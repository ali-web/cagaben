The same happened to Thomas Charles \"Charlie\" Linville when he was\nMarine in Iraq in 2011.Now Jukes, a former Army reserve staff sergeant, and\nLinville want to defy their disabilities in the most extreme way — by climbing\nthe highest mountain in the world within the next two months.  They could be\nthe first combat amputees to reach that summit.\"There is a pressure to show\nthe world that I can climb Mount Everest,\" said Jukes, 31, who, like Linville,\nhas become a skilled mountain climber using a prosthesis. \"To say, 'I have one\nleg, but I can climb Mount Everest. I have PTSD, but can climb Mount Everest.\nI have a traumatic brain injury, But I can climb Mount Everest.'\"Linville, 30,\nwho is married and the father of two daughters, said he went from being a\nstrong Marine to having people have pity for him after the amputation.\"Getting\nto the top I kind of view as vanquishing those demons, showing all these\npeople that, 'Don't you have pity for disabled veterans because we're capable\nof so much more than you think,\" Linville said.The Heroes Project founder, Tim\nMedvetz, and Charlie Linville looking at Mount Everest in 2014. (Photo: The\nHeroes Project)The men are part of two separate teams climbing for two\ndifferent veterans support organizations. Both climbing parties are taking the\nless-traveled northern route to the summit out of Tibet and will likely come\nin contact with each other. That route has a soaring final approach to the top\nthat keeps climbers in the so-called death zone more than 26,000 feet high for\nup to 24 hours or longer — a region where the human body can no longer\nacclimate and begins to decline.It will be Linville's third attempt to climb\nthe 29,029-foot mountain with a veterans organization called The Heroes\nProject. The former Marine attempted in 2014, but climbers were pulled off the\nmountain after an avalanche killed 16 Nepalese guides. Linville tried again\nlast year, but the season was canceled after an earthquake struck Nepal,\nkilling 8,000.The Heroes Project founder, Tim Medvetz, and Charlie Linville\nbegin their trek to Mount Everest base camp in 2014. (Photo: The Heroes\nProject)In January 2011, Linville was a member of Marine bomb disposal unit\nworking in Afghanistan when he stepped on a buried explosive. After a series\nof surgeries to deal with his damaged right leg, the limb was amputated below\nhis knee in 2013.He and Jukes don't know each other, though they wish each\nother well. But the circumstance of two separate efforts to put the first\ncombat amputee at the top of Everest has raised criticisms. . Tim Medvetz, who\nfounded The Heroes Project in 2009 to help combat amputees by working with\nthem to climb difficult mountains, says the group sponsoring Jukes's climb,\nU.S. Expeditions \u0026amp; Explorations (USX), is trying to \"steal Charlie's\nthunder.\"The co-founder of USX, Army 2nd Lt. Harold Earls, who said he came up\nwith the idea independent of The Heroes Project efforts to climb Everest,\ndenies this and says he hopes to link up with Medvetz and Linville during the\nclimb.\"There's no point in having a group of veterans not working together,\"\nEarls said, 23, from Cummings, Ga. He said the key focus of the USX effort is\nto raise awareness of post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide in the\nArmy.Nearly 270 active-duty service members killed themselves last year,\ncontinuing a trend of unusually high suicide rates that have plagued the U.S.\nmilitary for at least seven years, the Pentagon reported Friday.The USX\nclimbing party includes Earls and Army 1st Lt. Elyse Ping Medvigy. If they\nreach the top, they would be the first active-duty Army soldiers to climb\nEverest.  \"Since I was a little girl I've always wanted to climb the Himalayas\n— that's kind of the epitome of climbing,\"  said Ping Medvigy, 26, of\nSebastopol, Calif., a veteran mountaineer who served nine months in\nAfghanistan as an artillery officer.First Lieutenant Elyse Ping Medvigy ice\nclimbing on an overhang on Mount Lincoln in Colorado in May 2015. (Photo:\nZachary Rossow)USX's goal is similar to The Heroes Project. USX works to\nassemble small teams of veterans and active-duty servicemembers to participate\nin adventure expeditions to foster teamwork and form lasting bonds that often\nflow from combat experiences, Earls said. The group has raised $178,000 toward\nthe Everest climb.Earls, Jukes and Ping Medvigy will make the ascent with a\nguide, three sherpas and climber/filmmaker David Ohlson, who will shoot a\ndocumentary. The expedition begins Thursday and the team hopes to reach the\nsummit the week before Memorial Day.Mevetz has climbed Everest twice, reaching\nthe summit in 2007. His organization has led combat amputee to climb the\nhighest summits on all seven continents with the exception of Everest in\nEurope.First Lieutenant Elyse Ping Medvigy calculating round corrections as\nthe Fire Support Officer during the first M777A2 artillery shoot from Kandahar\nAirfield, Afghanistan in August 2014. (Photo: Handout)More than 4,000 people\nhave climbed the mountain and hundreds have died trying. About two-thirds of\nthe attempts are made from the Nepalese south side. The north face is\nconsidered more treacherous.Ping Medvigy, who will be promoted to captain\nwhile on Everest, says she has a passion for climbing and has conquered\nKilimanjaro plus the tallest peak in South America, the 22,841-foot Aconcagua\nin Argentina.\"When it comes to high altitude, its kind of the purity of the\nsport. It's just you and the mountain,\" she said.The highest peak Earls has\nclimbed is Mount Rainier in Washington state at 14,416 feet.Jukes  is rated\n80% disabled by the Department of Veterans Affairs. In December 2006, he was a\ntruck commander on the lead vehicle of a convoy in Iraq when twin anti-tank\nmines detonated. The blast didn't rupture the under-carriage of his truck, but\nthe concussion shattered his right heel and broke his right femur.Following an\noperation to repair his foot, Jukes was infected with the super-bug bacteria\nMRSA that went undiagnosed. By the time a civilian doctor identified it after\nJukes was back home in Colorado to recover, much of the heel bone had been\ndestroyed.Captain Matt Hickey, USX CEO (at far right), led the climbing team\nin their training expedition at Mount Rainier.

He\nfound that with a proper prosthesis, he could continue mountain climbing, a\nsport he pursued since childhood.First Lieutenant Elyse Ping Medvigy looking\nat Aconcagua on the approach hike to the mountain, in Argentina (the Andes),\nDecember 2011. (Photo: Handout)Jukes said a big concern on Everest will be the\nrisk of frostbite to his stump, where there is reduced blood flow. This could\ncomplicate his dream to reach the summit, he said.\"The most important thing\nfor me,\" Jukes said, \"is coming home with the same number of limbs that I left\nwith.

But a furious shadow campaign\nis under way in several pockets of the country to influence who nabs these\nspots.This weekend, North Dakota Republicans will meet in a convention to\nselect 25 convention delegates who, in addition to the three state officials\nwith already reserved delegate spots, can all be unbound in Cleveland. State\nGOP Executive Director Roz Leighton said presidential campaigns have been\nrecruiting people in the state to run for delegate spots so they can count on\nhaving supporters in the delegation at the convention.Pennsylvania will have\n17 bound delegates selected in the state's April 26 Republican primary, but 54\nKeystone State delegates will be unbound — though many may express which\ncandidate they plan to support. Colorado selects delegates the first week of\nApril who can choose whether to declare a preference. Any delegate doing so\nbefore being selected will be bound to that choice for the first ballot at the\nconvention. Colorado GOP spokesman Kyle Kohli said it is likely the state's\n37-member delegation \"will be mixed, but it's possible it could be almost\ncompletely bound or completely unbound.\" Guam has nine unbound\ndelegates.Delegates cheer presidential nominee John McCain at the 2008\nRepublican National Convention in Minneapolis, Minn. (Photo: Andrew West, The\nFort Myers News Press)Nowhere is the fight for these coveted delegates more\nintense than the Virgin Islands.A Michigan political consultant, John Yob,\nmoved to the islands last year and campaigned heavily to become an uncommitted\ndelegate. His work paid off: He emerged as the top vote-getter among the 300\nor so Republicans who participated in the islands' March 10 caucus. Despite a\nbig contingent of other delegate candidates who were committed to presidential\ncontenders, Yob and the five other unbound delegates prevailed, including his\nwife, Erica.Yob, who worked on Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul's unsuccessful\npresidential campaign and the White House bids of John McCain and Rick\nSantorum, has a bit of an inside track on delegate-selection process. He\nactually wrote a book on it, _Chaos: The Outsider's Guide to a Contested\nRepublican National Convention_, published in February. In it, he singled out\nthe unique role U.S. territories could play as \"free agents\" in a brokered\nconvention.Yob told USA TODAY he has been visiting the Virgin Islands since\n2009 and had no ulterior motives in relocating to the territory last year. \"I\nstarted making offers on houses in 2011,\" he said. \"I was not thinking about\nthe 2016 national convention in 2011.\"His father, a veteran Michigan political\nstrategist Chuck Yob, supports Ohio Gov. John Kasich's presidential bid, but\nthe younger Yob insists that he has no preference. He called Texas Sen. Ted\nCruz a \"solid candidate\" and praised Trump's ability to \"bringing in new\npeople\" to the party.Yob said he's already heard from all the presidential\ncampaigns since the March 10 election but declined to discuss the details of\nhis conversations.His eligibility and residency are being challenged in court.\nThe chairman of the local party, John Canegata, has moved to disqualify Yob\nand the other unbound delegates, citing a party rule that requires delegates\nto accept their positions in writing. He's replaced them with six alternates,\nfour of whom are pledged to support Trump, Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco\nRubio.The fight over whether to seat Yob and the other unbound delegates could\ndrag on for months. But the battle has underscored how much clout a territory\nwith roughly 105,000 residents and only a few thousand registered Republicans,\ncould have in this year's wildly unpredictable GOP contest.Holland Redfield,\nthe GOP's national committeeman from the territory, automatically gets a slot\nas an unbound delegate to the convention.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e3d"},"content":"It’s a standard for everyone: You report your income when you file taxes. And\nfor Uncle Sam, money is money, whether it’s wages or interest from bank\naccounts.That interest could be a few bucks if your savings account is with a\nbig bank, where interest rates tend to be near 0.06%, or more with a high-\nyield savings account, where rates can reach 1% or above.Whatever the case,\nreporting that interest is required, and it will take you only an extra step\nor two. Here’s what to know.**What bank interest is taxable?**Any interest you\nreceive from a bank account is taxable income, whether it's a checking or\nsavings account or a certificate of deposit. And it’s taxed at the same rate\nas your wages.But do you have to report interest if it’s just\npennies?“Technically, yes, even if it’s a few pennies,” says Carrie Houchins-\nWitt, a certified tax professional in Coralville, Iowa.“However, the IRS does\nallow you to round to whole numbers, so if it’s less than 50 cents, you could\nnot claim it and still be following the rules,” she adds.**What about other\ninterest?**Outside of basic bank accounts, you might get money from sources\nsuch as savings bonds or investment accounts, including retirement plans.\nAlthough they count as taxable income, too, these are handled differently, and\nyou may need a tax professional to help you.**Getting the paperwork:\n1099-INTs**It‘s important to report checking or savings interest on your tax\nreturn, especially if you receive a 1099-INT form from your bank. The 1099-INT\nis a short document that shows the interest you received from a financial\ninstitution during the previous year. Credit unions call bank interest\n“dividends,” but they still count as interest on a 1099-INT.Banks are required\nto send a 1099-INT only to account holders who received $10 or more in\ninterest. If you got less than that, you may not get the form. In that case,\nyou can find the amount of interest you received on bank statements from last\nyear.**Where do I report it?**On your federal tax return, you insert the total\ninterest earned last year in one of three places:orYou fill out only one of\nthese. If you earn more than $1,500 in interest, you must use Form 1040 and\ncomplete another form called Schedule B. It’s a form for listing all banks or\ncompanies that paid you interest last year, and you’ll send it in with Form\n1040.The IRS will get a copy of the 1099-INT from your bank, so there’s no\nneed to include that with your tax return.**What happens if I forget to report\ninterest?**“If a 1099-INT has been issued, the IRS knows that,” Houchins-Witt\nsays. “They’ll do computer matching on tax returns.”And you might get hit with\na small late-payment penalty for failing to claim interest income. If the IRS\nsends a notice, you typically have to pay a penalty of 0.5% of the tax owed.\nThis charge is per month after the tax deadline — April 18 this year — and it\nincludes the last half of April and the part of the month that the IRS sends\nyou a letter.So if you owe $100 in taxes on undeclared interest income and\nreceive a notice on June 15, you’re looking at a fee of $1.50 for April, May\nand June. Ignoring further attempts from the IRS to collect can lead to an\nincreased penalty of 1% of the tax owed per month. And if you keep avoiding\nit, the penalty can reach 25% per month — plus the actual tax you haven't\npaid. Other penalties can also apply, depending on your circumstances.But you\ndon't have to wait for the IRS to act if you forget to include interest as\ntaxable income. Simply send in an amended tax return.**Report, no matter\nwhat**Reporting all income, no matter how small, is the rule.**MORE: **Find\nthe Highest Bank Interest Rates**MORE: **Prepare and File Your Taxes\nOnline**MORE: **The Fastest Way to Get Your Tax Refund_Spencer Tierney is a\nstaff writer at NerdWallet, a personal finance website.

Since then, mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh —\nofficially part of Azerbaijan — has been under the control of local ethnic\nArmenian forces and the Armenian military.Armenian forces also occupy several\nareas outside Nagorno-Karabakh proper. The sides are separated by a\ndemilitarized buffer zone, but small clashes have broken out frequently.Each\nside blamed the other for Saturday’s escalation.In a statement, Azerbaijan’s\nDefense Ministry said 12 of its soldiers “became shahids” — Muslim martyrs —\nand said one of its helicopters was shot down.The statement also claimed that\nmore than 100 Armenian forces were killed or wounded and that six tanks and 15\nartillery positions were destroyed.Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan told his\nnational security council that 18 Armenian soldiers were killed and 35\nwounded.Armenia earlier claimed to have inflicted heavy damage on Azerbaijani\nforces, but did not immediately give figures. A statement from the Nagorno-\nKarabakh defense ministry claimed more than 200 Azerbaijani soldiers were\nkilled, but there was no corroboration for that figure.“This is the most wide-\nscale military action that Azerbaijan has tried to carry out since the\nestablishment of the 1994 cease-fire regime,” Sargsyan said.Remains of a\ndowned Azerbaijani forces helicopter lies in a field in the separatist\nNagorno-Karabakh region, on Saturday, April 2, 2016.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e41"},"content":"HOUSTON — Roy Williams will tell you it’s all the same, he’s just coaching\nbasketball, doggone it, like he always has.But then he’ll do things like\ncrouch down after a made three — the most important basket of North Carolina’s\n83-66 national semifinal win against Syracuse on Saturday — and holler as loud\nas he can, imploring with urgency his players say they rarely see for them to\nrun back on defense.There’s something different about Williams in the final\ndays of his 28th season, and the more anybody notices it the more easy it is\nto notice. Williams doesn’t want to be the story but doesn’t want to stop\nrefuting that he’s the story.His team proved to be just as determined to\ncounter anything it got from Syracuse, a 10-seed that had gritted its way into\nthe Final Four with late-game comebacks. Sure enough the Orange closed a\n17-point gap to get within 57-50 at the 9:49 mark of the second half thanks to\na Malachi Richardson three-pointer.Then sophomore point guard Joel Berry came\nup with the most critical of his 10 assists, finding senior guard Marcus Paige\nopen for three. The Tar Heels hadn’t hit from deep in the game, missing badly\non many attempts. Paige changed that, and Williams started shouting.“You could\nsee him over there, getting in his little stance, saying ‘C’mon get a stop’\nbecause he knows the chance we have to get the momentum back,” Paige said. Of\nhis coach’s renewed intensity, he said, “I definitely feel it.”Senior forward\nBrice Johnson (16 points) followed that with a dunk and, after another\nSyracuse three, Theo Pinson hit from deep. The Tar Heels had emerged unbowed,\nheaded to their 10th title game. They play Villanova, a staggering 95-51\nwinner against Oklahoma, Monday night.That he feels under siege here is not\nsomething Williams has tried to hide. Saturday he told reporters not to ask\nany “stupid” questions about retirement, but also mentioned how difficult it\nhad been for him to deal with the deaths of friends (the ESPN broadcaster\nStuart Scott)  and mentors (legendary North Carolina coach Dean Smith) over\nthe past year and a half. He mentioned not reading many articles this year but\nalso said he’d never been criticized and second-guessed so frequently by\nannouncers and writers in his career.Williams is heading to his fourth\nnational title game, and first since winning his second championship with the\nTar Heels in 2009. His health and whether it could force him to retire has\nbeen a major story line here, though he says he’s fine. His knees clearly\nbother him, but he can, he showed Saturday, still move quickly when he needs\nto.The win also comes as North Carolina braces for the final notice of\nallegations from the NCAA in an academic scandal that has hovered over the\nschool for years. Though none of the current players were enrolled during the\nperiod when the fraud occurred they have spent their careers answering\nquestions about it — and worrying that they’d be punished for it.Now they’re\ntrying to become just the fifth team in NCAA history to be ranked No. 1 in the\nAssociated Press’ preseason poll, win their conference regular season and\ntournament titles and the national championship. The first team to do so?\nNorth Carolina’s 1982 squad led by Michael Jordan and James Worthy.This Tar\nHeels team doesn’t have transcendent superstars. It is built around experience\nand depth — especially in the frontcourt — and both were important in the\nfirst half.The Tar Heels couldn’t find their shot, missing 10 three-pointers,\nand had trouble infiltrating Syracuse’s vaunted 2-3 zone. It wasn’t until\nJohnson — usually the pivot to North Carolina’s attack — was on the bench that\nhis teammates responded.They took only one three after the nine-minute mark,\nand managed to build a 39-28 halftime lead with 26 points in the paint. Berry\ncreated driving lanes and fed big men Kennedy Meeks, Isaiah Hicks and even\nJoel James (who had 4 points but averaged 2.2 per game this year). Johnson sat\nwith two fouls but his team still went on a 23-12 run.“Brice is a key player\nbut he’s not the main guy, you know what I’m saying?” James said, holding a\nhand in the air. “It’s a five-person sport. It’s not just a one-person sport.\nIt shows the character of our team that we can adapt without Brice on the\ncourt.”It helped that Syracuse started taking bad shots. The Orange surely\nwanted to slow the game down, but as soon as North Carolina clamped down on\ndefense — both teams were sloppy in that area early — Syracuse started\nrushing.“I think the biggest change was defensively,” Paige said. “When\n(Brice) went out, we went small for a stretch and really upped our defensive\nintensity and got a bunch of stops.”Whether the Tar Heels can cause Villanova\n— which shot 71.4% from the floor — similar troubles is less certain. Tar\nHeels players said they didn’t watch much of the Wildcats' convincing win, and\nWilliams wouldn’t talk about the next game, saying he needed to savor beating\nSyracuse first.He expects to have a scouting report in his hand early Sunday\nmorning, and then he’ll tailor a practice plan based on what it says. Same as\nalways, nothing different, just another game.“We’ve got one more,” sophomore\nswingman Justin Jackson said when asked about Williams’ message to the team\nafter the game. “That’s all he said.”\n\n","title":"North Carolina responds to coach Roy Williams' intensity","twitter":{"body":"RT @USATODAYsports: North Carolina responds to coach Roy Williams' intensity: https://t.co/EMDFEA8QTu","date":"Sun Apr 03 06:19:04 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716510310476201984"},"retweets":10},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1SKomIE"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e46"},"content":"Villanova is coming off arguably the greatest performance in NCAA tournament\nhistory and has been dominant throughout its run through the bracket.\nMeanwhile, North Carolina struggled to put 10th-seeded Syracuse completely\naway until the final minutes. Based on Saturday’s game alone, the Wildcats\nshould be the overwhelming favorite, right? Not so fast. The matchup actually\nfavors the Tar Heels, and here’s five reasons why they’ll cut down the nets on\nMonday night.Villanova has given teams fits with their four-guard lineup. They\ncan switch on all screens on the perimeter without having to worry about\nfalling into mismatches. That’s the hallmark of a great perimeter defense and\na big reason why the Wildcats have strolled through the tournament. Modern\ncollege basketball teams are built around perimeter offense. Well, most modern\ncollege basketball teams are, but not North Carolina. The Heels are the most\ndominant low post team we’ve seen at this level in some time. Despite shooting\n23.5% from 3 against Syracuse in the semifinal, Carolina still produce an\nefficient 1.23 points-per-possession thanks to their inside trio of Brice\nJohnson, Kennedy Meeks and Isaiah Hicks.Villanova’s Ochefu is capable of\nbanging with Carolina’s bigs, but who’s going to help him? If he’s forced to\ncontest a lot of shots at the rim, the Heels big men should feast on the\noffensive glass as Ochefu will be left out of position for the rebound. The\nWildcats’ interior defense has been great all season, but they haven’t been\ngreat on the defensive glass, ranking outside the top-100 in defensive\nrebounding percentage. They gave up 19 offensive boards to the Sooners in the\nsemifinals. That will be an issue against the Heels, who rank third in\noffensive rebounding percentage. Even if the shots aren’t falling for\nCarolina, there will be plenty of second chance opportunities.They can’t keep\nthis up, right? The Wildcats are shooting 48.9% from 3-point range in the\ntournament after knocking down 11 of their 17 attempts against Oklahoma. A\ncold shooting could be on the way, and this team isn’t necessarily built to\novercome that. Villanova doesn’t get to the line a whole lot (243rd in free\nthrow rate) or grab a whole lot of offensive rebounds (209th in offensive\nrebound percentage).North Carolina plays two point guards — Marcus Paige and\nJoel Berry II — and it shows in the statistics. The Tar Heels turn the ball\nover on only 15.3% of their possessions, the 18th best mark in the country.\nVillanova has given its last two opponents fits with its pressure, forcing\nKansas and Oklahoma into a combined 33 turnovers and scoring a bunch of easy\npoints off of them. Paige and Berry should be able to break the press and get\ntheir big men easy looks on the break. Speaking of which…Trying to speed up\nNorth Carolina’s offense may not be the best strategy for Villanova, but it\ncan’t really deviate from the strategy it’s used all season. The Wildcats play\nat a relatively slow pace, averaging about 66 possessions a game, which ranks\n284th in the nation. But that number is based mostly on how methodical they\nare on the offensive end. Villanova’s defense likes to force opponents to play\nfast. Their average defensive possession last about 17 second, per kenpom.com,\nwhich is quicker than the national average. If Jay Wright wants to try to\nspeed things up on the defensive end, Roy Williams will be happy to oblige.\nAnd if this game turns into a track meet, Carolina might put up 100 points.\n\n","title":"5 reasons why North Carolina will beat Villanova in the national title game | For The Win","twitter":{"body":"5 reasons North Carolina will beat Villanova https://t.co/EjXFkZnYzX","date":"Sun Apr 03 04:10:36 +0000 2016","favs":49,"id":{"$numberLong":"716477978557829121"},"retweets":33},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1Y7BjxO"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e47"},"content":"HOUSTON — The game’s final minute ticked away quickly and slowly at the same\ntime.A stoic Jay Wright stood at the far corner of the court and glanced down\nat his bench, letting his gaze fall on his starters, who’d been pulled a few\nminutes earlier.Ryan Arcidiacono and Josh Hart looked at each other, ecstatic\nbut also puzzled.“We didn’t believe it, either,” Hart said later.No one could\nhave predicted a 95-51 final score, the most lopsided game in Final Four\nhistory. No one thought this Villanova team could play nearly perfect in its\nbiggest game of the season to date.But the Wildcats did, and an even bigger\ngame now awaits: Monday’s national championship game against North Carolina.If\nthey can play like they did against Oklahoma on Saturday, they might be\nunbeatable.Villanova shot 71.4% from the field, the second-best shooting\nperformance of any team in Final Four history; the best, of course, was\nVillanova against Georgetown in the 1985 title game, a performance many\nconsider the Perfect Game.The Wildcats also shot 61.1% from beyond the arc to\nboot. And while both those offensive numbers are staggering, it was the\nVillanova defense that both set the tone for the game and secured the victory.\nThe Wildcats picked pockets, stealing the ball 12 times from the Sooners, who\nultimately turned the ball over 17 times — which led to 31 Wildcat points.\nVillanova outscored Oklahoma in the paint, on the break and off the bench.“It\nwas a phenomenal game on both ends of the floor,” Villanova assistant coach\nAshley Howard told USA TODAY Sports. “We always say when we have games where\nwe get stops and shoot the ball well, we can have games like this. It was\nalmost a perfect storm for us.”Asked when he knew Villanova’s game plan\nentering Saturday’s contest would work, Howard smiled.“When the horn went\noff,” he said, laughing. “(But really,) once we got it up to 25 in the second\nhalf, and I saw that our guys were still really dialed in.”Wright said he felt\ngood at halftime, and felt that his players were focused. At that point, too,\nhe felt confident in the way they had switched and helped on Buddy Hield,\nOklahoma’s star shooter and one of the best players in the country. He’d only\nscored seven points and shot 3-for-8 from the field in the first half.“I\ndidn't think it was ours at that point, but I felt good that what we decided\nto do was working,” Wright said. “I told the team at halftime, ‘All right,\nthey're going to come back and make a run,’ which they did at the start of the\nsecond half. About three minutes to go (in the game), (associate head coach)\nBaker Dunleavy said, ‘Do you want to put the walk-ons in?’ I said no.“I wasn't\neven sure at that point to be honest. When you're in it, you're not thinking\nclearly about that, about the game being over. You're thinking about next\nplay, substitutions. Probably everyone else knew (the game was over) earlier\nthan I did.”Hield finished with nine points, his second-lowest output of the\nseason. Only one Oklahoma player — Jordan Woodard — reached double-digits; he\nhad 12 points. The Sooners shot 31.7% as a team, 15 percentage points lower\nthan their season average.The night, quite simply, belonged to ‘Nova.“It was\njust one of those games that could happen to anybody,” Wright said. “I feel\nbad for Oklahoma that it happened to them in the Final Four. But I'm happy we\nhad one of those games where we just make every shot. We had end-of-shot-clock\nshots we just threw up and went in. …“We'll try to continue to be dialed in\nand try to get one more on Monday night.”\n\n","title":"This night belonged to nearly perfect Villanova; one more night to go","twitter":{"body":"RT @NicoleAuerbach: \"We didn't believe it either.\" On Villanova's nearly perfect night: https://t.co/R6wjtxYdEM","date":"Sun Apr 03 04:07:10 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716477114418118656"},"retweets":12},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MKMfkl"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e49"},"content":"_“It’s scary to think I may have CTE.” — Detroit Lions linebacker DeAndre\nLevy_Imagine the impact on the NFL, and the sports community at large, when\nthe day comes that there’s a definitive test to diagnose chronic traumatic\nencephalopathy (CTE) in the living.Players such as Levy might not have to\nguess whether repetitive head trauma thought to be a root cause of CTE has\nleft them with a brain illness that could affect them for the rest of their\nlives.A CTE test might provide the answers — hopefully in step with treatment\nthat makes a difference.That day can’t get here soon enough.“The science will\nconnect the dots at some point,” former NFL defensive end Marvin Washington\ntold USA TODAY Sports during the weekend. “It will change football.”At the\nmoment, CTE is only definitively confirmed in subjects posthumously, by\nexamining brain tissue that reveals abnormal levels of tau protein.Chris\nNowinski, co-founder of the Concussion Legacy Foundation, said experts had\nexpressed optimism that a CTE test for the living would be developed within\nfive years.In addition to determining what percentage of football players, and\nothers in activities considered to be at risk, have signs revealing the\nexistence of CTE, Nowinski wonders about the medical recommendations that\nwould stem from such a diagnosis.“I would hope it would be to stop playing,\nwith aggressive treatment that would hopefully slow the progress of the\ndisease,” said Nowinski, whose front-line work includes securing brains of the\ndeceased for study as his group partners with Boston University and the\nVeteran’s Administration.“But can you really stop a 22- or 23-year-old from\nplaying?”Washington, who played for 11 NFL seasons, is involved with a\ncompany, Kannalife Sciences Inc., that is conducting clinical trials using\ncannabidiol as an agent to treat traumatic brain injuries. He can see the day\nwhen a CTE test, perhaps with grades that identify stages that underscore\nrisk, is a standard component in evaluating players.“At the combine, a guy who\nhas had three or four concussions might be like a guy who had two ACL (tears)\nin college,” Washington surmised. “That hurts his stock. Maybe it will get to\nthe point where they can determine if someone is one or two hits away from\npermanent damage.”That’s a sobering thought, for sure, but imagine the risk\nmanagement. With intense research efforts to develop a test that on the\nlandscape of the concussion crisis would be like finding the Holy Grail, the\nculture shift in football is undoubtedly still in the early stages.“It’s great\nto see the rules changes to make the game safer,” Nowinski said. “The one\nthing that’s missing now is an honest discussion about the risks. If you’re a\nfootball player, I’d have to imagine that you’re confused by what you hear\ncoming from the NFL.”In his thoughtful, 1,000-word letter to the _Detroit Free\nPress_ this week, — a follow-up to his rebuke on Instagram of Indianapolis\nColts owner Jim Irsay, who poorly compared the risks of football to reactions\ndifferent people can experience when taking aspirin — Levy maintained that he\nmight already have CTE.Levy wrote, not surprisingly, that it’s a sentiment\nshared with several of his NFL peers as awareness increases of long-term risks\nfrom head injuries. And there are many more retired players expressing a\nsimilar theme.Levy’s hunch, he wrote, is fueled by symptoms. Headaches. Memory\nloss. Cognitive disorders. Mood swings. The symptoms don’t necessarily add up\nto CTE, but clearly there are issues.Add that to the cases of CTE confirmed in\nthe bodies of younger people — Junior Seau was 43, Tyler Sash 27 and Chris\nHenry 26, and there were former high school players diagnosed at 17 and 18 —\nthe evolving research has shown that the brain disease isn’t developed only in\nolder subjects, decades after they finished their playing careers.It’s no\nwonder Levy calls his situation scary.He said his fear wasn’t to the point\nwhere he would walk away from football as Kansas City Chiefs safety Husain\nAbdullah did this week, retiring after seven seasons, citing concern of long-\nterm effects on his health. Levy accepts the risks of football.Yet if there\nwere more definitive answers with a CTE test for the living, I wonder if that\nwould be the swing factor on the other side of risk.“Would it get to a point\nwhere players would sign a waiver and absolve the NFL of any damages?”\npondered Washington, who retired after the 1999 season and said he had not\nexperienced any alarming health issues. “I just don’t see too many guys\nputting their long-term health on the line, if they have the information.”What\nbetter information than a test to confirm CTE in the living.\n\n","title":"What it would mean for the NFL to be able to diagnose CTE in the living","twitter":{"body":"What it would mean for the NFL to be able to diagnose CTE in the living https://t.co/3CdOr3tBkq","date":"Sun Apr 03 03:35:04 +0000 2016","favs":37,"id":{"$numberLong":"716469035718811648"},"retweets":24},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MKshpI"}

Which means Kris Jenkins and Nate Britt — who are\nbrothers, legally — could face off with a national title at stake.“I try not\nto get sidetracked because we’ve got to take care of the game that’s at hand,”\nVillanova forward Jenkins said. “But it would be pretty cool to play against\nhim on down the line. … It would mean a lot, man.

It’s near and dear to my heart.”Jenkins spends every holiday with the\nBritts; both young men refer to each other as brothers. The Britt parents\nsplit time between traveling to see Jenkins at Villanova and the younger Britt\nat North Carolina. Britt Sr. estimated he’s seen 11 or 12 games apiece in\nperson this year.One potential game would dwarf all the others — a national\nchampionship matchup between both of his sons.

The company has not\nsaid when commercial flights might begin or how much a ticket will cost.The\ncompany is also developing a larger orbital rocket that it plans to build at\nKennedy Space Center and launch from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station,\npossibly late this decade.Blue Origin first launched and landed the New\nShepard in November at the company’s private range in Texas, in what was then\nconsidered an impressive and historic feat — the first landing under its own\npower by a vertically launched booster that delivered a payload in\nspace.SpaceX followed a month later with a successful landing by a larger\nbooster at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.Blue Origin’s New Shepard launched\nin November. The rocket successful re-launched and landed in Texas on Jan. 22.\n(Photo: Blue Origin)In January, Blue Origin flew and recovered the same rocket\na second time, with Bezos saying the New Shepard required minimal\nrefurbishment after the first flight.“Launch. Land. Repeat,” he said\nthen.Bezos sees resuability as essential to achieving his ambitious vision to\nlower the cost of human spaceflight and make space accessible to millions of\npeople.SpaceX does not plan to fly the booster it recovered in December a\nsecond time, but expects to land more that can be reused.SpaceX’s next\nopportunity will come Friday, when it is scheduled to launch an International\nSpace Station cargo mission from Cape Canaveral. The company will try to land\nthe first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket on a ship in the Atlantic\nOcean.Saturday’s Blue Origin launch carried two experiments aboard the capsule\nto take advantage of the flight’s few minutes in microgravity, one built by\nstudents at the University of Central Florida.The UCF experiment, selected by\nBlue Origin in 2009, gently pushed a marble into a bed of dust and filmed the\ninteraction. The goal was to better understand collisions in the early solar\nsystem, and between particles such as those in Saturn’s rings or on the\nsurfaces of asteroids.\"We have been waiting for this day for a long time,\"\nsaid UCF physics professor Josh Colwell, who was at the launch site and\nexchanged high-fives with colleagues afterward. \"A lot of talented students\nhave helped make this happen.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e4d"},"content":"HOUSTON — When you’re as good as North Carolina, you don’t need to make many\nthree-pointers to beat a zone defense. For the Tar Heels in Saturday’s\nnational semifinals, the exact number was two.Though timely threes by Marcus\nPaige and Theo Pinson on consecutive possessions inside the 10-minute mark\nstalled any chance of a Syracuse comeback, North Carolina is headed to an NCAA\nchampionship game clash with Villanova because of its shifty point guard who\ncan make magic in tight quarters its bevy of tall people who can hit\n15-footers and a defense that might be its best ever under Roy Williams.And\nnow, after beating surprising No. 10 seed Syracuse 83-66 at NRG Stadium,\nWilliams will have a chance Monday to win his third national title and the\nschool’s sixth overall.Though they missed their first 13 from three-point\nrange, the Tar Heels only seemed like they might be in trouble for a brief\nmoment in the second half. Their 16-point lead had been cut to 57-50 with a\nlittle less than 10 minutes remaining after a five-point burst by freshman\nMalachi Richardson, bringing back memories of Syracuse’s shocking comebacks\nover Gonzaga and Virginia to reach the Final Four.But when they needed it\nmost, the Tar Heels started hitting, quickly pushing the lead back to 65-53.\nThat complemented a performance in which North Carolina scored 50 points in\nthe paint, shot 54% overall and outscored the Orange 12-4 on the fast\nbreak.\"They always have an inside presence regardless of who it is at all\ntimes with their teams and when they’re knocking down the three, as well, it’s\nkind of unguardable at the college level,\" Syracuse leading scorer Michael\nGbinije said.In the end, this was the Tar Heels’ most commanding victory over\nSyracuse, which took them to the wire twice during the Atlantic Coast\nConference season. And it sets up what should be a terrific final, as both\nteams appear to be at the peak of their powers. North Carolina has barely been\ntested on its way to the final, winning five games by an average of 16.2\npoints.It seemed like the game might be closer than that early as Syracuse got\nthe pace it wanted for the first 10 minutes.But whatever opportunity that\nshould have given the Orange never materialized as Gbinije struggled badly,\nthe shot selection deteriorated against North Carolina’s tough interior\ndefense and the Tar Heels eventually worked the ball into the middle for\neasier looks.Even with senior Brice Johnson on the bench for the final nine\nminutes of the half, North Carolina used a 9-0 run to create some separation\nand finally got the game going at a faster tempo. Though the Tar Heels went\n0-for-10 from the 3-point line in the first half, they made 17-for-25 inside\nthe arc and went to halftime with a 39-28 lead.Last week in Chicago, Boeheim\nsaid the Orange weren’t good enough to overcome a bad game by Gbinije, who\naverages 17.6 points. That looked prophetic, as Gbinije went 5-for-18 and\nSyracuse’s offense never got in a rhythm as a result.North Carolina was not\nbuilt to be reliant on one player and got a balanced effort with four players\nin double-figures, led by Johnson’s 16 points and nine rebounds.\n\n","title":"No. 1 seed North Carolina ends Syracuse's run 83-66","twitter":{"body":"RT @USATODAYsports: No. 1 seed North Carolina ends Syracuse's run: https://t.co/uk7G9a0SS8 #FinalFour https://t.co/y7IFPWJS0a","date":"Sun Apr 03 03:00:33 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716460349592104960"},"retweets":26},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1SK3cKU"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e4e"},"content":"BOSTON — While Uber and Lyft's safety policies face a myriad of scrutiny here,\nthe founder of a new ride-sharing service says his company fills an overlooked\ngap in the industry: a focus on women’s safety.Chariot for Women, based in\nMassachusetts, is an Uber-like service that only hires women drivers. The\nintent is to give female passengers peace of mind by ensuring another woman is\nalways behind the wheel.Founder Michael Pelletz, who was an Uber driver for\neight months, came up with the idea for this company after he picked up a male\npassenger who seemed like he was on the edge of a drug overdose.“One thought\nkept coming up in his head: ‘What if I was a woman?' ” the company’s website\nsays. “Just one bad apple behind the wheel and those women would not be safe\nat all. 3 a.m. in Boston is a candy store for predators.”Besides women\ndrivers, Chariot for Women, which is set to launch around the country April\n19, will only pick up female passengers or boys under the age of 13. **​**If a\nwoman orders the service and is with a male above the age of 13, Pelletz said,\nthe male would be denied a ride.Of the 20,000 Uber drivers in Massachusetts,\n7,000 are female, said Carlie Waibel, a spokeswoman for Uber. Across the U.S.,\n29% of drivers who joined in fall 2015 were women. About 60% of Lyft\npassengers are women, and 30% of drivers are female —the highest percentage in\nthe ride-sharing industry, said Alexandra LaManna, a Lyft spokeswoman.More\nthan 1,000 women have already signed up for Chariot for Women. Pelletz said\nhis company has the most “stringent background checks in the industry” and\nwill fingerprint every driver.Following a series of incidents involving\ndrivers and passengers, Boston has turned a stern eye to ride-sharing\nservices. A big point of contention has been Uber and Lyft's reluctance to\nfingerprint its drivers. A bill currently pending in the Massachusetts\nLegislature is looking to regulate both Uber and Lyft by intensifying company\nbackground check policies and placing limits on surge pricing.Although Chariot\nfor Women's background check policies are seemingly more strict than other\nride-sharing services, Joseph L. Sulman, an employment law specialist based\noutside of Boston, told the Boston Globe that refusing to hire men as a driver\ncould be a potential legal problem.According to the Massachusetts Attorney\nGeneral’s Office, the state's anti-discrimination laws prohibit discriminating\nagainst a potential employee on the basis of sex — except in situations where\nsex is a“bona fide occupational qualification,” which is a qualification\nemployers are allowed to consider when hiring employees.“The law is really\ntough on that,” Sulman told the Globe. “For gender, it’s not enough to say,\n‘We really just want to have a female here because our customers prefer that\nto feel safer.’”Pelletz said that according to his lawyers, his company is\nrunning a legal business model that fulfills a market need.\"We believe that\ngiving women and their loved ones peace of mind is not only a public policy\nimperative but serves an essential social interest,\" he said, reading a\ncompany statement. \"Our service is intented to protect these fundamental\nliberties and we look forward to ending the inequality of security that\ncurrently afflicts drivers and riders on the basis of gender.\"Cori Harris, 20,\na sophomore at Boston University, matches the  demographic Pelletz said could\nbenefit from using his service — a young, college-aged woman, who is likely to\nrequest a ride alone or with other girlfriends late at night.Harris said she\nfrequently uses ride-sharing services, and only once felt unsafe when her male\nUber driver suddenly became loud and aggressive. While this experience hasn't\ndeterred her from using Uber, she said it has made her more wary of the\npotential risks.\"Uber is definitely safer than walking home, but if there was\nanother service that was as convenient as Uber and offered the same service\nand I knew I would have a woman driver, I would definitely consider it,\" she\nsaid. \"Why not take that extra step to be safe — especially as a woman in\ncollege?\"__Follow USA Today reporter Trisha Thadani on Twitter:\n@TrishaThadani__\n\n","title":"Ex-Uber driver creates ride-sharing service for women","twitter":{"body":"Chariot for Women is about making ride-sharing even safer for women, founder Michael Pelletz says.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e53"},"content":"Since the iPhone SE announcement, I've fielded my fair share of questions\nabout the device from friends and family, all of whom find the phone's raison\nd'être a little hard to get their heads around.And who can blame them? The\nanswer I find myself falling back on is, \"The iPhone SE is more or less an\niPhone 6s in the body of an iPhone 5s.\" That's a lot of letters and numbers to\nswallow, with not a lot of difference between them.If you're still confused,\ndon't worry, I'll break it all down for you. And if you're already leaning\ntowards getting an iPhone SE instead of an **iPhone 6s**, allow me nudge you a\nlittle further in that direction.RelatedThe worst part of buying a new iPhone\nis holding your nose and forking over hundreds for a thing Apple will be\ntrying to convince you to replace in 10 months. A 64GB iPhone 6s lists for\n$749, and if you're inclined to spring for the huge **iPhone 6 Plus** or\n**iPhone 6s Plus**, the bill can quickly climb as high as four figures.Though\nit's still not exactly _cheap_ for a smartphone, the iPhone SE's pricing model\nlooks pretty good in comparison. Officially, it starts at $399 for the 16GB\nmodel, but I want you to completely forget that piece of information and\nrepeat after me: \"I will not buy a 16GB iPhone, because, in all likelihood, it\nwill significantly limit the shelf life of my iPhone.\"_Unofficially_ speaking,\nthe iPhone SE starts at just $499 for the (actually usable) 64GB model.\nUnfortunately, there's no step between 16GB and 64GB, nor is there an iPhone\nSE with more than 64GB of internal storage. Still, $499 is the most you'll pay\nfor the new iPhone SE, which currently makes it one of the cheapest ways to\nget an iOS handset.And if you're worried that the iPhone SE's modest price is\nindicative of compromised performance, I have some good news for you.That's\nright: Internally speaking, the iPhone SE is more or less the same phone as\nthe iPhone 6s. In terms of raw processing and photographic horsepower, it's\nright on par with the newest and best-performing iPhones to date.If you need a\nrefresher, here's a quick rundown of some of the iPhone 6s's most noteworthy\nfeatures, all of which have found their way into the SE's delightfully small\nframe:The iPhone SE is equipped with the same camera and camera software as\nthe iPhone 6s, which scored quite well in our lab tests. The inclusion of 4K\nvideo is almost absurd given the SE's size, but this capability will surely\nwin over the hearts and minds of 4K TV owners.This one's a big deal. In the 6s\nand 6s Plus, the A9 made mincemeat of our benchmark tests. And, as in the 6s,\nthe SE's A9 chipset is backed up by 2GB of RAM. It's not quite as juiced up as\nthe **Samsung Galaxy S7**, which is equipped with a ridiculous 4GB of RAM, but\nif the SE performs at anywhere near the 6s's level you won't notice the\ndifference.I won't lie: I'm going to need to be dragged kicking and screaming\ninto the Siri/Apple Pay era. But for a lot of people, these two features are\ndelivering on Apple's aim to simplify day-to-day life via the iOS\necosystem.Now that I've clarified which elements of the 6s have carried over,\nwhat if I told you that there were even some areas where the SE could\npotentially lap the 6s in terms of performance?We can't confirm this until we\ntest the iPhone SE ourselves, but early reports suggest that it can stretch\nits battery life further than the 6s. If true, that's great news for iOS users\nwho have long struggled with subpar battery life. Consider the **iPhone 6**, a\ndevice whose battery was significantly outclassed by all its competitors even\nwhen it was first released.So what's changed? The answer might be hiding in\nplain sight. The iPhone SE is a peculiar phone because of its 4-inch frame—a\ndesign that's out of place in an industry operating on a bigger-is-better\nphilosophy. But the SE's tiny size is our prime suspect when it comes to the\nSE's potentially game-changing battery life. With fewer pixels and less\ndisplay real estate to illuminate, the SE's battery doesn't have to do as much\nheavy lifting.But keep reading! Some folks (myself included) also see an\ninherent value in smaller phones that goes beyond an ostensibly longer battery\nlife. It doesn't matter whether you have small-, medium-, or large-sized\nhands: Sometimes you just want to be able to reach every corner of your\nphone's screen without letting go of the subway handle.The iPhone SE is _not_\na redesign of the iPhone 5s. Aside from a half-ounce or so of extra weight,\nthe SE is, in fact, the exact same device from a design standpoint. It'll sit\nsnugly in your palm and retreat back to your pocket with ease.Apple is betting\nthat enough people loved the 5s to justify double-dipping, and based on a\nquick poll of my friends who owned one I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it's\na smart move.But, after all of this—the cheaper cost, the better battery life,\nthe thumb-friendly size—perhaps you're still worried about missing out on some\nof the things Apple opted _not_ to carry over from the 6s. Let's take a minute\nto address those features.It's true that there are a few things the 6s has\nthat the SE doesn't. But let me soothe your fear of missing out with a little\ndose of perspective.Apple spent a lot of time and energy on 3D Touch, making\nit one of the key selling points for the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. But from the\nget-go it was clear that most of its potential was untapped. Turns out, not\nmuch has changed in the last six months. 3D Touch is still an impressive\nhardware feature, but there's little software to support it. On the iPhone SE,\nits most obvious use–activating Live Photos–can even be achieved with a long\npress on the screen. I don't think you'll notice the difference.Serious selfie\nshooters might cringe, but for most people, the iPhone SE's 1.2MP front camera\nis adequate for both Face Time sessions and quick self-portraits. Plus, the SE\nsports Apple's new Retina Flash, which helps make up for the resolution loss\nin low-light settings.Okay, I'll admit it, this one stings a bit.

And together, this\nVillanova team is championship-caliber.After a frantic start to the game that\nsaw 11 lead changes, the Wildcats began pulling away, starting with their\nstifling defense. They beat the Sooners 95-51 — the most lopsided Final Four\nresult ever —  and will play for the program’s second national title on Monday\nnight. Villanova will face the winner of North Carolina-Syracuse.The margin\ntopped 34-point Final Four wins by Cincinnati against Oregon State in 1962 and\nMichigan State against Penn in 1979.“That was just one of those nights,”\nVillanova coach Jay Wright said. “I feel bad for Oklahoma.”It became clear\nquickly that Saturday’s semifinal would belong to Villanova. Hield opened the\ngame with a three-pointer, but then didn’t score for the next 15 minutes. On\nrims not known for being the friendliest to shooters, Villanova’s got all the\nright bounces. Threes fell; the Wildcats owned the paint. They picked Sooners’\npockets.In short, they turned in the most dominant performance of the season\nwith the brightest of lights and the biggest of expectations. Josh Hart led\nall scorers with 23 points, and five players scored in double figures.The\nWildcats shot 71.4% from the field, 61.1% from three-point range.\"Obviously we\nlove when we can hit shots,\" said Hart, a 6-5 junior. \"But this program is\nreally built on just dialing in defensively, being tough.\"I think there was\none play in the first half when (Isaiah) Cousins hit a banked three. That's\nwhen attitude comes into play. Not being rattled, just when things like that\nhappen, look at your brother in the eye and say, Attitude, continue to be\nlocked in.\"Villanova put on a clinic in the first half, taking a 14-point lead\ninto the locker room after shooting 67% from the field and 55% from beyond the\narc. Equally as impressive as the Wildcats scoring 1.45 points per possession\nwas their defense.They forced nine first-half turnovers, and turned those into\n15 points.They put different defenders on Hield all night, and the one\nconstant was this: No one gave Hield any room to breathe. One of the nation’s\nbest players was largely a nonfactor in the Final Four, finishing with nine\npoints on 4-for-12 shooting.Hield's Sooners will go home, and the Wildcats\nwill move on. Villanova hasn't been in the title game since 1985, when it\nupset Georgetown for its first national championship.Jay Wright, who has\ncoached Villanova for 15 years, will coach in his first title game on Monday\nnight.\n\n","title":"Villanova dominates Buddy Hield, Oklahoma 95-51, roars into title game","twitter":{"body":"Villanova dominates Buddy Hield, Oklahoma to roar into title game: https://t.co/GI0emwybbE","date":"Sun Apr 03 00:24:36 +0000 2016","favs":62,"id":{"$numberLong":"716421102952644611"},"retweets":32},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MKy0M8"}

The main card airs on pay-per-view following prelims on FOX\nSports 1 and UFC Fight Pass.Jones is ranked No. 1 in the USA TODAY\nSports/MMAjunkie MMA light-heavyweight rankings (and No. 1 pound-for-pound).\nCormier is No. 2 at 205 pounds, and Saint Preux is No. 8.Jones fights for the\nfirst time since defeating Cormier in early 2015 and defending his belt for a\ndivisional record eight straight times. Since then, though, he’s dealt with\ntwo arrests on driving-related charges. The first resulted in UFC officials\nstripping him of the title in 2015, and the most recent saw Jones serve brief\njail time for a probation violation before striking a plea deal that\nultimately allowed him to remain on the UFC 197 card.When Jones was stripped\nof the belt a year ago, Cormier claimed the vacant title with a submission win\nover Anthony Johnson.Saint Preux has had an impressive run in the UFC, only\ntasting defeat twice in nine trips to the octagon, but is one fight removed\nfrom a third-round technical submission loss to Glover Teixeira at UFC Fight\nNight 73. He rebounded from the defeat with a unanimous decision victory over\nRafael Cavalcante at UFC Fight Night 82 in February.Other rumored replacement\nopponents included Anthony Johnson and Rashad Evans. White explained his\nreasoning for Saint Preux over those two during his appearance.“Obviously, the\nnumber one choice would be Anthony Johnson, who is the number two ranked guy\nin the world and a fight that everybody wants to see. But Anthony Johnson just\nhad surgery on his mouth and can’t even put a mouthpiece in for at least three\nweeks. So, as you go down the line, other guys have fights set up. …Rashad\nEvans is fighting the week after against Glover Teixeira. So he already has a\nfight. Plus Rashad Evans is ranked number seven, Ovince Saint Preux is ranked\nnumber six. So, number one versus number six makes the most sense.”The latest\nUFC 197 card now includes:MAIN CARD (Pay-per-view, 10 p.m. ET)PRELIMINARY CARD\n(FOX Sports 1, 8 p.m. ET)PRELIMINARY CARD (UFC Fight Pass, 6:30 p.m. ET)For\nmore on UFC 197, check out the UFC Rumors section of the site.\n\n","title":"Ovince Saint Preux replaces Daniel Cormier, meets Jon Jones in new UFC 197 headliner | MMAjunkie","twitter":{"body":"Jones gets new UFC 197 opponent for interim belt https://t.co/JDSr40yTMa","date":"Sat Apr 02 23:13:08 +0000 2016","favs":18,"id":{"$numberLong":"716403120973021184"},"retweets":17},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1Y7bVrY"}

We went in with no preconceived\nnotions whatsoever. OK, maybe a little part of us would have loved to tell yet\nanother celebrity to just stick with their day job.Turns out, this model can\ncook. Like, she can really cook.And this is not a diet or health book where\nChrissy shares how she keeps her bikini body in shape. This book is all about\ncomfort and indulgence.

Yellow.\nCake. Mix.**Con**: The effort is minimal but the end product is major, so best\nto save this for a special hosting occasion or group brunch. There's no way to\nmake this breakfast for one. Which in reality, is probably a good\nthing.**Difficulty**: Easy**Flavor**: The sweet oatmeal and creamy custard\nbase balances with the flavors of the raspberries and peaches nicely. Not a\nfan of those? You can easily sub blueberries or any other fruit.**Would we\nmake it again?** Yes.Chrissy Teigen's \"Everything\" Chicken Sandwich Melts\nWtihout the Sandwich Melt. (Photo: Mary Cadden)A self-proclaimed \"chile\nfiend,\" the cook brings a little added heat to this basic dish with paprika\nand cayenne pepper. We opted to not make the actual sandwich and stick to just\nthe chicken breast and were not disappointed.**Con**: No real cons\nhere.**Pro**: The recipe is for four chicken breasts so it is easy to double\nfor more and freezes well if you are cooking for one.**Difficulty**:\nEasy**Flavor**: The heat and texture of the breading really sets this dish\napart from your basic breaded chicken cutlet. The spices are not overpowering\nand there is a good heat thanks to the cayenne pepper.**Would we make it\nagain?** Yes.Chrissy Teigen's \"Chrissy's Mac and Cheese With Cheesy Garlic\nBread Crumbs\" (Photo: Mary Cadden)Chrissy has VERY strong feelings about her\nmac and cheese and how it compares with her hubby John Legend's. \"I'm sorry,\nJohn. I love you so, so much and you are absolutely perfect. ... But my mac is\nbetter.\" And Chrissy, we would LOVE to do a comparison anytime you and John\nare free. Seriously, call us.**Pro**: This recipe is basically a license to\neat a bowl of cheese.**Con**:  For the novice cook, this is one where you\nmight want a helping hand — one for the constant stirring and a sous chef who\ncan hand you what you need, when you need it.**Difficulty**: There is a good\ndeal of effort involved between keeping track of what to add when while\ncontinually stirring so as not to burn the milk/cheese. There are a lot of\nmoving parts.**Flavor**: This one went newsroom-wide and got rave reviews,\nincluding an \"Oh My Gawd.\" The amount of Swiss cheese used was really the only\nbone of contention. Some people loved the fondue flavor it added, asking if\nthere was wine in it. The answer would be no. Others felt the recipe could go\nlighter on the Swiss. Then again, the pan was wiped clean. And the crispy\ncheesy garlic bread crumbs provide a nice contrast to the cheese.**Would we\nmake it again?** Yes.All in all, we are pretty impressed with what we made.\nThe ingredient lists are pretty basic, nothing you could not get in a your\naverage grocery store. Instructions were also written for the cook who can\neasily be intimidated. The ingredient costs are kept to a minimum. And the\nbook offers a pretty wide selection in terms of styles (American comfort,\nThai-inspired) and types (soups, salads, sandwiches.)\n\n","title":"Does Chrissy Teigen's 'Cravings' live up to the hype?","twitter":{"body":"Does @chrissyteigen's  'Cravings' live up to the hype? @MaryCadden says yes in her review. https://t.co/UcUrjNUd9G","date":"Sat Apr 02 20:45:22 +0000 2016","favs":306,"id":{"$numberLong":"716365931593785344"},"retweets":51},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MECBQf"}

The Secret Service allowed the\nprotest, but not the inflatable, after a number of recent incidents involving\npeople flying drones and throwing objects over the White House fence.\"We're\nlate. We got distracted by a standoff over an inflatable joint,\" the protest's\norganizer, Adam Eidinger, announced a half-hour after the protest march was\nsupposed to start. \"Come on, stoners! Put down that fake joint for a real\none!\"The annual protest usually takes place on April 20, but was rescheduled\nto emphasize the theme of the protest. Protesters want the Obama\nadministration to move the drug to a lower schedule, or to remove it from the\nschedule of controlled substances entirely. Doing so, they say, would lead\nmore states to decriminalize marijuana and encourage more medical\nresearch.Dozens of protesters engaged in civil disobedience by openly smoking\nmarijuana in front of the White House beginning at 4:20 p.m., a time long\nassociated with marijuana smoking and cannabis culture. Police wrote at least\ntwo citations.\"Cannabis has benefited me tremendously medicinally,\" said\nLauren Dove, 27, of Washington, D.C., who was given a $25 ticket for smoking\nmarijuana in public. \"It helps people. I don't think it's dangerous.\"While the\nDistrict of Columbia legalized marijuana last year, it's still illegal to\nsmoke it in public — and possession is still illegal on federal property\nregardless.Obama, who has admitted to using marijuana as a youth, has resisted\ncalls to take executive action to decriminalize marijuana, saying those\nchanges need to come from Congress. \"The president’s response was if you feel\nso strongly about it, and you believe there’s so much public support for what\nit is that you're advocating, then why don't you pass legislation about it,\nand we’ll see what happens,\" White House press secretary Josh Earnest said in\nJanuary.Obama himself didn't see the protest — he had left for Joint Base\nAndrews on Saturday morning for a round of golf with sportswriter Tony\nKornheiser, astronaut Mark Kelly and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron\nRodgers.Secret Service officers prevent marijuana activists from bringing a\n51-foot inflatable joint down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House on April\n2, 2016. (Photo: Gregory Korte, USA TODAY)\n\n","title":"Pot activists protest in front of White House, without giant blow-up joint","twitter":{"body":"RT @gregorykorte: Pot activists protest at White House – minus giant joint https://t.co/OsWCkbWVxH via @USATODAY","date":"Sat Apr 02 20:42:56 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716365321725165568"},"retweets":16},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1SJitLS"}

Parcak used images taken by satellites 400 miles above the\nEarth to find what appeared to be evidence that Vikings made it hundreds of\nmiles further into North America than previously known. Parcak has used the\nsame technique to find 17 pyramids, 1,000 tombs, and 3,000 forgotten\nsettlements. But this newest discovery could change everything we know about\nVikings in North America.The first — and so far only — Viking settlement in\nNorth America was found in 1960 at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland, the New\nYork Times reports. Parcak's site is 300 miles southwest at Point Rosee. After\nspotting discolorations and patterns in the satellite images, she had to hike\nthrough bogs and forests while worrying about bear attacks to confirm her\nsuspicions. Some digging revealed a stone cracked by fire, scraps of iron ore,\nand Viking-style turf walls. “Either it’s … an entirely new culture that looks\nexactly like the Norse,” Parcak tells the Post, “or it’s the westernmost Norse\nsite that’s ever been discovered.” And that means there could more\nundiscovered sites showing Vikings settled deep into North America hundreds of\nyears before the arrival of Columbus.

But within the United States, one category\nis growing faster than the others, and those who tick the boxes for that group\nare the most likely to receive five-star reviews from their guests.Airbnb\nrecently crunched its own numbers and discovered that senior hosts (defined as\nthose who are 60-plus) are its fastest-growing age demographic in the U.S.,\nand that 64% of those senior hosts are women. Airbnb writes:\"Across the U.S.,\nsenior women hosts are becoming an increasingly important part of the Airbnb\ncommunity ... And increasing numbers of Airbnb hosts are empty-nesters who are\nsharing space in their homes to make ends meet and meet travelers from around\nthe world.\"In addition, women who are 60 and over receive the highest\npercentage of five-star reviews — more than any other combination of age and\ngender.In the United States, 13% of Airbnb hosts fit into the senior category\nand the majority of listings posted by seniors are in the Northeast. Four of\nthe five states with the highest percentage of senior-owned listings are in\nthe Northeast: Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire and Delaware. New Mexico is the\nfifth.According to the data, if you want to have a solid Airbnb experience,\nseeking out a senior host might be the way to go. Hosts over 60 receive a\nhigher percentage of five-star reviews than those in other age categories,\nwith almost 2/3 (62%) of guests giving them the site's top rating. Senior\nwomen fare slightly better than senior men, with 63% of them earning five\nstars, compared with 61% of men. Senior women are also more likely to rent a\nprivate room (as opposed to the whole house) than any other demographic\ngroup.Almost 2/3 of senior hosts are empty nesters and the ability (or\nwillingness) to rent those otherwise empty rooms seems to be beneficial to\nboth the host and the guest. The people who stay with senior hosts have rated\nthem as providing the highest quality Airbnb experience, and the hosts\nthemselves are getting an extra source of income that, in some cases, allows\nthem to continue living in their homes. Half of senior hosts said that they\nchose to host due to financial reasons, and 45% said that they used those\nAirbnb dollars — an average of around $6,000 per year for a \"typical\" senior —\nfor \"important costs of living.\"\n\n","title":"Why an older woman may be your next Airbnb host","twitter":{"body":"Why an older woman may be your next Airbnb host https://t.co/OPWRp2EXJp","date":"Sat Apr 02 19:40:20 +0000 2016","favs":18,"id":{"$numberLong":"716349565843148802"},"retweets":10},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MVWJrO"}

By Saturday, a Twitter\npage was also up and running.The measure, signed into law last week by Pence,\na Republican, makes Indiana only the second state to prohibit a woman from\nseeking an abortion because her fetus was diagnosed with a disability such as\nDown syndrome. It also prohibits abortions when they are sought based on the\ngender or race of a fetus and requires the remains of miscarried or aborted\nfetuses to be interred or cremated.Contact @GovPenceIN to report your periods\nin response to HEA1337!

She told USA TODAY that she got the idea after reading the bill. The woman, who said she wanted to remain anonymous because she feared for her safety, said she created \"Periods for Pence\" and had 700 Facebook followers by the next day.Stephanie Hodgin, deputy press secretary for Pence, issued a statement to WRTV and other news outlets that said, “We are always willing to take calls from constituents who have questions, concerns or are looking for assistance.\"Pence is up for re-election in November, but Republican strategist Mike Murphy tells WXIN-TV that this Facebook effort is not likely to hurt him politically because  \"people who are joining this website or this Facebook page weren’t going to vote for him anyhow.”“Right to life in this state is a winning issue, hands down,” he said.A similar campaign was launched in February against new Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin after he signed legislation requiring women to have a face-to-face consultation with their doctor at least 24 hours before having an abortion, the newsandtribune.com reports.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e5f"},"content":"It was August 1924, and Adolf Hitler was pounding away on his little Remington\nportable typewriter in a small prison cell outside Munich. He was writing\n_Mein Kampf_ and reaching a climax of self-infatuation. Increasingly convinced\nof his messianic mission to save Germany — from Marxists, from economic\nmisery, from the Jewish world conspiracy — Hitler spun his own self-image to\nhistoric and histrionic heights.“At long intervals of human history,” he\nwrote, “it may occasionally happen that the practical politician and the\npolitical philosopher are one.” This rare combination of the man of action and\nthe man of vision — Hitler had in mind Napoleon, Frederick the Great of\nPrussia and himself — was what made the great leader uniquely able to prevent\nhis country’s “downfall” and “collapse” — two of Hitler’s favorite words as he\ndrafted his political manifesto.In short, the solution to Germany’s calamitous\npost-World War I misery was … Hitler. Though he discussed in his book\neverything from education to warship construction and stamping out syphilis,\nHitler’s primary offer was himself. After its publication in 1925, _Mein\nKampf_became known as the Nazi bible.Hitler’s special skill in selling himself\nwas his uncanny ability to intuit crowd mood. He understood that he had to\nreach past the nitty-gritty of desperate 1920s pocketbook issues to the German\npeople’s sense of themselves. “The question of the recovery of the German\npeople (from World War I) is not a question of economic recovery,” he wrote in\nan internal party memorandum. Regaining an “inner feeling” was the key, he\nexplained, because only that could lead again to “national greatness.”\nGermans, not merely defeated but humiliated by the war’s aftermath, craved\nself-respect even more than bread, Hitler rightly sensed.Sound familiar? While\nDonald Trump is no killer, he shares Hitler’s goal of national greatness. Like\nHitler, Trump has a preternatural sense of crowd mood and the voters’ inner\nneeds, not just their material distress. They want, even more than badly\nneeded jobs and security, a sense of their own value in an unmoored world.And,\nlike Hitler, Trump offers the same route to achieving renewed greatness:\nhimself. A born demagogue believes that only he has the skills needed to save\nthe day.Trump and Hitler proceed from the same apocalyptic starting point. In\nTrump’s narrative, America is on the brink of ruin. At least a portion of his\nlisteners, as did Hitler’s, passionately believes the downfall scenario. Each\nman is (or was) skilled at setting up boogeymen: For Hitler, it was Jews,\nMarxists, the hated French and the “lying press.” For Trump, it is Muslims,\nMexican illegals, the Islamic State terrorist group and the Chinese who are\nsupposedly cleaning our clocks. When convenient, Trump includes the\n“dishonest” news media covering his events — a tactic also used in the 1960s\nby Alabama Gov. George Wallace.Yet, like Hitler, Trump understands the\nimportance of the news media to his political enterprise. In 1987, Trump wrote\nin the book he now holds up as a kind of Trump bible, _The Art of The Deal_:\n“If you are a little different, or a little outrageous, or if you do things\nthat are bold or controversial, the press is going to write about you. … Even\na critical story … can be very valuable.”Hitler couldn’t have agreed more.\nAfter a particularly violent beer hall rally in Munich, he said: “It makes no\ndifference whatever whether they laugh at us or revile us. … The main thing is\nthat they mention us.”By his self-identification with famous men of the sword,\nHitler created a glorified rationale for his unique qualification to save\nGermany. Trump has a simpler explanation: deals. He does not invoke storybook\nfigures of history but rather his own career as a deal-maker. Reframing the\npractice of politics and the exercise of foreign policy as the art of the\ndeal, Trump claims that only he has the negotiating skills to arrest the\ncoming downfall and once again achieve greatness, his all purpose palliative\nfor a disillusioned and rebellious following.In _Mein Kampf_, Hitler expounded\na great-man theory of politics based on “the genius and actions of an\nindividual personality,” as opposed to that weak and wobbly thing called\nmajority rule. This was his undisguised argument for authoritarian governance.\nTrump, with his cavalier attitude toward Congress — he talks of expanding laws\nas if by presidential fiat — echoes Hitler’s high-handed dismissal of\nparliamentary democracy as “a joke” (in a 1923 interview with an American\nnewspaper).Comparing Trump to Hitler is slippery business. No one serious sees\nTrump as a genocidal psychopath seeking world conquest. Trump does not even\nseem to have the grasp of world history that Hitler, for all his distortions\nand liberties in _Mein Kampf_, had acquired as a busy autodidact (he called\nhis year in Landsberg Prison “my university (education) at state expense”).\nNor does Trump have a need for political success as his complete self-\naffirmation; Hitler, by contrast, had no other profession than politician.Even\nso, the man in cell No. 7 was operating on raw instincts that, in the end, won\nhim Germany. “The mentality of the masses has no use for half measures and\nweakness,” Hitler wrote one day. “It recognizes only ruthless strength and\nbrutality.”In his book, Trump wrote: “It’s instincts, not marketing studies,”\nthat drive the good deals. No deep thinker, he is as instinctive as a\npolitician can be. Eerily, those instincts are also winning the presidential\ncandidate a large slice of American politics._Peter Ross Range, a longtime\nGermany specialist, is a writer based in Washington, D.C.

You likely remember Tattoo, played\nby actor Hervé Villechaize on ABC's _Fantasy Island_.At the start of each\nepisode, the diminutive character cried \"De plane, boss! De plane!\" to Mr.\nRoarke, played by Ricardo Montalban.Now \"de plane\" — a refurbished 1967\nGrumman Widgeon G-44, the last of its kind to be built — is going on sale at\nthe Branson Auction this month, according to a statement from company owner\nJim Cox.In the news release, Cox said the vintage seaplane appeared on the TV\nshow from 1977 to 1984 and it had multiple owners afterward. In the mid-1980s,\nit was confiscated by the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics. \"The pilot was using\nit to smuggle drugs!\" Cox said in the statement.Later, the government sold it\nto a private collector.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e62"},"content":"She may be diminutive in height and remarkably trim, but there's nothing else\nthat's small about Dolly Parton. Among her oversized attributes, she's got a\nbig voice, big hair, and a personality as big as the Great Smoky Mountains. At\n70 years old, the effervescent icon has been working nine to five and then\nsome for decades but shows no signs of slowing down. Her 2015 NBC biopic,\n_Dolly Parton’s Coat of Many Colors,_ garnered huge ratings. She has a new\nalbum coming out soon and has announced a major tour that will kick off this\nsummer. And she has big things happening at her theme park, DolIywood.I sat\ndown with Parton to talk about the park that bears her name. Located in Pigeon\nForge, Tenn.,, Dollywood is nestled in the foothills of the Smokies near where\nshe and her 11 siblings grew up. She was there to kick off its 31st season,\nand we met in the park's Chasing Rainbows, a museum that is devoted to her\nlife and career. Flashing her trademark smile, making a racket with her many\nbaubles, and displaying violet eye shadow and matching nails, she looked like\nshe stepped right out of one of the exhibit's glossy photos.Despite her room-\nlighting persona, Dolly was delightfully disarming. When we began our\nconversation, she hushed others in the room with a stern \"Quiet, we're\ntalking! Shh!\" After they obliged, she quickly softened her tone and giggled\nloudly. This diva apparently gets what she wants with kindness and humor.\nThroughout our chat, she laughed easily and exuded warmth.For the 2016 season,\nthe park is opening Lightning Rod. At 73 mph, it will be the world's fastest\nwooden coaster. Using electro-magnetic propulsion instead of a traditional\nchain lift, it will also be the world's only launched wooden coaster. Famously\nafraid of thrill rides, Dolly won't be getting anywhere near Lightning Rod. I\nasked her whether she ever experienced a coaster.DOLLY PARTON: I was never\nmore scared than I was at Disneyland. I had a little niece who wanted to ride\nSpace Mountain. She was crying her eyes out. I didn't want to ride, but I did\nit just for her. I almost threw her out! I was so scared, I couldn't even hold\non to her. I thought, 'Oh Lord, if you just let me make it through this, I'll\nnever get on another coaster.'USA TODAY: With world-class coasters like\nLightning Rod, do you ever wish you could muster the courage to try the wild\nrides at your park?DOLLY PARTON: I've got too much to lose — like my hair!\nLord knows what else could fall out of me. I can think of a lot of other\nthings I'd rather do than be scared to death [on a coaster].Late last summer,\nthe 300-room Dollywood's DreamMore Resort opened as part of a $300 million\nexpansion to the park. I asked Dolly whether a hotel was always part of the\nplan.DOLLY PARTON: Yes, I wanted a hotel from the time we started. Two or\nthree different times, we've tried to build this resort. When we had the big\nrecession, we had to pull back. But in the last couple of years, everything\nfell right into place. I always pray that God will direct me, so that was a\nprayer answered.USA TODAY: What are you most proud of at the DreamMore?DOLLY\nPARTON: Well, the whole thing. I've got it finally. It really makes Dollywood\na vacation destination. People are loving it. They can come to the park and\nnot have to go anywhere. The rooms are great and are tailor-made for families.\nWe have so many fun things scheduled [at the hotel], it is an attraction in\nitself.USA TODAY: In what ways does the DreamMore reflect you?DOLLY PARTON: We\nhave to \"Dolly-ize\" everything. Butterflies are my symbol. As a child, I used\nto get lost chasing them and got my butt whipped for wandering too far off. So\nwe have butterflies everywhere. We have some of my sayings — \"Dolly-isms\" — in\ndifferent places. There's a whole layout of my album covers. It's in good\ntaste. There's a fine line between taste and gaudy.My mamma used to make stone\nsoup. She'd tell us the legend and send us out to clean up rocks. We didn't\nhave that much food. If a child was going through something, she'd choose that\nchild's rock to put in the soup to make us feel a little more special. So we\nhave stone soup at the restaurant.USA TODAY: What was the path that led you to\nDollywood?DOLLY PARTON: Many years ago, I used to think that if I became\nfamous, I'd love to come back to my home area and build something. I knew the\n[Great Smoky Mountains] National Park would always draw a bunch of tourists. I\nknew it would be a good business investment. But more than that, I knew it\nwould be something wonderful for my people. You know how they talk about\nhonoring your mother and father? I wanted to bring honor to my family. I\nwanted to have something with my name — my dad's name — tagged to it.I wanted\nto do something special and provide jobs for the people in this area. At that\ntime [31 years ago], we were not as prosperous as we are now. I like to take\nsome pride in thinking I had a little bit to do with some of that. And\nDollywood is something I thought would be a wonderful thing for families.You\ncan't just say, 'I'm gonna build a park.' What are you going to do if you\ndon't know anything about it? I went into business with the Herschends.\n[Herschend Family Entertainment owns and operates a number of parks and\nattractions including Silver Dollar City, the park that preceded Dollywood.] I\nknew I needed to surround myself with people who understand this world.Even in\nthe decorating [of the hotel], I have no taste. But I know good taste when I\nsee it. I appreciate it and respect it. I just don't know how to do it. I've\nbeen blessed through the years by working with good people that are smarter\nthan me. I can have a dream, but I need help to carry it through.USA TODAY:\nDid you visit amusement parks as a child?DOLLY PARTON: Yeah! We were real poor\nkids. Every year, if we were lucky, the school would let us go to the county\nfair. That was the biggest thing in the world to me. [Dollywood features a\nretro Country Fair area with a Ferris wheel, carnival games, and other\nattractions.]USA TODAY: If Dollywood existed when you were much younger, would\nyou have wanted to come here?DOLLY PARTON: I would have wanted to, but we\nprobably couldn't have afforded it. But I would have loved to work here. I\nwould have said, 'I can sing. Can I come in and sing?'USA TODAY: What are your\nfavorite parts of the park?DOLLY PARTON: Well, I love the music, because\nthat's what I'm all about. [More than any other American theme park, Dollywood\nfeatures an incredible number and variety of live performances.] 'My People!'\nis my favorite show. It really is my people. It's my story — my journey — from\nwhen we were little up to my songs. It's kind of a mini Broadway show. A lot\nof my family members perform in it.We have great food too. I love that,\nbecause I'm a hog at heart. I may be skinny now, but inside there's a hog\ntrying to get out.USA TODAY: What do you think makes Dollywood different from\nother parks?DOLLY PARTON: Me! That's the obvious answer. We have great music.\nIt should be so, because that's my business. Especially for these parts, I\nthink it's wonderful that [the park helps] preserve the Smoky Mountains\nheritage. We have the sawmill, we have candle makers, we have the old\ngristmill.We've got something for everybody, and I'm as proud of that as\nanything. You can bring your whole family, even your squirrelly teenagers.\nThey don't have to stay with mommy and daddy. They can go ride the coasters,\nand everyone can meet up later. There are things for little kids and for older\nfolks. Grandparents can come.USA TODAY: Might you ever build another\nDollywood?DOLLY PARTON: We've talked about it. We've had offers worldwide. I\ndon't just want to put my name on something and not be able to be around to\nsee that it's right. I think for sure we will someday. We almost put one in\nNashville, and we would still like to.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e63"},"content":"It’s not an April Fools’ joke, though watching it, I couldn’t really believe\nmy eyes.The Boston Celtics stunned the Golden State Warriors on Friday night,\nbeating them 109-106 and ending the Warriors’ 54-game home win streak.You’re\nprobably asking right now: Wait, how did an undermanned Celtics team (they\nwere missing Jae Crowder) beat the best basketball team in recent history?\nThere were a lot of factors, but here were some big keys —The Celtics threw a\nlot of different looks at league MVP Stephen Curry — including moments with\nEvan Turner on him, double teams, and, at one memorable moment, having the\nentire team defend him.Lol!!!! pic.twitter.com/XNFF84xOd9— sam esfandiari\n(@samesfandiari) April 2, 2016They found their best success with Avery Bradley\non him, however. Bradley hounded Curry off ball, making it difficult for him\nto get into his motion sets. His teammates helped him by bumping Curry off\nscreens, and generally making his life difficult. Curry opened up in the\nsecond half — he’s the best player alive for a reason — but the Celtics were\nable to stay in the game because Bradley is a great defender and harried Curry\nfor much of the first half.In the first quarter especially you could see Curry\nstruggling with the physicality of Bradley and Turner and Marcus Smart. For\nmuch of the first quarter, he seemed content to find his teammates, or just\nstruggled to even get the ball in his hands.Curry didn’t score a basket until\nthe closing seconds of the first quarter. He finished with 29 and was by far\nthe best player on the floor, but that quarter he took getting adjusted\nallowed the Celtics to stay in it, and find some belief.The Celtics made their\nplan clear — they were going to make life hard off the ball for Curry and\nThompson and let the other players on the Warriors be the ones to beat them.\nThompson had no baskets in the first quarter, struggling just as Curry did\nwith the constant harassment and attention off the ball.Unlike Curry, he never\nreally got it going — finishing with 15 points on 6 for 16 shooting and 2 of 6\nbeyond the arc. Not awful numbers, but the Warriors needed a bit more from\nhim.Thomas may stand just 5-foot-9, but as you watched the game you got the\nsense that it was turning into a straight man-off between the diminutive\nCeltics guard and the Warriors’ emotional center Draymond Green. Both were\nwhooping it up after baskets, screaming at their teammates, and neither seemed\nwilling to back down from everything.This is funny with Thomas because, again,\nhe’s 5-foot-9. But he refused to back down, and his ability to get past his\nman and repeatedly get into the paint made life extremely difficult for the\nWarriors. The Celtics’ offense wasn’t as pretty as the Warriors’ was by any\nstretch of the imagination, but again and again Thomas got into the paint and\nmade the right decision. He finished with 22 points and six assists.The\nCeltics hung tough with the Warriors in a thrilling third quarter that saw\nStephen Curry turn into a human fireball, and somehow the Celtics returning\nevery punch. To kick off the fourth quarter, the Celtics landed a surprising\nblow when Marcus Smart got a few mismatches on Mareese Speights and didn’t\nhesitate. On the first he attacked the basket and laid in a wonky runner.![sma\nrtdrive](https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/smartdrive.gif?w=640\u0026h=36\n0)He followed that up with a three-pointer in the big man’s face.![smart3](htt\nps://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/smart3.gif?w=640\u0026h=360)The two\nbuckets grew the Celtics’ lead, and you could see the team really starting to\nbelieve.Turner is a player who is not quite what most modern NBA teams are\nlooking for. He can’t really shoot the three. He loves a good mid-range\njumper, the inefficient shot that is that antithesis of all that is NBA gospel\nright now. And yet that weird mid-range game he loves so well was devastating\nfor the Warriors. The Celtics kept working the ball around, forcing switches\nuntil Turner had someone he felt comfortable posting up. He finished 8-13 from\nthe field for 21 points, and tacked on 5 assists and 5 rebounds.The Warriors’\noffense is one of the most beautiful things in sports, but there is a way to\ndisrupt it — you turn the game ugly. The Celtics did that. They hung guys up\non screens, dove after loose balls, banged bodies in the post.As soon as the\ngame got the feeling of that playoff atmosphere, the refs more or less put the\nwhistles away … just what the Celtics wanted.This is the long and the short of\nit — Brad Stevens had a perfect game plan and the Celtics executed it\nperfectly.They hounded the Warriors off the ball, refusing to let them get\ninto their sets. They took the shots the Warriors gave them, even if they\nweren’t pretty. The Celtics moved the ball exceptionally well and found the\nright pass time and time again.He took this starting lineup …… and beat the\ndefending champions on their court. That is stunning.He did it by taking\nadvantage of all the things listed above, but also by instilling in the\nCeltics a sense of belief that they belonged on the floor with this team and\nthat they deserved to win the game.Isaiah Thomas on Brad Stevens' message\nduring late timeouts: \"He kept saying, 'This is ours!'\"— Boston Celtics\n(@celtics) April 2, 2016Now, for the huge caveat —The Warriors are still the\nbest team in the NBA. The Celtics played a near-perfect game and were a\nrimmed-out Stephen Curry three from having that game go to overtime. The\nWarriors were missing Festus Ezili and Andre Iguodala. If the Celtics somehow\nclaw their way out of the Eastern Conference and meet the Warriors in the NBA\nFinals, the Warriors probably win in five.But the Celtics did show that there\nis a way to beat this Warriors team. You have to be willing to get ugly, to\ntake mid-range shots, and to work your tail off on defense. And you need a\nlittle luck.Actually, yeah, that’s number 9 on this list.The Warriors\nuncharacteristically turned the ball over a few times down the stretch. They\ndon’t usually do that. The Celtics hit some weird floaters and got a few non-\ncalls and had bouncing balls break their way.But for a team like the Celtics\nto stun the Warriors in Oakland, they needed a little luck. Any team does.\nThat shouldn’t take away from what they accomplished.\n\n","title":"9 reasons the Celtics snapped Golden State’s 54-game home win streak | For The Win","twitter":{"body":"9 reasons the Celtics stunned the Warriors in Oakland https://t.co/F9hvriA10i","date":"Sat Apr 02 15:53:36 +0000 2016","favs":44,"id":{"$numberLong":"716292507047342080"},"retweets":26},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1VjH6kG"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e64"},"content":"NASHVILLE — Officials from Donald Trump's presidential campaign are accusing\nTennessee Republican Party officials of attempting to steal pro-Trump\ndelegates to the national convention and stop them from being a part of\nTennessee's delegation.The move is part of national Republican Party effort to\nstop the GOP frontrunner from becoming the nominee, Trump campaign officials\nhave alleged.On Wednesday, Ryan Hayes, chairman of the Tennessee Republican\nParty, agreed on the names of seven of 14 at-large delegates that the state\nparty is allowed to appoint under party rules, said Darren Morris, Tennessee\ndirector of Trump's campaign. But several of those names are missing from a\nlist he reviewed late this week, replaced with people not in the Trump\ncamp.\"They're picking anti-Trump people,\" Morris said. \"They're picking\nestablishment picks who don't support Donald Trump, and it's just the same\neffort that they're conducting all over the country to steal a vote here,\nsteal a delegate there, to affect the outcome of the convention in July and\ntake the nomination away from Donald Trump.\"A Tennessee party official\ndisputes that allegation, accusing Trump’s camp of distorting the truth while\nnoting Trump will still receive all delegates won in the state's March 1\nprimary.\"Instead of stirring up strife and grossly mischaracterizing the\nconversation that took place between Mr. Morris and Chairman Haynes, let's set\nthe record straight: There was never an agreement, especially after the Trump\ncampaign spoke dismissively about the party process and one of our female\nmembers,” said Brent Leatherwood, executive director of the state Republican\nParty.He did not specify who was insulted.Trump handily won Tennessee’s GOP\nprimary with 39% of the vote. Candidates needed to meet a 20% threshold to\nearn a portion of the 41 elected delegates up for grabs, so the delegate slate\nthat voters approved was split among the top three, according to state GOP\nofficials:At issue are the 14 at-large delegates that the state Republican\nParty's Executive Committee appoints. Though the state party selects those\npeople, national convention rules say they should be allocated in proportion\nto primary results.The Republican National Committee selects an additional\nthree delegates — generally the national committeeman, national committeewoman\nand state Republican Party chairman — making Tennessee's grand total 58.\"The\nparty chair is a puppet,\" Morris said. \"He is doing the bidding of the party\nestablishment to take the nomination away from Donald Trump.\"Trump campaign\nofficials told state party leaders who they wanted for the seven at-large\nspots that they believe they're entitled to, and those leaders reneged, Morris\nsaid. He alleges that their replacements don't really support Trump.The state\nparty will follow GOP bylaws, Leatherwood said. State law that mandates all\ndelegates to be bound to their respective candidate for two rounds of\nballoting at the Republican National Convention.But if Trump doesn't win by\ngarnering a majority of delegates nationwide before the floor vote, Tennessee\ndelegates would be free to vote for their personal choice after two rounds.\nThat greatly concerns Trump supporters.The Trump campaign urged its supporters\nto pack a Tennessee Republican Executive Committee meeting Saturday here to\ninfluence a committee vote on finalizing the 14 at-large delegates. A campaign\nemail sent to supporters in the state argued \"a small group of Tennessee\nestablishment insiders pulling a fast one.\"\"We won the votes,\" it read. \"They\nare trying to steal them.\"On Saturday, dozens of Trump supporters were refused\nentry into the meeting after the executive committee changed its rules and\nclosed the proceedings. Officially, organizers said their small meeting room\nhad reached capacity.Executive committee members approved the slate of 14 at-\nlarge delegates that upset the Trump camp, 40-25.“Trust me, there will be a\nwar,” a Metro Nashville councilman, Robert Swope, told Trump supporters\noutside the meeting. “I want everyone to remember this moment in the Tennessee\nGOP because this will come back to haunt them.”_Contributing: Jamie McGee and\nJoel Ebert, The Tennessean. Follow Joey Garrison and Dave Boucher on Twitter:\n@joeygarrison and @Dave_Boucher1_\n\n","title":"Trump camp accuses Tenn.

In mid-January, a unidentified bettor\nwagered $100 at 1,000-to-1 odds that Syracuse would win national college\nbasketball championship, said Jay Kornegay, vice president of Westgate’s race\nand sports book.If Syracuse upsets North Carolina on Saturday and beats the\nwinner of Oklahoma-Villanova in the final Monday, the bettor will collect\n$100,000, according to Kornegay.“It’s certainly going to be a punch to the\ngut,\" Kornegay told USA TODAY Sports. “But it’s not going to be something\nthat’s going to make us raise the price of our sandwiches.’’Kornegay said\nthere are three other tickets and a combined $135 that were wagered on\nSyracuse at 1,000-to-1 odds. At the time, Syracuse, a No. 10 seed in the NCAA\ntournament, was 0-4 in the Atlantic Coast Conference and its coach, Jim\nBoeheim, was serving a nine-game suspension for NCAA rules violations.The\nowner of the betting tickets are unknown, according to Kornegay, who said he\nwouldn’t confirm them until he sees the tickets.For the record, Kornegay said,\nthe biggest odds he has paid out was a 500-to-1 ticket placed on Regan Smith\nto win Showtime Southern 500 in 2011 at Darlington Raceway.What’s worth\nnoting: Smith is from Cato, N.Y., a half an hour drive from Syracuse,\nN.Y.Also:Villanova, which lost to Oklahoma 78-55, is a 2-point favorite vs.\nOklahoma, and North Carolina is a 9 1/2-point favorite vs. Syracuse, said\nJimmy Vaccaro, who sets the lines at South Point Hotel and is considered the\ndean of Vegas bookmakers. He said the point spreads could shift closer to game\ntime Saturday.He also said the money wagered on each of the four teams has\nbeen evenly split.“Probably as evenly split as the Final Four maybe in the\npast 10 years,\" said Vaccaro, who added, “It’s been an unbelievable\ntournament.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e68"},"content":"The Amazon Echo has quietly become the hottest smart home product on the\nmarket. Suddenly, every tech company wants to integrate its products with\nAmazon's customizable virtual assistant, Alexa.The integrations keep coming,\nat such a pace that it can be hard to know exactly which products work with\nAlexa. Amazon's website tries to keep on top of things, but its interface can\nbe tough to navigate. It also (understandably) underplays the fact that you\ndon't need an Echo to take advantage of Alexa and all the devices she can\ncontrol.RelatedNot only has Amazon built Alexa into other products, like the\nFire TV, but the company has also allowed third-party hardware makers to build\nAlexa into their own devices. None of these devices have hit the market yet,\nbut they'll be coming later this year. By the end of 2016, Alexa will be found\nin a Samsung refrigerator and even some Ford cars.To help you understand\nAlexa's reach, we've created this comprehensive guide. We'll be continuously\nupdating it as new integrations are announced, in order to help you build the\nsmart home that's right for you.Below you'll find a list of all the product\ncategories Alexa covers. Click on any category to see what's available.While\nthe Echo is Amazon's flagship Alexa device, it isn't alone. There are four\nother devices on the market that offer Alexa, as well as three more from\nthird-parties that will be available later this year. Here's a quick\nrundown:The Echo is the black cylinder that started it all—a Bluetooth speaker\nequipped with far-field, always-on microphones and internet-connected smarts.\nThe $179.99 device can control smart home products, play music from your\nphone, Amazon Prime, and Spotify, and even order products off Amazon just by\nlistening to your voice.With the Alexa app, you can customize the virtual\nassistant to your liking, with hundreds of Alexa Skills for everything from\ndelivering more accurate weather forecasts to making fart sounds.Take the\nEcho, slice off the top, and you've got the Echo Dot. The Dot ditches the\nhigh-quality built-in speaker to cut down on cost, while still giving you all\nof Alexa's smarts. A smaller built-in speaker does let you talk to Alexa, but\nit's not good enough for streaming music. Instead, you can connect the Dot to\nspeakers you already own via Bluetooth or an audio out jack.The Dot will sell\nfor $89.99, but for the time being you can only order it through Alexa-enabled\ndevices. It ships on March 31.The Amazon Tap takes the Echo's core features\nand packs them into a portable Bluetooth speaker. Since it's battery-powered,\nthe Tap isn't always listening like the Echo or Echo Dot. Instead, you have to\npress a mic button to speak to Alexa.Even though it's portable, the Tap\nrequires a WiFi connection to use Alexa (there's no LTE option), so if you're\nout and about, you'll need to use your smartphone as a mobile hotspot. You can\npre-order the Tap for $129.99, and like the Echo Dot, it ships March 31.The\nFire TV version of Alexa doesn't have all the same features as Alexa on the\nEcho, but it can still control smart home products and take advantage of Alexa\nSkills.The main difference is the way you interact with Alexa. You need to\nhave your TV on and speak to Alexa through the Fire TV Remote. There's no\nalways-on listening mode, but that might be a positive if you have privacy\nconcerns.The Fire TV Stick with Voice Remote also offers Alexa, using the same\nremote interface. Alexa on Fire TV Stick offers the same features as Alexa on\nthe Fire TV box, and is the cheapest way to get the virtual assistant at just\n$50.Samsung's latest smart fridge, unveiled at CES earlier this year, will\nalso allow you to talk to Alexa through an app on its giant touchscreen. We\nwent hands-on with the fridge back in January, but Alexa functionality wasn't\nworking. When it finally arrives, we can guarantee that the fridge won't be\ncheap; the price is expected to be between $5,000 and $6,000 when it hits\nstores later this year.If you want to make your fridge smarter without\nshelling out thousands of dollars, then you should check out the Invoxia\nTriby. It's already out on the market and will soon be the first third-party\ndevice to offer Alexa integration.The Triby has a built-in speaker for playing\nmusic, a screen that can display doodles made in the companion app, and the\nability to make calls to phones running the app.This year, Ford vehicles with\nthe latest version of the Ford Sync infotainment system will get Alexa\nintegration, putting the Echo's core features (plus some driving-related ones)\nright in the car. It's such a clever integration that it won one of our CES\nEditors' Choice Awards this year.While Alexa can control lots of smart home\ndevices, most of the integrations require a smart home hub to act as a middle\nman. Annoying? Yes. But since current Alexa devices lack the radios needed to\ncommunicate directly with the devices, it's a relationship that we'll have to\ndeal with for the foreseeable future.SmartThings offers one of the most robust\nsmart home ecosystems on the market. With Alexa integration, you can control\njust about any SmartThings-compatible device that has an on/off state. Other\ncompatible products include smart lightbulbs, air vents, switches and outlets,\nand even the Honeywell Lyric smart thermostat.The Wink hub is probably\nSmartThings' chief rival, though it hasn't been able to keep up in terms of\nthe number of compatible products. Regardless, through the Wink hub, Alexa can\nstill access and control smart bulbs, switches and outlets, and (exclusively,\nuntil very recently) the Nest Learning Thermostat.Insteon may not be as flashy\nas SmartThings and Wink, but the older ecosystem remains a compelling option\n(if frustratingly closed). Alexa can control products specifically through the\nInsteon Hub (2245-222).Amazon's assistant won't work with any of Insteon's\nother hubs, including the HomeKit-compatible Insteon Hub Pro. With the\n2245-222 and Alexa, you can control plugs, switches, lights, and wired\nthermostats.Alarm.com is a dealer-installed smart home and security system—an\nunusual arrangement that takes the headache out of having to set up a smart\nhome system yourself. At CES 2016, the company announced integration with the\nAmazon Echo, which will allow Alexa to control Alarm.com lighting products and\nthermostats. You can also use your voice to arm the security system.Vivint is\na professionally installed smart home and security solution that also\nannounced Amazon Echo integration at CES 2016. With Vivint, Alexa can arm your\nsecurity system and control lights, thermostats, garage doors, and even smart\nlocks.Even though it's a professionally installed system, Vivint provides\narguably the best voice control of any smart home system, though rivals are\ncatching up quick.Nexia is far from a name brand, but the smart home ecosystem\nworks with a variety of Z-Wave smart home devices. Like Alarm.com and Vivint,\nNexia also recently announced Amazon Echo integration for its system, but\nhasn't offered many details on which products will work with Alexa.You've\nprobably never heard of Universal Devices, but home automation geeks know the\ncompany for its Insteon-compatible ISY (_\"izzy\"_) hubs. The company offers two\nhubs: the ISY-994i Series and ISY-994iZw Series. Both offer Insteon\ncompatibility, but the latter adds a Z-Wave radio for those devices. Set up\nAlexa integration and you'll be able to control lights, door locks,\nthermostats, and device programs, which make changes to multiple devices at\nonce.HomeSeer offers six different smart home controllers (or hubs) that are\ngeared much more towards home automation geeks than average consumers. With\nthe HomeSeer Amazon Echo integration, users can ask Alexa to control lights,\nlocks, thermostats, garage doors, and security systems.Simple Control is\nprimarily focused on A/V and home theater control, but the company's powerful\nhub and app allow you to control many other devices including entire\nSmartThings and Insteon systems.The system isn't simple (or cheap), but it\nallows for a lot of customization. Due to Simple Control's A/V focus, Alexa\ncan control TVs, and even change channels for you.Lighting was the first type\nof smart home gadget made compatible with the Amazon Echo, and the sheer\nnumber of smart bulbs (and switches, dimmers, and outlets) that work with\nAlexa show just how far Amazon has come. Most of these products are smart\nlightbulbs, which aren't the simplest solution, but they offer an easy entry\npoint into smart home tech.Philips makes some of the best smart bulbs money\ncan buy, and its affordable Hue White bulbs are some of our favorites. While\nthis kit already works with Siri, it can be integrated with Alexa for\nadditional voice control. The company also sells extension bulbs if you want\nto add more to your ecosystem.This kit was our favorite smart bulb option of\n2015, and for good reason. Philips Hue White and Color not only offer the best\nperformance, but a great third-party ecosystem. Like the White Starter Kit,\nthis kit also works with Siri and now includes Alexa integration as well.\nPhilips also sells extension bulbs for this kit.The Philips Hue Go puts the\ncolor control of Hue bulbs into a rechargeable, portable light that puts out\n300 lumens and lasts up to three hours on a charge. The only downside is that\nit requires a Philips Hue Bridge (included with the starter kits above) to\nconnect it to the Hue app, and subsequently, Alexa.Part of the Friends of Hue\nlighting line, this color-changing bloom is another unusual fixture you can\nplace in your home, but it lacks a built-in battery. You'll still need a Hue\nBridge to take advantage of all this light has to offer, including the ability\nto control it with Alexa.Another member of the Friends of Hue line, the\nLightstrip offers color-changing technology and the flexibility to line\ncertain spaces and even be cut to the perfect length. Once more, you'll need a\nHue Bridge to control the Lightstrip with Alexa.The LIFX Color 1000 is a great\nalternative to the Philips Hue color bulbs, offering millions of colors and an\nextremely wide color temperature adjustment range (2500–9000K) with no need\nfor a hub. You can control the bulb via WiFi, making it easy to connect to the\nAmazon Echo and Alexa.Similar to the A19 Color 100, this BR30 bulb offers lots\nof colors and color temperature adjustment, but fits better in high hats and\nother larger lighting fixtures. And just like its little brother, the BR30\nvariant works with Alexa.The LIFX White 800 ditches its siblings' color-\nchanging ability, but still offers color temperature adjustment. That helps\nlower the entry price for this hubless bulb. Like its siblings, the White 800\ncan be controlled with Alexa. (Just don't try to get her to change the bulb's\ncolor)This bulb is essentially the BR30 equivalent of the White 800, but\nslightly brighter; it puts out 950 lumens instead of 890. And like the Color\n1000 BR30, this bulb will work for bigger light fixtures.The Cree Connected\nLED bulb is one of the most affordable and flexible bulbs on the market.\nThey're priced competitively with Philips Hue White bulbs, but work with just\nabout any smart home hub. That makes them a better deal in the long run, since\nit sets you up to start building a comprehensive smart home ecosystem.Through\na SmartThings or Wink hub, you'll be able to control these affordable bulbs\nwith Alexa. Cree also offers a 5000K variant of the bulb.The GE Link bulb\ntries to compete with the Cree Connected LED in terms of price, functionality,\nand color temperature variants, but its performance just can't match up.\nRegardless, the GE Link bulb works with Alexa via a Wink hub.Note: There are\nalso BR30 and PAR38 variants of the GE Link bulb.Osram Lightify bulbs don't\nchange color, but they do offer adjustable color temperature for less than the\nLIFX White 800 bulbs. There many other products in the Lightify lineup,\nincluding a recessed LED light, a color-changing lightstrip, and an outdoor\nlighting kit, but it's unclear if they all work with Alexa.Regardless, all of\nthese products will need to connect to Alexa through a SmartThings or Wink\nhub.TCP Connected bulbs are far from the best solution on the market. They\nrequire their own additional hub and offer lackluster performance. But they do\nalso work with Alexa if you connect them to a SmartThings or Wink hub.In some\nrespects this an extension of lighting, but there's much more that you can\ncontrol with smart switches, plugs, and outlets. From ceiling fans to garbage\ndisposals, there are plenty of things you can make \"smart\" with a switch or\noutlet. And if you use the products below, you'll be able to control those\ndevices with Alexa, too.If you want a simple on/off switch that will work with\nAlexa, the WeMo Light Switch is worth considering. Unlike competing switches\nthat use different wireless protocols, this switch works over WiFi, making it\neasy to connect to Alexa without the need for a hub.The WeMo Switch's name is\na little deceiving: This is a smart plug, not a light switch. It's just called\na switch because you can toggle plug-in appliances and lights on and off with\na physical power button or smartphone app. It also works over WiFi, making it\neasy to control with Alexa.The Insight Switch includes all of the same\nfeatures as the regular WeMo Switch, but adds in the ability to monitor the\nenergy usage of whatever device is plugged into it. It's a nifty feature for\njust $10 more than the Wemo Switch, but it's doubtful you can ask Alexa how\nmuch energy your coffee maker is using.Similar to Belkin's Wemo switches, the\niHome Smart Plug allows you to remotely turn devices and lights on and off. It\nalso works with Apple HomeKit (giving it Siri support), Nest, and Wink. Even\nthough it uses WiFi, it will only work with Alexa when connected through a\nWink hub.SmartThings was making its own outlet long before Samsung acquired\nthe startup, and still makes it to this very day. It works over ZigBee instead\nof WiFi, meaning it will require a SmartThings hub if you want to control it\nwith Alexa.TP-Link's HS100 is another WiFi smart plug that connects directly\nto Alexa, bypassing the need for a hub.TP-Link's HS110 is very similar to\nBelkin's Wemo Insight Switch, packaging energy monitoring into a smart plug\nthat connects to your phone and Alexa over WiFi.Unlike other DIY smart home\nsystems, Insteon itself makes the majority of its compatible devices,\nincluding dimmers, switches, outlets, and plugs. Thanks to Insteon's Echo\nintegration, all of these switch-based devices can be controlled with Alexa.GE\nmight be getting out of the appliance business, but the company sells plenty\nof smart switches, dimmers, and outlets/plugs. Amazon doesn't specifically\nnote that these products work with Alexa, but they are compatible with the\nSmartThings hub, meaning they should work with Alexa just fine.Just like GE,\nLeviton makes smart switches, dimmers, and outlets that can be controlled with\nAlexa via a SmartThings or Wink hub.Lutron is arguably the biggest name when\nit comes to switches, dimmers, and outlets. The company uses its own\nproprietary wireless system called Lutron ClearConnect, which means these\ndevices will only connect to the Wink hub. Despite the proprietary system,\nWink states that Lutron products will work with Alexa.Enerwave is not nearly\nas well-known as Lutron, GE, or Leviton, but the company's Z-Wave products do\nwork with the SmartThings hub. While not explicitly stated as compatible,\nEnerwave switches, dimmers, and outlets should work with Alexa.Like Enerwave,\nEvolve is not well-known, but the company's switches, dimmers, and outlets are\ncompatible with SmartThings, which means they should also work with\nAlexa.Amazon recently expanded Alexa's capabilities, adding support for\nthermostats. Thanks to the Alexa Skills Kit, you can now control the\ntemperature of your home, as well as a few heating and cooling extras.Until\nvery recently, this was undoubtedly one of the most sought-after Alexa\nintegrations, spawning numerous IFTTT integrations. For the past few months,\nyou could only control the Next Thermostat through IFTTT or the Wink hub, but\nnow it has been integrated directly with Alexa.Not one to let startups steal\nits thunder, long-time thermostat maker Honeywell created its own take on the\nNest concept called the Honeywell Lyric Thermostat. The latest version works\nwith Apple HomeKit and now Alexa, thanks to the company's integration with\nSmartThings.The Ecobee3 was the first smart thermostat to integrate directly\nwith Alexa, without the need for a hub. It was also one of the first\nthermostats to support Apple HomeKit.The Sensi is a less well-known smart\nthermostat from Emerson, which makes it somewhat suprising that it's the\nsecond thermostat to integrate directly with Alexa. The Sensi doesn't have a\nfancy color screen or an unusual design, but it packs scheduling smarts and\ninternet connectivity into a relatively affordable package.This April, Alexa\nwill be able to control Haiku Home ceiling fans, with the ability to adjust\nthe lights and fan speed. All Haiku fans with the company's SenseMe\ntechnology, including its H, I, and L Series fans, will work with this new\nintegration.The Echo and Alexa are quickly conquering the home, and with new\nintegrations like Ford Sync they're also popping up in our cars and garages.\nThere aren't many compatible devices on the market just yet, but it's only a\nmatter of time until more are released.The Automatic is a small device that\nconnects to your car's diagnostic port and beams driving data like fuel level,\ncheck engine light codes, and more to your smartphone via Bluetooth. With the\ncompany's Alexa integration, you can ask Alexa how much fuel you have, where\nyou last parked, and even how much you drove over a given time period.Garageio\nis a small, WiFi-enabled device that you can connect to up to three garage\ndoors (depending on the model you buy) to remotely open and close them from\nyour phone. With the Amazon Echo and similar devices, you can open and close\nyour garage doors simply by asking asking Alexa.In addition to all the devices\nthat you can control with Alexa, there are plenty of services you can interact\nwith. You can ask Alexa to order you a pizza from Domino's, hail an Uber,\ncheck your bank account balance at Capital One, and much more.IFTTT (short for\nIf This, Then That) is perhaps the most powerful service you can connect to\nyour Amazon Echo. It's an endlessly flexible middle man that helps Alexa\nconnect to tons of other products and services that don't yet have official\nAlexa integrations. There are IFTTT \"recipes\" for Logitech Harmony Home\nControl, Honeywell Total Connect Comfort thermostats, Xfinity set-top boxes,\nHP printers, and much, much more.With Spotify's Amazon Echo integration, you\ncan play and control your Spotify music with your voice. (Assuming Alexa can\nhear you over the bass drops in the latest Skrillex track, anyway.)The first\nbanking service to integrate with Alexa, Capital One Bank allows you to ask\nthe assistant to make bill payments, check your account balance, and track\nyour spending.With Alexa's Uber integration, you can hail any type of Uber\nwith your voice. You can also check how far away your Uber is and even cancel\nthe ride.The fast pizza chain has always dabbled in new technology, from its\nonline pizza tracker to its order via pizza emoji option. With its new Alexa\nintegration, you can order a pizza from the couch without ever touching your\nphone.Considering the Amazon Echo's built-in Bluetooth speaker, music service\nintegrations are a must. With Pandora integration, Alexa can now play your\nfavorite internet radio stations.Want to listen to your favorite local radio\nstations on the Echo? Then you'll want to activate the iHeartRadio\nintegration.TuneIn is very similar to iHeartRadio, allowing you to play local\nstations from across the country. The key difference is that TuneIn also\noffers news, sports, and talk radio. That means with Alexa, you can listen to\nCNN, NPR, ESPN Radio, and more.Included with an Amazon Prime account, Prime\nMusic gives you free access to thousands of older songs. And since it's an\nAmazon product, it only makes sense to be able to use it with the company's\nvirtual assistant.There are a few products that work with the Amazon Echo and\nAlexa but don't fit neatly into any of the above categories. As more products\nbuild integrations, we'll be sure to break them out into separate\nsections.Want Alexa to help you stay healthy? With the Fitbit integration, you\ncan ask your virtual assistant how many steps you've walked, how many calories\nyou've burned, how well you slept, and much more. Is it that much easier than\npushing a button on the wristband or looking at an app? Nah, but it sure is\ncool.The first sprinkler system controller to integrate with Alexa, Rachio\nwill let the assistant control sprinkler zones and manage weather delays,\nmaking it easy to shut off your sprinklers if there's a sudden summer\nthunderstorm.While not the only security-related system on this list, Scout\nAlarm is the only _pure_ security system that connects to Alexa. The company\noffers a wealth of Alexa commands, including the ability to arm/disarm your\nsystem and call for help.In perhaps one of the most innovative Alexa\nintegrations, you can place calls with Alexa via an Ooma Telo internet-\nconnected landline phone. You might scoff at the idea of using a landline, let\nalone connecting Alexa to one, but the Telo isn't really a \"landline.\"\nInstead, it places calls over the internet and offers nationwide calling for\nfree, which makes it a pretty compelling option if you still want a home\nphone.\n\n","title":"\n      Everything That Works With Amazon Echo and Alexa - Reviewed.com Smart Home\n  ","twitter":{"body":".@revieweddotcom offers a comprehensive list of everything that works with Amazon Echo and Alexa. https://t.co/Nb2kHjV9Gz","date":"Sat Apr 02 13:20:27 +0000 2016","favs":19,"id":{"$numberLong":"716253964950441984"},"retweets":22},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://bit.ly/1q3hQ6T"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e69"},"content":"NASHVILLE — What started as a two-employee company to reissue White Stripes\nback catalog has grown into one of the most innovative record labels going. In\nthe past seven years, Third Man Records has developed a roster of artists\nbeyond Jack White, released 350 titles and pressed some 2 million pieces of\nvinyl. Many of the records are unique (embedded holograms, flexi-discs pressed\non X-Ray film), and the company also operates two retail stores, here and in\nWhite's hometown of Detroit, both with \"novelties\" and impressive performance\nspaces.\"We like to say we're creating things that don't exist,\" said Ben\nBlackwell, who helps run the Third Man operation for his uncle Jack. \"So you\ncreate this scenario that doesn't exist anywhere else, and that gets you to an\nend product, a piece of art or a recording, whatever you want to call it, that\nwouldn't have happened otherwise.\"Blackwell was speaking of the so-retro-it's\n-beyond-cool direct-to-acetate recording system at Third Man, through which\nmusicians in the performance space can cut live songs direct to a record. It's\nthe height of mid-'50s technology, but the old-school tech, which doesn't\nallow for any do-overs or edits, is exciting today, Blackwell said.\"It gets\nbands a little bit on edge,\" he said.Ben Blackwell, in his office at Third Man\nRecords in Nashville. (Photo: Jim Lenahan, USA TODAY)Recently, the co-hosts of\nUSA TODAY's _Dad Rock_ podcast visited Third Man Records. Blackwell provided a\npersonal tour, first of the store, which is open to the public, then behind\nthe scenes in the record label offices, where no cameras are allowed. The\nfront of store is an attraction full of musical wonders, including a restored\n1947 phonobooth, where customers can cut a rudimentary record for $20, and an\nantique video jukebox that utilizes 16mm film.Behind the scenes, just as much\ncare is given to the look and feel of the place, even though few people see\nthe shipping department and graphic design studio and other operations.\nThere's a blast furnace converted into an elevator, old lighted motel signs,\ntaxidermy and a high-gloss yellow floor (all employees must wear yellow and\nblack, the official colors of Third Man, in the same way that the White\nStripes were always outfitted in red, black and white). There's even dozens of\nlimited-edition colored vinyl embedded into outdoor patio grout. \"It's\nprobably about $2,000 to $3,000 worth of vinyl, on the collectors market,\ncompletely unsalvageable, to just (mess) with record collectors,\" Blackwell\nsaid.It's all a bit Willy Wonka-esque, which shouldn't surprise fans of\nWhite.\"I've oftentimes said that the staff of Third Man Records is perpetually\ntrying to keep up with the ideas and the imagination of Jack White,\" Blackwell\nsaid.And Blackwell — a musician himself who ran his own small label, Cass\nRecords, before joining Third Man — is still a bit amazed at what they have\nbuilt.\"I expected after six months that Jack was going to come into my office\nand say, 'Hey man, we just lost a ... ton of money. You need to move back to\nDetroit.

And no, the Democrats don't seem to have\nsenses of humor.It's your weekly roundup of For the Record, peeps. Let's do\nthis.We know, it's been so long since last Saturday, when the fates of more\nDemocratic delegates were decided. A quick recap:That's right: Sanders swept\nlast week's Democratic contests, and his camp says this is the momentum he\nneeds to make a grab at the nomination. Never mind that they haven't said\nexactly when Sanders would theoretically overtake Hillary Clinton in the\ndelegate count. Reminder: Clinton is still ahead of Sanders by 701 delegates\n(1,712 vs. 1,011, to be exact). Despite what the Bern-ers say, the Clinton\ncamp thinks Hill will lock up the nomination on April 26, when Pennsylvania\nand four other states vote.We find that listing his deeds of the week is\neasier if done in chronological order. Otherwise, it just gets confusing.Or\nperhaps he never really went away? However you look at it, there's no denying\nthat Rubio's plan is interesting. He won 172 candidates during his now-\nsuspended campaign, and he wants to keep 'em, goshdarnit. Why? To stop Trump\nfrom amassing the 1,237 delegates needed to win the GOP nomination outright,\nof course. Maybe this was Rubio's plan all along. Or maybe he still wants to\nbe an option during that mythical contested convention. If ever there was a\nyear for crazy, unprecedented things to happen, this is it.Did you know that\nthere was an election-related thing happening in North Dakota this weekend?\nNeither did we, so thank god for the presidential primary calendar.\nRepublicans in the state are selecting their 25 convention delegates. Here's\nthe fascinating part: They aren't bound to anyone. Instead, they, along with\nthree state officials who already have spots, get to pick whomever they'd like\nwhen they arrive in glorious Cleveland come July. They don't have to say who\nthey're supporting ahead of time, either. How did the campaigns dealing with\nthis? By recruiting people to run for these elusive delegate spots.That's a\nwrap for the week.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e6c"},"content":"HERSHEY, Pa. — Republican John Kasich kicked off the presidential primary\nseason in Pennsylvania with a town hall meeting here Friday morning.The Ohio\ngovernor, who later in the day spoke at the Pennsylvania Leadership Conference\nin Harrisburg, is the first candidate from either party to visit the area in\nadvance of the April 26 primary election. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz spoke at the\nHarrisburg conference later Friday.Kasich, a Pennsylvania native, was greeted\nby about 600 people at the Antique Automobile Club of America Museum,\naccording to a museum official.After telling some stories about growing up in\nthe coal town of McKees Rock near Pittsburgh, Kasich’s tone grew more serious\nas he spoke about a number of the nation’s challenges and hit common\nRepublican themes, such as lower taxes and less government regulation to\nstimulate small businesses and job growth.Speaking about the threat of\nterrorism abroad, Kasich said defeating Islamic State, also known as ISIL or\nISIS, would require the U.S. to build a coalition of Islamic Arab nations with\nEuropean cooperation.\"We need to have them in the coalition, because we don't\nwant just us going to destroy ISIS,\" he said. \"And we need to go in the air\nand on the ground and we need to destroy ISIS. That would be the biggest blow\nthat we could do to these crazy people, these murderers.\"One of the few times\nKasich referred to his Republican opponents, Cruz and businessman Donald\nTrump, was in regard to the treatment of Muslims in this country. Contrary to\nTrump, who has called for banning the entry of Muslim refugees, except if they\nare wealthy, and Cruz, who has advocated for patrolling Muslim neighborhoods,\nKasich said he favors an inclusive approach.\"If you want to find out what is\nhappening in the Muslim community and who is being radicalized, who do you\nthink you ask? Do you ask you?\" he said pointing to the crowd. \"Or do you ask\nsomeone who lives in the Muslim community.\"Ohio Governor and Republican\nPresidential candidate John Kasich speaks at a town hall event at the Antique\nAutomobile Club of America Museum in Hershey on Friday, April 1, 2016. Kasich\nsaid is the only Republican capable of beating Democratic front runner Hillary\nClinton, (Photo: Jeremy Long, Lebanon Daily News)Kasich trails both Trump and\nCruz in the delegate count and faces an uphill climb to win the GOP\nnomination, but he confidently predicted that none of the three remaining\nRepublican candidates will have the required 1,273 delegates to win the\nnomination, which would lead to a brokered convention in Cleveland this\nsummer.\"It's going to be really, really, really cool,\" he said.Kasich drew\nsome of his loudest applause when he said he is the only Republican capable of\nbeating Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, a statement supported by\nseveral recent polls.\"I'm the only one who consistently beats Hillary Clinton\nbecause I can get crossover votes,\" he said.Kasich also said he would be able\nto unify a divided Congress and fractured nation.\"We can fix these problems,\nbut there is one thing that we have to remember. We may be Republicans and we\nmay be Democrats, but when I grew up, and even now in my lifetime, we are\nAmericans before anything else,\" he said.Kasich was introduced by Rep. Charlie\nDent, whose district includes Hershey and parts of Lebanon County. Dent, who\nendorsed Kasich about a month ago and helped arrange the event, called him “a\ncommon sense conservative.”“I think that we are going to find that John Kasich\nis our favorite son,” Dent said. “He will be the first president from\nPennsylvania since James Buchanan. Except, unlike Buchanan, he’ll really be a\ngood president.”Nick Aragon of Palmyra, who came to the town hall with his\nwife, Elisabeth, and their 3-month old son, Alexander, said he was pleased\nwith Kasich's performance.“I think the town hall style really fits him well\nbecause he is folksy and he likes connecting with the people. I think this was\na great opportunity to showcase that,” Aragon said.Some who came to the town\nhall said they see Kasich as a better alternative to Trump and Cruz.“He’s not\nDonald Trump, Ted Cruz or Hillary Clinton,” said Andy Ruggiero of Hummelstown,\nwho initially supported former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and then\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio before settling for Kasich.Elliott Weinstein, a\nRealtor from York County, said he is in Kasich's camp for the same reason.“We\nhave to stop the insanity,” Weinstein said. “I might not agree with everything\nhe says, but at least he is normal.”\n\n","title":"Kasich campaigns in native Pennsylvania","twitter":{"body":"Kasich campaigns in native Pennsylvania https://t.co/BRMlWqLE0s","date":"Sat Apr 02 10:05:04 +0000 2016","favs":28,"id":{"$numberLong":"716204796135522304"},"retweets":10},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MIc7NM"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e6d"},"content":"HENDERSONVILLE, Tenn. — It’s been 10 years since the sky opened up, swooped\ndown in a swirl of fury and nearly ended Amy Hawkins’ vibrant life.And yet,\neven from the confines of a wheelchair she hopes one day to leave behind, the\nHendersonville mother who shielded her sons from a tornado on April 7, 2006,\nstill has no regrets.She also doesn’t spend a lot of time feeling sorry for\nherself.“I’ve never asked why,” she said. “I’m here. I saved the boys. If it\nmeant that I died then so be it.”Why she is paralyzed from the waist down — a\nmaze of rods winding through her back — matters less than having an earlier,\nmore important prayer answered.“For three generations in my family, a parent\nhas died,” said Hawkins who lost a stepfather who helped raise her just before\nher 12th birthday.“So I asked God while I was young to never take me away from\nmy kids. He didn’t take me away, so that’s why I don’t ask why.”**‘I KNOW IT’S\nHERE. GOTTA GO’**At first, Hawkins had little memory of that day. Through the\nyears, the events have come back to her in a patchwork of recollections,\nstories told to her by others and even dreams of that day.She had picked up 6\n-year-old son Jair from kindergarten and taken him and his brother Cole, 3, to\nget pizza. Her husband Jerrod, a firefighter in Brentwood, called to let her\nknow that strong storms were headed her way.Once home, she heeded the warnings\non television and headed to the basement.“I know it’s here. Gotta go,” she\ntold Jerrod before dropping the phone. He didn’t hear anything from anyone for\n45 minutes.Hawkins says she remembers lying on top of the boys reciting the\nLord’s Prayer.“Through dreams I remember the last brick that hit me,” she\nsays.Jair and Cole, now 16 and 13, have their own bare memories.“I remember my\nmom opened up the door… and seeing a cloud coming at us,” said Cole who closed\nhis eyes and woke up to “bricks everywhere.”While a neighbor rushed the boys\nto nearby Hendersonville Medical Center, Hawkins’ twisted and crumpled body\nrequired more care.Sumner County sheriff’s Deputy Tim Sebring was the first\nresponder on the scene.“The whole house, it was just gone,” recalls Sebring.\n“I noticed a female all mauled up underneath some bricks.”Sebring said Hawkins\nwas making noises and trying to move, but he knew how important it was for her\nto stay put until EMS arrived.“I just grabbed her neck and held her there,” he\nsaid. “I just kept talking to her and praying over her. It seemed forever\nuntil EMS got there.”Hawkins was treated first at Vanderbilt University\nMedical Center and then the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, a rehabilitation\ncenter for those with brain and spinal cord injuries.**A NEW HOME**Her story\nof heroism and survival made international news after parents on her son’s\nbaseball team started a petition for the television show _Extreme Makeover:\nHome Edition_ to replace the family’s destroyed home.In four days in August of\nthat year, more than 2,000 community volunteers helped build the new home in\nHendersonville. The show aired nationally and in Europe. Hawkins says the\nshow’s producers told her their episode was “Europe’s favorite.” Interviews\nfor publications in England and Germany followed.For the one-year anniversary\nof the devastating twister, the family appeared on the _Oprah Winfrey Show\n_where the young mother was again hailed as a hero.Amy Hawkins makes herself\ncoffee in her home that was built by Extreme Makeover TV show which built it\nto accommodate her wheelchair. Hawkins was paralyzed trying to save her two\nsons following a 2006 Sumner County tornado, The family was featured on\nExtreme Makeover and will soon be moving out of the home . (Photo: Shelley\nMays / The Tennessean)Her story continues to inspire.In December 2014, Hawkins\nunderwent spinal surgery on the television show _The Doctors _to relieve\nunrelenting back pain that required fog-inducing medications.Now 44, Hawkins\nsays the surgery, in which the surgeon inserted “titanium rods that look like\ntrain tracks back there,” has taken away about 90% of her back pain.It has\nalso, she believes, brought her closer to walking again. Over the years she\nhas gained more feeling in her legs and feet, she says, and is cautiously\noptimistic that she’ll one day be able to leave her wheelchair behind.For the\nmoment though, the family has undergone another milestone recently by moving\nout of the house a community helped build for them.**MOVING ON**The family\nrecently purchased a 31-acre farm in Portland and plans to first move into an\napartment and then build a home.Amy admits she has mixed feelings about\nleaving the home, but is glad to pass it on to another family with young\nkids.Ten years after saving her sons, Jair,left, and Cole from a tornado that\ndestroyed their Hendersonville home, Amy Hawkins and her family reflect on the\nday that changed their lives.

There are ways you can keep the speed up on an old computer \\- but\neventually, the hardware is going to get too outdated to run the latest\nsoftware you need.In the past, that's the point where you'd just go buy a new\ncomputer; I've talked before about how to know you've reached that point.\nHowever, it's now become easier to give your old computer a second lease on\nlife, or it into a usable computer for a friend or relative. All you need is\none simple thing.I'm talking about the operating system. And, I don't just\nmean that you should upgrade to Windows 10. While Windows 10 does run a lot\nbetter than past versions of Windows on low-powered hardware, it doesn't play\nnicely with your old hardware. To avoid this problem, you'll need to update to\nan operating system that isn't Windows.Many people like using Linux for this\npurpose. Linux is a free, secure operating system that comes in a lot of\nversions, from full Windows replacements to tiny versions that can run a $35\nRaspberry Pi computer. Linux Mint running the MATE desktop and elementary OS\nare two consumer-friendly options you can check out that work well on older\nhardware.While these are powerful Windows replacements, there is a simpler\noption. Over the last few years, you've probably heard about Chromebooks.\nThese are sub-$250 laptops that run Google's Chrome OS, which is an operating\nsystem version of Google's popular Chrome browser.An operating system like\nthis has a number of advantages, such as running very well on low-powered\nhardware. It has the same strong security as Chrome, and gets regular updates\nwith performance and security fixes.In addition, Chrome OS works a lot like\nWindows with a start button, taskbar and apps, so you can pick it up quickly.\nMost of the time, it's as easy to use as a standard Web browser. Plus, it can\ndo many of the same things other operating systems can do, like video chat,\nplay music, print documents and play games.The Chrome OS programs are actually\nWeb apps it runs from the cloud, and many of them are free. This also means\nthat it stores your files online so you can access them anywhere on any\ngadget. If one of your Chrome OS computers crashes, you can log in on any\nother Chrome OS gadget and have your entire computer ready to go just the way\nyou want it.In the past, to get Chrome OS you'd need to shell out a few\nhundred dollars for a Chromebook or a Chrome OS-based desktop. That isn't the\ncase anymore.A company called Neverware has an operating system called\nCloudReady, which is a version of Chrome OS that works on a wide range of\nlaptops and desktops, including Apple hardware. The best part for you is that\nit's free for home use (there's also a paid educational version that's great\nfor school environments).Installing a new operating system on a computer is\nalways a little tricky, but Neverware has extensive step-by-step directions on\nits site. It has also tested CloudReady on each of its \"certified hardware\nmodels\" so it knows what features do and don't work correctly.You can check\nthe list of certified hardware models to see if your laptop or desktop\nqualifies and how well CloudReady will work. Even if your model isn't on the\nlist, you can install the OS anyway and see what happens. Many people have\nfound it works just fine.In general, CloudReady runs on laptops and desktops\nmade in 2007 or newer, and Netbooks from 2009 and on. It needs at least 1GB of\nRAM to run smoothly, but because it relies a lot on cloud storage and Web\napps, it only needs 8GB of storage space.On some computers, you can dual-boot\nCloudReady and Windows if you don't want to give up Windows entirely. As\nalways, be sure your information is backed up in case something goes wrong\nduring the installation.If you're installing CloudReady on your main computer,\nyou can back up your files by moving them to Google Drive. You can also move\nyour photos to Google Photos and upload your music to Google Music. By doing\nthis, they'll all be there when you install and sign in to CloudReady.\nCloudReady also supports other cloud services like Dropbox if you'd prefer to\nuse a non-Google product.Of course, some people want to stick with Windows. If\nthat's the case for you personally, then it's probably time to start looking\nfor a new computer. The process can feel daunting, but it won't be if as long\nas you know what to look for. Or, you might decide you don't need a computer\nat all.

They don’t have room for me.\nThat happens in life.”Officials for Heller’s landlord, Deep Canyon Desert LLC,\nsaid they wanted her evicted because her apartment was kept in “deplorable\nconditions” and that Heller often had loud, disruptive arguments with her\ndaughter. The company had threatened to evict her twice before but nothing\nimproved, so representatives followed through this time.The apartment complex\nmanager, Melody Morrison, told the judge that Heller kept the apartment in\n\"deplorable conditions.\" A _Desert Sun_ reporter who visited the apartment\nFriday afternoon found the carpet dirty and the living room cluttered with\nboxes and stacks of magazines but far from the point of hoarding.After court,\nMorrison declined to comment then walked briskly away from a reporter to avoid\nquestions. The company’s lawyer, eviction specialist William Windham, said his\nclient did not want to evict Heller but felt it was a reality of the\nbusiness.Windham said he felt conflicted, too.“I’ve evicted people off of\ntheir death beds and regretted every second of the trial,” Windham said. “But\nmy job is unfortunately to set my feeling aside and do what my clients ask me\nto do.“It would be same if this was a lady who was 30 years old and had five\nchildren or a little old man with cancer,” he said. “If you have a commotion\nbeing caused on the property, and the people won’t stop, you have no choice\nbut to take action.”In this case, that action came in the form of an “unlawful\ndetainer,” which is a mundane court filing in which a landlord asks a judge to\nforce a tenant from a property. Cases like these are rarely worthy of media\nattention, but the trial Friday was a strange one.Heller defended herself\ndespite the fact that she could barely see or hear. After she took an oath to\ntell the truth, she kept her hand raised and did a brief hula dance then\nlaughed under her breath.Her eyesight was too poor to read court documents\nuntil someone volunteered a pair of eye glasses from the courtroom\naudience.And finally, when it came time for arguments, Heller refused to stay\nat the defendant’s table and instead hovered on the edge of the judge’s bench,\nunwilling to sit. For most defendants, this would result in a firm response\nfrom the bailiffs — including possible arrest — but as Heller pleaded with the\njudge, barely out of arm’s reach, deputies stood back and watched, uncertain\nhow to react.This leniency appeared to be a sign of sympathy, but in the end\nit didn’t matter. Riverside County Judge Charles Haines ruled against Heller\nwithout any deliberation.He issued his judgment in a low, hushed tone that she\ncouldn’t hear.Outside the courtroom, a deputy had to explain to her that she\nhad lost.“What? What kind of ridiculous thing is that?” she snapped, as the\nreality of the ruling set in. “But I don’t have any money.”_Follow Brett\nKelman on Twitter: @TDSbrettkelman_\n\n","title":"100-year-old woman booted from her Calif. home","twitter":{"body":"100-year-old woman booted from her California home https://t.co/EpLJIOWHBr","date":"Sat Apr 02 06:55:04 +0000 2016","favs":40,"id":{"$numberLong":"716156982571495424"},"retweets":73},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MIciZt"}

A hostage negotiator said that Haynie appeared to be intoxicated,\naccording to court documents made available Friday.Shortly after 8 p.m., he\nwas removed from his apartment and taken to the Las Cruces Police Department\nfor questioning. Haynie told officers that he “blacked out” and could not\nremember what happened but also told them he had had only had two beers,\npolice said.Inside the apartment, officers found a 0.22-caliber revolver and\nblood. Haynie was booked into Doña Ana County Detention Center on a charge of\nfirst-degree attempted murder, which carries a maximum sentence of up to nine\nyears in prison and up to $10,000 in fines.Before 11 a.m. Friday, the victim\nalready had undergone surgery, according to his daughter.“He’s had surgery and\nthere was organ damage, but he’s doing fine,” Kendrah Vallee said. “The family\nis with him currently, and we are asking for privacy.”Vallee said her father\nwould be hospitalized for at least 48 hours.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e71"},"content":"SHEBOYGAN, Wis. — Democratic hopeful Bernie Sanders came out swinging at rival\nHillary Clinton and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker on Friday in a wide-ranging\nspeech in Sheboygan, where he urged his supporters to push a \"political\nrevolution\" beyond the presidential campaign.The independent Vermont Senator,\nwho spoke for about an hour to a crowd of 2,000 at a Sheboygan high school,\ndrew a clear dividing line between himself and Clinton, the former secretary\nof state who leads the delegate count in the Democratic contest.Sanders\nreferenced a video posted Thursday in which Clinton argued she was \"sick\" of\nhis campaign for \"lying\" about her ties to the fossil fuel industry, saying\nshe hasn't taken money from the industry during her campaign.Sanders countered\nthat records cited by Greenpeace showed she'd received $4.5 million in\ncontributions — either through her campaign or her SuperPAC — from lobbyists\nfor the fossil-fuel industry.\"These are not just workers, these are paid,\nregistered lobbyists,\" Sanders said. \"Secretary Clinton, you owe our campaign\nan apology. We were telling the truth.”A statement from Clinton's\ncommunications director released after the speech made it clear that she would\ndo no such thing.\"It's disappointing that they've doubled down on negative\ncharacter attacks that deliberately mislead voters rather than debate the\nissues,\" the statement read. \"Their latest attack over campaign contributions\nignores their own donations from individuals who work for oil and gas\ncompanies, and most importantly it ignores Hillary Clinton's record and\nagenda.\"Later Friday Sanders spoke in Green Bay, attributing his campaign’s\nmomentum to the broad coalition behind him. He told about 2,000 people at the\nKress Events Center on the UW-Green Bay campus that if they stay energetic and\nengaged, he can defeat Clinton in the Wisconsin primary Tuesday and continue\nbattling for the Democratic presidential nomination.Democratic presidential\ncandidate Bernie Sanders waves to the crowd before speaking during his\ncampaign stop Friday at the Kress Events Center at UWGB. (Photo: Evan\nSiegle/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)“With your help, we’re going to win\nWisconsin,” Sanders said. “We cannot go forward as a nation unless we have the\ncourage to put the real issues out there on the table, dissect them, solve\nthem and go forward.”Before he took the stage, Sanders said, he met with\nleaders of several local Native American tribes and pledged to reset the\nnation’s relationship with tribes. He noted unemployment and poverty are very\nhigh among Native Americans and access to health care and education is\npoor.“Before we became a nation, when the first settlers came here, the Native\nAmerican community was lied to, was cheated and treaties that were negotiated\nwere abrogated,” Sanders said. “The truth is the relationship of the United\nStates government to the native people of this country is nothing less than\nshameful. … All I can say is if elected president of the United States, our\ngovernment will establish a new relationship with the Native American\ncommunities.”in Sheboygan, Sanders continued to hammer Clinton's record on\nforeign policy, pointing to her vote to authorize the war in Iraq as one of\nthe largest blunders in American foreign policy. In contrast to some other\npoints Sanders made throughout his speech, this comment received only\nscattered applause.Sanders also took specific aim at Walker, the Republican\ngovernor, for what he said was not properly funding education, pushing anti-\nunion legislation and promoting voter ID requirements in the state. The April\nprimary vote will be one of the biggest tests of voter ID on a statewide level\nsince it was fully implemented.“I say to Scott Walker and other governors\naround the country: If you are afraid of free and fair open elections, get out\nof politics,” Sanders said.Sanders arrived to the cheers of supporters and one\nperson who shouted out that they loved the Vermont Senator, to which he\nresponded: \"You know what, I love you, too.”“It is time to not only elect a\nnew president but to transform our country,” Sanders said after taking the\nstage.Sanders spent a good deal of his speech emphasizing the need to\neliminate income inequality in the United States, saying ordinary Americans\nare being undermined by a \"rigged economy\" that abandons the middle class. He\nhas advocated a $15 minimum wage as part of that plan.He also spent time\nblasting the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, which struck down\ncampaign spending limits on corporations, saying it's opened the door to\n\"billionaires buying elections.\"Later, he outlined his plan to offer free\ncollege tuition at public universities,.He proposed funding that plan by\nimplementing a tax on financial transactions that he said would target \"Wall\nStreet speculation.\"But the one line that got some of the loudest applause of\nthe afternoon was an attack on Republicans regarding their stance on gay\nmarriage.\"When they talk about family values they are talking about making it\nimpossible for our gay brothers and sisters to get married. I disagree,”\nSanders said.Sanders closed the event by saying that income inequality, health\ncare, tuition and other issues that he's made central to his campaign are the\ndefining challenges of our time.\"I believe that today we are in a pivotal\nmoment in American history,\" he said. \"These are the issues that people are\nnow thinking about, and what people are saying is, 'enough is\nenough.'\"Supporters began lining up as early as 8 a.m. for a chance to hear\nSanders speak.JoAnn Masche-Daane, of Beaver Dam, was second in line. She said\nshe'd been apathetic about politics before Sanders got her attention with his\nhonesty about the issues facing this country.\"He really woke me up ... when he\nstarted talking about stuff and about what's really going on in this country,\"\nshe said.Hazel Dulmes, a Sheboygan native and freshman at UW-Madison, said\nshe's supporting Sanders over Clinton because she views Sanders as more\ntrustworthy. She also favors his proposals to provide free public college\ntuition and to legalize marijuana.\"I think he's been consistent throughout his\npolitical career,\" she said.The independent Vermont Senator is the first\npresidential candidate on either side to visit Sheboygan in advance of\nWisconsin’s April 5 primary and is looking for supporters to help deliver a\nbig win, with 86 delegates at stake._Contributing: Jeff Bollier, Shelby Le Duc\nand Patti Zarling, Green Bay (Wis.)

Several of the terrorists had ties to the\nBrussels community, including Salah Abdeslam, who was captured four months\nlater in Molenbeek, where he grew up.Abdeslam's brother, Ibrahim, who blew\nhimself up in the Paris attacks, also grew up in Molenbeek, as did at least\ntwo of the terrorists in the Brussels attacks.Abdeslam even returned to\nMolenbeek the night of the Paris attacks after he scrapped his suicide vest\nand fled the city.In the neighborhood itself, community leaders have expressed\nfear that its predominantly Muslim young people will fight back if the\nprotesters attempt to mount their demonstration despite the ban.“They don’t\ntrust the police and they aren’t going to take it,” said Fouad Ben Abdelkader,\na teacher in the neighborhood, the Associated Press reported. On Thursday he\njoined a meeting of a couple dozen community leaders and mentors to\nneighborhood youths who feel adrift in mainstream Belgian society.At the\nmeeting, Molenbeek’s youth organizers planned for the worst, expressing doubt\nthat police are prepared for a confrontation and worried that the authorities\nare unwilling to listen to their concerns.“There are some messages that are\nclearly calling for violence against Muslims,\" said Sarah Turine, a Molenbeek\ncouncilwoman who called the meeting in hopes of heading off problems. \"And\nthere have been repercussions on social networks among young people, families,\nsaying we have to get mobilized to defend our little brothers, our sisters,\nour mothers. Seeing that last weekend the police didn’t do their job and\ndidn’t succeed in avoiding clashes, that creates mistrust.”Brussels is still\nreeling from last week's attacks.

Bush. “They are both soccer teams, right? There is\nno significant difference between the soccer games that I can see. If they\nhave met all that and can show their male counterparts do not have\nsubstantially additional duties --- which based on what I’ve seen they don’t\nhave -- it will be difficult for the employer to justify the differential in\npay.”Carli Lloyd, Megan Rapinoe, Rebecca Sauerbrunn, Hope Solo and Alex Morgan\nfiled the complaint with the EEOC on behalf of the entire team on Thursday\nthat alleged that players on the women’s national team make about half of what\ntheir male counterparts earn. Unless it’s dismissed for procedural reasons,\nthe EEOC can take up to 10 months to investigate a claim.“I believe they have\na claim that is certainly worth looking and (the EEOC) should be looking at it\nseriously.,” Castro said. “As an American, I’m extremely proud of this women’s\nteam. In sports, women have traditionally been behind the 8-ball, so to speak.\nIt’s about time that we look at women in sports and we begin to treat them\nwith the same value and equity that they merit.”Castro, currently the chief\ndiversity officer and a vice president at Pennsylvania’s Commonwealth Medical\nCollege, said she feels there's plenty to trigger an investigation.“What the\nplaintiffs need to prove in an equal pay case is that something that they\nappear to have already done: There are males and females working in\nsubstantially equal jobs with the same employer yet they are receiving\ndifferent compensation,\" she said. \"From what has been reported, it seems like\nthe reached that prima facie threshold.”Once the investigation --- if one is\nlaunched by the agency --- is complete and the EEOC finds that U.S. Soccer\nviolated federal law, the agency will attempt to reach a voluntary settlement\nwith the federation. If a settlement can't be reached, the agency or, in some\ninstances, the Department of Justice, would determine whether to file a\nlawsuit.If either the EEOC doesn't find U.S. Soccer broke any laws, the\nplayers could bring a civil suit.

The difference between the candidates falls\nwithin the poll's error margin of ±6.3 percentage points.Hillary Clinton has\nbeen campaigning in Milwaukee and Green Bay ahead of Tuesday's Wisconsin\nprimary. She will be making stops Saturday in Madison and Eau Claire.Bill\nClinton also hit Wisconsin's governor, Scott Walker, during his speech for\nmaking cuts to the University of Wisconsin System budget and for requiring\nidentification for voters.His talk to the crowd of mostly students was policy\nheavy, touching on Hillary Clinton's ideas to reform Wall Street, lower the\ncost of college and diversify the country's energy usage, which he said would\nbring jobs by creating new wind and solar energy infrastructure.Bill Clinton\nalso mentioned his wife's early work before politics, where she went\nundercover for a civil-rights advocate to investigate segregation in Alabama\nschools in the 1970s.\"That was gutsy for 40 years ago,\" he said.Clinton spoke\nhighly of his wife, saying she is the only candidate with good ideas and\nrelevant experience.\"Experience is a dry, old term that old people like and\nyoung people don't,\" he joked to the crowd of mostly students.Minnesota Sen.\nAl Franken, who introduced Bill Clinton at the campus event, said he was not\nconcerned about poll numbers showing Hillary Clinton behind with young people\nin Wisconsin.The Marquette Law School Poll showed Sanders with 83% of the\nsupport from Democrats ages 18 to 29 in Wisconsin.\"As a senator, I’m really\ninteresting in getting things done,\" Franken said. \"I’m not going to break\ndown poll demographics.”Ahead of Bill Clinton's talk, state Rep. Amanda Stuck,\nan Appleton Democrat, spoke of her first time seeing the former president when\nhe campaigned in the 1990s in Wisconsin. She talked about visiting a fourth-\ngrade classroom for the first time as legislator earlier this year and getting\nthis question from a female student: “Can girls be president?”“Come November,\nI hope no little fourth-grade girl has to ask me that question,\" she said.The\nWarch Campus Center, overlooking the Fox River, filled up quickly with\nsupporters after the doors opened at 9:30 a.m. CTThe former president made a\nsurprise stop at Copper Rock Coffee in downtown Appleton before heading to the\nuniversity, chatting with patrons. He told the Lawrence University crowd that\nhe likes to seek out small coffee shops wherever he goes to talk casually with\npeople about issues.Hillary 2016 volunteers had been handing out coffee they\ngot from the campus center cafe to people waiting in line this morning.Those\nat the front, like 58-year-old Suzi Perlewitz — one of a few baby boomers\nqueued up — said she began standing in line at about 6:30 a.m. Perlewitz saw\nHillary Clinton at her Green Bay campaign stop earlier in the week, and\nproudly displayed her \"selfie\" with the candidate.But Friday was about Hillary\nClinton's husband.\"I got to vote for him twice,\" she said, noting she was one\nof the few in line to do so.She was right. Based on those in line, Bill\nClinton would be speaking to a mostly young crowd.Lawrence University students\nAbbi North, Natalie Ortega-Wells and Becca Tapia got in line about 7:30.They\nsaid their professors had encouraged students to come to the event. By Friday,\na majority of students had been to one campaign event or another, North\nsaid.On Tuesday, Democratic challenger Bernie Sanders had a rally at the Fox\nCities Performing Arts Center, and Republican Donald Trump was across the\nstreet Wednesday at the Radisson Paper Valley Hotel.\"A lot of people have gone\nto Sanders,\" North said. \"But this is on our campus.\"_Follow Katherine Lymn\nand Madeleine Behr on Twitter: @kathlymn and @madeleinebehr_\n\n","title":"Bill Clinton rips Trump's plan for a wall","twitter":{"body":"Bill Clinton, stumping for wife Hillary in Wisconsin, rips Trump's plan for a wall. https://t.co/Psf1wT288V","date":"Sat Apr 02 00:55:08 +0000 2016","favs":83,"id":{"$numberLong":"716066401962819584"},"retweets":43},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1Y4t6KF"}

There were sounds of\nguns all over. I was the only person in my room who survived the attack after\nhiding inside a suitcase.\"Musyoka, like many of the other surviving students\nnow attends Moi University in Eldoret in western Kenya. Even though Garissa\nUniversity reopened in January, most non-Muslim students opted to leave: The\nAl Shabab killers targeted Christians in their assault.One year after the\nIslamic militant group Al Shabab mounted one of the most deadly terror attacks\never to happen here, this East African country is still combating extremism,\nand dealing with the aftershocks – while preparing for the next attack.After\nAl Shabab killed 148 students and staff at Garissa University in northern\nKenya on April 2, 2015, many students opted to move out of the region. At the\nsame time, Garissa is building a stronger perimeter wall to safeguard campus\nin the future. And they hold drills — staging mock terrorist attacks — to\nensure preparedness.These drills are controversial, and sometimes, they\nbackfire — rather than following directions, students often run amok. Three\nstudents in recent months died when they thought a real attack was occurring.\nTwo jumped from high windows while a stampede of students crushed another\nstudent.\"When this happens most students think it’s a real attack,\" said\nJoshua Wekesa, a student at Nairobi’s Strathmore University, who was injured\nduring a mock terror drill. \"Most of them are terrified.\"That's because the\nAl-Qaeda-linked group continues to launch fatal attacks along the Somali\nborder and Kenya’s northern coastline before retreating into hideouts in the\nBoni forest, a remote area known for its elephants.The cumulative effect of\nrecent deaths on the coast, the Garissa massacre and the 2013 Westgate Mall\nattack that killed 67 has severely undermined people’s confidence in the\nKenyan government, said Peter Wafula Wekesa, a political scientist at Kenyatta\nUniversity.\"It made Kenyans aware of the folly of the security apparatuses in\nthe country, which are inept, inefficient and reactionary,” Wekesa said. “At\nthe very least, Kenyans are now more alive to the fact that they are on their\nown on matters of security since they can’t trust the government to provide\nthe same.\"Eldoret Police Commissioner Abdi Hassan said he was most hopeful\nabout a nation-wide program to train student leaders to help stop their Muslim\npeers from becoming terrorists.\"We are committed to fighting terrorism by\nensuring that all students in universities are not radicalized by this terror\ngroups,\" Hassan said. \"We are offering lessons to help them reject any attempt\nto be radicalized.\"Still, in spite of the drills, the beefed-up security, and\nde-radicalization programs, Musyoka says she fears that another attack could\nhappen at her new school.\"When I hear a bang or an explosion within the school\ncompound, I panic,\" Musyoka said. \"My heart begins to pound.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e7b"},"content":"Donald J. Trump is probably not going to win Wisconsin and everyone is\nwondering what that means.Is it that having his campaign manager charged with\nbattery against a female reporter, a thing that actually happened this week,\nwas the actual last straw for Trump voters otherwise inured to outrageous\nbehavior by the campaign? Is it that Wisconsin's conservative talk radio\nhosts, in pointed contrast to their nationally syndicated peers, have been\nforceful and unyielding anti-Trump voices? Is it that we polite, reserved\nMidwesterners are just immune to Trump's abrasive style?Who knows. But\nmultiple public opinion polls in the last few days have shown Texas Sen. Ted\nCruz comfortably ahead of the blustering billionaire, set to pick up a bunch\nof delegates in Tuesday's primary. In particular, the data show Trump to be\nespecially unpopular among Republicans in the state's reddest and most\npopulous Republican counties: the crescent of suburbs around Milwaukee. The\nMarquette University Law School poll, which usually gets Wisconsin right,\nshows Trump with only 28 percent support from Republican voters in Milwaukee\nsuburbs.If those numbers hold, Trump is going to lose here. But in true\nTrumpian fashion, he won't lose without doing a bunch of damage to the state's\nRepublican Party infrastructure.That's because Trump's lines of support in\nWisconsin reveal some regional fault lines that ought to be worrying\nRepublicans. In the more rural north and the west of the state, he is winning,\nor at least he _could _win. On CNN on Thursday, Rep. Sean Duffy said he\nsuspects his vast district, which extends from Wausau to Bayfield, will vote\nfor Trump. Duffy earlier in the week told the _Wall Street Journal_ that\n\"There’s a number of people in my district who are quiet Trump supporters.\" A\nprofile in political courage himself, Duffy, who previously endorsed Florida\nSen. Marco Rubio, said he would remain neutral in this primary.As far as\nanyone can tell, Trump's first and only endorsement among Wisconsin state\nlegislators came from James \"Jimmy Boy\" Edming of Glen Flora. Edming, who ran\nfor state Senate in 2010, told the Wausau _Daily Herald_ editorial board back\nthen that his platform was \"garage logic\" and that everything he needed to\nknow about legislating he'd learned from fixing old cars — making him sort of\nthe perfect Trump-supporting politician. This week he told the _Wall Street\nJournal_ not only that he would vote for Trump but also how the GOP's internal\ncivil war is affecting him: \"Now that I’m seeing that the Republicans are\ntrying to tackle Donald Trump,\" he said, \"the more I see on the news, the more\npissed off I get.\"The polls show nothing like this sort of Northwoods-\nvs.-Milwaukee split within Wisconsin's Democratic Party. Hillary Clinton edges\nout Bernie Sanders in Green Bay and suburban Milwaukee; Sanders beats Clinton\nin Madison, obviously, and in the north. But it's not a particularly stark\ndivide, and it doesn't feel like much of a civil war even in comparison to the\n2008 Democratic primary, which at the time felt quite heated but now seems\nlike a bygone era of civility and substance.**POLICING THE USA: A look at\nrace, justice, media**If the polls hold and Cruz wins most of Wisconsin's\ndelegates on Tuesday, that will have serious consequences for the rest of the\nRepublican nomination battle, and will increase the likelihood of a chaotic,\ncontested GOP convention. That's exactly the outcome a lot of Republican\nleaders want, and as a national story it's seen as a sort of comeback by the\nGOP establishment.But the Wisconsin Republican Party still has a lot of voters\nlike Jimmy Boy Edming. And if Trump loses, and especially if he loses at the\nconvention, they are going to see it as a Republicans \"trying to tackle Donald\nTrump.\" In Wisconsin, they'll blame suburban Milwaukee, and they'll be right\nto.

We wish we could have been\nthere.\"About nine years ago, Nick Carter decided he wanted to write a movie,\"\nEstrada told us, saying that eventually his script was able to get into the\nhands of the production company responsible for _Sharknado_. Once the premise\nwas down, all they needed were the boy band-ers.\"They were casting, and\nobviously they were casting for as many other boy band members as they could,\"\nEstrada said. \"And during that time they reached out to the guys in my band\nand I guess they reached out without him necessarily knowing and when he found\nout that I was available to be in it — originally I had a much small role and\nafter I had agreed to do that smaller role I got another call from casting\nsaying ‘Nick has asked if you would be interesting in playing one of the (main\ncharacters).’\"Erik-Michael Estrada as Komodo in 'Dead 7.' (Photo: Raymond Liu,\nThe Asylum/Syfy)When you're a former boy band member, who do you talk to? Who\ndo you reminisce with? Who just _gets_ you? Other former boy band members,\nobviously.\"We’ve all crossed paths in different times over the years, during\nthe heights of our careers. And when we got to all be in the same room\ntogether, we just started telling each other stories,\" Estrada explained.\n\"Stuff we did in the quick change room, after-show parties. It’s interesting\nbecause I think each one of the bands has its own dynamic, but when we’re all\ntogether, it was the first time we had all had people we could talk about that\nwith, that shared that similar experience. I think it was cathartic (for all\nof us). For us to be able to just talk to other people who could really relate\nto us, because we’re a pretty unique fraternity of sorts.\"If they hadn't\nbroken out into song at least once (besides the official track they recorded\nfor the film) we would have been sincerely disappointed. So good thing they\nwent to karaoke to let off some steam.\"There was a couple nights that we did\nkaraoke,\" Estrada said.\"That was fun. I know the production crew got a thick\nout of that. (We sang) _I Want it That Way_, I believe. It was was whatever\nthe karaoke guy had readily available.\"We are really good at singing _I Want\nit That Way_ at karaoke as well. Just for future reference.\"I know everyone\nwould love to do another one,\" he said. \"So we just have to mash our heads\ntogether and we’ll come up with something.\"Maybe a different genre mashup?\nEstrada, for one, had a really brilliant idea when we asked. \"Maybe some type\nof old gangster movie meets vampires?\"We'd watch._Dead 7_ airs on Syfy at 8:00\np.m. ET Friday.\n\n","title":"What happens when 90s boy bands make a zombie movie?

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e7f"},"content":"Is it OK for a cop to lie?A federal appeals court, considering a drug\ntrafficker's conviction in Montana, ruled earlier this week that sometimes it\ndoesn’t matter.Attorneys for Hector Magallon-Lopez argued that crucial\nevidence at the man's 2012 trial — two pounds of methamphetamine seized in a\n2012 search of his car — should have been excluded because the police officer\nlied about why the suspect’s vehicle was being stopped.The officer told\nMagallon-Lopez that he had failed to signal properly before changing lanes, an\nintentional ruse so as not to arouse suspicion about the true nature of the\nstop.The real reason for the stop, according to court records, emerged from a\nSept. 27, 2012, Drug Enforcement Agency wiretap intercept, which indicated\nthat two Hispanic males, one bearing a distinctive arm tattoo depicting a\nghost and skull, would be transporting a supply of methamphetamine from\nWashington state to Minneapolis.According to the intercept, the route would\ntake the two men traveling in \"green, black or white'' car with Washington\nplates through Bozeman, Mont., between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. on Sept. 28.Police\nset up a surveillance operation on the main interstate running through\nBozeman. And around 3 a.m., officers spotted a green Volkwagen Passat with\nWashington plates, registered to Hector Lopez at an address in the Yakima\nValley where, according to the wiretap, the drug shipment was to originate.The\nsighting set in motion the traffic-stop ruse, when officers observed that one\nof the occupants — Magallon-Lopez — sported what appeared to be a ghost or\n\"grim reaper'' on his right forearm, while the other man was identified as\nJuan Sanchez whose name was first disclosed on the wiretap intercept. A\nsubsequent search of the vehicle resulted in the seizure of methamphetamine\nhidden in a compartment under the trunk.\"The details that the officers\nconfirmed before making the stop sufficed to establish reasonable suspicion,''\nJudge Paul Watford of the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals wrote in the\nopinion supporting the officers' action.  \"Green, black or white passenger car\nwith Washington plates? Check. Traveling eastbound through Bozeman, Mont., on\nthe correct date and during the predicted, quite narrow time frame? Check.\nOccupied by two Hispanic males? Check. Registered to an owner who lived in a\ntown associated with the investigation and who, at least in terms of stature,\nfit the description of the person expected to be accompanying Sanchez? Double\ncheck.\"That the officer lied about seeing Magallon-Lopez make an illegal lane\nchange does not call into question the legality of the stop,'' Watford wrote.\n\"The standard for determining whether probable cause or reasonable suspicion\nexists is an objective one; it does not turn either on the subjective thought\nprocesses of the officer or on whether the officer is truthful about the\nreason for the stop.''In a concurring opinion, Judge Marsha Berzon\nacknowledged some distress in reaching the same conclusion.\"Is it fine for\npolice officers flatly to tell the drivers they stop that they observed — or\nthought they observed — a traffic violation when they really did not?'' Berzon\nwrote. \"We hold today that it is. And I cannot disagree, as the line of\n(prior) cases...seems to lead to ineluctably to that distressing\nconclusion...So long as the facts known to the officer establish reasonable\nsuspicion to justify an investigatory stop, the stop is lawful even if the\nofficer falsely cites as the basis for the stop a ground that is not supported\nby reasonable suspicion.''\n\n","title":"Federal court: OK for cops to lie -- sometimes","twitter":{"body":"Federal court: It's OK for cops to lie — sometimes. https://t.co/OKEbguya37","date":"Fri Apr 01 22:45:13 +0000 2016","favs":22,"id":{"$numberLong":"716033707111542785"},"retweets":33},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1N0L6jo"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e84"},"content":"On the first day of the new quarter, the Dow traced out the same pattern it\ntraveled in the first quarter of the year: a big early drop has been followed\nby a rebound rally that has pushed the blue-chip stock gauge to solid gains\nfor the day.Driving the volatile trading today was an early negative reaction\nto tanking Japanese stocks and plunging oil prices. But those negatives were\noffset by a better-than-expected March jobs report in the U.S. and good news\non the domestic manufacturing front, where March data pushed back into\nexpansionary territory after months of suffering through its own private\nrecession. Any signs of a manufacturing bounce back bodes well for the\neconomy.Wall Street earlier today was also trying to interpret what another\nstrong jobs report might mean for the Federal Reserve's interest rate-hike\nplans.After the market's miraculous comeback in the first quarter, when it\nrallied late in the quarter to erase a double-digit percentage decline to\nfinish up close to 1%, U.S. stocks kicked off the new quarter with a similar\ntrading pattern as it confronted a slew of cross currents that are weighing on\ninvestor sentiment.Forty-five minutes after the opening bell on Wall Street,\nthe Dow Jones industrial average, which gained 1.5% in the first quarter and\nwas down 117 points earlier in the session, had erased its gains and turned\npositive. The rally gained steam in the afternoon and the Dow closed the\nsession up 108 points at 17,793 -- a new 2016 high.The Standard \u0026amp; Poor's\n500 index also set a new 2016 high, rising 0.6% to 2073. The Nasdaq composite\nindex gained 0.9% to 4915.For the year, the Dow is now up 2.1% and the S\u0026amp;P\n1.4%. Only the Nasdaq remains in the red for 2016, down 1,9%.Weighing on\nstocks early in the session were many of the same worries that sparked a\ncorrection earlier this year. Losses were again mounting up in the oil patch,\nwhere U.S. produced crude fell 4.3% and ended below the $37 per barrel\nmark.Market turbulence abroad has also been a factor today. Stocks in Japan\nsuffered a major downdraft overnight, tumbling nearly 4% as investors got a\ncase of the jitters after a survey indicating a dip in confidence among\nJapanese businesses.A strengthening dollar, which hurts U.S. multinationals\nand depresses commodities, is also fanning the bearish flames today.Add on\nWall Street trying to figure out what another strong jobs report might mean\nfor Fed monetary policy, and you end up with a confluence of negatives that\nhave given investors reason to sell.But the strong manufacturing report,\ncoupled with good news on jobs, helped offset the negatives.Wall Street\ndigested the release of the March jobs report, which came in solid and a tad\nbetter than expected. The government reported that the U.S. economy created\n215,000 new jobs last month, slightly topping expectations. The unemployment\nrate ticked up to 5%, vs. an estimate of 4.9%. Other plusses in the report:\naverage hourly earnings for workers rose 0.3% and the labor participation rate\nticked up to 63%.The continued strength in the job market suggests the U.S.\neconomy continues to chug along, further reducing fears of a recession.Jim\nPaulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, sums up the\nconfusing cross-currents best.\"The jobs report was 'good,' but not so good\nthat it immediately raises fears that the Fed is behind the curve (and will\nhave to change course and hike rates sooner or more aggressively than\nthought),\" Paulsen says. \"The bottom line: this report will calm recession\nfears and is positive for risk assets.\"But Paulsen does add in a disclaimer of\nsorts, and offers other reasons which might explain the market's wobbly start\nto Friday's session.\"However, the probability of Fed tightening has risen\nagain since this report ..., so worries about the Fed and rate increases are\nalso climbing a bit since the report. I think the stock market is reacting\nthus far to a bad Tanken surveys (on business sentiment) in Japan (where the\nNikkei fell 3% overnight) and to the big drop in the price of oil. These two\nthings are more than offsetting a jobs report, which is kind of neutral, as it\nshows solid economic growth (that will) probably lead to faster Fed\ntightening.\"Paulsen correctly predicted stocks would turn higher as Friday\nmoves on as fears of recession fade further from view.In the just-completed\nfirst quarter, the S\u0026amp;P 500 rose 0.8%, the Nasdaq fell 2.7% and the small-\ncompany Russell 2000 was off 1.9%. Both the Dow and S\u0026amp;P 500 are less than\n3.0% off their record highs from May 2015.The start to the quarter was gloomy\nin foreign stock markets as well. Shares were trading sharply lower in Europe,\nwhere the broad Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 1.6%. In France, the CAC 40\nwas off 1.6% and in Germany, the DAX was off 1.6%.\n\n","title":"Deja vu: Stocks kick off Q2  in the red, then erase losses, turn up","twitter":{"body":"#BREAKING Stocks kick off Q2 in strong fashion, Dow jumps 100-plus https://t.co/5UOcn1Q5xn","date":"Fri Apr 01 20:01:05 +0000 2016","favs":26,"id":{"$numberLong":"715992401261772801"},"retweets":22},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MZ9AJS"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e85"},"content":"I’m all for second chances. A third one? Maybe not.Greg Hendrix coached\nfreshman football and served as an assistant on the varsity in Bentonville\n(Ark.) High’s powerhouse football program, up until he was fired in 2014 for\nallegedly calling a former player turned cheerleader a “[expletive] queer” and\ndismissing the student-athlete’s attempt at a handshake with the phrase, “I\ndon’t talk to [expletives].”Of course, Hendrix denied accusations made in the\nform of handwritten statements to the administration, suggesting the students\nwho came forward were conspiring against him.So, Hendrix was offered a second\nchance some three hours southeast in Little Rock, Ark., where he has been\nteaching U.S. History and coaching both football and track at Wilbur D. Mills\nUniversity Studies High. On Thursday, he found himself in the news once\nagain.According to the Arkansas Times, Hendrix allegedly showed the first half\nof Mel Gibson’s 2004 R-rated epic “The Passion of the Christ” to his U.S.\nHistory class (because what’s more American than that?) and included a “study\nsheet” that asked, among other questions: Did seeing the movie change your\nperspective on Christ’s suffering for your salvation?”But when a complaint\nprevented Hendrix from finishing the film the following day, he taught his\nclass a lesson in liberalism and political correctness. This being 2016, that\nlesson was recorded by a student and sent to the Arkansas Times and ACLU of\nArkansas.“Your first amendment right to peacefully assemble in this classroom\nand to have free speech was ruined by one person — a liberal. I keep telling\nyou, when Democrats are offended by something and they don’t agree with it,\nthey want to shut it down, they want to ban it, and they want to censor it, so\nyou have lost your first amendment right that is guaranteed to you by the\nconstitution to peaceful assembly in this classroom, and to free speech,\nbecause of one person. How’s that make you feel?[…]“Birds of a feather do\nwhat? They flock together. Let this be your first lesson on liberalism,\nDemocrats 101. Let this be your first lesson. Don’t say Jesus at school. Oh,\nLord. Don’t say Jesus at school. But we can push Islam on you, and, you know,\ngay rights, and all this other stuff. All that’s acceptable. But don’t say\nJesus. Okay?[…]“I keep telling you, I’ll never understand how blacks can\nsupport the Democratic party. It just blows my mind. All they do is convince\ny’all that whoever the Republican nominee is is going to take away food stamps\nand all this stuff, put you in chains and send you back to Africa. Well, shit,\nif that was going to happen, they would have done it a long time ago, wouldn’t\nyou think? Has a Republican ever done that? No. Here’s the bottom line on\nRepublicans, because I am one. Actually, I’m a Constitutional Conservative: we\njust want you to get off your ass and go to work and be productive members of\nsociety and quit mooching off the government, because somebody is paying for\nthat. Me.”Hendrix goes on to suggest protestors were paid $3,500 by liberal\nfoundations to disrupt Donald Trump rallies before lumping the Black Lives\nMatter movement in with “terrorists.”  After explaining “liberal means taking\nliberties with the Constitution,” Hendrix concludes his lesson plan with this:\n“So, we’re going to watch the news, y’all got something you want to do, do it,\nand I’m going to put on ‘Star Wars: The Legacy Revealed,’ because I like\nit.”“It was weird. He shouldn’t have done it because there are a lot of\nstudents that have different religions.

ET this Sunday, I will probably watch most of it, as enjoying\nbaseball is not only an important part of my job but also an important part of\nmy constitution. I have a game of my own Sunday morning, but I’ll probably go\nout to eat with some friends afterward, and we’ll probably watch the first\ngame because we all know each other through baseball and share a common love\nof baseball. Then, wiped out from playing, I’ll head home and watch the 4 p.m.\ngame because it features the Toronto Blue Jays and their incredible offense,\nwhich is always fun, and because I can think of no better way to pass a lazy\nSunday afternoon than watching baseball. Once that’s done, I’ll certainly DVR\n_The Walking Dead _so I can tune into the night game, because it so happens to\nbe a World Series rematch between the Mets and Royals, and because, again,\nit’s among the first games of real, meaningful Major League Baseball after far\ntoo much time without it.But I will watch all of it begrudgingly. Do you hear\nme? Begrudgingly, I say!It happens that I am so dedicated to watching baseball\nthat I will watch baseball even when I strongly believe, on principle, that\nthe specific baseball in question should not be undertaken at that particular\ntime. They’ve got me hooked, and so I will participate in Major League\nBaseball’s continued trivialization of what should be the greatest and most\nimportant holiday of the year: Opening day.And I understand that, rationally,\nthe league and _ESPN _and everyone else involved have good reasons for kicking\noff the season with a Sunday triple-header — making more money, mostly, which\nis in their best interests as businesses. And typically, I believe the\nnostalgia-driven calls for baseball to go back to doing things the way\nbaseball used to do things are silly and unnecessary, and that progress just\nsort of happens and we have no choice but to plow forward.But this isn’t a\nrational thing. Opening day should serve as a celebration of baseball to be\nenjoyed by all fans of all teams on the same day. A couple of years ago, teams\nactually played their season openers on _four different days_. At that point,\nwhy even bother giving it a name?True story: One April afternoon in 1987, when\nI was six years old and toiling through a lesson on whatever the heck you\nlearn about in Kindergarten, the principal’s voice came over the classroom’s\nP.A. and called me down to his office so I could leave school and go attend my\nfirst-ever baseball game with my family: Opening day at Shea Stadium. The same\nthing happened pretty much every year after, but that first time probably\nstands as the greatest day of my life. All downhill from there, really. I got\nto _leave school _to go to a baseball game! Take that, all you suckers staying\nbehind in school! You guys stay here learning how to add; I’ll be watching\nbaseball.Everyone deserves that type of excitement, I think. And the best way\nto guarantee it is to scrap the Sunday-night nonsense and have all 30 Major\nLeague teams start their seasons with day games on the first Monday in April,\nthen get about ensuring that the first Monday in April become a national\nholiday in which everybody except those of us who get to attend baseball games\nfor work is excused from work.If you check out MLB.com or any team’s website,\nyou’ll find “Opening Day” capitalized as though it’s a real thing and a proper\nnoun. It should be both, but it’s neither now. It’s just a couple of days on\nwhich teams Major League teams play their first games.\n\n","title":"MLB’s opening day can’t be a holiday if it no longer really exists | For The Win","twitter":{"body":"MLB's opening day can't be a holiday if it no longer really exists https://t.co/RvzltdU8aJ","date":"Fri Apr 01 18:46:10 +0000 2016","favs":25,"id":{"$numberLong":"715973548372656128"},"retweets":18},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1VgG88M"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e87"},"content":"HAWTHORNE, Calif. -- Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk said Friday that \"pre-orders\"\nfor the Model 3 electric car had hit 198,000, an encouraging sign a day after\nthe novel vehicle aimed at a mass market was unveiled here to an enthusiastic\ncrowd.The Model 3 drove onto a stage through a curtain of fog at a lavish\nceremony in a converted hangar adjoining the SpaceX factory in this Los\nAngeles suburb. Tesla CEO Musk vowed that the car will seat five, hit the\nhighest safety marks and have a range of at least 215 miles a charge.While its\nperformance won't be nearly as breathtaking as its larger sibling, the super-\nluxury Model S, will be impressive: Zero to 60 miles per hour in less than 6\nseconds. To prove the point, Tesla offered test rides with a long straightaway\nin which the car hurtled down a side road at push-you-back-in-your-seat speeds\nin near silence.The Model 3, Musk said, will be priced at $35,000, about half\nthe cost of its two current models, the Model S sedan and Model X crossover.\nMusk tweeted Friday that with options, the average order was closer to\n$42,000. The car is considered critical to Tesla's success, its first attempt\nto lure average car buyers -- not just the rich --  to electric\nvehicles.Initial reaction to the car appeared favorable. After lines formed\noutside Tesla showrooms around the country where customers could make\nreservations for a refundable $1,000, which it terms \"pre-orders.\" Musk\nannounced the figures had hit 115,000 by the time the car was revealed. Then\non Friday, Musk tweeted that the order bank had hit 180,000, then later that\nit was 198,000. \"Future of electric cars looking bright!,\" he wrote.Tesla\n\"will set the all time record for any consumer tech company,\" wrote Trip\nChowdhry, analyst for Global Equities Research, in a note before the\nunveiling. Musk says Tesla is aiming to produce 500,000 cars a year, up from\nabout 50,000 last year. To accomplish the goal, Tesla is building what Musk\nsays will be the largest lithium-ion battery factory in the world outside\nReno, Nev.The car's profile is similar to the Model S, lacking any adornment\non the front where a grille would normally be. Musk says the car has trunks\nboth front and rear. The extra space is due to its lack of a gas engine since\nit has only batteries and electric motors. Inside, the car has a huge screen\non the center console like other Teslas, though it is slightly smaller than on\nthe Model S or X. It is also distinguished by a huge glass roof over both the\nfront and rear seats, which Musk says affords better headroom.Experts say they\nexpect different versions of the Model 3, some fancier than others. In the\nprocess, it could experience price creep.\"Tesla has a history of introducing a\nvehicle with a reasonably low price and then selling versions that are much\nmore expensive,\" says Jack Nerad, executive editorial director for Kelley Blue\nBook, in a statement. \"There was no mention of EV's major Achilles’ heel --\nrecharge time. The 215-mile range and low recharge times make EVs  (electric\nvehicles) impractical for many buyers.”Musk says Model 3 cars will start\ndelivery to customers in late 2017.In another plus for the Model 3, Musk says\nit will have access to Tesla's Supercharger network, which will be expanded.\nSuperchargers are high speed recharging units, both in cities and on major\nhighways.  \n\n","title":"Tesla unveils its Model 3 sedan as pre-orders top 198,000","twitter":{"body":"Stunning!

That included action plans for the\nUnited Nations, the International Atomic Energy Association, a global\npartnership to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction and Interpol.The\nUnited States also revealed for the first time in more than a decade its\ninventory of HEU. It reported 586 metric tons of HEU in the United States in\n2013, down from 741 metric tons in 1996.The inventory includes HEU for\n\"national security or non-national security programs, including nuclear\nweapons, naval propulsion, nuclear energy and science,\" said Myles Caggins, a\nspokesman for the National Security Council. The tally  counts HEU that can be\nconverted to low-enriched uranium and HEU in spent nuclear reactor fuel.The\nU.S. figures reflect a reduced supply of HEU worldwide, the White House said.\nSince the last summit in 2014, 10 nations have removed or disposed of about\n450 kilograms — about 990 pounds — of HEU. Argentina, Switzerland and\nUzbekistan are free of HEU, as is the entire region of Latin America and the\nCaribbean.\"That inventory is one that we have reduced considerably,\" Obama\nsaid. \"When it comes to our nuclear-powered ships and submarines, we are\nexploring ways to further reduce our holdings of highly enriched\nuranium.\"Obama used the summit as an opportunity to defend the agreement with\nIran that stopped that nation's nuclear weapons program in exchange for\nreduced economic sanctions.\"After nearly two years of intensive negotiations\nand strong sanctions, the countries represented in this room achieved what\ndecades of animosity and rhetoric did not: a long-term deal that closes off\nevery possible path for Iran to build a nuclear weapon and subjects Iran to\nthe most comprehensive nuclear inspections ever negotiated,\" Obama said.Obama\nsaid Iran has so far \"followed the letter of the agreement,\" but that some of\nits actions may scare off potential business partners.\"When they launch\nballistic missiles with slogans calling for the destruction of Israel, that\nmakes businesses nervous,\" Obama said. \"If Iran continues to ship missiles to\nHezbollah, that gets businesses nervous.\"Critics, including Republican\nlawmakers and presidential candidates as well as the government of Israel, say\nthe agreement gives Iran too much leeway to cheat.Thursday, Obama and the\nofficials from more than 50 countries conducted a series of meetings, then had\na working dinner at the White House. He met with the leaders of China, Japan\nand South Korea to discuss how to confront threats from nuclear-armed North\nKorea.North Korea said it will continue its nuclear and ballistic missile\nprogram Friday and added that a state of “semi-war” existed on the divided\npeninsula, Reuters reported.One nuclear-armed power did not send any delegates\nto the security summit: Russia.Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security\nadviser for strategic communication, said American and Russian officials\ncontinue to work day-to-day on nuclear security issues. He described the\nRussians' absence from the summit as a \"missed opportunity\" for them.This is\nthe last Nuclear Security Summit of the Obama presidency.

Federal, state and local governments added 20,000.Employment gains for\nJanuary and February were revised down by a trivial 1,000.Average hourly wages\nrose 7 cents to $25.43 and are up 2.3% the past year, more than reversing an\nunexpected dip in February and possibly indicating that lackluster earnings\ngains of slightly more than 2% throughout the recovery are picking up. If the\ntrend continues, it could signal that inflation will accelerate and help prod\nthe Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate again after lifting\nit in December for the first time in nine years.Possibly working against that\ntrend was a rise in the labor force participation rate — the share of the\npopulation working or looking for jobs. It picked up from 62.9% to 63%, the\nhighest level since March 2014, and it's up  from 62.4% since September after\ntrending down for years as Baby Boomers have retired. Millions of Americans on\nthe sidelines since the recession have streamed back into an improving labor\nmarket, including retirees, people in school and on disability, and\ndiscouraged workers who stopped looking for jobs.If it persists, that shift\ncould keep the unemployment rate higher for longer and temper wage increases\nby expanding the pool of available job candidates. That could allow the Fed to\nraise interest rates more slowly.The report’s modest negatives included an\naverage workweek that was unchanged at 34.4 hours, below the recent trend.\nEmployers who trim the hours of workers may be unlikely to step up hiring in\ncoming months.The number of part-time workers who prefer full-time jobs jumped\nby 135,000, pushing up a broader measure of unemployment that includes that\ngroup, the jobless and discouraged workers who have given up looking to 9.8%\nfrom 9.7%.Last month, retailers added 48,000 jobs while health care added\n44,000; leisure and hospitality, 40,000; construction, 37,000; and\nprofessional and business services, 33,000.Manufacturers cut 29,000 jobs,\nrevealing the sector is still hobbled by a weak economy overseas and the oil\nindustry’s downturn. Mining and logging companies, which include oil\nproducers, chopped 12,000 jobs.Jason Schenker, president of Prestige\nEconomics, called the report “solid,” but said, “You’re losing really high-\npaying jobs” in manufacturing and energy and adding lower paying positions in\nretail and restaurants.Manufacturing may be poised for a turnaround. The\nInstitute for Supply Management said Friday its index of factory activity\nregistered expansion for the first time in six months on a surge in new\norders.Overall, the labor market has been resilient, steadily turning in\naverage gains of more than 200,000 jobs a month despite an economy that grew a\nsluggish 1.4% at an annual rate late last year and is likely to expand by less\nthan 1% in the current quarter.Healthy consumer spending and the housing\nrecovery have propped up hiring, more than offsetting the slump in\nmanufacturing. But the government reported this week that even consumption has\nbeen subdued this year, raising questions about whether the labor market will\nsputter as well. In a note to clients, Barclays said Friday’s solid report\nprobably heralds a pickup in consumption in coming months, as newly employed\nworkers ramp up purchases.Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen signaled this\nweek that the central bank is likely to stand pat on interest rates this\nmonth, regardless of Friday’s jobs totals. Although stocks have bounced back\nfrom a selloff early in the year, Yellen said she’s concerned about China's\nslowdown and its potential to further roil markets.\n\n","title":"Employers added solid 215,000 jobs in March","twitter":{"body":"Employers add 215,000 jobs in March, while unemployment rate rises to 5% https://t.co/9MSxAHBRAA #jobsreport (Getty) https://t.co/mtetp0uBc6","date":"Fri Apr 01 13:40:10 +0000 2016","favs":17,"id":{"$numberLong":"715896539328045056"},"retweets":30},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MZsWyv"}

Bernie Sanders of Vermont, her\nDemocratic primary opponent, held his first major rally in New York.\"So much\nof what we're hearing is contrary to who we are as New Yorkers and Americans,\"\nClinton said her first campaign appearance in this area since January. \"Think\nabout what we hear on the Republican side.

I have 1 million more votes than Donald\nTrump, and I have 2½ million more votes than Bernie Sanders.”Clinton and\nSanders are vying for 291 delegates up for grabs in New York's Democratic\nprimary April 19. Clinton has 1,243 pledged delegates so far compared to 980\nfor Sanders; 2,383 are needed to clinch the Democratic nomination.Clinton, who\nlives in Chappaqua, N.Y., wasted no time emphasizing her adoptive home state.\nShe took the stage the stage with longtime Democratic Rep.

John\nKasich and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas.“I just wish that there were an opportunity\nto actually talk and listen to each other because we’ve got to unite,\" she\nsaid. \"When this primary contest is over, we’ve got to unite and make sure we\nhave a Democrat in the White House.”Earlier Thursday, a Quinnipiac University\npoll reported that Clinton held a 12 percentage-point lead over Sanders in New\nYork. The poll found a narrower gap between the two than the 21-point margin\nin a Sienna College poll released March 7.Sanders holds a slight lead over\nClinton in Wisconsin, the last major primary before the New York vote.\nWisconsin has 96 Democratic delegates up for grabs, but New York with 291\ndelegates offers challenges and opportunities for both camps.Sanders has\nmobilized hundreds of volunteers to canvass neighborhoods and set up phone\nbanks.

And it's brilliant.When his story hit the Internet, people\naround the world were alarmed. Why would anyone voluntarily live in a self-\nmade box and pay to sleep in someone else's living room? Because in San\nFrancisco, rent prices have gone through the roof. As someone who just went\nthrough the insanity of the housing hunt in San Francisco — Berkowitz's box\n(or pod) idea sounds only slightly short of completely reasonable.Here’s why:\nIt’s impossible to find affordable housing in San Francisco. If you’re single,\npetless and in a place where you can live in a box, why waste your money on\nspace that is increasingly expensive and not increasingly better?With help of\n@imightbecharles, I now live in a pod. Wrote about it https://t.co/6dnjBP3Ekp\n\\+ https://t.co/14odqt3tw9pic.twitter.com/ptc9cdUIzgMy requirements were\nsimple, I thought: The apartment had to allow a cat (Phoebe Louise is not\nnegotiable). Have one bedroom. Have a bathroom. Have a roof. Be inside the\ncity.We started the search for a cat-friendly, one-bedroom apartment with the\nmax price set to $2,500. It would be more than we spent in Washington, D.C.,\nbut split between the two of us, my boyfriend Brent and I could make that\nwork. Zero results came up. We paid for an AirBnB for one full month to help\nus get settled and, ideally, not be forced into the first available apartment\nwe found, so we took the next week to search online for apartments.I could pay\n$1,400 for a private bedroom in a house with other roommates — but I’d have to\nleave Brent behind. I could live in the “PENTHOUSE DELUXX FULLY FURNISHED”\nscam that had a price tag of $99 a month. Or we could commute from San Jose.\nWe gulped and bumped our search window up to $3,300. Finally, there were a\nnumber of options. I emailed all of them. Every single one. Photos or no\nphotos. Regardless of neighborhood, distance from work or square footage, I\nemailed with my friendliest compliments about their “absolutely beautiful”\nproperties that I was sure would “feel just like home!\"Out of 20 places I\nreached out to on Craigslist, only seven were still available — they’d all\nbeen taken since the postings went up the day before, or even that morning. By\nthe time I emailed back to schedule a tour, only two remained. We showed up on\nthe doorstep of the first available open house 20 minutes early and we were\nfirst in the door — by about a minute and ten seconds. As soon as the couple\nbehind us started oohing and ahhing over the micro kitchen, I realized I was\nalready in a competition for an expensive, tiny apartment I didn’t even know\nif I wanted.Three more couples came in while we were still there and the man\nshowing the apartment explained the apartment would go to whomever applied\nfirst. I took out my phone and started filling out our application before I’d\neven seen the bedroom. I vigorously tapped my reference information on the\nscreen while Brent asked some questions about utilities.Less than an hour\nlater, all of our forms and documents were in. The next morning, the landlord\ncalled and told us that seven other applications had been filed since ours,\nbut since we snuck in just before them the apartment was ours if we wanted it\n— $3,195 for less than 700-square-foot apartment. The only apartment we’d been\nable to find, see and apply for where Brent, Phoebe Louise and I could live\ntogether without other roommates. There was a bathroom. There was a roof. We\nhad 48 hours to make a decision.I frantically moved our price cap to $3,350 to\nsee if there was anything else, and I applied to the few new listings that\npopped up since the previous night. They were all either taken, or waiting on\nconfirmation from someone who had already applied. If we wanted, we could join\nthe waiting list without seeing the place‚ but it was six people long. I hit\nrefresh more times that day than when I was a high school senior, waiting to\nsee if I was accepted into my top-choice college.We got in to see the second\napartment, which was bigger and brighter, but also more expensive. As our\n48-hour mark approached, we’d had no luck finding any other listings in our\nprice range. So we did it. The lease came, with $3,195 written right on it. I\nsigned. I anxiously blocked out the fact that I was signing a year lease for\nan apartment that was almost $1,000 more a month than I planned. As expensive\nas it was, it would be cheaper than the studio Airbnb we were in. Even now,\nthree months later, I poke around Craigslist to see if we missed a hidden\ndeal. We didn't. The median cost for a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco\nis $3,670, according to Zumper's apartment rental data. We got, by someone's\nstandards, a steal.On moving day, we walked into our new, small empty\napartment with nothing but suitcases. At least there wasn't much to furnish.\nWe won't be buying much anytime soon. Unless we can find someone who wants to\nrent a box in our living room.Peter, let us know if you're in the pod-\nrelocation market.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e93"},"content":"DETROIT — Back in 2014, Flint water treatment workers expected they'd add\ncorrosion control to the city's drinking water — chemicals that would have\nprevented a public health crisis — after the city switched its water supply.\nBut the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality said they didn't have\nto.Up to this point, it's been hard to understand why the state didn't require\nFlint to use corrosion control, chemicals that stop lead leaching into the\ncity's water supply. And the state's rationale, that it misunderstood federal\nguidelines, has mystified water treatment experts interviewed by the _Detroit\nFree Press_. It also drew scorn from the Flint Water Advisory Task Force,\nappointed by Gov. Rick Snyder himself to investigate the crisis — the task\nforce called the department's interpretation of the rule \"egregious\" and\n\"lax,\" saying it bypassed important and obvious questions about water\nsafety.But testimony at a legislative hearing this week from the city's\nutilities chief may help explain: When Flint began to pump drinking water from\nthe Flint River, the city's water treatment plant wasn't capable of adding\ncorrosion control treatment, not without equipment upgrades the broke city\ncouldn't afford.In fact, Flint didn't start to install the required equipment\nuntil November 2015, when the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality\nsigned off on an October permit application for a temporary phosphate feed\nsystem while a permanent feed was under construction, according to state\nrecords.That's the same month Snyder finally acknowledged that there was a\nproblem in Flint, that the abundant evidence amassed by independent\nresearchers was accurate, and that the city's drinking water was not safe.It's\ncritical context for understanding the state's disastrous decision-making in\nFlint.Michael Glasgow, then a lab supervisor and now the city's utilities\nadministrator, testified Tuesday at a legislative hearing about the Flint\nwater crisis.Flint, Mich., resident Glaydes Williamson holds up water from\nFlint and hair pulled from her drain, during the House Oversight and\nGovernment Reform Committee hearing to examine the ongoing situation in Flint\non Capitol Hill in Washington on Wednesday, Feb. 3, 2016. (Photo: Molly Riley,\nAP)The state has said, for months, that the department misinterpreted the\nfederal Lead and Copper Rule, a guideline for treating water to prevent the\nkind of public health crisis that happened in Flint — because water pumped\nfrom the Flint River hadn't been dosed with corrosion control chemicals, the\ncity's residents were exposed to lead-contaminated water, for almost two\nyears, including nearly 9,000 children younger than 6.And even after the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency told the state last spring that Flint must\nbegin corrosion control immediately, the state didn't act — in official\nemails, claiming it was appropriate to continue monitoring the city's water\nbefore changing its treatment, even as two rounds of state testing showed lead\nlevels in the city's drinking water climbing.The decision to skip corrosion\ncontrol certainly didn't save money. Corrosion-control chemicals, which keep\nlead contained by coating the inside of plumbing pipes, are cheap; some\nreports estimate the cost of treating Flint River water at less than $150 a\nday.Plant upgrades, however, are expensive. A 2014 engineering report,\nperformed in conjunction with a bond offering for a new regional water\nauthority the state OK'd Flint to join in 2013, said the local treatment plant\nwould require $8 million in upgrades to process the Lake Huron water the new\nsystem would pump.Flint was broke by the time it joined the new regional water\nauthority, and under the oversight of a state-appointed emergency manager\nhired to cut costs. And it was still broke the next year, when a different\nemergency manager opted to pull drinking water from the Flint River while the\nnew system was under construction, instead of purchasing water from the\nDetroit system Flint had patronized for years.Both choices were billed as\ncost-saving measures, justified because of Flint's financial situation.That\n2009 report didn't specify how much of that $8 million total installation of\ncorrosion control equipment would account for, but the idea that Flint's plant\nneeded a corrosion control upgrade wasn't new. A 2009 engineering analysis\nassociated with the same water system detailed equipment necessary to add\ncorrosion control at Flint's plant: a 6,000-gallon bulk storage tank, a\ntransfer pump and a 120-gallon day tank and chemical metering pumps.According\nto the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, no upgrades to corrosion-\ncontrol equipment were made at the plant before it began to pump and treat\nFlint River water, more corrosive than the Lake Huron water it expected to use\nwhen the new system was complete.I asked Ari Adler, a spokesman for Snyder,\nwhether the plant's lack of equipment was a factor in the state's decision to\nskip corrosion control. Adler stuck with the state's line, that the\nenvironmental quality department misunderstood the Lead and Copper Rule. Nor,\nAdler said, did the Flint plant's capacity impact the state's decisions in the\nwake of EPA's order to start corrosion control immediately.In a series of\nemails earlier this year, environmental quality department spokespeople said\nthe state hadn't required Flint to upgrade its corrosion control equipment\nbecause upgrades of its corrosion control equipment weren't required.It's the\nkind of circular, maddening illogic that makes parsing the causes and\nconsequence of the Flint water crisis so maddening.But one thing's sure: As we\nall work to understand what happened in Flint, the conditions at the water\ntreatment plant — and whether the cost of adding equipment impacted public\nhealth decisions — should be a part of the conversation._Nancy Kaffer is a\n_Detroit Free Press_ columnist where this column first appeared.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e94"},"content":"The Navy is easing its tattoo policy in a bid to recruit and retain more\nsailors from the millennial generation, of whom more than 1 in 3 sport body\nart.Sailors will be allowed to have neck tattoos, sleeves and even markings\nbehind their ears under the new policy, the most lenient of any military\nservice. Only their heads are off limits under the new policy, which the\nNavy's top sailor has called a reality check on the permanent art favored by\nsailors.“We just got to the point where we realized we needed to be honest\nwith ourselves and put something in place that was going to reflect the\nrealities of our country and the needs of our Navy,” Master Chief Petty\nOfficer of the Navy Mike Stevens said Wednesday. “We need to make sure that\nwe’re not missing any opportunities to recruit and retain the best and the\nbrightest because of our policies.”The new rules, announced Thursday and\ntaking effect April 30, will allow sailors to:• Have multiple or large tattoos\nbelow the elbow or knee, including the wrists and hands, effectively allowing\nsleeve tattoos that can be seen even while wearing short sleeve uniforms.•\nHave one tattoo on their neck, which includes behind the ear, and it may not\nexceed 1 inch in length or height in either or both directions.• Sailors with\nvisible tattoos will now be eligible for recruiting duty or leading recruits\nat boot camp in Great Lakes, Ill. These tough assignments often give sailors a\nleg up to make rank.The rules do not change the Navy’s content guidelines that\napply to body art “anywhere on the body,” the policy says.The service\nreiterated these in the updated policy, banning “tattoos that are obscene,\nsexually explicit, and or advocate discrimination based on sex, race,\nreligion, ethnicity, or national origin.\"“In addition, tattoos that symbolize\naffiliation with gangs, supremacist or extremist groups, or advocate illegal\ndrug use are prohibited — waivers will not be given for tattoos with\nprohibited content,” the service said.The updated tattoo policy does not apply\nto Marines, even ones serving at Navy commands, according to a spokesman for\nCommandant of the Marine Corps Gen. Robert Neller. The Marines are easing\ntheir tattoo rules but do not allow sleeves, which would be visible with\nshort-sleeved uniforms such as physical training uniforms.In 2015, the Army\nupdated its rules to allow sleeve tattoos, but it does not permit soldiers to\nhave ink on their necks or hands, which would be visible in the Army Service\nUniform.Sailors' tattoos must be documented in the administrative remarks\nsection of their service record.Sailors found to have tattoos with prohibited\ncontent could face disciplinary action and even involuntary discharge. It’s\nleft up to commanding officers to decide what crosses the line. Typically,\nsailors are allowed to have tattoos removed or modified to eliminate any\nbanned content before they are disciplined.Tattoos are popular with sailors,\nespecially millennials. New rules will allow more inked sailors to compete for\ncareer-enhancing jobs like recruiting duty.

Thibodeaux, U.S. Navy)Beyond what’s stated in the policy,\ndon’t expect a laundry list of do's and don'ts.“There are just so many\nvariables when you look at tattoo language and tattoo art that it’s just not\nreasonable to try and identify a set list of what is and what isn’t\nacceptable,” Stevens said. “This is one of those areas where we trust this\nsenior leadership, our triads, to be able to look at something in its context,\nusing the chain of command and having discussions amongst themselves as to\nwhether something is appropriate or not.”Stevens said the changes came from\nsailors' feedback, with many complaining that their body art unfairly barred\nthem from jobs such as recruit division commanders that can help them get\nadvanced.Stevens said he believes that society is more accepting of tattoos,\nwith some estimates that as much as nearly half of the demographic the\nmilitary recruits from has tattoos.\"This isn’t official, but in my research, I\nsaw estimates that the percentage of people with tattoos in the 18 to 25 age\ngroup as being between 37(%) and 40%,\" he said. \"That's not an insignificant\nnumber.\"That age group encompasses the majority of sailors in the fleet,\nStevens said, and made the Navy's leadership realize a policy change was\nneeded from the tougher rules enacted 13 years ago.\"It’s a tough recruiting\nenvironment out there already and when you start putting up barriers that\ndon’t have any true rationale behind them, you create problems for yourself\ninto the future,\" he said. \"We’ve met (recruiting) goal for 105 straight\nmonths and our recruiting is strong, but you never want to get\nbehind.\"_Contributing: Jeff Schogol, Military Times.

He forwarded the proposal to the rest of the commission in preparation for\na vote at Thursday's regular commission meeting.\"Our ISPs handle all of our\nnetwork traffic\" on home and mobile networks, Wheeler said in an official\nstatement released after the meeting. \"Even when data is encrypted, our\nbroadband providers can piece together significant amounts of information\nabout us — including private information such as a chronic medical condition\nor financial problems — based on our online activity.\"  \n  \nAs Wheeler envisioned, customers would be able to opt out of marketing from\ntheir Internet service providers and their affiliates and must opt in for any\nexternal use of their data. FCC staff will prepare a notice of rule-making for\nonline publication and will then  take public comments on the issue from\ncompanies, groups and individuals for 60 days after its release online, prior\nto crafting the rules.Opponents to the measure, including trade groups\nUSTelecom and free market think tank Free State Foundation, have argued that\nthe FCC's privacy provisions may be different than those the Federal Trade\nCommission uses to regulate sites and services on the Net.“It is disappointing\nthe FCC is pursuing a new privacy framework that will impose onerous\nrequirements on broadband providers and will mistakenly leave consumers with\nthe impression that they are receiving meaningful new protections,\" said\nMobile Future Chairman Jonathan Spalter.Commissioner Michael O’Reilly, who\nalong with fellow Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai voted against the privacy\nmeasure, said that it sets the agency off “on a statutory fishing expedition”\nand represents “an alarming display of doublethink.”Congress directed the FCC\nto create privacy regulations for traditional phone companies and now must do\nso for Internet connectivity, said Commissioner Mignon Clyburn. \"There is\nabsolutely no comparison\" between the information that could be gathered by\ntoday's ISPs and traditional phone companies, she said. \"Times have changed\nand we need to ensure that our rules are updated to reflect these\ntechnological transformations,\" she said.The commission also voted 3-2 along\npolitical lines — which Democrats Clyburn, Wheeler and Commissioner Jessica\nRosenworcel in favor — to expand the Lifeline program, which for more than 30\nyears has provided discounted telephone service to low-income Americans, to\ninclude mobile or fixed broadband service.For more information about the\nservice, which gives low-income homes up to $9.25 monthly for services, go to\nthe FCC web site._Follow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider_,\n\n","title":"FCC to tackle consumers' Internet privacy rules","twitter":{"body":"FCC to craft new privacy rules on how Internet service providers can use customer data. https://t.co/n6vPm3ZwZM","date":"Fri Apr 01 11:15:20 +0000 2016","favs":25,"id":{"$numberLong":"715860091371700224"},"retweets":26},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MX42Q6"}

Salmonella, which is usually spread through contaminated food,\ntypically causes diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps that can last from four\nto seven days.\"The worker is well and back at CDC and, based on what we know\nnow, no other staff were exposed or sick, and there was no release outside the\nlaboratory,\" the agency said in a press release.The worker had completed all\nrequired safety training and was following standard protocols while performing\na procedure on a frozen sample of salmonella in an effort to grow the\nbacteria, the CDC said. In the days following the procedure, the worker became\nill and on March 18 informed the agency they had been diagnosed with a\nsalmonella infection. The agency said it is investigating to see if additional\nlaboratory safeguards are needed to prevent exposures in the future.Biosafety\nexperts expressed concern about the infection, but praised the CDC for\nidentifying it and notifying the public.\"I think the important thing here is\nthat the CDC learned from its past mistakes and is now practicing\ntransparency,\" said Scott Becker, executive director of the Association of\nPublic Health Laboratories. Becker, who noted that lab work carries risks,\nsaid the CDC's new lab safety office will play an important role in reviewing\nthe policies and procedures to determine what happened in the incident.Sean\nKaufman, a biosafety consultant who has testified before Congress, said it's\ngood news that mechanisms were in place to identify when a lab worker got\nsick. But Kaufman said he remains concerned that CDC has not addressed\nsystemic issues with lab safety.\"Even though CDC has taken steps in the right\ndirection, there continues to be a stream of incidents and accidents,\" Kaufman\nsaid.Exactly how many lab incidents have occurred at CDC in recent years is\nunclear because the agency has been slow to release records under the federal\nFreedom of Information Act. Last year, the CDC told the USA TODAY NETWORK it\nwill take until sometime in 2018 before it will release reports of all\nincidents that occurred at the agency's labs in Atlanta and Fort Collins,\nColo., during 2013 and 2014.A summary of lab incidents the agency provided to\nthe news organization was incomplete and revealed the CDC lacked a key policy\nto ensure top agency safety officials received reports of mishaps, despite\npromises to Congress of reforms.The USA TODAY NETWORK's \"Biolabs in Your\nBackyard\" investigation, published throughout 2015, revealed that incidents at\nthe CDC are among hundreds that have occurred corporate, university,\ngovernment and military labs nationwide. It also exposed a system of\nfragmented federal oversight and pervasive secrecy that obscures failings by\nfacilities and regulators. The series has been cited in ongoing congressional\ninvestigations and in new transparency reforms called for by White House\nscience and homeland security advisers. In November, the CDC replaced the head\nof its laboratory regulation program, which inspects biodefense labs\nnationwide that work with potential bioterror pathogens.The CDC's high-profile\n2014 incidents involved potential bioterror pathogens like anthrax and Ebola\noccurred in biosafety level 3 and 4 labs — the two highest safety levels —\nwhere scientists wear specialized gear ranging from respirators to full-body,\nspacesuit-like protection. The new salmonella incident involved a common\nstrain of the bacterium that causes food-borne illnesses and it occurred at a\nbiosafety level 2 lab where workers may only wear gloves, gowns and face\nmasks.Kaufman said it's important to have a strong culture of safety and\nattention to detail in all levels of labs to ensure workers don't get sick and\npotentially spread illness to their families. \"There was some sort of\nbreakdown in those procedures and someone got sick,\" he said of the latest\nincident.Read the USA TODAY NETWORK's \"Biolabs in Your Backyard\" investigation\nat biolabs.usatoday.com.Follow investigative reporter Alison Young on Twitter:\n@alisonannyoung\n\n","title":"Latest CDC lab incident involves worker infected with salmonella","twitter":{"body":"CDC investigating how one of its lab workers became infected with salmonella. https://t.co/yrsAUzfVVi","date":"Fri Apr 01 10:10:14 +0000 2016","favs":15,"id":{"$numberLong":"715843707774361600"},"retweets":18},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MXkPSW"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023e9d"},"content":"It only cost the Patriots a fourth-round pick to put together the league’s\nscariest receiving duo. New England swapped the 127th pick in 2016 NFL Draft\nfor Bears tight end Martellus Bennett, a move that has surely knocked a few\nhours off AFC coaches’ sleep schedules.The Patriots have spent the last few\nyears trying to forget they once employed a tight end who was later convicted\nof murder, but have been longing for the days when Aaron Hernandez and Rob\nGronkowski drove defensive coordinators mad with their versatility. The team\npicked up veteran Scott Chandler before the 2015 season to try to replicate\nthat pairing. In 2014, it was Tim Wright trying to fill that void. While those\ntwo had some good moments, neither proved to be the game-changer Hernandez was\nduring his short NFL career.Bennett is the player the Patriots hoped Chandler\nwould be last season. At 6-foot-6, 273 pounds, he has the frame to outmuscle\ndefensive backs.But he’s also quick enough to shake any linebacker in\ncoverage.With the football-catching monster wearing 87 on the field, defenses\nwon’t be able to give Bennett extra attention.“I have no idea,” said the\nusually boastful Rex Ryan when asked how the Bills will defend the two tight\nends. “**I just think it’s unusual to have two guys that are like 6-7 and can\nrun, catch, block.** So, yeah, it’s going to be a major challenge. There’s no\ndoubt about that. **It’s scary when you look at them.** Those are two huge\nguys. **How we’re going to defend them, I don’t know.**”While Bennett and\nGronkowski are at their most dangerous in the passing game, it’s their\ncontributions in the run game that make them such an imposing pair. Gronkowski\nis considered one of the best run-blocking tight ends in the league.Bennett\ndoesn’t have nearly the same reputation as a blocker, but he’s been a average-\nto-good run-blocker throughout his career.Martellus Bennett's PFF run blocking\ngrade rank (out of ~ 60-70 qualifying TEs)'15 18th  \n'14 11th  \n'13 19th  \n'12 7th  \n'11 5th  \n'10 6th  \n'09 11th— Pat Thorman (@Pat_Thorman) March 17, 2016When the Patriots have both\non the field, they’ll typically have the blocking advantage in the box. But\ndefenses can’t exactly load up on run defenders — that will play right into\nNew England’s hands.Having two dynamic tight ends allows the Patriots to play\nfaster, as they did during Hernandez’s last season when New England ran the\nfastest offense in the league, per Football Outsiders . They can go with a\nrun-heavy formation one play, and split Gronk and Bennett out wide in a spread\nformation the next. If they go no-huddle without substituting, the defense\nwill be stuck with immobile linebackers to cover dangerous receivers in\nspace.Let’s take a look at what defenses will be up against when New England\ngoes up-tempo with a hypothetical three-play sequence:It’s first down. The\nPatriots come out in their two-tight end personnel grouping and line up in a\ntight formation. The defense has to respect the run here because of the size\nand strength the Pats on the line of scrimmage. The defense answers with base\npersonnel (that is, four defensive backs and seven defensive\nlinemen/linebackers) to defend against the run.![pats_base_v_base](https://usa\ntftw.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/pats_base_v_base1.png?w=1000\u0026h=553)Even with\nNew England in a condensed formation, there are still plenty of matchup\nproblems for the defense. The defense has to add a safety to the box to help\nagainst the run, leaving Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola one-on-one on the\noutside. And either Gronk or Bennett is getting a one-on-one matchup with a\nlinebacker.OK, let’s say the Patriots run it on first down and the defense,\ngeared up for a run, holds them to a modest three-yard gain. That’s a win for\nthe defense, but now Tom Brady has the Patriots hurrying to the line. The\ndefense is scrambling as the offense spreads out.![pats_4wide](https://usatftw\n.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/pats_4wide1.png?w=1000\u0026h=553)Now the defense has\neven more problems. With the two tight ends on the outside, how does the\ndefense match-up? Keep in mind they have only seconds to figure this out. No\nmatter how they line up, there’s mismatches all over the field. Not wanting to\nleave a linebacker on Gronkowski out wide, the defense has to put a safety on\nhim. That leaves one safety deep and no help over the top on the outside. And\nnow we have Bennett on the outside versus a linebacker, Dion Lewis (who’s\nbasically a receiver wearing a running back number) matched up with a\nlinebacker and only six defenders in the box to defend against a possible\nrun.To avoid these match-up problems the defense can play zone, with defenders\ncovering parts of the field rather than specific receivers. But Brady tears up\nzone defenses, especially simple zone coverages without any pre-snap\ndisguises. Against the no-huddle, that’s really the only brand of zone\ncoverage a defense can play.“You can’t hardly scheme anything [against the no-\nhuddle],” Alabama coach Nick Saban said of up-tempo attacks. “**The most\nimportant thing is to get the [play] call [in] so the guys can get lined up,\nand it’s got to be a simple call. **The offense kind of knows what you are\ndoing.”The matchup zones coverages that defenses use to get the best of both\nzone and man coverage require a lot of communication, but there’s no time to\ntalk when the offense is firing off plays every 15 seconds.Playing man\ncoverage is really the only way to defend these supremely intelligent\nquarterbacks who can find the holes in a zone coverage before the ball is even\nsnapped. There are no voids in man coverage — a quarterback, even one as good\nas Brady, can do nothing if no receivers get open. But good luck trying to\nmatch-up with this receiving corps man-to-man.Back to our hypothetical…So\nBrady just shredded the defense for a big gain, and the defenses has no idea\nwhat to do. The Patriots are hurrying to the line _again_, but now they are\nemptying the backfield. The threat of the run is gone, but they have five very\ncapable receivers lined up outside with only four defensive backs on the field\nto cover them. Everywhere you look, there are problems.![pats_empty](https://u\nsatftw.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/pats_empty1.png?w=1000\u0026h=552)That\nlinebacker can’t cover Lewis in the open field, Bennett has a mismatch on the\nright side and the defense has only one guy to cover Gronkowski. And, oh yeah,\nthere are still two excellent route runners lined up in the slot with maybe\nthe greatest quarterback ever pulling the strings. This is a nightmare for\ndefensive coordinators, and one they will be facing throughout the 2016\nseason.********New England will play a reactionary style of football. The\ndefensive personnel will dictate the Patriots’ offensive strategy. If a team\nwants to play five or six defensive backs to defend against the pass, the Pats\nwill pound the ball on the ground all game. Stay in base personnel, and Brady\nwill throw for 400 yards and three touchdowns.There are a few teams capable of\nmatching up with New England’s versatile group of skill players. Carolina can\nwith its three quick linebackers Luke Kuechly, Thomas Davis and Shaq Thompson,\nwho actually held up in coverage against Larry Fitzgerald on a few plays in\nthe NFC Championship. Arizona has a chance with hybrid players like\nlinebacker/safety Deone Bucannon and corner/safety Tyrann Mathieu in the\nstarting lineup. Seattle has a similar set-up in their nickel package, with\nsafety/destroyer of worlds Kam Chancellor capable of holding his own in tight\nquarters as an ancillary linebacker. And, of course, the Broncos with their\ndeep secondary and dominant pass rush will give any offense trouble.![Screen\nShot 2016-03-31 at 11.50.01 AM](https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2016/03\n/screen-shot-2016-03-31-at-11-50-01-am.jpg?w=1000)The other 27 teams don’t\nreally stand a chance against this offense — and I’m not sure the four I just\nlisted really do either. With all of these weapons and Brady continuing to\nimprove every season, there’s some 2007 Patriots potential here. I don’t know\nabout 16-0, but this team will get close to the undefeated team’s record for\npoints scored in a season.The last time the Patriots had two good tight ends\nand could play at a blistering pace, they averaged nearly 35 points a game and\nmade it to a Super Bowl. It’s still very early in the offseason, but expect\nsimilar results in 2016.\n\n","title":"The Patriots’ new secret weapon could make them unstoppable next season | For The Win","twitter":{"body":"Secret weapon could make the Patriots unstoppable https://t.co/eGCKgjd0Zx","date":"Fri Apr 01 02:38:05 +0000 2016","favs":46,"id":{"$numberLong":"715729921474039808"},"retweets":28},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1RP6Sea"}

It was the first\ntime an appeals court had weighed in directly on the legality of phone-\ntrackers that have been widely — and mostly secretly — used by police agencies\nfor nearly a decade.“Cellphone users have an objectively reasonable\nexpectation that their cellphones will not be used as real-time tracking\ndevices, through the direct and active interference of law enforcement,” a\npanel of three judges on Maryland’s Court of Special Appeals wrote. The judges\nalso accused Baltimore authorities of misleading the lower-court judge who had\napproved their use of the device, commonly known as a stingray.That decision\ncould imperil hundreds of criminal convictions in Baltimore and elsewhere in\nMaryland, where police have used stingrays prolifically. An investigation last\nyear by USA TODAY identified nearly 2,000 cases in Baltimore alone in which\nthe police had secretly used stingrays to make arrests for everything from\nmurder to petty thefts, typically without obtaining a search warrant.“We have\na grave concern that our clients are incarcerated because of the use of a\nstingray that was illegal,” said Natalie Finegar, who is coordinating a review\nof stingray cases for the city’s public defender.Finegar said defense lawyers\nare focused most urgently on about 200 cases in which people appear to have\nbeen sent to prison based on evidence the police found after they used a\nstingray. “Those are the emergencies,” she said. “By itself, it’s just a huge\nnumber of cases.\"Stingrays are suitcase-sized devices that allow the police to\npinpoint a cellphone’s location to within a few yards by posing as a cell\ntower. They have drawn alarm from privacy advocates, in part because they also\ncan intercept information from the phones of nearly everyone else who happens\nto be nearby.Dozens of police departments from Miami to Los Angeles own\nstingrays, but few have revealed when or how they use them, in large part\nbecause they signed nondisclosure agreements with the FBI. As a result, few\ncourts have weighed in on the circumstances in which the police are permitted\nto use them.The U.S. Justice Department last year ordered federal agents to\nobtain search warrants before using stingrays.Maryland prosecutors can ask the\nstate’s highest court to overturn Wednesday’s decision. Christine Tobar, a\nspokeswoman for the state’s attorney general, said it was “reviewing and\nevaluating next steps.”Even if it stands, the legal road for people imprisoned\non the basis of what the judges declared to be an illegal search is far from\nstraightforward. State law puts strict limits on when and how people serving\nprison sentences can challenge their convictions.“This isn’t some kind of get\nout of jail free card. It might be different case by case,” American Civil\nLiberties Union lawyer Nathan Wessler said. “What’s clear from this opinion is\nthat this secrecy cannot stand.”A Baltimore detective testified last year that\npolice had used their tracking device about 4,300 times since 2007.Wednesday’s\ncourt opinion came in the case of Kerron Andrews, who was charged in a 2014\nshooting. A city judge gave the police a “pen register” order — a court order\nthat does not require the same level of proof as a search warrant —\nauthorizing them to use a stingray to find him. Maryland’s Court of Special\nAppeals ruled that because police had not obtained a search warrant,\nprosecutors could not make use of the evidence they found when Andrews was\narrested.The judges announced their decision nearly a month ago, but did not\nlay out their reasoning or the legal problems with Baltimore’s surveillance\nuntil they delivered a 74-page opinion on Wednesday.A Baltimore court ordered\nAndrews freed on bond while the state decides whether to appeal. His lawyer,\nAssistant Public Defender Deborah Levi, said he could be freed as soon as\nFriday.\n\n","title":"200 imprisoned based on illegal cellphone tracking","twitter":{"body":"Baltimore lawyers identified as many as 200 people who were sent to prison based on  illegal cellphone tracking. https://t.co/u62P5sFi6i","date":"Fri Apr 01 02:10:10 +0000 2016","favs":103,"id":{"$numberLong":"715722895377432576"},"retweets":220},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MF4ZSa"}

But state police confirmed at about 8:40 p.m. that\nDermyer had succumbed to his injuries.Earlier, the trooper and two civilians\nwere transported to Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center for\ntreatment. The two civilians who were shot sustained non-life threatening\ninjuries.Officers responded around 2:45 p.m.to reports of a shooting at the\nGreyhound bus station in the 2900 block of N. BoulevardAccording to police\nsources in Richmond, troopers with the Bureau of Criminal Investigation were\nparticipating in drug interdiction training at the bus station at the time of\nthe shooting.At about 2:40 P.M., Dermyer approached a male just inside the\nstation doors and while Dermyer talked to him, the male pulled out a gun and\nshot him multiple times, Virginia State Police said. As the male fired, two\ntroopers returned fire. The suspect moved to the terminal's restaurant, where\nauthorities were able to take him into custody. He later died at the hospital,\nVirginia State Police said.The troopers were in plain clothes but had guns and\nbadges, sources said.Greyhound says there are two trips from Norfolk every\nday. The first bus leaves at 8 a.m. and a second bus leaves at 12 p.m. and\narrives at 2:30 p.m.Greyhound tweeted Thursday afternoon that the Richmond\nstation is closed until further notice.\"We are actively working with the\nauthorities,\" Greyhound officials stated.A police officer talks with bus\npatrons outside the Greyhound Bus Station in Richmond, Va. Virginia State\nPolice said at least two troopers responding to a shooting at the Richmond bus\nstation and civilian have been taken to a hospital. (Photo: Steve Helber,\nAP)The incident remains under investigation.Governor Terry McAuliffe said in a\nstatement Thursday that he has offered resources to the state police and\nRichmond. \"Our public safety team and I will continue to monitor the situation\nand support State Police and local authorities in their response and\ninvestigation of this incident,\" the governor said. Richmond Mayor Dwight\nJones issued a statement saying he was being briefed on the situation.The\nGreyhound Bus Station is located west of the city’s downtown area, across from\nThe Diamond, Richmond’s minor league baseball stadium and within a former\nindustrial area. It is located on a main thoroughfare connecting a residential\ndistrict to the stadium and nearby restaurants.Brendan Hamilton told the\n_Richmond Times-Dispatch_ he was about to walk into the station when he heard\ntwo loud bangs, then saw flashes of light. He told the newspaper he then heard\nat least five more bangs. People then started to run out of the building, said\nHamilton, 28, who was visiting from Baltimore.Vincent Smith was working next\ndoor to the Greyhound station when he heard sirens and saw police cars buzzing\nby.“The police units just poured in like a river,” said Smith, who works at\nthe U-Haul Moving and Storage facility. “I went to the end of the lot and\nthere must have been 30 units just a block away.”Smith said he saw police\nofficers carrying shields and assault weapons. An officer came by and ordered\nhim and his co-workers to stay inside and lock the doors until they’re told it\nwas safe again. By late afternoon, he said he had been locked inside for about\nan hour and a half.City Councilwoman Reva Trammell called it “the saddest day\nin the city of Richmond.”“State troopers doing their job and innocent people\nshot,” she said. “Why?

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023ea1"},"content":"Why. Just why. (Photo: Ron P. Jaffe, CBS)**The following contains spoilers for\na TV show that aired its series finale two years ago, just FYI.**Two years ago\ntoday, millions of viewers tuned in one last time to at long last  discover\nhow Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) met the mother of his children.But over the course\nof _How I Met Your Mother_’s highly anticipated series finale, that titular\nmother, who fans had been waiting for for nine years, ends up dying young of\nan unspecified disease, and Ted, in middle-age, rekindles a romance with his\nincompatible ex from the start of the show: Robin Scherbatsky (Cobie\nSmulders).The show aired a series finale that went down in television history,\nbut surely not in the way that its creators intended. The decisions to\nminimize the woman the show spent nine seasons teasing and deny Ted the happy\nending he (and we) had been pining for, coupled with unceremoniously ending\nthe marriage between Robin and fan-favorite Barney (Neil Patrick Harris)\noutraged many fans. What exactlywas the _point _of the entire show then?I’m\nnot sure what the point of it was, but I do know one thing: It’s been two\nyears, and I’m still not over it. And the more I think about it, the more it\nbecomes clear that I’m never going to get over it.When the finale aired there\nwas an outcry from fans and critics alike. I was one of them. How? How was it\npossible that this show -- one that I had invested a significant portion of my\nlife in, watching episodes faithfully every Monday night on CBS since it\ndebuted in 2005 -- hurt me so much? Because I did feel hurt. When you have\nsuch a time and emotional investment in a show, it’s hard not to feel\ndownright betrayed when the show doesn't go in a consistent, satisfying and\nquality direction._HIMYM_ does not exist to please me. No show or movie is\nheld solely accountable to where its fans want it to go. But the problem\nwasn’t that it betrayed me or any other loyal fan, but that it betrayed\nitself. In the universe of the show, Robin and Ted ending up together felt\nwrong. There were nine seasons of proof as to why those two were never meant\nto be a couple.  The show worked very hard to convince us of that fact, while\nsimultaneously asking the audience to root for Robin and Barney (we mean, the\n_entire ninth season_ took place over their wedding weekend).  So when the\nmother was ripped away from Ted and Robin was ripped away from Barney, the\naudience got whiplash.I used to laugh like that. (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA\nTODAY)Other shows that have gone out on a sour note (cough _Seinfeld_ cough\n_Lost_ cough), have not tarnished the episodes that came before them. You may\nnot have been on board with the whole purgatory thing on _Lost_, but that\ndoesn't take away from the action or emotion of an exceptional episode, like\nseason four’s \"The Constant.” But the fact that the mother ends up being such\na footnote in Ted’s life _does_ change the way you watch something like the\nshow’s season four finale, “The Leap,” which suggests that a bad year in the\nprotagonist’s life will soon be righted by the appearance of his true love.\nBut according to the finale, his true love was sitting next to him in that\nMacLaren’s booth the whole time.I’ll also admit that I’m bitter. I’m bitter\nbecause I hung on to _HIMYM_ through its disappointing final seasons simply\nbecause the promise of the mother kept me going. I’m bitter because the show’s\nunwavering positivity was such a welcome lift in my life when I needed it, and\nit upended its years-long faith in happy ever after in one hour. I’m bitter\nbecause I can’t re-watch my favorite episodes anymore, the same way you can’t\ngo back to your childhood home after someone else has moved in there. It’s the\nsame, but it’s all wrong.An alternate ending on a DVD box set doesn’t change\nthings, and in fact nothing in the past two years has changed the way I felt\nwatching this episode live, mouth open in disbelief. And apparently, nothing\nwill.\n\n","title":"Why I’m still mad at ‘How I Met Your Mother,’ two years later","twitter":{"body":"\"How was it possible that this show ... hurt me so much?\" @klawls explains the lingering pain of the HIMYM finale. https://t.co/thVr3s7mZL","date":"Fri Apr 01 00:15:13 +0000 2016","favs":30,"id":{"$numberLong":"715693966465884160"},"retweets":20},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MEpUF3"}

On March 22,\nneighboring Belgium was hit by coordinated attacks that left 32 dead. Last\nNov. 13, Islamic militants went on a rampage in the heart of the capital,\nkilling 130 people.  Those attacks followed  mass shootings in January 2015 at\nthe satirical newspaper _Charlie Hebdo_ and a Jewish grocery store, in which\n17 people were killed.Afterward, many wondered how they could have helped the\nwounded, said Christophe Talmet, head of the French Red Cross emergency and\nfirst-aid training program. Talmet coordinated rescue teams during the\nattacks.\"People were saying, 'I have to do something, but I don't know what,'\n\" Talmet said. \"Something happened, people really felt involved — it touched\nthem very deeply.\"As a result, Paris City Hall has been overwhelmed by the\nscale of the public response to its offer of free classes to teach Parisians\nhow they can help save lives before emergency services arrive on the scene.\"We\nhad originally thought we would do this once a year, but we will have to do it\nagain soon,\" said Bernard Jomier, Paris' deputy mayor in charge of health, who\ninitiated the first training event last weekend. \"Our new goal is to give\ninitiation classes to up to 10,000 Parisians this year and to train 10,000\nmore to become qualified rescuers.\"Jomier, a physician who was at Paris\nhospitals the day after the attacks Nov. 13, recalled long lines of people\nwanting to donate blood. The mobilization \"was impressive,\" he said \"to the\npoint that we had to tell them not to go because the stocks were full.\"The\nFrench Red Cross normally offers comprehensive emergency training sessions on\nthe weekends. But two days after the attacks Nov. 13, the number of Parisians\nregistering to attend via the humanitarian organization's website rose by 40%,\nTalmet said. Extra training sessions were set up to cater for the\ndemand.\"People are knocking on our doors, they want to become players,\" Talmet\nsaid.All 3,500 slots were booked during the day-long training sessions\norganized in each of the city's districts, Jomier said.\"What can a citizen do\nin the face of terror, take a weapon, confine himself at home?\" Jomier asked.\n\"Here we tell him, 'You can act. If something terrible happens, you can be\nuseful.' It is the responsibility of the authorities to show them how they can\ndo it.\"Participants said they were grateful for the training.Some 3,500 people\nsigned up for the training organized by city hall in the aftermath of deadly\nterror attacks. (Photo: J. Riffaud/ J. Haller, French Red Cross)\"When I heard\nabout the attacks, I was both scared and sad, even if it wasn’t in my\nneighborhood,\" Prune Lambert, 16, said as she lined up with her family to\nobserve a Red Cross volunteer demonstrating a CPR technique.Lambert's brother,\nPierre, 13, initially didn't understand why his mother insisted he go, but he\nsaid after the training that it would be useful \"should there be another\nattack.\"Patrick Pelloux, a former _Charlie Hebdo_ columnist and emergency\ndoctor, was first on the scene after the shooting at the paper's editorial\noffice. He gave first aid to surviving colleagues and also treated victims of\nthe attacks in November.\"Civilian defense was abandoned after World War II, so\nwe need to reinvent it,\" Pelloux said.In 2004, the French government passed a\nlaw to teach children basic lifesaving skills.   Pelloux said that did not go\nfar enough.Almost half of French citizens  have some first-aid training,\nTalmet said. Still, Northern European countries are better prepared. Ninety-\nfive percent of Norwegians and 80% of Germans are qualified, according to a\nreport in 2009 by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent\nSocieties.\"This training must be made very popular so that people train\nregularly,\" said Pelloux, who worked with the Paris Fire Brigade to help\norganize the training event. \"At least once a year so that people remember\nwhat to do.\"\n\n","title":"With terror in mind, Parisians train to be first responders","twitter":{"body":"Following terror attacks on Europe, Parisians flock to training centers to become first responders.  https://t.co/Wr3roZ1Mo2","date":"Thu Mar 31 21:15:06 +0000 2016","favs":36,"id":{"$numberLong":"715648641629884416"},"retweets":19},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MWZCsc"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023eaa"},"content":"Jess and Ryan Weaver of Elkhart, Indiana, can’t qualify for a mortgage. The\ncouple have a household income of around $70,000 per year, four kids age 7 and\nunder — and $200,000 in combined student loan debt. That makes their total\ndebt high compared to their income — a red flag for lenders.Jess and Ryan, who\nwent to Bethel College in Mishawaka, Indiana, aren’t unusual. They’re part of\na growing group of graduates who are delaying major life milestones because of\ntheir student loan debt, according to a 2015 study by the Boston-based\nnonprofit American Student Assistance.“When we first took out student loans,\nwe couldn’t see the impact it was going to have later in our lives,” Jess\nsays.For others, like Cyndi and Rick Blalock of St. Charles, Missouri, student\nloan debt isn’t debilitating; it’s just a means to an end.“We kind of just\nconsider student loan debt the cost of doing business,” says Cyndi, who owns\nher own dental practice. She and Rick, a chiropractor, had $375,000 in student\nloan debt when they graduated in 2011. But with six-figure incomes and no\nkids, the couple was still able to purchase a home in 2014 through Health Care\nFamily Credit Union, which offers mortgages specifically for healthcare\nprofessionals. And now, after years of aggressive payments, Cyndi and Rick\nhave eliminated around $169,000 of their principal student loan\nbalances.Whether your student loan debt is paralyzing or just a pain, it’s\npossible to ease your burden so you can buy a home, have a family or start a\nbusiness. Here are five ways to get started.Income-driven repayment plans are\none of several solutions the government offers federal student loan borrowers\nwho are struggling with debt. These arrangements — which include income-based\nrepayment, Pay As You Earn and the Revised Pay As You Earn plans — allow\nqualifying borrowers to cap their payments at a percentage of their income,\nand have their remaining debt forgiven after 20 or 25 years of payments.Given\ntheir income and their four kids, the Weavers qualified for an income-based\nrepayment plan that currently allows them not to make payments on their\n$100,000 in federal student loan debt. The couple has to reapply for the plan\nevery year, and if their income increases, they may have to start making\nmonthly payments. But as long as they qualify for income-based repayment – no\nmatter what their monthly payment is – their remaining federal student loan\nbalance will be forgiven at the end of their repayment period.They still pay\naround $900 per month toward their $100,000 in private student loans. Loans\ntaken out from a private lender, rather than the government, aren’t eligible\nfor federal repayment plans. The government offers federal borrowers who’ve\nworked for the government or a nonprofit for 10 years full student loan\nforgiveness. Another federal program partially forgives federal student loans\nfor teachers who work in low-income public schools for five years. You can\nmaximize the amount you’ll save through these programs by making payments on\nan income-driven repayment plan.Deferment and forbearance are both programs\nthat allow certain borrowers to temporarily stop making monthly loan\npayments.The government allows borrowers to defer their federal loans if\nthey’re facing an economic hardship, going back to school or serving in the\nmilitary; it grants forbearance to borrowers with medical issues or other\nfinancial challenges.Some private lenders offer deferment and forbearance, but\ntheir programs aren’t typically as generous as the federal government’s.Rick\nBlalock opened his chiropractic clinic shortly after graduation and didn’t\nturn a profit right away. That qualified him for two years of loan deferment.\nHis loans still accrued interest, but he used the the cash he saved on monthly\npayments to build his business.“Cash flow was so important,” he says. “When\nyou’re starting a new business from scratch, it’s hard to get a bank to give\nyou a loan.”  You can lower your interest rate by refinancing your student\nloans, whether they’re federal or private. However, bear in mind that\nrefinanced federal loans become private and no longer have federal borrower\nprotections and benefits, including access to income-driven repayment plans,\nforgiveness programs, deferment and forbearance.An increasing number of\nemployers, including PricewaterhouseCoopers and Fidelity Investments, are\ncontributing to employees’ student loan payments. A March 2016 NerdWallet\nstudy found that borrowers can save more than $4,000 in interest by taking\nadvantage of this perk.Even if your employer doesn’t officially offer to help\nrepay your student loans as part of your compensation, it doesn’t hurt to\nnegotiate for it, says Kevin Fudge, manager of consumer advocacy and community\naffairs at American Student Assistance.“You never know what’s possible until\nyou ask,” he says.More from NerdWallet:\n\n","title":"Don’t let student loans hold you back: 5 ways to tackle your debt | Campus Beat News for College Students | USA TODAY College","twitter":{"body":"RT @USATODAYcollege: Student debt holding you back?

And we're there,\" said Wasserman. \"The election has become a referendum\non Donald Trump instead of Barack Obama.\"The Democratic Congressional Campaign\nCommittee — the Democrats' House campaign operation —  is not asserting at\nthis point that Democrats will take over the House. But the party clearly\nbelieves the divisiveness of Trump's campaign has opened up new opportunities\nfor its candidates, especially in suburban districts with well-educated voters\nand in districts where the percentage of Latino voters is in double digits.\nNational polls have shown that about 80% of Latino voters have an unfavorable\nview of Trump, as do about 70% of Republicans with college degrees.Among the\ndistricts where Democrats believe they may be able to take advantage of those\ndemographics: Virginia's 10th Congressional District, which is represented by\nRepublican Barbara Comstock and is made up of high-income, highly educated\nsuburban residents and has a growing Hispanic and Asian population; and\nPennsylvania's 8th Congressional District, an open seat that includes affluent\nsuburbs north of Philadelphia.\"The political environment is as unpredictable\nas Trump's explosive rhetoric, but one thing is for sure: House Democratic\ncandidates are ready to seize on the electoral winds at their back, and win\nbig in November,\" said Meredith Kelly, national press secretary for the\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee.But a spokeswoman for the National\nRepublican Congressional Committee said it is too little, too late for\nDemocrats. Democrats have run out of time to field competitive candidates in\nmany states, where the filing deadline to run for Congress has closed, said\nNRCC Communications Director Katie Martin.\"House Democrats' first issue is\nthat they've had recruitment failures across the country,\" Martin said. \"In\nvery competitive races, if they do have a candidate, they are very weak\ncandidates. They have a math problem and they having a filing problem when it\ncomes to deadlines, which makes them taking back the House impossible.\"She\nsaid Republican incumbents running for the House are not focusing on\nTrump.\"Our members are very focused on working for their districts, regardless\nof what's happening anywhere else,\" Martin said. \"I think when you open up any\nlocal newspapers in our members' districts back home, you're going to read\ngreat headlines about what they're accomplishing for their communities.\"Most\nRepublican candidates are doing their best to avoid talking about Trump,\ntrying instead to focus on local issues, said Eric Herzik, chairman of the\npolitical science department at the University of Nevada, Reno.\"A month ago,\nthe safe line for Republican congressional candidates was, 'I'll back the\nRepublican nominee, whomever that is,' \" Herzik said. \"Now that it looks like\nit's going to be Trump or Cruz, the safe line is, 'We still have primary\nstates to go through, we have to see how this plays out, let the people\nspeak.' The other safe thing for them to do is avoid talking about what's\ngoing on in the Republican Party and say, 'We've got to save the nation from\nHillary Clinton.' \"But some GOP candidates in close elections have decided to\ndenounce Trump. Republican Reps. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., and Bob Dold, R-Ill.,\nboth running in Democratic-leaning districts, have said they will never\nsupport Trump. Curbelo has called Trump \"insulting and offensive\" and Dold has\ndenounced him for \"disgusting and offensive\" comments about women, Muslims,\nand Hispanics.Only seven of the 246 Republicans in the House have endorsed\nTrump.Part of the problem for GOP congressional candidates is that Americans\nare increasingly voting party-line, making it unlikely that they would vote\nfor Clinton for president and a Republican for Congress at the same time, said\nJack Pitney, a political science professor at Claremont McKenna College in\nCalifornia.\"That puts the Republican majority in jeopardy, especially in\nsuburban districts, where Trump is about as popular as head lice,\" Pitney\nsaid. \"Trump is definitely going to cause damage for Republicans.

That prompted media reports that cited his\nearlier brush with the law.Seventeen years ago while working for former\nRepublican congressman Robert Ney, Lewandowski was arrested for carrying what\ncourt records say was a loaded pistol, three magazines, a holster and several\nrounds of ammunition in an overnight bag into the Longworth House Office\nBuilding.Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski (Photo: Joe Raedle, Getty\nImages)He was charged with a misdemeanor, claimed it was an accident, and the\ncharges eventually were dismissed. Then for four years he fought to get the\ngun back, filing lawsuits in four District of Columbia and federal\ncourts.After losing in two D.C. courts, Lewandowski tried to recover the gun\nfrom the police department and was again denied. He filed a federal lawsuit\nfor loss of property and mental anguish, seeking $50,000 in damages, but the\njudge ruled it was \"simply an attempt to sue the government again.\" That\nprompted the appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit —\nGarland's court.In May 2003, a panel composed of Garland and conservative\nJudges Douglas Ginsburg and David Sentelle became the fourth court to deny\nLewandowski's effort to recover the gun in a brief, unsigned opinion.Garland,\nnominated earlier this month by President Obama for the Supreme Court seat\nleft vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, has been denounced by the\nNational Rifle Association over two more substantive cases.In 2007, he was\namong several judges who sought to reconsider a three-judge panel's decision\nstriking down the District of Columbia's handgun ban. Conservative critics say\nthat shows he favored the ban. Supporters note that judges often seek\nrehearings simply because of an issue's importance, not because they disagree\nwith the earlier ruling.In 2000, Garland was on a panel that upheld the\nJustice Department's maintenance of background check data for six months. The\nNRA had challenged the policy as constituting a national gun registry.\n\n","title":"Merrick Garland heard Trump campaign manager’s appeal over gun in 2003","twitter":{"body":"RT @richardjwolf: Strange Bedfellows: Trump campaign manager appealed to Merrick Garland over gun in 2003 https://t.co/ATtnKjdCim via @usat…","date":"Thu Mar 31 20:25:27 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715636146458529793"},"retweets":5},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MWPJL7"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023eae"},"content":"WACO, Texas — Jasmin Hernandez, a former Baylor student who claims she was\nsexually assaulted by a former Bears football player, has filed a lawsuit\nagainst the school alleging Title IX violations and negligence by the\nuniversity.Hernandez’s lawyers gave her name to the media to use in reporting\non the case.According to the lawsuit, an alleged victim of former Bears\ndefensive end Tevin Elliott said that she had been raped by the football\nplayer. The lawsuit named the victim as Jane Roe to protect her identity. The\nlawsuit said that Baylor’s chief judicial officer, Bethany McCraw said there\nwas “nothing McCraw could do in response to Roe’s complaint that she had been\nraped by Elliott.”Elliott was convicted of sexual assault and sentenced to 20\nyears in prison and fined $10,000 for crimes while he was at Baylor.The\nlawsuit said McCraw told Roe that she was “the sixth female student to come in\nto McCraw’s office to report that they had been sexually assaulted by\nElliott.” The suit further stated that Baylor coach Art Briles “was aware of\nthe reports.”According to the suit, McCraw allegedly told Roe that there was\n“nothing the school could do for Roe unless there was a court determination\nthat Elliott had indeed raped Roe. Otherwise McCraw said it would come down to\na ‘he said-she said’ situation, and the school could not act on it.”The\nlawsuit stated that Hernandez enrolled at Baylor in the fall 2011 and that on\nApril 15, 2012, she was attending a party at a residence near campus. The suit\nsays Elliott invited Hernandez and her friends to the party as he knew one of\nthe friends.The lawsuit stated that at one point in the evening, Hernandez\nbecame separated from her friends and that Elliott grabbed her by the wrist\nand led her outside. The suit states that as Hernandez continued to protest,\nthe player picked her up over his shoulder and carried her behind a secluded\nshack on the property.According to the lawsuit, one behind the shack, “Elliott\npushed Hernandez up against an embankment, ripped off her pants and began to\nrape her.” The suit says Hernandez began to pull her pants back up and Elliott\ngrabbed her again, pulled her pants back down and raped her again.Hernandez\nwent back into the party and told her friends what had happened and they took\nher to a nearby hospital so a rape kit could be performed, according to the\nsuit. The suit said Hernandez also gave an account of what happened to a Waco\nPolice officer.The lawsuit says Hernandez’s mother arrived to help the next\nday and was turned away for help by: the Baylor Counseling Center, the\npsychology department at Baylor’s Student Health Center, and Baylor’s Academic\nServices Department which allegedly told the mother, ‘If a plane falls on your\ndaughter, there’s nothing we can do to help you.”According to the suit,\nHernandez’s mother and father both contacted Briles’ office multiple times to\nfollow-up on the incident. The suit said the mother received a call saying the\ncoach was looking into it and the father never received a return phone\ncall.The suit said despite Hernandez’s report to several administrative\noffices, “Baylor did not take any action whatsoever to investigate Hernandez’s\nclaims.”The suit accuses Baylor of multiple failures to comply with federal\nlaw, Title IX, and that the school acted “with deliberate indifference towards\nHernandez’s reports of rape to several different Baylor departments as\nreflected by Defendants’ actions and inaction alleged herein.”The lawsuit also\nalleged that a former member of Baylor’s advisory board that “reviewed sexual\nassault response issues with community leaders has publicly stated that Baylor\nofficials have known abou the larger problem of sexual assaults committed by\nstudent-athletes for years.” The suit said the former member is a nurse who\n“has estimated that despite only making up 4% of the student population at\nBaylor, male student-athletes are responsible for 25% to 50% of all reported\nassaults that occur at Baylor.”Baylor had another player convicted of sexual\nassault last year. Defensive end Sam Ukwuachu was convicted of sexually\nassaulting a Baylor student following a football game against Iowa State in\n2013. The victim in that case reached a settlement with the university late in\n2015._Follow Tim Kephart on Twitter: @timkephart33_\n\n","title":"Ex-student files Title IX lawsuit against Baylor over alleged sexual assault","twitter":{"body":"RT @USATODAYsports: Former student files Title IX lawsuit against Baylor over alleged sexual assault: https://t.co/6mXXPvACWA https://t.co/…","date":"Thu Mar 31 20:25:20 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715636114380484608"},"retweets":18},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MEDice"}

And the Queen Bee’s renewed buzz can be only mean one\nthing: Another edge-snatching album is upon us.Beyoncé's camp previously\nconfirmed the album would drop sometime in April, which got us thinking, “Why\n_not_ this Monday (April 4)?”Here’s the calculated reasoning behind our\nprediction.Beyoncé has largely eschewed interviews over the course of the last\ntwo years, relying instead on a painstakingly curated social media profile and\nHBO documentary, quiet contributions to grassroots movements campaigning\nagainst systemic racism, and sumptuous music video visuals that leave critics\nwringing their hands in a bid to parse through her embedded political\nmessages. And yet, on the verge of increasing clamor about her sixth studio\nalbum, Bey agrees to a cover story. The _Elle_ profile (on newsstands and\nonline April 4) is either incredibly serendipitous or incredibly strategic.\nBased on the mogul's business savvy, we’re inclined to lean toward the\nlatter.Time is running out for Beyoncé to release new music before her\n_Formation_ world tour kicks off April 27 in Miami. Of course, nothing's\nstopping her from touring without new material. But we're not talking about an\namateur here — we're talking about _Beyoncé_, one of music's savviest\nmarketers, who's ascended the pop music throne by making sure there's always\nsomething new for her fans to buzz about. Launching a tour without releasing\nan album first? Both we and Bey know that's a wasted opportunity.From the\n_Formation_ video's pointed police brutality references to Bey's Black Panther\nhomage at the Super Bowl, all signs point toward Beyoncé highlighting social\njustice issues on her new album. And April 4 marks an important and tragic\nanniversary for the BLM movement — it's the one-year anniversary of the death\nof Walter Scott, who was killed by police after a traffic stop in South\nCharleston on April 4, 2015. Combined with the rumors that Bey will honor\nTrayvon Martin, Tamir Rice and Mike Brown in one of her new music videos,\nremembering Scott by releasing her album on the 4th isn't beyond the realm of\npossibility.Beyoncé previously opened up about the significance of the number\n4 during her press tour for her fourth studio album, the aptly titled _4_.\nDuring an July 2011 interview with _Good Morning America_, the singer\nexplained: \"My birthday is on the fourth. My mother's birthday is on the\nfourth. My husband's (Jay Z) birthday is on the fourth. I got married on the\nfourth.\" So, why not debut her highly anticipated LP on the fourth day of the\nfourth month of the year — a day which also marks her 8th anniversary with\nJay? It's only right.\n\n","title":"4 reasons to believe Beyoncé's album may drop on April 4","twitter":{"body":"RT @usatodaylife: 4 reasons to believe Beyoncé's album may drop on April 4 https://t.co/6IzcSH6i7S https://t.co/SbPPE9i8hc","date":"Thu Mar 31 20:22:34 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715635418033729540"},"retweets":18},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MWS2xQ"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023eb0"},"content":"Each day seems to bring a new reason for Republican leaders to contemplate how\nthey might derail Donald Trump at the GOP convention, along with hand-wringing\nover whether it would be appropriate to violate the will of the people — or at\nleast the will of most Republican primary voters. But there is one group that\nwould wholeheartedly support party officials: the Founding Fathers.The\nFounders were far more worried about a demagogue seizing power than they were\nabout following the voice of the people. Most important, they clearly intended\nthe election of the president to be well-insulated from a direct expression of\nthe popular will. That is why we have the Electoral College, which was\ndesigned to temper the sometimes clamorous voice of the people.Although this\nhas led several times to candidates winning the popular vote but losing the\nelection, most recently in the case of Al Gore in 2000, the Founders would not\nnecessarily have had a problem with such a result. They were far more worried\nabout too much democracy than they were about too little democracy.The reason\nfor this was simple: The Founders did not entirely trust the people, who were\ntoo likely to be ruled by their passions, rather than guided by their reason.\nAs James Madison wrote, “It is a misfortune, inseparable from human affairs,\nthat public measures are rarely investigated with that spirit of moderation\nwhich is essential to a just estimate of their real tendency to advance or\nobstruct the public good; and that this spirit is more apt to be diminished\nthan promoted by those occasions which require an unusual exercise of it.”No\none would argue that “spirit of moderation” has presided over the Republican\nnomination contest. Much as Madison and the other Founders feared, passion\ninstead of reason is the driving force this election cycle, as the recent\nviolence at political rallies has amply confirmed.The figure whom the Founders\nmost feared was the demagogue, whose inflammatory rhetoric stirred the very\npassions that the Founders hoped to control — a fairly apt description of\nTrump’s campaign to date. That is one of the main reasons the Constitution\ncontains so many roadblocks to the direct expression of the people’s will.\nMuch of Madison’s Federalist No. 10 is an outline for how the new republic\nwould control demagogues. Enlarging the size of the nation would help “to\nrefine and enlarge the public views” and make it more difficult for “men of\nfactious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs” to use\n“intrigue (to) betray the interests of the people,” he wrote.In other words,\nmany of the checks and balances built into the Constitution were put there\nprecisely so that people such as Trump would not be able to win an election.\nActually, the Founders feared men such as Patrick Henry, with his impassioned\nand persuasive oratory, although I believe they'd have found Henry a virtual\nPericles compared with The Donald.**POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice,\nmedia**The role of political parties in all of this complicates matters\nsomewhat but would not have changed their overall view. The Founders almost\nuniversally hated political parties and were deeply distressed when the new\nrepublic quickly gave rise to protoparties (true political parties in the way\nthat we think about them did not exist until well into the 19th century). As\nThomas Jefferson wrote, “If I could not go to heaven but with a party, I would\nnot go there at all.” For the Founders, the problem with a political party was\nthat it went directly against the kind of dispassionate reason they hoped\nwould guide all political debates by requiring men to hew to the party line,\nregardless of their conscience.What would the Founders have thought of party\nleaders who undermined their own nominating process to keep a man such as\nTrump from winning? They'd likely have congratulated them for doing exactly\nwhat wise statesmen are supposed to do — dampening the passions and allowing\nreason to rule.The Founders found many ways to bridle the voice of the people\nto avoid what they saw as the “excesses of democracy,” particularly when it\ncame to the office of the presidency. They'd undoubtedly find fault with this\nelection season, but not with Republicans for subverting their own nominating\nprocess._Andrew Trees is an adjunct professor of history at Carthage College\nand author of _The Founding Fathers \u0026amp; the Politics of Character._In\naddition to its own editorials, USA TODAY publishes diverse opinions from\noutside writers, including our __Board of Contributors__.

GunTV also will sell ammunition, firearm accessories and outdoor\napparel.It has not yet been announced what television providers or channels\nwill carry the controversial shopping channel, so it is unclear who will\nactually be able to tune in. However, the channel also will be broadcast on\nthe GunTV website.GunTV is filming in a renovated television studio in\nThousand Palms, Calif., formerly known as the Palm Springs Film Factory, that\nwas designed for a cooking show or commercials. The channel's founders are\nDoug Bornstein and Valerie Castle, a couple with professional backgrounds in\nshopping networks who live in Rancho Mirage, Calif.“We are very excited to\nbring our new concept of shopping for firearms and accessories to live\ntelevision,\" Castle said in a news release. \"Our unique platform allows\nindustry manufacturers to showcase products through our talented and\nexperienced on-air hosts. Viewers will receive in-depth, entertaining product\ndemonstrations, and see the products in action, an important component of the\npurchasing decision.”The development of GunTV became public knowledge in\nNovember when _The (Palm Springs, Calif.) Desert Sun_, which like USA TODAY is\nowned by Gannett Co. Inc., broke a story revealing that the network was\nsetting up in the Coachella Valley. A few weeks later, two Islamic State-\ninspired terrorists killed 14 people in San Bernardino, a city only an hour's\ndrive from the Thousand Palms filming location. The nationwide debate over gun\ncontrol came to focus on the Inland Empire, with national media criticizing\nthe shopping channel as ill-timed.Soon after, GunTV's launch was delayed. The\nshopping channel grew quiet, stopping all public statements and social media\npostings, until the channel's launch was abruptly announced in a news release\nThursday morning.According to the release, GunTV will dedicate three minutes\nof every hour to firearms safety.“We understand that the more informed we are\nas consumers, the better purchasing decisions we make,\" Castle said in the\nrelease. \"At GunTV, safety is our number one priority.GunTV appears to be\nmodeled after existing shopping channels, such as the Home Shopping Network\nand QVC TV, but will face more stringent restrictions. Unlike the jewelry,\ncommemorative coins or decorative plates sold on other channels, firearms\ncan’t be mailed across state lines or sold to just anyone.To work within gun\nlaws, GunTV won’t actually sell firearms directly to its viewers. Instead,\nwhen a viewer calls GunTV, the network will place an order on behalf of that\nviewer with Sports South, a Louisiana firearms distributor. Sports South will\nthen ship the weapon to a local gun store, where it can be purchased as normal\nby the viewer.In a prior interview, an official from the Law Center to Prevent\nGun Violence said the sales process appears to adhere to the laws that\nregulate gun sales. However, she still argued that GunTV was trivializing the\nsale of firearms.“Buying a gun is a serious decision,” said Laura Cutilletta,\nsenior staff attorney for the Law Center. “If you are going to buy a gun for\nyour home, it’s not a decision you should be making at three in the morning\nbecause you are watching TV.”_Follow Brett Kelman on Twitter: @TDSbrettkelman\n_\n\n","title":"Want to buy a gun on your couch at 3 a.m.?

Nor does\nit mean you necessarily have to start in at the beginning of this now 12-book\nseries; there are other entry points that would allow you to move backwards\nand forwards, if you so choose.But taken together with its equally good\nimmediate predecessor _A Dangerous Place, Journey_ serves as a bridge that\ntakes the series' main character, World War I nurse turned psychologist and\ninvestigator Maisie Dobbs, into a new chapter of her life. And like most\ntransitions, this one has more impact if you know what came before.More\nperhaps than any book so far, _Journey_ finds Maisie in a reflective mood,\ntaking stock of prior cases and retracing prior steps. Newcomers might find\nthe effort confusing, but no one should find it repetitive: Winspear is\nunearthing new riches buried deeper in old ground, as Maisie comes to realize\nthat some of her views on past events were wrong, or at least one-sided.Author\nJacqueline Winspear. (Photo: Stephanie Mohan)Set in 1938, _Journey_ continues\nto follow the havoc wreaked by the First World War as the world makes its\ninexorable way toward the Second. Maisie, however, is seeking a break from\nworld events, returning to England and, she hopes, some degree of normalcy\nafter the death of her husband and child.Friends and enemies alike seek her\nout, however, and she’s soon off to Munich on an undercover mission for the\nBritish government. As _Journey_ is a mystery, you expect things will not go\nas planned. What you may not expect is the inventiveness of Winspear’s twists,\nthe on-edge excitement they provoke, or the philosophical issues and\npsychological depths they allow her to explore.There are some great new\ncharacters we may hope to see again, along with an antagonist who is a more\ninteresting creation than your standard stock Nazi villain. Where _Journey_\ntruly shines, though, is in Winspear’s recreation of a citizenry on the brink\n— some caught up in and rushing toward madness, others shrinking back, hoping\nit will pass.Like its heroine, this is an intelligent, tough but compassionate\nbook, one that immerses us in history without swamping us in details or excess\nforeshadowing. Maisie is on a journey of self-reclamation, and if that\ninvolves feeling lost at times, that’s fine with a woman who has learned never\nto fear going in circles because “the next time around, you’ll see something\nyou missed before.”For Maisie fans, the next time around can’t come soon\nenough.\n\n","title":"Take this 'Journey to Munich' with Maisie Dobbs","twitter":{"body":"RT @BiancoRobert: Take this 'Journey to Munich' with Maisie Dobbs: https://t.co/b5MCEHL47x via @usatoday","date":"Thu Mar 31 19:58:10 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715629280336748544"},"retweets":6},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MEEnAL"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023eb4"},"content":"FOSTER CITY, Calif. — When it comes to TVs, the mantra is simple. It’s the\npicture quality, stupid.But life in the real world isn’t always that easy.\nThere are many different factors that can influence what your eyes actually\nperceive when they’re looking at various TV screens. Sure, the quality of the\nTV itself probably has the biggest influence, but the quality of the source\nmaterial plays a nearly equal role.Each of these elements, in turn, is\ninfluenced by a number of supporting pieces. On the TV side, there’s the type\nof technology used (LCD, OLED, etc.), the screen resolution, color range,\ncontrast ratio and much more. On the content side, quality goes all the way\nback to how the material was first recorded, edited, encoded and stored, and\nthen the means of distribution. Even the bandwidth of a network connection if\nthe source is being streamed.Frankly, it’s enough to confuse just about\neveryone.Thankfully, the TV and content industries have recognized the\nchallenge and are working on means to make things simpler. Even better, the\nfruits of those efforts are just starting to come to market. The problem is,\nthere are a few of these consumer-friendly monikers that vendors are now\nusing.Probably the biggest effort comes from the UHD (Ultra High Definition)\nAlliance — a group of more than 35 consumer electronics, broadcast and film\nproduction companies — and it’s called UltraHD Premium.The original work on\nthe alliance and its logo program — meaning products that meet the\ncertification can carry the UltraHD Premium logo on their packaging — started\nat CES 2015 and at this year’s CES, the logo became official. The UltraHD\nstandard covers TVs and BluRay players on the hardware side, and recorded and\nstreamed video on the content side.Dolby has come up with a somewhat similar\ncertification program of its own that it calls Dolby Vision, which also has a\nlogo. Finally, some companies, notably Sony, are sticking with labeling of\ntheir own. In Sony’s case, it's using 4K HDR.Despite the potential confusion,\nwhat unites all of these different efforts is not just an increase in\nresolution to 4K — more than four times the resolution of standard HD — but\nimprovements in the quality of each of those 4 million pixels. Specifically,\nthe visual improvements involve two key elements: a higher dynamic range\nbetween light and dark signals, hence HDR, and a broader range of colors —\nsometimes called a wider color gamut.Sony's X900C ultra-slim 4K UHD TV seen at\nthe 2015 International CES at the Las Vegas Convention Center. (Photo: David\nBecker, Getty Images)Together, the greatly improved contrast ratio offered by\nHDR and the increase to more than 1 billion possible colors, thanks to what’s\ncalled 10-bit color, offer a visually noticeable improvement even over\nstandard 4K TVs.Arguably the HDR and color gamut features are much more\nimportant to overall picture quality than the resolution increase of 4K\nbecause they can be seen from any distance on any size screen. Appreciating\nthe resolution enhancements of 4K alone, on the other hand, often requires an\nuncomfortably up-close glance at a large screen.That’s why the recent\nintroduction of these enhanced UHD (Ultra HD) specs, which combine both 4K\nresolution along with HDR and a 10-bit (or higher) color gamut, is a bigger\ndeal than the introduction of 4K. (To be clear, not all 4K or even UHD TVs\nfeature HDR or a wider color range. You need to specifically look for those\nfeatures.) The new TVs that meet these specs from vendors like LG, Samsung,\nSony, Panasonic, Vizio and others offer stunning images, particularly when\ncombined with new Ultra HD Premium or Dolby Vision-logo’d content.Of course,\nto get the full impact, you need to be on the lookout for high-resolution\naudio capable components (sometimes called HD Audio), as well as Dolby’s new\nAtmos audio surround specification support as well.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023eb5"},"content":"If the networks don’t want us to rush to judgment, they should make rushing\nmore difficult.Consider CBS’s _Rush Hour _(Thursday, 10 ET/PT, ** out of\nfour), a dispiriting, derivative buddy-cop comedy based on the hit movie\nfranchise starring Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker. Which means odds are good\nyou'll come to the series knowing that most shows based on movies don’t work,\nand will leave thinking _Rush Hour_ does not feel like an exception, in large\npart because Jon Foo and Justin Hires feel like awfully bland substitutes for\nChan and Tucker.Now to be fair, many of us — myself included — reached similar\nconclusions about CBS’s _Limitless_, which has become one of the network's\nbrighter lights. Even in its flawed pilot, however, _Limitless_ showed a gift\nfor inventive storytelling that's missing here.Here's another difference:\nRather than try to shove Jake McDorman into the role played by Bradley Cooper\nin the film, _Limitless_ created a new character for him, which helped lessen\nthe inevitable comparisons. _Rush _seems to be begging us to compare old to\nnew — and in Thursday's premiere, \"new\" doesn't fare so well. Indeed, it\nbarely even registers.John Foo as Detective Lee, Justin Hires as Detective\nCarter, and Wendie Malick as Captain Lindsay Cole in 'Rush Hour.' (Photo:\nRichard Cartwright, CBS)Here, however, is one more _Limitless_ lesson worth\nlearning: It’s never wise to count an actor out. Those of us who assumed that\nMcDorman could not carry_ Limitless _have been proved wrong: He's turned out\nto be one of the season’s most engaging performers. So we should avoid making\nthe same assumptions about Foo and Hires because who knows — given better\nmaterial and more time to develop their own takes on the characters, perhaps\nthey’ll improve.But goodness, they have a steep climb ahead of them.Foo plays\nHong Kong Detective Lee, sent to Los Angeles to retrieve some stolen objects\nand, he hopes, a missing person. He’s teamed with Hires’ Detective Carter,\nwho’s assigned the job as punishment by his boss, Captain Cole (Wendie Malick,\none of the best reasons to retain hope). Naturally, the Captain is exasperated\nby Carter’s tendency to break the rules, as well she (and we) should be,\nbecause there's no more by-the-book TV than a cop who doesn't behave by the\nbook.Even without seeing the film, you can probably guess where_ Rush Hour_ is\nheaded, as it does nothing to subvert a single stereotype or cliche. Lee is\nlaconic and, in his halting English, a bit sardonic. Hires is over-stimulated,\nchatty and funny, or at least written as funny. They clash, but of course they\nwill bond: there isn’t a second episode if they don’t.Justin Hires as\nDetective Carter and John Foo as Detective Lee are partners in 'Rush Hour.'\n(Photo: Neil Jacobs, CBS)Perhaps by that point, the show will begin to\nestablish its own identity and the stars will begin to seem a little more at\nease and a lot more distinctive. We’ll just have to try to remember that\npatience is a virtue.Just as CBS had better remember that our patience is not\nlimitless.\n\n","title":"Review: Don't rush to see CBS's 'Rush Hour' remake","twitter":{"body":"Critic @BiancoRobert advises: Don't rush to see CBS' \"Rush Hour\" remake. https://t.co/PnMUUvyoSf","date":"Thu Mar 31 19:30:14 +0000 2016","favs":11,"id":{"$numberLong":"715622249794048000"},"retweets":8},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MSQxAE"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023eb8"},"content":"LOS ANGELES – Kobe Bryant has seen enough the past two decades to realize the\neffect that twists of fate can have on a career. Or the twist of a knee.“The\nsports gods have a sense of humor,” Bryant told USA TODAY Sports. “That’s what\nI think. It is pretty amazing that it seems like in sports you always have\nthose weird connections.”For Bryant, who is retiring after an historic 20-year\nNBA career, one of those connections dates back to when he was just 3 years\nold.It involved Mitch Kupchak. The Los Angeles Lakers general manager since\n2000, Kupchak also played in the NBA for nine seasons. In 1981, he was signed\nby the Lakers to a seven-year, $5.6 million contract — big money for that era\n— and expected to be a key member of a team that would go on to win the NBA\ntitle. But that ended in December 1981.“My first year in L.A. we were playing\nthe San Diego Clippers,” Kupchak said. “Magic (Johnson) kind of shuffled me\nthe ball for a layup and a player stepped in front of me to draw a charge.“So\nI tried to stop rather than get the charge and have a big collision, but I\ncouldn’t stop so I ended up injuring my knee, tumbling into this player and\ngoing on the floor together.”Kupchak missed the rest of the season and the\nfollowing one. Coach Pat Riley promoted Kurt Rambis to a starting position and\nowner Jerry Buss soon traded for another big man, Bob McAdoo. Both would play\na crucial role on that championship team. However, the long-term effects were\neven greater.Although Kupchak came back to play an additional three seasons\nwith the Lakers, appearing in 147 games, he was never the same. But he stayed\nwith the team, even after retirement, going to business school, working as\nassistant GM to Jerry West, then eventually taking over the main job.It was\nthen his path began to intertwine with that of Bryant, though things were\nfairly straightforward at first, with Bryant and Shaquille O’Neal forming an\nunstoppable combination that produced three titles from 2000-'02.However,\nO’Neal’s departure in 2004 left the Lakers at a crossroads. The fruitless\nyears that followed caused Bryant to demand a trade – unless Kupchak could do\nsomething to turn things around.“I was pissed,” Bryant said. “Not even kind\nof, it was fury. I had to win a championship without Shaquille O’Neal. It was\njust the challenge. It wasn’t fair. But it is what it is. That was just an\nobsession.“So I (wasn’t) going to sit here and play for this organization, no\nmatter how beautiful the city is, no matter how much I love the franchise. I\n(was) out here scoring 40-50 points, breaking my back trying to win, and money\n(was) not being spent on getting talent here to win a championship.”Bryant\nflirted with joining the Clippers, thought about the Chicago Bulls and\neventually stayed in purple and gold. His faith was rewarded when Kupchak\ntraded for Pau Gasol, laying the foundation for a new double act that would\nlead to two more titles, in 2009 and '10.Kupchak says he was aware of the\ntension.“We were stuck in a period where he was in his prime and we were a\nplayoff team but we were not good enough to get where he wanted to go,”\nKupchak said. “So the frustration reared its head. (Then) we got lucky with\nthe Pau deal and for him that put him back in the finals.”Bryant, at the time,\nsummed up his thoughts by telling the _Los Angeles Times_ that Kupchak had\ngone “from an F to an A-plus.”Nowadays Kupchak shakes his head when he\nreflects on the way things turned out. He admits it is unlikely he would have\nended up as a GM, anywhere, let alone the Lakers, had his playing career\npanned out the way he wanted it to.“In terms of Laker lore and winning\nchampionships, maybe my injury was a good thing,” Kupchak said.He still\nremembers the missed step that caused his knee to buckle. He can visualize the\nplay, and almost feel the pain. And he certainly remembers the San Diego\nClippers player, a blameless participant, who stood in his path and caused him\nto change direction before his knee crumpled beneath him.It was Joe\n“Jellybean” Bryant, Kobe’s father.\n\n","title":"How the twist of a knee brought Kobe Bryant, Lakers GM together","twitter":{"body":"How the twist of a knee brought together Kobe Bryant and the Lakers GM. https://t.co/gIgZZhUtOf","date":"Thu Mar 31 18:55:08 +0000 2016","favs":16,"id":{"$numberLong":"715613414278692865"},"retweets":10},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1ME2K1x"}

In 2015, with an\nassist from the European Space Agency, he placed a small mosaic in the\nInternational Space Station.Although he’s not entirely predictable (the No. 1\ntrait of any street artist), his signature spot in Paris is near the classic,\nblue street signs on the corners of buildings, a good reminder to lift your\neyes on your next stroll through Paris.And the next?“There are still some good\nspots waiting for my intervention,” he says.\n\n","title":"Space Invaders: Delightful mosaics left by elusive Paris street artist","twitter":{"body":"RT @usatodaytravel: Space Invaders in Paris: Elusive street artist leaves delightful mosaics https://t.co/nxKzUsyDtr https://t.co/J28MYxTBOO","date":"Thu Mar 31 17:25:16 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715590800042627072"},"retweets":17},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1UFlKj6"}

Humana spokesman Mark Mathis said the\ninsurer believes agents are \"an important source of information and guidance,\"\nbut it sometimes makes \"changes in order to maintain sustainable and\naffordable health plans for our members.\"Others say insurers are cutting\ncommissions to save money by reducing the number of sick people who\nenroll.\"Many states are looking at doing whatever can do to support to agents\nin their states and not allow health plans to game their commissions so they\nenroll only healthy people,\"  Peter Lee, executive director of the Covered\nCalifornia exchange, said in an interview. \"It flies in the face of the ACA\n... to say in code to agents, 'Don’t bring us sick people', or to make it\nharder for some.to enroll.\"People who lose their jobs are most likely to\nquickly sign up for insurance if they're sick, says Larry Levitt, senior vice\npresident of the Kaiser Family Foundation, who has discussed the issue with\ninsurance company actuaries and state and federal ACA exchange\nofficials.Insurance agents now enroll about half of those who buy insurance on\nthe government exchanges. Low-income people, who tend to have more health\nproblems, need to buy their plans on the government websites to get federal\nsubsidies and often need the most help.Aetna, United Healthcare and Cigna have\nall complained they're losing money on ACA plans and enrollment drops off\nsharply as subsidies fall. A study out Tuesday by the  Blue Cross Blue Shield\nAssociation found the cost of medical care for those newly enrolled in ACA\nplans were 19% higher in 2014 and 22% higher in 2015 than those who were\ninsured through employer plans by BCBS companies those years.The Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) called the report \"seriously flawed,\" in\nlarge part because those with serious health problems trying to buy individual\ninsurance could be discriminated against because of their conditions before\nthe ACA took effect.Insurance was supposed to be easier to buy, Lee and Levitt\nsay, so it was assumed agents would not be needed to buy ACA plans. The\nopposite happened, however, as fewer states created their own exchanges than\nexpected, the federal Healthcare.gov site had massive problems and Republicans\nin Congress kept the federal government from hiring more \"navigators\" to help\npeople navigate the site and health insurance system to buy policies, says\nLevitt.Despite improvements with the exchanges, many consumers still need\nhelp, says Lee, who acknowledges he was wrong the exchanges would \"make buying\ninsurance as easy as buying a book on Amazon.\"The process is especially\nconfusing for consumers eligible for subsidies. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of\nMichigan, which still pays commissions, has found that 80% of consumers are\neligible for subsidies, but only 40% know that when they first contact the\ncompany, spokesman Andy Hetzel says.\"If insurance agents are not paid, the\nconsumer loses because they have to travel down this road alone without an\nexpert,\" agrees Ronnell Nolan, CEO of Health Agents for America.Some insurers,\nincluding Humana, have dropped commissions on different types of plans in\ndifferent states, especially gold and platinum plans, which Levitt says\nattract people with the most health problems because of their low deductibles.\nWhile Humana dropped commissions on these plans after open enrollment ends,\nothers including United Healthcare nearly eliminated them altogether for 2016\nplans for individuals and families. Aetna recently eliminated commissions on\nall new individual plans with effective dates between March 31 and Dec.\n31.Katherine Hempstead, director of the health insurance coverage team at the\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation, says cutting commissions is a \"cry for help\"\nby insurers that shouldn't be ignored. (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA\nTODAY)Katherine Hempstead, director of the insurance coverage team at the\nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation, says dropping commissions should be seen as a\n\"cry for help\" by insurers as it shows they are \"signaling that in the current\nmarket there are some products that they really don't want to sell.\"Insurers\nhave criticized the federal government for allowing customers to abuse the\nspecial periods by signing up for insurance when they needed health care and\nthen dropping insurance after the crises had passed. CMS recently limited the\ncircumstances that allow people to sign up for the special enrollment\nperiods.A bill passed the Georgia House last week that would require insurers\nthere to pay agents a minimum commission, but it failed to make it through the\nSenate. The Louisiana state House is expected to vote on a bill within days\nthat would require insurers to give agents 90 days notice before dropping\ncommissions.Under the ACA, insurers have to spend 85% of premiums on medical\ncare, leaving only 15% for overhead, including commissions. Insurers started\nreducing the size of commissions soon after the law passed.Pennsylvania state\nRep. Frank Farry, a Republican, is researching whether to introduce\nlegislation requiring insurers to pay commissions, but worries that requiring\nthem to spend a portion of the 15% on commissions could \"put them in a\npinch.\"Peter Lee, executive director of Covered California, that state's\nhealth insurance exchange, told federal regulators commission should be\nrequired. (Photo: Covered California)Earlier this year, the Connecticut\nInsurance Department blocked United Healthcare from eliminating commissions\nbecause the company included them in its 2016 rate filing that was approved.\nThe insurer instead reduced its commission from $20 to $10 a month.Colorado\nand California both require commissions for agents.Lee, of Covered California,\nurged Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell in January to mandate\nminimum commissions year-round to prevent insurers from steering certain\nconsumers from their plans.CMS spokesman Aaron Albright declined to comment\nabout the commission cuts, but said in an emailed statement that, “Whether\nthrough HealthCare.gov, the call center, navigators, enrollment through an\nagent or web broker, consumers have many channels to choose from most\nconvenient to them.\"\n\n","title":"Insurers cut commissions to restrict when and what plans people buy","twitter":{"body":"RT @rlocker12: Insurers cut commissions to restrict when and what plans people buy. @JayneODonnell lays it out here. https://t.co/H0ey18gtgR","date":"Thu Mar 31 15:23:27 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715560142268469248"},"retweets":14},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MW1Xnq"}

I thought, finally — _finally_ — you had accepted reality.“I played\nthrough a lot of injuries, I played through some situations I probably\nshouldn’t have,” Tiger said earlier this March, adding that he was taking\nthings slow and had no timeline for return. “I cost myself some\ntournaments…I’ve cost myself months and years because of it. That’s what\nathletes do. They play through pain.”But now the Masters is almost upon us and\npeople are starting to wonder if Tigercould make a sneaky appearance. All\nsigns would suggest “no,” but there’s enough reasonable doubt to keep the\nflames of the Twitterverse roaring hot.Tiger Woods’ agent, Mark Steinberg,\nsaid the 14-time major champ was “absolutely not” practicing at Augusta\nNational last week amid rumours he was, but added to Golf Channel that there\nwas “no further update” on his general condition. He’s still yet to officially\nwithdraw from Masters field, which is getting everyone excited, so much so\nthat now people are interpreting this “coming home” tweet as a cryptic\nforeshadowing of an imminent Augusta return.Coming back to my roots.

Not a young gun by any stretch of the imagination, but he\nstill conceivably has 10 years of PGA Tour golf left in him. Even if he\ndoesn’t even think about touching a club for the rest of this year and targets\na return in 2017, he could still play the equivalent of three average-length\nNFL careers.Tiger Woods can’t beat a back injury; the only way he can succeed\nis if he fully heals and figures out a way to prevent further injury going\nforward. And to do that, he needs to go slow. Really slow.Making a dramatic\nreturn at the Masters may be tempting for Woods, but he needs to remember that\ntime is on his side more than he realizes. If he truly cares about closing-out\nhis career on a high note, he needs to have the strength to say no next week.\n\n","title":"Tiger Woods should absolutely not play in the Masters | For The Win","twitter":{"body":"Tiger playing the Masters would be a huge mistake https://t.co/STir3UPhOX","date":"Thu Mar 31 14:59:41 +0000 2016","favs":15,"id":{"$numberLong":"715554162931425280"},"retweets":13},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1RMMRor"}

You can’t just roll out of bed and\nput the suit on,” Affleck _said during a red-carpet premier_ for the film.\n“Audiences expect you to look like a superhero. And that took me about a year\nof training to do.”From West’s Batman to Affleck’s version of the Dark Knight,\nand from George Reeve’s 1950s portrayal of Superman to Cavil’s Man of Steel\ntoday, every on-screen iteration of both heroes seems to get bigger and\nbrawnier.Here’s a look at how Batman and Superman have bulked up over the\nyears:According to _Muscle \u0026amp; Fitness_, Cavill bulked up to about 190\npounds for his Superman debut in 2013's _Man of Steel_, cutting down to about\n6% body fat. Before filming the shirtless scenes, Cavil pushed his body fat to\n3-4%  \nBefore stepping into Christopher Reeves’ red boots for this revival of the\noriginal Superman series, Brandon Routh wasn’t big on lifting weights.  “When\nyou’re new to it, your body really can put on a lot more muscle easier the\nfirst time,” Routh _told Men’s Fitness._ He said that he “put on 20 to 25\npounds in about five to six months.”When Tom Welling brought Superman’s\nyounger days to the small screen, the TV drama’s producers made sure he stayed\nswoon-worthy. Welling wasn’t allowed to gain weight, according to a profile in\n_Seventeen_, and couldn’t even play pickup basketball. \"What would happen if I\ngot a black eye?\" Welling said.Credit Dean Cain’s physique in the '90s TV\nseries to his days as a football player. Cain played defensive back at\nPrinceton before signing with the Buffalo Bills in the late '80s. But a knee\ninjury prevented Cain from ever playing in the NFL, which led him to\nacting.Filmmakers behind the classic _Superman_ series first thought\nChristopher Reeve was “too young and maybe even too skinny” for the role,\n_according to one documentary_. Reeve recalled wearing a giant shetland\nsweater to his audition to hide his “string bean” physique. After landing the\nrole, he hit the weights and ate four times a day, mixing a meat-heavy diet\nwith vitamin pills.In this TV series, Reeves’ barrel-chested Superman\ndisplayed a classic physique that seems almost quaint by today’s superhero\nstandards. But even he had help, using a padded suit that augmented his size,\naccording to _Den of Geek__._At 43, Ben Affleck is the oldest actor to debut\nas Batman. He’s also the biggest. He points to daily 6 a.m. workouts and the\ndo-or-die pressure that comes with donning the iconic cowl. “I knew the camera\nwas going to be looking at me, and the guillotine was there so I knew I had to\nbe ready,” said Affleck, who claimed he gained 20 pounds of muscle for the\nrole.When cast as Batman, Christian Bale weighed 130 pounds, thanks to a\nprevious role as an insomniac, _Today__ notes_. It took him six months to pack\non 100 pounds before his debut in 2005’s _Batman Begins_, which ended up being\n_too_ much muscle for director Christopher Nolan.“(I was) eating, just eating\nlike crazy, just trying to put on pounds and pounds and pounds,” Bale told\n_Sci-Fi Wire_. \"I actually went … way overboard. By the time I arrived in\nEngland, you know, Chris kind of looked at me in shock and kind of went, 'God,\nyou're like some grizzly bear.'”In sequels to Tim Burton's _Batman_ movies,\nboth of these actors inherited the rubber-muscled Batsuits made famous by\nMichael Keaton. And while both filled them out just fine, we just remember one\nthing: the nipples. Their Batsuits had nipples. Why?Tim Burton’s modernization\nof Batman for the big screen debuted a suit with rubberized muscles, requiring\nlittle of the wearer's physique. Keaton had played mostly comedic roles before\n_Batman_, and didn’t bulk up much, if at all, for the role. Action hero\nSylvester Stallone later lamented Keaton’s Batsuit, which he said ushered in a\nnew era. “The action movies changed radically when it became possible to\nVelcro your muscles on,” _he told the __Los Angeles Times_.Laugh all you want\nat West’s goofy take on Batman. But at 6 feet 2 and 210 pounds, West’s\nphysique was the closest to that of Batman’s in the comic books, according to\n_an analysis by __the Economist_. And while his spandex Batsuit wasn’t the\nmost flattering, West _didn’t look too shabby underneath_.\n\n","title":"Today's Batman and Superman are screen heroes with superbods","twitter":{"body":"Today's Batman and Superman are screen heroes with superbods — but that wasn't always the case. https://t.co/sl0DxiLD4W","date":"Thu Mar 31 12:50:24 +0000 2016","favs":36,"id":{"$numberLong":"715521629389000708"},"retweets":42},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MTG6Nm"}

The news agency\nalso hired reporters who worked in the Nazi party's propaganda division,\nincluding photographer Franz Roth, who was in the propaganda unit of the SS\nand whose photos were approved by Hitler himself.Scharnberg also contends the\nAP allowed the use of its photographs in antisemitic propaganda, including the\npublications \"The Sub-Human\" and \"The Jews in the USA.\"By working with the\nNazis, the AP helped that totalitarian regime \"portray a war of extermination\nas a conventional war,\" the historian said in the interview with _The\nGuardian_. For example, Roth's photos following the 1941 Nazi invasion of Lviv\nin western Ukraine focused on the atrocities carried out by Soviet troops\nbefore the arrival of the Nazis, and ignored the violence of the German forces\nagainst the Jewish residents.\"The pictures played their part in disguising the\ntrue character of the war led by the Germans,\" Scharnberg said. \"Which events\nwere made visible and which remained invisible in AP's supply of pictures\nfollowed German interests and the German narrative of the war.\"The Associated\nPress said in a statement that Scharnberg's research \"describes both\nindividuals and their activities before and during the war that were unknown\nto AP.\" The news agency says it is conducting a review \"to further our\nunderstanding of the period.\"\"AP rejects the suggestion that it collaborated\nwith the Nazi regime at any time,\" the statement goes on to say. \"Rather, the\nAP was subjected to pressure from the Nazi regime from the period of Hitler's\ncoming to power in 1933 until the AP's expulsion from Germany in 1941. AP\nstaff resisted the pressure while doing its best to gather accurate, vital and\nobjective news for the world in a dark and dangerous time.\"The AP removed\nRoth's photographs from its website after the study's publication, _The\nGuardian _reported. The news agency is looking into photographs credited to\nRoth after Scharnberg's \"new-to-us reference to him,\" an AP spokesman told\n_The New York Times _.A German photo agency that was a subsidiary of AP\nBritain produced the images from Nazi Germany and the territory it occupied,\nand \"U.S. newspapers were supplied with some of these images through the\nGerman subsidiary,\" the AP's statement says. Images that came from the Nazi\ngovernment or its propaganda wings were \"labeled as such in their captions or\nphoto credits.\"The news agency also says that it had no control over the use\nof its photo archive after the U.S. declared war on Germany on Dec. 11, 1941,\nand the regime expelled all foreign news organizations.\n\n","title":"Historian claims the Associated Press collaborated with Nazis","twitter":{"body":"RT @wwcummings: The Associated Press is refuting a study that says it collaborated with the Nazis: https://t.co/yHsJJSdOay https://t.co/yWh…","date":"Thu Mar 31 06:44:07 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715429450993807360"},"retweets":21},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MV2iH1"}

We need to end that and make the government by and for the people again.”Committed to his cause, Kelso says he has spent 20% of his net worth on the campaign.“I’m a patriot,” he says. “I believe in helping the United States of America.

If elected president, he says he would combat extremism, fight for the environment and champion equal rights.“I’m running for president because I’m tired of fear mongering and hate mongering,” Adams says. “I think there’s nothing more patriotic than stepping forward to run for the president when your country is in need.”**Party:** Democrat  \n**Website: **http://www.electhenryhewes2016.com  \n**Platform:**The publisher and civic consultant from New York is not a political rookie; he ran for mayor of New York City in 1989 and for U.S. Senate in 1994.Seemingly laid back — he was the only one of many at a C-SPAN “lesser-known candidates” forum in New Hampshire to forgo a jacket for an argyle sweater — Hewes left the Republican party to become a Democrat in 2007 because he opposed the Iraq war and use of drones. But he retains his pro-life position.“My pro-life position is something that resonates,” Hewes says. “That’s the primary ethos of my campaign.”Hewes says he was among the first Democrats to adopt a strong and clear anti-police violence platform.“Police violence concerns young people and I don’t really see Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton talking about it except for in really abstract generalities.

They are very different things.”Soltysik says capitalist societies simply can not foster true equality. And now, more than ever, he thinks change is imperative.“With the science of climate change, we really don’t have time to spend on reforming capitalism or greening capitalism” Soltysik says. “The planet is literally telling us it cannot hold a capitalist society or economic system.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023ec8"},"content":"Guidelines the Food and Drug Administration issued Wednesday could expand\nwomen’s access to an abortion-inducing pill in states that have sought to\nlimit its use.The new guidelines strike directly against laws passed by\nseveral states — including North Dakota, Ohio and Texas — that require doctors\nto adhere to 16-year-old FDA regulations. Several other states have tried to\nlimit use of the drug, but their efforts face legal challenges around the\ncountry.The new rules allow women to use the medication for 70 days after the\nstart of their most recent menstrual period, up from 49 days under the\nprevious guidelines. The agency also lowered the dosage of the medication,\ncalled mifepristone, from 600 milligrams to 200 milligrams, and made it easier\nfor women to get a prescription for the pill.The previous requirements had\nbeen in place since 2000, but the FDA said in a statement that more recent\nscientific data showed that it was time for the update.\"After reviewing the\nsupplemental application, the agency determined that Mifeprex is safe and\neffective when used to terminate a pregnancy in accordance with revised\nlabeling,\" the statement said, referring to the brand name of the\ndrug.Abortion rights groups hailed the move as a long-needed dose of common\nsense given the history of the medication.President Ilyse Hogue of NARAL Pro-\nChoice America, a network of groups dedicated to protecting and expanding\nreproductive freedoms, said the abortion pill has proved through decades to be\nsafer than Tylenol, Viagra and other common medications used around the\nworld.\"Unlike state and federal anti-choice laws that restrict a women's\naccess to an abortion, the FDA decision to make mifepristone available to more\nwomen in this country is based on science that shows this usage is safe and\nmedically sound,\" Hogue said. \"It's high time to put medicine back into the\nhands of medical professionals and take it out of politicians' hands.\"Abortion\nopponents disagreed, arguing that lengthening the time that women can use the\npill will lead to more \"incomplete\" abortions and more risks to mothers.\nPresident Troy Newman of Operation Rescue, a Kansas-based anti-abortion group,\nsaid pharmaceutical companies will use the FDA's decision to persuade more\n\"vulnerable pregnant women\" to use the \"unpredictable\" drug.\"The FDA should be\nmore about protecting the public from exploitative and predatory uses of drugs\nrather than pandering to Planned Parenthood and the rest of the Abortion\nCartel,\" Newman said in a statement.Ohio's lawmakers had passed the\nrequirement to follow FDA guidelines in 2004, but the law didn't take effect\nuntil 2011 because of a court order. From 2010 to 2011, when the law went into\neffect, surgical abortions dropped to by more than 75% to 1,234 from 5,862,\naccording to state health department records.By 2014, non-surgical abortions\nincluding the abortion pill were 5% of all procedures, compared to 13.2% in\n2004.Women's Med in Sharonville, Ohio, which ceased surgical abortion in 2014\nafter losing a legal battle with the state, still provides medication\nabortions. But it has used methotrexate injections rather than the abortion\npill because administering Mifeprex according to the old FDA guidelines was\ntoo expensive and time-consuming, said Dr. Martin Haskell, the clinic's\nowner.But Wednesday's FDA decision gives Haskell another cost-effective\nalternative for abortions — one he said he will consider offering to patients\nin the future.“They’re finally catching up with reality,” Dr. Franz Theard, a\nphysician who operates Hilltop Women’s Reproductive Clinic in El Paso, said of\nthe FDA. Texas law requires pregnant women seeking abortions to first fill out\npaperwork, get an ultrasound and receive counseling.They return 72 hours later\nto take mifiprex. Then they are sent home where they take a second drug,\nmisoprostol, all in keeping with the FDA's 2000 guidelines because state law\nprohibits off-label use of drugs that can be used for abortions.“We tell them,\n‘Don’t go to work,’ ” because the procedure causes cramping, Theard said. But\nit is much less invasive than a surgical abortion and so trouble-free for some\nwomen that almost a third don't return for a recommended follow-up after the\nabortion.In Arizona, where a court order has put its state law similar to Ohio\nand Texas on hold, lawmakers sent a new bill to the governor last week\nrequiring abortion-inducing medications be administered according to FDA\nprotocol that was in effect as of Dec. 31.The legislation is sitting on Gov.\nDoug Ducey's desk, awaiting his signature or veto. Bill proponents are\nscrambling to figure out what to do.\"They will not be following the (current)\nFDA recommendations if this bill becomes law,\" said state Rep. Randall Friese,\na Tucson Democrat and a surgeon who asked Ducey to veto the bill. \"I'm hoping\nthis information makes it to the governor's office to help him\ndecide.\"_Contributing: Jessie Balmert, The Cincinnati Enquirer; Marty\nSchladen, El Paso Times; Alia Beard Rau, The Arizona Republic.

This was 24 hours after he marked a legal loss in a different\ncase on Tuesday in Los Angeles.The two cases involve civil defamation and\nsexual battery lawsuits filed against him by two of the five-dozen women who\nhave accused him of drugging and/or raping them in episodes dating back\ndecades.Meanwhile, Cosby is fighting a criminal sexual-assault case in\nPennsylvania, currently on hold while he appeals pre-trial rulings.On\nWednesday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Craig Karlan ruled that Cosby will\nnot have to immediately answer more questions under oath in a deposition\nsought by Judy Huth, a California woman who says Cosby forced her into a sex\nact at the Playboy Mansion in Los Angeles around 1974, when she was 15.The\nruling gives Cosby more time to resolve the criminal case before answering\nmore questions from Huth and her attorney, leading Cosby legal foe Gloria\nAllred, who represents dozens of his accusers.But the judge warned he's not\nfreezing the Huth sexual battery case indefinitely. \"I don't want this case to\nbe here three, four, five years from now. That's not justice,\" Karlan\nsaid.Attorney Gloria Allred at the Santa Monica Courthouse on March 30, 2016\nin Santa Monica, Calif. (Photo: Frederick M.

And Cosby is not off the hook, she warned.\"He is\nstill under order to be deposed so it's going to happen; it's just a question\nof when,\" she told USA TODAY. \"The judge said he wants to move our lawsuit\nalong, to 2017.\"Janice Dickinson on March 29, 2016 in Los Angeles. (Photo:\nNick Ut, AP)On Tuesday, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Debre Katz Weintraub\nruled that ex-supermodel and Cosby accuser Janice Dickinson's defamation suit\nagainst him can proceed.\"Victory!\" Dickinson shouted, alongside her attorney\nLisa Bloom (Allred's daughter), after the hearing. Dickinson says Cosby\ndrugged and raped her in a Lake Tahoe hotel in 1982, and then defamed her by\ndenying her accusation.Cosby had sought to have Dickinson's suit dismissed;\nhe's already been successful in getting another of the defamation suits\nagainst him dismissed.But the judge ruled that a jury could determine the\ncredibility of Dickinson's claims and whether a statement by Cosby's former\nlawyer branding her a liar was legally defamatory.Pressley said in a statement\nTuesday that the Cosby team was happy that some of bases for the Dickinson\nlawsuit were dismissed, but still maintains the entire suit should be thrown\nout and is considering an appeal.\n\n","title":"Bill Cosby wins temporary delay in lawsuit against him","twitter":{"body":"Bill Cosby marked a small — but only temporary — legal victory in Los Angeles. https://t.co/l58GIXKUpR","date":"Thu Mar 31 02:15:07 +0000 2016","favs":20,"id":{"$numberLong":"715361752406433792"},"retweets":17},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MC9Za8"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023eca"},"content":"Most people would to love to wipe the mosquitoes that spread the Zika virus\noff the face of the Earth.But fighting these nasty little biters — a species\ncalled Aedes aegypti — is harder than most people imagine, experts say. USA\nTODAY's Liz Szabo talked to mosquito control experts to find out why this\nspecies is such a formidable foe.**Q. What makes these mosquitoes\ndifferent?**A. They love humans — but not in a good way.Like the dog, the\nAedes aegypti has evolved to live among people. Yet while dogs seek human\napproval, and willingly work for us, the mosquitoes that spread Zika simply\nwant our blood.Although the Aedes aegypti originated in jungles, breeding in\ntree holes or in water that collected in leaves, it now thrives in our homes,\naccording to the World Health Organization.\"It's a domestic mosquito,\" said\nbiologist Laura Harrington,  professor and chairwoman of the entomology\ndepartment at Cornell University in New York.  \"You won't find it in places\nwithout humans.\"Female mosquitoes need the protein and other nutrients in\nblood to make eggs.The Aedes aegypti produces more eggs and lives longer after\ndining on our blood than when they feed on other animals.All mosquitoes\nrelease a numbing substance in their saliva, so that people don't feel them\nbite, Harrington said. They also release chemicals that prevent blood from\nclotting, so that they can suck longer. The Aedes aegypti produces a less\npainful bite than other mosquitoes, so it's possible that they produce more of\nthis numbing substance, Harrington said.The Aedes aegypti \"hones in on the\nvolatile chemicals that come off our skin,\" said Grayson Brown, a professor of\nentomology at the University of Kentucky who recently returned from a trip to\nBrazil to study way to protect people from Zika. \"If you're sitting next to a\nmonkey, it's much more likely to bite you than the monkey.\"**Q. How does this\nmosquito exploit human weaknesses?**A. Unlike the mosquitoes that spread\nmalaria, which breed in depressions in the ground or swamps, the Aedes aegypti\nprefers to lay eggs in our man-made containers and even rests under our beds\nor in our closets. It prefers clean water, like the rain water that people in\ndeveloping nations store in jars outside their homes, Harrington said.The\nAedes aegypti also has adapted to live among human waste. It thrives in the\ntrash-strewn streets of crowded, impoverished cities of developing countries,\nbreeding in the water that collects in old tires, plastic cups and bottle\ncaps, according to the WHO. Other favorite locations: construction sites and\nclogged rain gutters.Females — the only ones that bite — can also lay eggs in\nthe \"microbial stew\" found in septic tanks, toilet tanks and shower\nstalls.**Q. Why is this mosquito so good at spreading disease?**A. Several\nfeatures help the Aedes aegypti spread Zika as well as other diseases,\nincluding yellow fever, dengue, chikungunya and West Nile virus.While most\nmosquitoes feed on blood only when they're laying eggs, feeding on plant\nnectar the rest of the time, Harrington said the Aedes aegypti feeds on blood\nalmost every day. Female are infectious throughout their lives.The Aedes\naegypti is an \"aggressive daytime biting mosquito,\" according to the WHO.\nAlthough it's most active at dawn and dusk, it also can bite at night in well-\nlit homes. Females mount \"sneak attacks,\" approaching people from behind and\nbiting ankles and elbows, where they're less likely to be noticed and\nslapped.Instead of taking lots of blood from one bite, these mosquitoes take\nmultiple sips from multiple bites, which increases the number of people that\nfemales can infect, according to the WHO.**Q. How dangerous are\nmosquitoes?**There are more than 3,000 species of mosquito in the world,\nincluding 176 in the USA, according to the American Mosquito Control\nAssociation. Together, they spread diseases that kill 725,000 people a year,\naccording to Gates Notes, the personal blog of Bill Gates, co-founder of\nMicrosoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Malaria alone kills\n438,000 people a year, according to the WHO.\"There's nothing good about\nmosquitoes,\"  Fauci said. \"People say, 'But mosquitoes feed the birds.'

The\n33-year-old woman, who was infected with Zika while traveling in Central\nAmerica when she was 11 weeks pregnant, only tested negative after the\npregnancy ended. She had an abortion 21 weeks into the pregnancy, after tests\nshowed extensive brain damage to her fetus.Doctors can't say for sure why the\nwoman harbored Zika in her blood for so long, in spite of having developed\nantibodies against the virus.Although antibodies protect the body from foreign\ninvaders such as viruses, the immune system doesn't usually attack a fetus.\nThat could have allowed the Zika virus to survive and multiply in the fetus'\nbody. Authors of the study found large amounts of Zika virus in the fetus'\nbrain, as well as in the placenta and umbilical cord.Viruses coming from the\nfetus or placenta could have reinfected the mother throughout her pregnancy,\nsaid study coauthor Rita Driggers, medical director of maternal and fetal\nmedicine at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. That might also explain\nwhy the woman's blood tests for Zika were negative after the pregnancy ended\nand there was no longer a source of virus in her body.It's also possible that\nthe woman cleared the Zika virus from her blood just as quickly as others, but\nthat genetic material from the virus remained behind, said Peter Hotez,\ndirector of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of\nMedicine in Houston, who was not involved in the new study.Scientists don't\nknow whether the woman's case is unique or if other pregnant women would also\ntest positive for Zika throughout pregnancy, said Anthony Fauci, director of\nthe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who was not\ninvolved in the new study. The only way to know for sure would be to take\nblood samples from many pregnant women throughout their pregnancies.\"You can't\nget all the answers from one case,\" Fauci said.Doctors in Brazil are currently\nconducting large studies of pregnant women, comparing those infected with Zika\nto those who are uninfected, to see how infection affects the health of the\nwomen and their babies.The woman's case could make other pregnant women with\nZika infections uneasy.The woman, who originally hailed from Finland but lived\nin Washington, had ultrasounds during the 13th, 16th and 17th weeks of\npregnancy. When the results were normal, the woman's doctors reassured her the\nher fetus was developing normally, Driggers said.During the 19th week of\npregnancy, however, an ultrasound showed abnormal brain anatomy in her fetus.\nThe next week, doctors performed an MRI, a sophisticated scan that provides\nmore detail than an ultrasound but doesn't involve radiation. The MRI found\nthat much of the fetus' brain had wasted away, according to the\nstudy.\"Normally, you would expect the brain to fill up the skull,\" said\nDriggers, who is also an associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at\nthe Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore. \"There was fluid\naround the brain, filling up the spaces where the brain wasn't.\"Zika has been\nstrongly linked to microcephaly, a birth defect in which babies are born with\nabnormally small heads and, in most cases, incomplete brain development. In\nthis study, the fetus' brain didn't meet the standard definition of\nmicrocephaly.Driggers said her study shows that that fetuses can have\nextensive brain damage, even if their brains are normal size.Doctors should\nconsider performing an MRI \"if there are any doubts about the diagnosis,\" said\nstudy coauthor Adre du Plessis, director of Children’s National Health\nSystem’s Fetal Medicine Institute and chief of the fetal and transitional\nmedicine division.But it's not practical to order an MRI for every pregnant\nwoman, said Laura Riley, a spokeswoman for the American College of\nObstetricians and Gynecologists.That's because the procedures can cost\nthousands of dollars. Also, there are relatively few experts who specialize in\ninterpreting the results of MRIs in fetuses, which aren't commonly\nperformed.Even the most sophisticated tests won't answer all of a pregnant\nwoman's questions, Riley said. It's possible that babies born after being\nexposed to Zika could have subtle problems that aren't obvious on imaging\ntests.\"MRI may give you a better look at brain structure, but nothing is\navailable to tell you about the brain’s function,\" Riley said.\n\n","title":"Zika virus may linger in pregnant women's blood months longer than usual","twitter":{"body":"Zika virus may linger in pregnant women's blood months longer than other infected patients. https://t.co/o2jZ9oA7qk","date":"Thu Mar 31 00:40:09 +0000 2016","favs":19,"id":{"$numberLong":"715337853639720961"},"retweets":44},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MTKZGb"}

When temperatures and humidity go up, the\nheart pumps a little more blood so your heart rate will go up a few beats per\nminute. \"If you’re stressed, anxious or 'extraordinarily happy or sad,' your\nemotions can raise your pulse,\" the association writes on its website.Fitbit\nfound that 50-90 beats per minutes is the typical resting heart range for\nadult Fitbit users around the world. The company's data also shows that being\nthin doesn’t imply heart health.On average, underweight Fitbit users have\nsimilar resting heart rates to overweight and obese users. The association\nbacks that up: \"Body size usually doesn’t usually change pulse. If you’re very\nobese, you might see a higher resting pulse than normal, but usually not more\nthan 100.\"Fitbit Blaze (Photo: Fitbit)\"If you're really very overweight, your\nheart rate has to be higher to support the extra tissue,\" says Dr. Melvin\nScheinman, professor of medicine at University of California, San Francisco\nMedical Center. \"But you have to be very, very obese.\"Low heart rate can,\nhowever, indicate heart disease. \"If you have a slow heart rate and you feel\nfine, there is no reason to worry about it,\" Scheinman says. \"It you have\nsypmtoms like fatigue, dizziness and blackout spells, then you should see a\nphysician.\"**Here are the states with the lowest resting heart rates (the\nnumber indicates the average number of beats per minute when resting)\n:**Hawaii: 66.031  \nMassachusetts: 66.868  \nSouth Dakota: 67.035  \nNew York: 67.211  \nVermont: 67.213  \nDelaware: 67.218  \nUtah: 67.257  \nCalifornia: 67.319  \nMinnesota: 67.34  \nConnecticut: 67.38**Here are the states with the highest resting heart\nrates:**Mississippi: 68.687  \nArkansas: 68.588  \nLouisiana: 68.586  \nTennessee: 68.513  \nAlabama: 68.508  \nWest Virginia: 68.41  \nOklahoma: 68.23  \nGeorgia: 68.227  \nOhio: 68.197  \nTexas: 68.137  \nKentucky: 68.112\n\n","title":"Which state has the lowest resting heart rate?","twitter":{"body":"Hint: It's not Mississippi. \nhttps://t.co/ZzuVY9tthi","date":"Thu Mar 31 00:30:10 +0000 2016","favs":24,"id":{"$numberLong":"715335340035325952"},"retweets":25},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MU7SJv"}

Robert Bentley is resigning a week after\nhe apologized for making inappropriate remarks to her but denied the pair were\nengaged in an affair.Rebekah Caldwell Mason said in a statement Wednesday that\nshe is resigning as Bentley’s senior policy analyst, the _Montgomery\nAdvertiser_ reports. The decision comes a week after Bentley’s contrite news\nconference in which he apologized to his family and Mason’s for his\nbehavior.Mason said she would no longer be paid from the governor's political\ncampaign or the Alabama Council for Excellent Government, a private entity\ncreated to support Bentley's policies.\"My only plans are to focus my full\nattention on my precious children and my husband who I love dearly,\" the\nstatement said.  \"They are the most important people in my life. Thank you for\nyour prayers for our family.”Mason had served as Bentley’s senior policy\nadviser since January. Mason, a former television news anchor in Bentley’s\nhometown of Tuscaloosa, signed on as spokeswoman for the little-known\nlegislator’s longshot bid for governor in 2010. She worked as the governor’s\ncommunications adviser before leaving to work on his 2014 re-election.The\nAlabama Ethics Commission appears to be preparing to investigate allegations\nsurrounding Bentley and Mason.The commission informed the state auditor it has\nassigned case numbers stemming from an auditor's report last week. That\nreported summarized allegations that the pair were having an affair and may\nhave misused state resources or broken state laws, the _Montgomery Advertiser_\nreported. Bentley and Mason have denied the allegations.The commission says it\nwill assign a special agent in the \"near future\" to conduct an investigation\ninto the complaints, the newspaper reported, quoting from a commission letter\nto the auditor.Central to the allegations are recently released audio excerpts\nin which the governor engages in sexually charged talk with the\nstaffer.Republican Gov. Robert Bentley, shown in a 2014 file photo, listens to\na phone call as Rebekah Mason, right, announces his win for Alabama governor,\nin Montgomery, Ala. (Photo: Brynn Anderson, AP)“I love you. I love to talk to\nyou,” the governor says to Mason on the tapes. “Baby, let me tell you what\nwe’re going to have to start doing, we’re going to have to start locking the\ndoor. If we are going to do what we did the other day, we are going to have to\nstart locking the door.”The tapes were recorded two years ago by Dianne\nBentley, the governor's former wife, who divorced him last year. The\nconversation, in which only the governor's voice is heard, was reportedly\ncaptured on her cellphone, which she left behind in a room at the couples’\nbeach home, WKRG-TV reported.The case has spurred calls for the governor's\nresignation by some state legislators.\"Much is required for Gov. Bentley to\nrepair his relationship with the state,\" said an editorial Tuesday by Al.com,\nan Alabama media consortium. \"If he remains unwilling to provide a full\nreckoning, then he should resign.\"In a new twist in the case, the pastor of\nthe First Baptist Church of Tuscaloosa confirmed that Bentley and Mason are no\nlonger members of the church following the release of the audio tapes.Senior\nPastor Gil McKee told the Christian News Network that while \"church discipline\nis a church family matter\" he can confirm that both Bentley and Mason are no\nlonger members of the church. \"I continue to pray for each of them,\" he\nsays.McKee does not indicate the timing or circumstances of their departure.\nBentley has served as Sunday school teacher and deacon at the church.Perhaps\nthe most damaging allegations came last week when former Alabama Law\nEnforcement Agency Secretary Spencer Collier, a longtime Bentley ally, accused\nthe governor and staffer of having an affair and charged that the governor\nused state resources to pursue it.Collier went public one day after he was\nfired by Bentley following a report raising concerns of \"possible misuse of\nstate funds\" at ALEA.Collier, who strongly denies the allegation, said Bentley\nand Mason were \"furious\" with him after he submitted an affidavit in an\nunrelated case involving the Alabama house speaker, who faces felony ethics\ncharges for allegedly using his public position to benefit his businesses and\nclients, the _Advertiser_ reported.The release of the tapes, in turn, prompted\nBentley's contrite remarks at a news conference.Bentley denied participating\nin a “physical, sexual relationship” but said he made a mistake in judgment\nand apologized to his family and the Masons.“I made a mistake,” Bentley told\nreporters. “Two years ago I made a mistake. ...I have apologized many times to\nmy family. I have apologized to the family of Mrs. Mason. I would now like to\napologize to the people of Alabama. I ask them to forgive me.”One reporter\nasked Bentley if he was in love with Mason, to which he replied, “I love many\nmembers of my staff, in fact, all the members of my staff. Do I love some more\nthan others? Absolutely.”_Contributing: Brian Lyman, Montgomery (Ala.)\nAdvertiser_\n\n","title":"Aide to Ala. governor resigns in wake of affair scandal","twitter":{"body":"Aide to  Alabama Gov.

Their\nfirst meeting earlier this month at UFC 196 also took place at welterweight.\nIt is not yet known if the Edgar-Aldo fight, also a rematch, will be the co-\nmain event. Also made official for the card is a lightweight fight between Joe\nLauzon (25-11 MMA, 12-8 UFC) and Diego Sanchez (26-8 MMA, 15-8 UFC).The\nhistoric UFC 200 event takes place July 9 at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. The\nmain card airs on pay-per-view following prelims on FOX Sports 1 and UFC Fight\nPass.McGregor is ranked No. 1 in the USA TODAY Sports/MMAjunkie MMA\nfeatherweight rankings (and No. 5 pound-for-pound). Diaz is No. 6 at\nlightweight. Aldo is No. 2 at featherweight after his 13-second knockout loss\nto McGregor at UFC 194, and Edgar is No. 3.In UFC 196’s headliner, Diaz forced\nMcGregor to tap out to a rear-naked choke in their non-title welterweight\nbout.Although McGregor bloodied his opponent in the opening round, Diaz\nrallied in the second to blast him with punches, force the fight to the mat,\nand secure the bout-ending submission. It proved to be one of the biggest pay-\nper-view events in UFC history.Despite the victory, Diaz, who took the bout on\nless than two weeks’ notice after lightweight champ Rafael dos Anjos suffered\na foot injury, recently opened as a small underdog in the expected\nrematch.Edgar has been pining for a title shot against McGregor, including\naccusing the featherweight champ of ducking him by choosing the potential for\na rematch with Diaz instead of defending his 145-pound title. Edgar has had a\ntitle shot before. He lost a decision to Aldo at UFC 156, which was the last\ntime he dropped a fight. Since then, the former lightweight champ has won five\nstraight, including a knockout of Chad Mendes in December at the TUF 22\nFinale.

Sen. Hillman\nFrazier, D-Jackson, waved a sheathed sword and quoted Bible Scripture as he\nargued against passage of the bill. Proponents also quoted Scripture, and even\nthe Five Man Electrical Band — \"signs, signs, everywhere signs\" — as they\nfended off an amendment to require churches with armed security to post\nsigns.\"We don't need to pimp the church for political purposes,\" Frazier said\nas he held an ornate sword at the podium. \"If you want to pass gun laws, do\nthat, but don't use the church.\"Sen.

Andy Gipson, R-Braxton. It now heads back\nto the House for more deliberation.The bill would allow churches to create\nsecurity programs and designate and train members to carry concealed weapons.\nIt would provide criminal and legal protections to those serving as church\nsecurity.The bill also would allow concealed carry in a holster without a\npermit in Mississippi, expanding a measure passed last year that allowed\nconcealed carry without a permit in a purse, satchel or briefcase, and another\nrecent law that allows open carry in public.The bill also seeks to prohibit\nMississippi officials from enforcing any federal agency regulations or\nexecutive orders that would violate the state constitution — an attempt to\nnullify federal gun restrictions not passed by Congress.Senators argued\nwhether this last provision would violate the Supremacy Clause of the U.S.\nConstitution.\"Where did you go to law school?\"  Sen.

The new promised delivery date\nis this June.The inspector general called into question millions of dollars\nthat were either determined to be unauthorized and unsupported for a project\nthat was originally estimated to cost $22 million. The ATR 42-500, purchased\nin 2008, was intended to support counter-narcotics efforts in Afghanistan, and\nthe Defense Department had agreed to modify the aircraft with \"advanced''\nsurveillance equipment'' to operate in combat zones.As of last February, the\nDEA had spent $10.1 million on the failed project, while DOD-related costs\ntotaled $67.9 million and included funds to modify the aircraft and for the\nconstruction of a hangar at Kabul International Airport.\"The DOD considered\nscrapping aircraft (in 2014) because, while the DOD had already expended more\nthan $65.9 million on the aircraft's modifications, an additional $6 million\nwas required to repair damages observed during attempts to modify the\naircraft,'' the report concluded. \"Yet, at that time, the market value of the\naircraft was only $6 million.''In a written response, the DEA said that it had\ncollaborated with the Defense Department on successful aircraft modification\nprojects in the past, but because modification funding for Global Discovery\nwas being provided largely by the Pentagon, the DEA was limited in its\ninvolvement in the overall modification process.\"Based upon that previous\nexperience,'' DEA Deputy Chief Inspector Michael Stanfill wrote, \"DEA had no\nindication that the Global Discovery modification would encounter significant\ndelays and problems that ultimately occurred.''In a statement Tuesday, the DEA\nsaid it \"welcomes recommendations that make us better.''\"DEA agrees that it\ncan should provide better oversight of its operational funding,'' the agency's\nstatement read. \"We are reviewing policies and procedures to ensure the\nlimited resources allocated to DEA are utilized in the most responsible and\neffective way possible.''The Justice inspector general has referred the\nfindings to the DOD's inspector general for review.\n\n","title":"U.S. spent $86 million on plane never flown ","twitter":{"body":"DEA and the Pentagon spent combined $86 million on a surveillance plane that has never flown. https://t.co/f9iPD8enU1","date":"Wed Mar 30 22:40:11 +0000 2016","favs":29,"id":{"$numberLong":"715307663530336261"},"retweets":70},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MTsUbd"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023ed4"},"content":"Do you have enough money to retire? That’s not an easy question to answer, but\nthere are some ways to tell if you’re on track. Experts like to use the\nfollowing methods to determine if you have enough to fund your desired\nlifestyle.**• Crunch the numbers.** Map your projected income — from personal\nassets, earned income, pensions  and Social Security — against projected\nexpenses. This is perhaps the most accurate way to determine whether you’re\nfinancially ready. But it will require more than a weekend of number\ncrunching.What’s involved? On the income side, it means calculating how much\nyou’ll receive from Social Security (and pensions if any); how much income you\ncan safely withdraw from investment accounts earmarked for retirement (assume\n2% to 4% per year); and how much income you might earn from working during\nretirement.On the expense side, it means calculating how much you’ll spend on\nessential expenses, such as housing, health care, food and transportation, and\nhow much you’ll need for discretionary expenses, hobbies, trips, gifts,\netc.This method, though time-consuming, is best for those 10 years or less\naway from retirement.**• Use an income-replacement ratio.** Determine what\npercentage of your current salary you’d need to generate in retirement to live\ncomfortably. Generally, advisers say you’ll need to replace 80% of your pre-\nretirement income. So, for instance, households that have gross incomes of\n$50,000, might need $40,000 of income in retirement.Part of this exercise\nrequires figuring out what portion of your income will come from which sources\nin retirement.In 2012, the average retiree had a household income of $51,000,\nand Social Security accounted for 35.3% of that amount. The rest came from\nother sources, such as savings and earned income. So in our example of a\nhousehold needing retirement income of $40,000, $14,120 of it would come from\nSocial Security and the rest, $25,880, would have to come from savings and\nother sources. That means a person would need a nest egg of about $1 million,\nusing a withdrawal rate of under 3%, to make up the gap.**• Divide assets by\nsalary.** Divide how much you’ve saved for retirement by your current salary.\nTo be financially ready for retirement, Fidelity Investments suggests having\n10 times your salary saved at retirement, eight times your salary saved by age\n60, six times by age 50,  three times by age 40, and one time by age 30.**•\nUse an online calculator.** Fidelity created a tool that lets you determine\nhow ready you are for retirement. Answering six questions at\nhttps://communications.fidelity.com/pi/2015/retirement/ gives you a retirement\nscore to show you how on track you are.Online calculators can give you a\nballpark estimate. (Photo: Getty Images)Other organizations have calculators,\ntoo. Those include: Ballpark E$timate and AARP.Before using any online\nretirement calculator, experts suggest considering the following: Many\ncalculators will give you a ballpark answer, but not necessarily the correct\nanswer. That might be fine if you’re more than 10 years away from retirement,\nbut less so if you’re not. If you’re close to retirement, there may be no\nsubstitute for using actual income and expense numbers to determine your\nreadiness, says Chuck Yanikoski, the owner of Still River Retirement Planning\nSoftware in Harvard, Mass.“I say that even though I am a strong believer that\nfor people who are more than, say, 10 years from retirement, simple tools are\nthe most appropriate, precisely because it's not possible in most cases to\nmake financial forecasts about individual retirement 15, 20, or 40 years ahead\nof time,” he says.Other things to consider when using an online retirement\ncalculator:_Robert Powell is editor of Retirement Weekly, contributes\nregularly to USA TODAY, The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023ed6"},"content":"Whoopi Goldberg is lending her name and financial backing to a new line of\nmedical marijuana products designed specifically for women.Goldberg, who has\nbeen public about her own marijuana use, is one of a handful of Hollywood\ncelebrities jumping into the marijuana marketplace. Bob Marley’s family has\npartnered with a cannabis company to produce Marley Natural products, and\nSnoop Dogg backs Leafs by Snoop. Goldberg said her “Whoopi \u0026amp; Maya” company\nreceived financial backing from three friends and family members, and she will\nserve as chairwoman.“I want to go nice and slow with this. I don’t want this\nto be a joke to people. It’s not a joke to women,” Goldberg told USA TODAY.The\ncompany she's co-founded offers four products: a balm, a tincture, sipping\nchocolate, and a bath soak. All are infused with marijuana and aim to reduce\nthe pain and cramps from periods. Pricing has not yet been set.The products\nsold under the \"Whoopi \u0026amp; Maya brand\" will be available only in California\nto people with their medical marijuana cards, and they'll be on shelves in the\nnext several weeks in at least five marijuana dispensaries around the\nstate.Because marijuana remains illegal at the federal level, the product\ntoday is unavailable elsewhere.The new \"Whoopi \u0026amp; Maya\" line of marijuana\nproducts aims to offer relief to women suffering from cramps and period pain.\n(Photo: Courtesy photo/Michael Osborne/Whoopi \u0026amp; Maya)The marijuana\nindustry is one of the country’s fastest growing industries, increasing\nannually by 31%, with a national market worth $5.7 billion, say the two\nresearch firms.By launching in California, Goldberg and partner Maya Elisabeth\nare entering one of the world’s largest marijuana marketplaces, with\nCalifornia producing $2.7 billion in sales last year, according to the\ncannabis-focused data firms New Frontier and ArcView Market\nResearch.California voters this fall are widely expected to pass a ballot\nmeasure legalizing recreational marijuana. In many cases, medical and\nrecreational products are identical; the only difference is whether a user\nneeds a doctor’s recommendation.California lawmakers this summer approved\nseries of measures formalizing the state’s medical marijuana system. Those\nmeasures lay the groundwork for a legal recreational system, and could\npotentially give anyone offering medical marijuana products a leg up in\nselling recreational products if they’re legalized this fall.\"Success at the\nballot box would massively increase California’s total legal market share,”\nTroy Dayton, CEO of The ArcView Group, said in a statement.Elisabeth said she\nand Goldberg believe their niche — if you can call 50% of the population a\nniche, she laughs — is ripe for success. She said women have for generations\nbeen herbal healers, and she believes the company’s marijuana products are no\ndifferent.There’s very little scientific research available about the benefits\nof medical marijuana use, largely because the federal government has sharply\nrestricted it. Researchers only now are starting to conduct sophisticated\ntrials about its potential benefits for PTSD and seizure sufferers. England's\nQueen Victoria is widely believed to have used a similar tincture to relieve\nher own cramps, Elisabeth said.\"I'm excited for people to feel comfortable\nusing cannabis,\" said Elisabeth, a founder of the all-female Northern\nCalifornia edible marijuana products cooperative Om Edibles.Goldberg said\nsmoking pot or drinking marijuana-infused tea has helped control her own\ncramps and pain, and she currently uses a \"vape\" pen filled with marijuana oil\nto combat glaucoma headaches.  She said she’s not interested in creating a\nrecreational cannabis company to sell joints to people who just want to get\nhigh. Goldberg came up with the idea for the company with a friend, and found\nElisabeth to partner with.Goldberg said that at her age, 60, she's willing to\ntake the risk of violating federal law because she believes so strongly in the\ncompany's mission.Another interest of the two women is in breaking what some\nare calling the \"grass-ceiling\"  in the semi-legal cannabis industry, which\nhas seen limited participation of minorities and women in leadership\nroles.When it comes to starting marijuana-focused businesses, state regulators\nhave written rules that tend to favor established small-business owners with\naccess to capital and clean criminal records. And because marijuana remains\nillegal at the federal level, some would-be entrepreneurs feel unwilling to\nstick their heads above the water, Elisabeth said, especially those who’ve\nseen how police and prosecutors disproportionally punish minorities when it\ncomes to drug use.“A lot of white men don’t have to think about this,” said\nElisabeth, who is white.Goldberg, an actress and comedian known for films like\n\"Ghost\" and TV shows like \"Star Trek: The Next Generation,\" has been open\nabout using marijuana, penning a column for _The Cannabist_ and arguing for\nlegalization on \"The View\". This venture into the public spotlight is\ndifferent: It's her first investment in a small business like this.“This is a\nnice quiet way that I can be part of this,” Goldberg said of the new company.\n“It had to help people if I were going to be involved.\"\n\n","title":"Whoopi Goldberg founds medical marijuana company for women","twitter":{"body":"Whoopi Goldberg's medical marijuana company for women offers balm and a bath soak: https://t.co/cr8AfdHEHj (Getty) https://t.co/FsKo5iFxrC","date":"Wed Mar 30 21:20:17 +0000 2016","favs":150,"id":{"$numberLong":"715287557949489152"},"retweets":93},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MSzdfh"}

Please don't\ndo it!' And I heard [gunfire], and I hear him yell: 'Merry F---ing\nChristmas!'\"Evidence showed that Battagalia, an accountant, shot each of his\ndaughters six times.Pearle rushed to the apartment and paced while police\nentered.

They are everything. All your hopes and dreams ...\neverything is gone,\" she said.Battaglia was arrested hours later outside a\ntattoo parlor where he had just had two roses — one for each girl — inked on\nhis arm.Before his arrest, Battaglia left this chilling message on his\ndaughters' answering machine:\"Goodnight, my little babies. I hope you're\nresting in a different place.\"There had been a long history of domestic\nviolence between Battaglia and Pearle, but no one thought he would kill the\nchildren, so he was allowed to have unsupervised visits.The murders sent shock\nwaves through the community. Lawmakers were outraged, and a law was changed.\nIt is now mandatory for judges to ask about a history of violence during\ndivorce proceedings.\"In a lot of cases, it was not brought up that there had\nbeen domestic violence in that relationship that was dissolving ... or there\nhad been some danger to the child,\" explained Paige Flink, director of The\nFamily Place, which offers assistance to abused spouses.Battaglia, 60,  was\nscheduled to die by lethal injection at 6 p.m. CT Wednesday in Huntsville. But\na brighter lasting image will remain.After the little girls were slain, The\nFamily Place opened Faith and Liberty’s Place, where parental visits are\nsupervised by armed off-duty police officers.Liberty and Faith Battaglia were\nshot and killed by their father on May 2, 2001. (Photo: Submitted)It’s also a\nplace where estranged parents can exchange children safely.\"I am certain Faith\nand Liberty's Place has helped prevent children from being kidnapped, children\nbeing harmed,\" Flink said.Tiffany Ratcliff and her abusive ex-husband were\nordered to go to Faith and Liberty's Place by a judge to exchange their son.\"I\nwas scared.

Bernie Sanders and two super PACs that\nsupport him.The American Democracy Legal Fund, established by David Brock,\ncharges that Sanders and his campaign repeatedly accepted contributions in\nexcess of the $2,700 legal limit for individuals per election.Another\ncomplaint alleges a Facebook ad encouraging donations after Sanders’ New\nHampshire win did not disclose who paid for the communication. Finally, the\nlegal fund accuses the super PAC Progressive Kick of illegally using Sanders’\nname and claims that group and the super PAC Nurses National Nurses United for\nPatient Protection are illegally coordinating with the Sanders campaign.The\nSanders campaign last month described an FEC warning about excessive\ncontributions as “standard” and said the campaign would address the FEC’s\nquestions. On Tuesday, the campaign dismissed the Brock group’s complaint as\nfrivolous and noted it follows Clinton’s chief strategist Joel Benenson call\nfor Sanders to change his negative tone.\"Just one day after the Clinton\ncampaign said we needed to change our tone, the leaders of their coordinated\nsuper PAC, which is funded by millions from Wall Street, filed baseless and\nfrivolous complaints with the FEC,” Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said\nin a statement. “Tells you all you need to know.\"The Clinton campaign declined\nto comment on the complaints.Brock, founder of the pro-Clinton super PAC\nCorrect the Record, has targeted Sanders throughout the campaign, raising\nquestions about his commitment to the Black Lives Matter movement and his\nmedical records._MSNBC_ reports this is the first time ADLF has filed a\ncomplaint against a Democrat.Sanders has long denounced the unlimited money\nsuper PACs spend in support of candidates. His lack of affiliation with a\nsuper PAC is a distinction he draws with Clinton at his rallies.Last month in\nMassachusetts, when Sanders was introduced at a rally by Karen Higgins, co-\npresident of National Nurses United, the campaign said it is not coordinating\nwith or raising money on behalf of the super PAC and highlighted the\ndifference between that PAC and others.\"This is a PAC that is supported by\nnurses, one of the most respected and admired professions in the country, and\nto compare nurses to the billionaires and Wall Street special interests who\nare supporting other candidates is a preposterous stretch,\" Sanders' spokesman\nMichael Briggs said after the rally.\n\n","title":"Hillary Clinton ally hits Bernie Sanders with FEC complaints","twitter":{"body":"A group of Hillary Clinton backers hits Bernie Sanders with FEC complaints.  https://t.co/ct99SimNrq","date":"Wed Mar 30 20:10:13 +0000 2016","favs":33,"id":{"$numberLong":"715269922084024321"},"retweets":35},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MBDFUT"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023ed9"},"content":"Sean Miller never requested all of this.Five times since his hiring in 2009,\nhis bosses at the University of Arizona have amended his coaching contract\nwith sweeteners, including multiple pay raises and 15 more hours of use per\nyear on a charter jet.In 2013, they even talked about increasing his salary by\nanother $100,000, but Miller said he didn’t need it and declined. A year\nlater, they awarded him a stake in a privately donated investment deal\ncurrently valued at nearly $4 million.“I’m being proactive,” said Miller’s\nboss, Arizona athletics director Greg Byrne. “I don’t believe he’s asked for\nit one time.”Unlike other top coaches in college basketball, Miller doesn’t\neven have an agent to help maximize his earning potential. He doesn’t need\none, apparently, because he’s already got all the leverage he needs — even if\nhe’s never quite reached the Final Four of the NCAA tournament, including this\nyear, when his team was bounced in the first round.Coaches with credentials\nlike his are in high demand — beneficiaries of a pay market that keeps\nspiraling upward, according to a USA TODAY Sports analysis of documents it\nacquired in conjunction with the Sports Capital Journalism Program at Indiana\nUniversity-Purdue University Indianapolis and the Grady Sports Media Program\nat the University of Georgia. This year, Miller was one of 24 coaches in the\ntournament making at least $2 million, up from 11 in 2011.And that creates a\ndilemma of sorts for Arizona, just like other top programs with big budget\nchallenges: They can say enough is enough and risk starting over with a\ncheaper coach. Or they can keep upping the ante, hoping to keep their coach\nfrom leaving for greener pastures.Arizona has made its choice, providing a\ncase study on the challenges of how to pay for it all while tensions rise in\nthe quest for revenue.In recent years, the school has tried to keep up by\nforaging for new money streams on campus and off, leading to creative\nenticements this year that helped make Miller one of the five highest-\ncompensated coaches in the tournament. USA TODAY Sports’ analysis measured his\ncompensation value this year at $4.9 million, up from about $2.3 million in\n2011, thanks largely to an unusual deferred compensation package derived in\npublicly traded units of an oil pipeline and storage business.Meanwhile,\nArizona’s bottom line is still stretched enough that the school has considered\nimposing a new $200 fee on students to help fund football stadium\nupgrades.“There are limits to this in my mind, to how far (the market) goes,\nand we just haven’t really hit them yet,” Arizona Board of Regents Chairman\nJay Heiler told USA TODAY Sports. “But at some point I think things will\nsettle down a little bit, and we won’t be in such a white-hot, overheated\nenvironment of escalating coaching salaries. We haven’t gotten there yet. So\nfar we’re still riding the delta upward.”Growing up in western Pennsylvania,\nMiller lived in a middle-class home and spent much of his time on the court\nwith his father, John, the legendary former coach at Blackhawk High.“We\nweren’t going on big vacations,” John Miller said. “We were in the gym most of\nthe time.”It paid off. Sean Miller, the oldest of four siblings, played for\nhis dad before moving on to play at Pitt. His brother, Archie, did the same\nbefore playing at North Carolina State, where Sean was an assistant coach.\nBoth followed their father into coaching and are still picking golden apples\noff its tree.As the head coach at Dayton, Archie, 37, just received an\nundisclosed pay increase and a third consecutive contract extension from the\nprivate school after making his third appearance in a row in the NCAA\ntournament.For Sean Miller, 47, his star rose after four 20-win seasons at\nXavier, leading him to Arizona, where he and his family have a 6,800-square-\nfoot home purchased for $3.25 million shortly after his hiring in 2009,\naccording to property records. He has a 308-108 career record and is one of\nthe best active coaches never to have made the Final Four, falling short four\ntimes in the Elite Eight.“Arizona has reached out and really made it pretty\ndarn good,” John Miller said. “Now if he would leave, I guess I would have to\nsay maybe more towards an NBA thing, you know? But knowing him the way I know\nhim, I just don’t know if he’s meant for the NBA. Some guys aren’t quite meant\nto do all the traveling and game after game after game. He’s more of an in-\nthe-gym guy.”Through a spokesman, Sean Miller declined to comment for this\nstory. So did his attorney, who reviews the contract improvements initiated by\nByrne.Byrne and John Miller say money is not a motivator for Sean. But\nambition can be even more influential. John Miller has noticed that some of\nhis son’s friends have moved on to coach in the NBA, particularly former\nFlorida coach Billy Donovan, now with the Oklahoma City Thunder, and former\nArizona star Steve Kerr, now with the Golden State Warriors.“I don’t know if\nthat’s maybe got him looking,” John Miller said. “At this point, I don’t know.\nI haven’t really discussed it with him too much lately. I think he’s happy\nwhere’s he’s at, and I think he has his mind set on getting into that Final\nFour.”Maryland nearly lured him away in 2011, a dalliance that was followed by\nthe first of his five contract amendments at Arizona, which included a two-\nyear extension, a pay raise and more time on the jet for recruiting. It was\n“close,” Byrne said of Miller’s decision in 2011.Like many of his peers in\nsimilar situations, Byrne doesn’t want to risk losing the head of a successful\nprogram that accounted for $22 million of $87 million in total operating\nrevenues for Arizona athletics in fiscal year 2015, according to the\nschool.“Coach Miller obviously is a high-demand coach in his sport,” said\nHeiler, chairman of the regents that oversee the state’s three public\nuniversities and approve such contracts. “It’s driven not only by the rest of\nthe college basketball world. It’s also driven by the professional basketball\nworld. Scarce leadership resources puts constant upward pressure on\ncompensation. … We deal with it like any board would in any industry in any\nsetting regarding its top leadership talent.”They also know there are limits\nout there. Just ask Arizona students.Arizona is one of the last holdouts in\nthe Pac-12 Conference — one of only two public schools in the league that\ndidn’t receive funding in athletics last year from student\nfees.“Philosophically, it’s something I’d prefer not to do,” Byrne said.But\nhe’s starting to wonder if he might have no other choice. After in-state rival\nArizona State recently added a mandatory $150 annual student fee to fund\nathletics, Arizona is under pressure to enter that race for revenue. This\nyear, Arizona officials considered adding a $200 student fee to help fund\nfootball stadium upgrades and might push for it again next year.Huge\ntelevision contracts have dramatically boosted the revenues of college sports,\nhelping Arizona’s operating revenues more than double from $40 million in\n2005, not adjusting for inflation. At the same time, the rising revenues of\ncollege sports have fueled escalating expenses.In Arizona’s case, athletics\nhad about $78.2 million in generated operating revenues last year, compared to\n$80.7 million in operating expenses, which ranked sixth among public schools\nin the Pac-12.To bridge the shortfall, Arizona receives university subsidies\nmuch like most of its public-school peers in the Power Five conferences. In\nArizona’s case last year, that came in the form of $1.5 million for utilities,\nplus $7.4 million in tuition waivers from the state board of regents to help\npay for athletics scholarships, a benefit also given to ASU.By adding a\nstudent fee, Arizona would be keeping up with the competition in one respect.\nIt would be gaining opposition in another.“I’ve heard overwhelming negative\nfeedback from students (on the student fee),” said Joe Zanoni, an Arizona\nstudent and senator for the university’s Associated Students. “Lots of\nstudents, especially in engineering, are here for five years and they’d be\npaying $1,000 to the athletic department. That’s a big chunk of change for our\ngeneration, especially because we’re getting buried in student loan debt,\ntoo.”Byrne said the football stadium needs the funding, arguing that parts of\nit are nearly 100 years old and need to be updated to stay operational. Such\nimprovements also are relevant to the whole athletics department because\nfootball is its biggest cash cow and one of at least two critical sources\nByrne cites for increasing revenue and funding rising expenses.The other is\nfundraising, one of Byrne’s strengths and the biggest reason Miller’s\ncompensation value jumped so high this year.It’s called the Longevity Fund.\nByrne said it comes from a private donor who offered a gift of 500,000 units\nin a master limited partnership to be used at the discretion of university\nPresident Ann Weaver Hart. Of that amount, a block of 175,000 units each is\nallocated to help in retaining Miller and football coach Rich Rodriguez, with\nanother 100,000 going to help retain Byrne._Financial Times_ identified the\ndonor as Jeff Stevens, the CEO of Western Refining Logistics, a limited\npartnership in El Paso. Stevens didn’t return a message seeking comment, and\nthe school has declined to identify the source of the fund. The full value of\nMiller’s Longevity Fund is nearly $4 million, according to the unit price this\nweek.“We thought that was a creative solution and one that also incentivized\nstaying at Arizona,” Byrne said.The university added the fund to Miller’s\ncontract with amendment No. 4 in 2014, stipulating then that he could become\nvested in a quarter of the fund’s value by this year and then receive a cash\nequivalent of the fund’s full value if he stayed at Arizona through May 2022.\nThe contract also said he would receive the vested value of the fund even if\nhe were fired “without cause” before then, which usually means getting fired\nfor not winning enough games.On the other hand, he doesn’t get any of the\nfund’s value if he voluntarily leaves for another job. A separate retention\nfund in his contract gives him $2.1 million if he stays at Arizona through\nApril 30.That means if Miller were to leave Arizona before the end of next\nmonth, he’d be forfeiting about $6 million. Last week, Miller quickly\nsquelched speculation about returning to his alma mater, which recently had an\nopening.“I have one of the great jobs in college basketball at Arizona,”\nMiller said in a statement. “I have no interest in becoming the head coach at\nPitt.”The longevity and retention funds provide an incentive to stay, but just\nin case it wasn’t good enough in 2014, Arizona reworked his contract in 2015\nwith amendment No. 5. This time, the contract was changed to let him collect\non the full value of the Longevity Fund in 2020 instead of 2022. It also\nvested him at two-thirds of the units’ value last fall instead of one-quarter,\naccounting for a big one-time bump in his compensation value this year.Miller\n“knows that President Hart and I have been very pleased with the job he has\ndone as our men’s basketball coach, and we’ve tried to reflect that by keeping\nhim between four and five years on his contract,” Byrne said.Asked why the\nuniversity accelerated the vesting and payout dates for Miller last year,\nByrne said, “That was a discussion between Sean and myself. … We were looking\nat the marketplace and thought this was a good solution and the best chance to\nhave our team in place during this time frame.”Another way to explain it is\nthat Miller simply had the upper hand. The leverage comes from his record and\nthe market. And the market will keep going up until it can’t, possibly because\nof legal, political or economic factors.Legal challenges continue to seek the\npossibility of more compensation for college athletes, who can receive\nscholarships and money for expenses but not salaries. The more money coaches\nmake, the more it seems unfair that the players don’t share more of the\nwealth.Sports economist Andrew Zimbalist called it an artificial market.“The\nreason why the coaches are able to command those salaries is because the\nplayers aren’t getting paid,” Zimbalist said. “The coaches are getting paid\nfor the value of the players they are recruiting.”And when subsidies and\nstudent fees are being used to balance the books and fund other expenses, the\nmarket starts looking like a bubble destined to burst, Zimbalist\nsaid.“Politically, it’s not sustainable,\" he said. \"Legally, it’s not\nsustainable. Economically, it’s not sustainable. And it’s going to be\nchanged.”Heiler, the chairman of the Arizona regents, said he wonders where\nthe ceiling might be.“I think institutions are going to have to … realize\nthere’s something to be said for having coaches who at some point feel like\nthey are being adequately compensated to reach all of their goals and\naspirations,” Heiler said of the market in general. “How much is enough, you\nknow, to be a collegiate coach in basketball and football and to be happy and\nfulfilled and to live a wonderful life?”**PHOTOS: Top 15 highest paid men's\nNCAA hoops coaches****Contributing: Jodi Upton****_Follow sports reporter\nBrent Schrotenboer on Twitter @Schrotenboer.

Now, imagine\nlearning your college dreams are coming true in front of millions of\nviewers.That’s what happened to Tyra Riedemonn, a 17-year-old high school\nsenior at the Young Women’s Leadership Academy of East Harlem. She thought she\nwould be appearing on NBC’s _Today_ show Wednesday to discuss the 15th\nanniversary of the CollegeBound Initiative (CBI), a program that places full-\ntime college guidance experts in high-need public schools in New York City.But\nshe was in for the surprise of her life.After Director of College Counseling\nJessica Sabia, who works with Riedemonn, explained the initiative to _Today_’s\nAl Roker outside in the _Today_ show plaza, she revealed that Riedemonn had\nbeen accepted to Gettysburg College in Gettysburg, Pa.Riedemonn’s ecstatic\nresponse says it all.But there was more. In an off-air segment filmed for the\nYoung Women’s Leadership Network — which supports both CBI and a network of\nall-girls public secondary schools — Sabia had another piece of news:\nRiedemonn would be receiving $60,000 a year in financial aid (annual tuition\nand fees at the college total $63,000).Darryl Jones, Tyra’s Gettysburg\nadmissions counselor, arrived to deliver the “fat envelope” sealing her\nfuture. With Sabia and Jones beside her, Tyra excitedly called her mom.“I’m\nbeing serious, mommy!” she said. “I’m looking at (the letter) right\nnow!”Riedemonn tells USA TODAY College, “I love the (Gettysburg) campus\nenvironment and I just love what they’re about in general.”And the\nscholarship? “Icing on the cake,” she says.The moment seemed just as\nexhilarating for Jones, since he could finally congratulate her on the\nadmissions decision. To keep the acceptance a secret, he said that Gettysburg\nhad to alter the mailing and electronic notification sequences so that\nRiedemonn didn’t find out when most other applicants had some 10 days\nearlier.“She’s been such a joy because she’s so brilliant, so spirited and\nsuch a wonderful human being,” Jones says. “We won the lottery in getting\nTyra.”Riedemonn, who credits her all-girls education for building her\nconfidence, is considering a major in psychology. She also plans to minor in\ntheater, one of her extracurricular passions. Following the _Today_ show\nappearance, she’s going to the Broadway musical _The King and I_ through the\nTheatre Development Fund’s Open Doors program.\n\n","title":"Surprise!

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023ee3"},"content":"This photo from March 17, 2016, shows fliers in line for security screening at\nSeattle-Tacoma International Airport. (Photo: Ted S. Warren, AP)NEW YORK (AP)\n— An expedited screening program called PreCheck was supposed to be the answer\nto maddeningly long security lines at the airport. But four years after its\nlaunch, the Transportation Security Administration is far short of enrolling\nenough travelers to make a difference, spelling trouble for summer travel\nseason.Fliers can expect massive security lines across the country, with\nairlines already warning passengers to arrive at least two hours early or risk\nmissing their flight.The TSA cut its airport screener staff by 10% in the past\nthree years, anticipating PreCheck would speed up the process. When not enough\nfliers enrolled, the agency tried to make up for that shortfall by randomly\nplacing passengers into the express lanes. But it recently scaled back that\neffort for fear dangerous passengers were being let through. That's when the\nlines started growing, up to 90 minutes in some cases.**BOOKMARK**: Go\ndirectly to the Today in the Sky homepageThe TSA is shifting some resources to\ntackle lines at the nation's biggest airports, but says there is no easy\nsolution to the problem with a record number of fliers expected this\nsummer.\"We had unacceptable line waits at the majority of our hubs,\" says\nRobert Isom, chief operating officer of American Airlines. \"Based on what the\nTSA is telling us, there is no relief in sight.\"Launched nationwide in 2012,\nPreCheck gives previously vetted passengers special screening. Shoes, belts\nand light jackets stay on. Laptops and liquids stay in bags. And these fliers\ngo through standard metal detectors rather than the explosive-detecting full-\nbody scanners most pass through.PreCheck lanes can screen 300 passengers an\nhour, twice that of standard lanes.The TSA offered Congress a lofty goal of\nhaving 25 million fliers enrolled in the program. Based on that and other\nincreased efficiencies, the TSA's front-line screeners were cut from 47,147\nthree years ago to 42,525 currently. At the same time, the number of annual\nfliers passing through checkpoints has grown from 643 million to more than 700\nmillion.As of March 1, only 9.3 million people were PreCheck members.\nApplicants must pay $85 to $100 every five years. They must also trek to the\nairport for an interview before being accepted. Getting once-a-year fliers to\nspend the time or the money to join has been a challenge. While 250,000 to\n300,000 people are joining every month, it will take more than four years at\nthat pace to reach the target.\"It hasn't been a failure; it just isn't moving\nas quickly as it needs to move,\" says Sharon Pinkerton, senior vice president\nfor legislative and regulatory policy at airline trade group Airlines for\nAmerica.Without enough members, the TSA faced a problem: PreCheck lanes were\nnearly deserted while other lines snaked throughout terminals. Keeping empty\nPreCheck lanes open was a waste of staff. But without them, passengers who\npaid to join would be aggravated.So the agency created workarounds to allow\npassengers who hadn't been fully vetted to still get expedited screening.Those\nwho flew 50,000 miles a year or more with an airline sometimes got the\nPreCheck designation on their boarding pass at check-in. Others would randomly\nget it based on demographic information.As a further step, the TSA in 2013\ncreated a program called Managed Inclusion where it randomly pulls people out\nof the normal line when it grows too long. Fliers' behavior is monitored, they\nare screened for explosives and then allowed to use the faster PreCheck\nlane.In this photo from March 17, 2016, Jeff Molina -a \"pathfinder\" worker at\nSeattle-Tacoma International Airport -- uses a two-way radio to get\ninformation about crowd levels at other security checkpoints as he holds a\nsign marking the end of an hour-long line for security screening. (Photo: Ted\nS. Warren, AP)The Associated Press has spent the last year fighting under the\nFreedom of Information Act for details on how many fliers are allowed into\nPreCheck through each method, but has been denied the information for\nunspecified security reasons.Lines did get shorter. By Thanksgiving 2014\nnearly 50% of fliers were getting expedited screening.Then last year, two\nback-to-back embarrassing inspector general reports came out, highlighting TSA\nsecurity lapses. One disclosed that the agency let a convicted domestic\nterrorist use PreCheck. The second revealed that in 67 out of 70 tests across\nthe nation, screeners failed to find mock weapons and explosives.In response,\nTSA agents stopped pulling passengers out of line unless there was an\nexplosive-detecting canine team present. That change went into effect in\nSeptember, right after the Labor Day rush.The move forced about 10% of all\npassengers — some 70 million fliers a year — to go back to normal\nscreening.Longer lines soon followed. By February, just 26% of passengers were\nscreened through PreCheck, according to Associated Press calculations on TSA\ndata obtained through a public records request.During the week of spring break\nin mid-March, 6,800 American Airlines passengers missed their flights because\nof long checkpoint lines, foreshadowing the headaches airlines fear during the\npeak summer travel months.\"The TSA is more or less suggesting that we need to\nlive with it,\" says Isom, American's chief operating officer.At Seattle-Tacoma\nInternational Airport waits have topped out at 90 minutes, with the typical\nmorning rush averaging 45 minutes to an hour, says Wendy Reiter, the airport's\ndirector of security and emergency preparedness. In the first week of March,\n50 Delta Air Lines passengers missed international flights — the type of\nflight that only departs once a day.Last week, officials in Charlotte were\nwarning passengers of waits exceeding 75 minutes, saying the lines were\n\"extremely heavy.\"At the world's busiest airport, in Atlanta, general manager\nMiguel Southwell told the TSA last month that \"things appear to be only\ngetting worse.\"And in Minneapolis, executive director Jeffrey Hamiel told the\nTSA that \"we are experiencing unacceptably long security wait times during\npeak periods.\"The TSA knows there is no quick fix.\"The real answer to the\nvolume growth is to ideally get a fully-vetted trusted traveler population,\"\nTSA Administrator Peter Neffenger told The Associated Press.For now though,\nthe agency is relocating 28 of its 142 canine teams to the 20 busiest airports\nso it can randomly put more fliers into PreCheck. The TSA won't say which\nairports are losing the teams and could therefore have longer lines.An\nadditional 200 screeners are being trained each week, but that is offset by\nthe average 103 screeners the TSA loses weekly through attrition. The agency\nis asking airlines to enforce carry-on bags restrictions before checkpoints so\nit has fewer bags to screen. Airport and airline staff will also take over\nsome non-security related tasks, such as returning empty bins to the start of\nthe checkpoint.There has been one bright side: the TSA says there is a direct\ncorrelation between longer lines and a spike in PreCheck enrollments.**IN\nPICTURES: Behind the scenes at LAX****IN PICTURES: 30 cool aviation photos**\n\n","title":"'No relief in sight' for long TSA lines","twitter":{"body":"RT @TodayInTheSky: 'No relief in sight' for long TSA lines https://t.co/kLZem9gTgE (AP) https://t.co/2GT2PycZOZ","date":"Wed Mar 30 15:13:26 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715195236004339713"},"retweets":20},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1M0gBza"}

IIHS found that many of the\nindustry's luxury midsize cars perform just as poorly as mainstream models, or\neven worse, with a luxury BMW model posting the lowest score.It's more than a\nconvenience problem. Visibility issues create a safety hazard, ranging from\nexcessive glare to insufficient illumination.\"With about half of traffic\ndeaths occurring either in the dark or in dawn or dusk conditions, improved\nheadlights have the potential to bring about substantial reductions in\nfatalities,\" IIHS said.John Whiteside, 54, of Rock Hill, Calif., said\nexcessive glare from oncoming vehicles is a big problem when he drives his\n2002 Toyota Camry. \"I have to literally turn my head a little bit to look\naway,\" Whiteside said. \"It can blind you.\"The study also brought attention to\nthe fact that U.S. auto-safety regulators have left headlight regulations\nlargely untouched for a half century, thus prohibiting certain new\ntechnologies that would light the roadway better while reducing glare.The\nNational Highway Traffic Safety Administration, responding to the IIHS report,\nnoted that its proposed overhaul of its five-star safety ratings will depend\npartially on vehicles' use of lower-beam headlights, semi-automatic beam\nswitching and amber rear turn signal lights — technologies that are supposed\nto improve visibility for the driver and other motorists.\"Basically, we agree\nheadlights can and should be stronger,\" NHTSA spokesman Bryan Thomas\nsaid.Since it's the auto industry, there are often many different headlight\noptions available through various packages on vehicles. So IIHS evaluated\nevery possible combination in several scenarios, including traveling straight,\nveering left sharply or gradually and veering right sharply or gradually.After\nassessing 82 possible combinations in 31 vehicles, the non-profit said only\none — the Toyota Prius v with the highest trim level — qualified as \"good.\"\nThat light combo is available only with the advanced technology package, which\nincludes LED lights and high-beam assist. The standard model, which comes with\nhalogen lights and no high-beam assist, gets a poor rating.Eleven models' best\noption qualified as \"acceptable,\" while nine were \"marginal\" and 10 were\n\"poor.\"Of the poor models, four were General Motors cars (Buick Verano,\nCadillac ATS, Chevrolet Malibu and Malibu Limited), two were Hyundai and Kia\nmodels (Hyundai Sonata, Kia Optima), two were Mercedes-Benz (C-Class and CLA),\none was Nissan (Altima) and one was Volkswagen (Passat).Altogether, 44 of the\n82 possible options qualified as poor, with the halogen-light model on the BMW\n3 Series posting the worst performance overall.Common problems cited on the\nmodels IIHS tested include excessive glare and poor low-beam visibility.\nNewfangled headlights that adapt to curves in the road helped some vehicles\nperform better, though not always.To be sure, the automakers aren't\nnecessarily violating any regulations with poor-performing lights.\"The ability\nto see the road ahead, along with any pedestrians, bicyclists or obstacles, is\nan obvious essential for drivers,\" IIHS said. \"However, government standards\nfor headlights, based on laboratory tests, allow huge variation in the amount\nof illumination that headlights provide in actual on-road driving.\"David Zuby,\nthe institute’s executive vice president and chief researcher, told the\nAssociated Press that regulations for headlights \"are essentially unchanged\"\nsince the 1960s.“In the standard, they are measuring the light coming out of\nthe light source — right in front of the light bulb, in essence — and not\nlooking at how the light is projected down the road, which is what our tests\ndo,” Zuby told the AP.Follow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter\n@NathanBomey.\n\n","title":"Headlight study: Only 1 out of 31 models rated 'good' by IIHS","twitter":{"body":"RT @NathanBomey: Pretty amazing that U.S. headlight regulations haven't been updated since the 1960s: https://t.co/V2UKmo8bHL","date":"Wed Mar 30 13:33:23 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715170057182134273"},"retweets":29},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1PFrd0X"}

Attendees to\nthe conference, which sold out in minutes, will be able to demo HoloLens\nduring Build, which starts Wednesday and ends Friday.The $3,000 device begins\nshipping to hundreds of developers Wednesday, who are expected to create a\nsuite of consumer-focused applications for a product that won't hit stores for\nanother year or two.Expect CEO Satya Nadella and other top Microsoft\nexecutives to tout HoloLens as the company's vision for how consumers will\ninteract with their digital lives in the future. By layering holograms over\nthe real world, users will be able to send emails, watch travelogues and play\nvideo games without disappearing into the occluded world of virtual reality\ngoggles.While a lot of attention is being focused this year on high-end VR\ngear, such as the recently released Oculus Rift, AR ultimately promises to be\n75% of a $120 billion AR/VR market by 2020, according to industry advisors\nDigi-Capital. Microsoft clearly intends to get a jump on the competition,\nwhich includes the intriguing AR work being done by secretive Florida-based\ncompany Magic Leap and Silicon Valley start-up Meta.HoloLens is expected to\nstar at this year's annual Microsoft Build conference in San Francisco.\n(Photo: Microsoft)This futuristic Microsoft showpiece aside, Build should also\nprovide insights into how Microsoft plans to keep Windows 10 momentum building\n(the operating system is now active on more than 200 million devices) once its\none-year free download window ends this summer.Other topics to keep an eye on\ninclude further developments to Cortana, Microsoft's voice-controlled virtual\nassistant; updates on Azure, the cloud computing platform that has made\nimpressive gains on Amazon's long dominant market position; and enhancements\nto the company's Office products, which now include Skype for Business and\ndigital pioneer Ray Ozzie's Talko app that is reminiscent of workplace\ncommunication platform Slack.In January, Microsoft announced its sixth\nstraight quarter of EPS beats, which reaffirms that Nadella, now two years\ninto a radical company turnaround, has picked the right goals for the onetime\nsoftware-selling king.The CEO and longtime Microsoft employee has vowed to\nreshape the company into nimble cloud- and mobile-first enterprise that is a\nleading player in enterprise work solutions, casting aside a losing model in\nan age that continues to see declining global PC sales.Developers are seen as\ncritical to any tech company's dreams of mass adoption. Much as the iPhone\nbecame a hit thanks to the millions of apps created by outside parties, so\nMicrosoft hopes to continue to expand the functionality of its operating\nsystem with the addition of innovative applications that mesh with consumers'\npersonal and work lives.Stay with USA TODAY for coverage of the opening\nkeynote as well as other big highlights from Microsoft Build._Follow USA TODAY\ntech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter @marcodellacava_\n\n","title":"HoloLens expected to star at Microsoft Build","twitter":{"body":"RT @edbaig: HoloLens expected to star at Microsoft Build https://t.co/STB1D4q8U9 via @usatoday","date":"Wed Mar 30 12:29:08 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715153888471605248"},"retweets":9},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MRapV2"}

Hundreds of anti-Trump protesters and supporters had gathered outside\nthe Holiday Inn Express in southern Wisconsin, where Trump was holding his\nmaiden rally in the state ahead of Tuesday's primary.In video posted on social\nmedia of the tense scene, the teen appears to be arguing with a middle-aged\nman and shoves or punches him before the pepper spray is deployed by a second\nman. The girl appears to hold a sign that accuses Trump of supporting white\nsupremacy. She is standing next to another young woman holding a Black Lives\nMatter sign. Others in the crowd could be heard chanting, \"All lives\nmatter.\"Police said they are reviewing several videos taken at the scene and\nhave spoken to several eyewitnesses. The young woman told officers she was\ngroped by a man before pushing him away, police said in a statement.The\ndepartment on Wednesday published a photo of a young man wearing a red \"Make\nAmerica Great Again\" baseball cap who they want to question about the\nincident. Police asked the public with help identifying the man.Janesville\nPolice Chief David Moore said Wednesday that the investigation has been turned\nover to the department's bureau of detectives. \"We intend to learn the true\nevents that occurred and make the appropriate arrests,\" he said.Here's a video\n(and prev photo) taken by @derek94gt of the punch/pepper spray incident at the\nJanesville Trump rally pic.twitter.com/iVCHvsISDiOn Monday, six protesters\nwere arrested on charges of disorderly conduct, obstructing an officer and\ntrespass after refusing to leave the lobby of the Holiday Inn Express as part\nof another anti-Trump protest at the venue, police said.Police said the\nprotesters identified themselves as belonging to the group Showing Up for\nRacial Justice. Members of the group had locked themselves together inside of\nPVC piping before occupying the lobby area. About 60 other protesters who\nentered the lobby left the hotel at the request of police.No photo of the\npunch, but here's a photo of the pepper spray. Woman received medical\ntreatment, police said. pic.twitter.com/1EOyBbAWQzTrump has faced criticism\nfrom rivals that the tenor of his campaign has created an unsafe environment\nat his rallies.Earlier this month, Trump abruptly canceled an event in Chicago\nout of safety concerns after hundreds of protesters filled the arena where he\nwas scheduled to speak. In another incident this month, a 78-year-old man was\ncharged with assault and disorderly conduct after he sucker-punched a\nprotester during a rally in Fayetteville, N.C.Inside the hotel conference\ncenter, Trump on Tuesday dismissed Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker as an\nineffective leader, arguing that the Badger State governor has been a poor\nsteward of the state's economy.Trump went after Walker hours after the\nWisconsin governor threw his support behind Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for the GOP\npresidential nomination.\"By the summer of 2015, Wisconsin was facing a $2.2\nbillion, two-year budget deficit,\" Trump said. \"That's terrible ...Twenty\nthousand fewer people in Wisconsin's labor force than seven years ago even\nthough the population has grown by 100,000.\"Polls show that the race for\nWisconsin is tight, and a win for Cruz would go a long way in complicating\nTrump’s hopes to win the nomination outright before the party’s national\nconvention in Cleveland this summer.Gov. John Kasich is polling a distant\nthird. But because the state’s 42 delegates are allocated on the basis of\nstate and congressional district winners, the Ohio governor’s showing could\nhave a significant impact on shaping the GOP race ahead of several winner-\ntake-all contests coming up.The rally in Janesville, home of Republican House\nSpeaker Paul Ryan, marked Trump’s kickoff campaign event ahead of next week’s\nWisconsin primary. Cruz and Kasich have been campaigning throughout the state\nfor days. Trump says he’s planning to spend much of this week with rallies\nplanned in Appleton and Green Bay.\"If we win Wisconsin, it's over,\" Trump\nsaidTrump arrived in Wisconsin on a day when his campaign faces plenty of\nheadwind.His campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was charged with simple\nbattery for an altercation with a reporter in Florida earlier this month.\nTrump, however, says the allegations against Lewandowski are baseless and\ncharged that the reporter, Michelle Fields, greatly exaggerated what\nhappened.\"Don't forget, initially she said 'thrown to the floor,'\" Trump said.\n\"If somebody squeezed your arm or hurt you wouldn't you start screaming or\nsomething?

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023eed"},"content":"SAN FRANCISCO – The government’s surprise decision to withdraw its case\nagainst Apple over the San Bernardino killer's iPhone  adds uncertainty to\ncriminal cases where state and local authorities have been confronted with\nmore than 1,000 locked smartphones and other devices, blocking access to\npotential evidence, according to a survey of more than a dozen\njurisdictions.These locked devices are separate from the most high profile\none: the iPhone used by Syed Farook, who with his wife, Tashfeen Malik,\ncarried out the December mass shooting in San Bernardino that left 14 dead. In\nmid February, a California court had ordered Apple to aid the FBI in\nsidestepping the security function of that iPhone, an action resisted by Apple\nout of concerns creating new software would make all iPhones more\nvulnerable.Monday afternoon the FBI announced it had been able to unlock the\niPhone without Apple’s aid and did not need to move forward with its case.\nMagistrate Judge Sheri Pym vacated her Feb. 16 order on Tuesday afternoon.Left\nunanswered is what Justice’s abandoned legal action means for the many other\nlaw enforcement agencies seeking assistance in unlocking encrypted iPhones,\niPads and encrypted devices from other manufacturers.“We were hoping this\ndecision, which could have gone to the Supreme Court, would have been a road\nmap and now it’s not,” said Stewart Baker, a partner in the Washington office\nof Steptoe \u0026amp; Johnson.State and local investigators have been blocked from\naccessing the contents of the more than 1,000 devices because of their\ninability to bypass security functions similar to those encountered by the FBI\nin the San Bernardino case. Some of the local cases have been resolved even\nthough possible evidence on the locked devices remained out of investigators'\nreach.The data, gathered in part from queries by Manhattan District Attorney\nCyrus Vance, indicate one of the largest number of locked phones seized in\nconnection with criminal investigations has been amassed in New York. Vance\nhas accumulated more than 200 blocked devices while the New York Police\nDepartment estimated that there are an additional “hundreds’’ in its\npossession.Officials expect the number of cases in which law enforcement seeks\nto force Apple to assist it overriding its devices' built-in security to\nincrease.In Manhattan alone, Vance’s office says the number of criminal\ninvestigations where it has been unable to get data from Apple devices has\nrisen to 205, out of a total 734 Apple devices received by the cyber lab for\nthis borough of New York City between Oct. 2014 and Feb. 2016.Vance told\nCongress last month he expects the number of cases in his office to rise\ndramatically because 94% of Apple devices feature the iOS 8 operating system\nor higher. Other local prosecutors face similar challenges, he testified.“The\noverwhelming majority of criminal investigations stalled by default device\nencryption will remain so until Congress intervenes,” Vance said in a\nstatement Tuesday.In a statement on Monday, Apple said it would “continue to\nhelp law enforcement with their investigations, as we have done all along, and\nwe will continue to increase the security of our products as the threats and\nattacks on our data become more frequent and more sophisticated.”**SECRET\nMETHOD**Privacy and security supporters held a rally outside of a San\nFrancisco Apple store to protest the U.S. government's demand that Apple give\nthe FBI a backdoor to hack into an iPhone. (Photo: Elizabeth Weise, USA\nTODAY)It is unclear whether the undisclosed technique used to gain access to\nthe phone used by Farook can assist local authorities.“The government has\nreleased so little information that it’s very hard to know what this means for\nother cases. We don’t know what types of phones and operating systems this new\naccess technique works on, so we don’t know how it will affect other phones or\ndevices,” said Kristen Eichensehr, a professor of cyber law at UCLA School of\nLaw in Los Angeles.But such an undertaking, if it is available, likely would\nbe enormous and extend far beyond New York.In Houston, the Harris County\nDistrict Attorney’s Office reported that investigators turned up more than 100\nencrypted devices last year, and have seized up to 10 per month so far in\n2016, spokesman Jeff McShan said.Of the estimated 800 mobile phones seized by\nthe Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department each year, up to 20% have some\ntype of encryption that prevents access, said spokesman Robert Tufano. He said\nApple is not the only manufacturer with encryption that “prevents us from\naccessing phones.’’“Investigators have just thrown up their hands in many\ncases, because they know that encryption has put potentially key evidence\nbeyond their reach,’’ NYPD spokesman Peter Donald said.“We have been working\nthis issue for the past year,’’ said David LaBahn, president of the\nAssociation of Prosecuting Attorneys, adding that the group is attempting to\namass a more comprehensive accounting of blocked phones.**BROOKLYN CASE**The\nhighest profile iPhone case aside from San Bernardino has been in Brooklyn.\nGovernment investigators have sought to compel Apple to help gain access to\ndata on the iPhone of a suspect who pleaded guilty in a methamphetamine\nconspiracy.District Court Judge Margo Brodie on Tuesday approved Apple’s\nmotion for a delay in the case and gave Apple a new deadline of April 15 to\nrespond to the government’s appeal of the magistrate judge’s order in Apple’s\nfavor. She told the government it must notify the court by April 11 whether it\nintends to modify the appeal.In a ruling on that case last month, Judge James\nOrenstein in New York’s Eastern District called the government's use of the\nAll Writs Act too \"expansive.\"As the government had also used the All Writs\nAct in the San Bernardino case, law enforcement officials would have liked\nclarification on whether the Act can be used to force tech companies to help\nthem get into locked devices. The 1789 law says that federal courts can\nrequire individuals to comply in cases that aren’t covered by existing\nlaw.With the withdrawal of the San Bernardino case, no resolution is possible\nand it’s going to take time for the government to have such a strong case\nagain, said David O'Brien, a senior researcher with the Berkman Center for\nInternet \u0026amp; Society at Harvard University.According to some attorneys, the\ngovernment’s actions have seriously weakened its credibility if it attempts to\nargue for compelling companies to help it in future cases. The Department of\nJustice spent a month saying Apple’s assistance was the only way it could get\ninto the phone, and then suddenly said it wasn’t, said Scott Vernick, head of\nthe data security and privacy practice at Fox Rothschild in Philadelphia.“Now\nany other court is going to ask, ‘Really? Are you sure you need their help?\nThat’s what you asked for last time and apparently you didn’t,’” Vernick\nsaid._Contributing: Kevin McCoy from New York__Follow USA TODAY cybersecurity\nreporter Elizabeth Weise on Twitter @eweise_\n\n","title":"1,000 locked devices in limbo after FBI quits iPhone case","twitter":{"body":"1,000 locked devices remain in limbo after the FBI quit their iPhone case: https://t.co/XdWgIuaSGG (Photo: epa) https://t.co/JhpwpU3Tcx","date":"Wed Mar 30 10:38:55 +0000 2016","favs":16,"id":{"$numberLong":"715126150964645888"},"retweets":23},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MR2XJr"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023ef3"},"content":"_Editor’s note: The story below was altered to remove a reference to William\nRhew’s wife.__Corrections and clarifications: A previous version of this\narticle misspelled Nathan Rhew’s name._“I remember the day I did it. I sat in\na Food City parking lot for 45 minutes and contemplated what I had just done\nand how it was going to affect my life.”William Rhew, a 21-­year-­old former\nPentecostal Christian raised in Johnson City, Tenn., is discussing his\nconversion to Islam. He says he doesn’t exactly fit the Muslim stereotype.“I\ndon’t look like what people fear,” Rhew says. “I don’t have a beard, I’m not\nArab.”The senior at Johnson City’s East Tennessee State University converted\nin 2012 during his senior year of high school. Christianity, he says, left him\nwith many questions so he decided to “look for answers” on his own. He first\nlearned about Islam from a high school friend, a Muslim girl named Sophia. She\nreferred him to Taneem Aziz, a founding member of a local mosque in Johnson\nCity.“(Taneem) is responsible for most of my learning about Islam now because\nwhat I didn’t learn from him, he gave me the resources to learn from, such as\n(websites on) and books, and a copy of the Quran,” says Rhew.He was attracted\nthe religion he says, because of the “simplicity of who is God. I figured out\nthat God is God. … I found that really beautiful. (Another) thing I find\nbeautiful … is that Islam encourages you not only to be pure in heart and\nmind, but to be presentable, to look nice. (And) we have the original Holy\nbook — we can see what was written.”His decision to convert, which he at first\nkept a secret from his immediate family and friends, came about two months\nafter he started studying the religion.“Many of my friends who have converted\nhave spent three or four years studying Islam before they even considered to\nconvert,” Rhew says. “Although it was a bit hasty, I did put a lot of effort\ninto researching the religion before I jumped into it.”The scariest part, he\nsays, was “realizing that everything you once were religiously is now (thought\nof) as wrong or partially wrong, and you have to come to terms with the fact\nthat some things have to be relearned.”One of the hardest things about\nconverting was not knowing how others would react, he says. “I didn’t really\ncome out, so to speak, as Muslim with my friends and even still some of my\nfamily don’t know.” His parents, he explains, discovered his new religion\nthrough his actions.“They had known something was kind of different when I\nbegan to not eat pork, (though) I never had a thing for alcohol, I never\ndrank. (But) they noticed my patterns … were a little different. I was waking\nup at an odd time early in the morning, doing something they weren’t sure\n(what it was), which was prayer. And they saw who my (new) friends\nwere.”Religion, he says, is now a taboo subject at home: “We don’t talk about\nit because it creates conflict and that’s not what I want. It’s not\nproductive.”“I want Wil to always make a choice for himself and know it’s the\nright choice,” says Rhew’s mom, Rebecca Rhew. She and his father, Nathan Rhew,\nhave lived in the area for some 20 years. She supports Wil, she says, and what\nhe “believes in his heart,” because he’s her son.“Wil may believe differently\nfrom what we want him to believe, but I would not debate him or put him down,”\nshe says. “It’s hard to know about different cultures. You have to learn and\ntake into consideration what the other person is thinking. I don’t put down\nsomeone else’s religion (even if) I don’t accept it myself. It’s not my place\nto judge them. (And) I think one of the things Wil has showed me is you can’t\npush (religion) down; people have to believe it for themselves.”Rhew, who is\npresident of the Muslim Student Association’s ETSU’s campus chapter and\nattends the local mosque at least once a week, says the media doesn’t help as\nit can influence people to perceive all Muslims as extremists. “I wish the\nvoices of normal Muslims would be heard over that of the extremists’,” he\nsays, “because, unfortunately, the more extreme voices yell louder.”He\nsuggests that people take the time to speak with Muslims instead of making\ngeneralizations.  “Assumptions are very dangerous,” Rhew says. “Assumptions\nare what have us in the state we are in now. … Don’t prejudge us from what you\nsee or hear.”“Diversity is nature’s beauty,” he believes, and when he meets\npeople of different faiths, he wants to know more about them and their\nreligions.“I’ve always had an interest in religion and culture, and I think in\npart that attributed to my becoming Muslim — I was willing to learn about it.”\n\n","title":"From Christian to Muslim: One student's coming out story | News for College Students | USA TODAY College","twitter":{"body":"The “simplicity of who is God,\" attracted him to Islam, says 21-year-old convert Wil Rhew. https://t.co/hdrfuzggWq https://t.co/1clGpQB9am","date":"Wed Mar 30 04:10:14 +0000 2016","favs":86,"id":{"$numberLong":"715028335575842816"},"retweets":57},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1V14yD2"}

Seriously, just stop lying.\"The New York\nbillionaire continued taking shots at Fields on Twitter throughout the day,\ntweeting \"Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions?

The department also cited an interview with another reporter who saw\nwhat happened. The police report said \"probable cause\" existed to charge\nLewandowski \"in that he did intentionally touch\" Fields against her\nwill.Earlier, the Trump campaign said in a statement that Lewandowski is\n\"absolutely innocent of this charge,\" and is \"completely confident that he\nwill be exonerated.\"Lewandowski previously denied the accusation by Fields,\nsaying he did not touch her and described the reporter as\n\"delusional.\"@MichelleFields you are totally delusional.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023ef7"},"content":"Millennials have more than enough financial worries. Now they can add about 2\nmillion more to their list. That's how much many might need to save to\nretire.Older Millennials — those born in the early 1980s — will need about\n$1.8 million salted away to maintain their standard of living in retirement\nwhile younger Millennials — those born in the late 1990s — will need upwards\nof $2.5 million, according to various studies, estimates and experts.To be\nfair, that equation makes two big assumptions. One, it assumes they'd need to\ngenerate $30,000 to $40,000 in annual income from their nest eggs in today's\ndollars. And two, it assumes a 2% inflation rate, which is currently the\nFederal Reserve’s target rate.So why do Millennials, aka Gen Y, need so much\nset aside? First, there’s the issue of inflation. Assuming a 2% inflation\nrate, a $1 million nest egg today would be worth about $530,000 in 32 years,\nwhich is when Millennials now in their mid-30s are expected to retire, and\nroughly $386,000 in 48 years, when the youngest Millennials are expected to\ncall it quits.What does this mean? Millennials who are behind the eight-ball\nwill have to start saving aggressively now if they aspire to have the same\nstandard of living in retirement as they did when working.Why? One, they are\nunlikely to have a pension plan as did their grandparents. Plus, their Social\nSecurity benefits are likely to be less generous than today's. And if all that\nwasn’t reason enough, Millennials are projected to live even longer than\ncurrent retirees.The oldest Millennials, assuming they have no money set aside\ntoday and that they earn 5% on their investments, will need to sock away\n$2,000 a month for 32 years to accumulate a $1.8 million nest egg. And the\nyoungest Millennials would need to save $1,000 a month for 48 years to\naccumulate $2.4 million.The really bad news? All this math changes if you need\nmore than $40,000 per year from your personal assets in today’s dollars and if\ninflation runs at 3%, the long-term historical average. In fact, that person\nwould need at least $3 million in their nest egg, says Michael Lonier, a\nfinancial adviser with Lonier Financial Advisory in Osprey, Fla., who was\nquick to add: “Glad I’m not 35.”**Just how much?**The youngest of the Boomers,\nthose born in 1964, would need $1.3 million earmarked for retirement. A Gen\nXer born in 1975 would need about $1.6 million.

Lines must be drawn,\nwhich means that despite a trio of top stars — Aaron Paul, Hugh Dancy and\nMichelle Monaghan — and an admirably unusual premise, Hulu’s _The Path_\n(Wednesday, ** ½  out of four) simply may not be one you want to follow._The\nPath, c_reated by Jessica Goldberg, explores the communal lives and faith of\nthe followers of Meyerism — a made-up religion that seems to be a combination\nof Scientology, EST and New Age veganism. Living together on a compound, these\nMeyerists are both intensely private and intensely committed, shunning\npublicity as they follow the Ladder toward the Light.But change is in the\nwind. The religion's founding father is in Peru and out of touch, leaving day-\nto-day operations in the hands of Cal (Dancy), who thinks Meyerism needs to\nstop hiding its Light under a bushel.That switch does not sit well with Sarah\n(Monaghan), but she has more immediate problems. Her husband, Eddie (Paul),\nhas returned from Peru troubled and distant — the result, she thinks, of a\nsexual affair. The truth, which Eddie keeps to himself, is that something has\nrocked his faith.There are interesting questions here, including how we decide\nwhat we’re willing to embrace (or at least accord grudging respect) as a\nreligion and what we dismiss as a cult. And respect is the watchword here:\nWhile we’re clearly meant to see worrisome aspects in Meyerism — led by the\nuse of force to retain straying members — it’s just as clear that we’re not\nmeant to mock its followers. There are, after all, worse sins in life than\nbeing painfully earnest.In TV, however, there are few worse sins than being\nuninvolving — and despite the best efforts of a strong cast, that’s where _The\nPath_ lands. Lives and happiness are at stake here, yet the dramatic stakes\nsomehow linger between low and medium. Monaghan’s Sarah is a blind zealot;\nPaul’s Eddie is a liar who allows his wife to suffer under the belief that he\nhas been unfaithful rather then admit he’s questioning his faith. No matter\nhow much these two lovely people love each other, this is not a marriage we’re\nleft crying out to see saved.Worse yet for the show’s dramatic purposes, the\nbelief system they’re battling over is so indistinct that it barely exists.\nThe cult emerges as a hazy, marijuana-drenched mix of dated  clichés, kept\nvague, perhaps, to avoid offense to any particular group. We’re meant to be\nmoved by the power of faith rather than faith itself, but that’s a fine line\nfor a series that gives us too little of substance or interest to hang on to\notherwise.On the plus side, Hulu is giving you only two hour-long episodes\nWednesday, with the other eight to follow on a weekly basis. That limited\ncommitment leaves you a week to decide whether you want to return.I wouldn’t,\nbut hey: Your time; your path.\n\n","title":"Review: Hulu's  'The Path' may not be worth taking","twitter":{"body":"So many paths, so little time.

But the official did not know whether the\ninformation included records of direct communication with any of the victims\nin the December shooting or other exchanges that may be related to the assault\ncarried out by Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik.Both attackers later died\nin a shootout with police.Authorities have defended their pursuit of the\nphone’s contents, including obtaining a federal magistrate's order directing\nApple to assist the government, to determine whether Farook specifically\ntargeted fellow workers at the December office party or was assisted by others\nunknown to  investigators.Justice lawyers abandoned their defense of the court\norder Monday, when they informed the judge that a technique developed by an\nunidentified entity was successful in allowing investigators to gain access to\nthe phone.“We sought an order compelling Apple to help unlock the phone to\nfulfill a solemn commitment to the victims of the San Bernardino shooting –\nthat we will not rest until we have fully pursued every investigative lead\nrelated to the vicious attack,'' California U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker said\nafter the Justice filing. \"Although this step in the investigation is now\ncomplete, we will continue to explore every lead, and seek any appropriate\nlegal process, to ensure our investigation collects all of the evidence\nrelated to this terrorist attack.''Meanwhile, the entity that assisted the FBI\nin bypassing the phone’s security function has completed its work, the federal\nlaw enforcement official said.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023efa"},"content":"JACKSON, Miss. — A man who discovered lead components in a city water main and\nthen told the public was fired Thursday from his job in Jackson's Public Works\nDepartment.Jonathan Yaeger, who had been working as an engineer in training in\nFebruary when he found a corroded band of lead connecting two pipes while\nhelping replace a water main, is a student at Jackson State University who had\na full-time job in the department. He was going to be responsible for\ninspecting new water lines and preparing contract documents, among other\ntasks, and had just acquired the responsibility of managing the city’s storm-\nwater permits.“I was going to be the storm-water guy,” he said.Public Works\nDirector Kishia Powell terminated Yaeger less than two weeks after he\npresented the lead joint to _The Clarion-Ledger_, which prompted a story about\nlead materials in the city’s water-distribution system.“I was disappointed in\nthe decision of the director to, in my view, put the reputation of the city\nbefore the safety of the public,” Yaeger said. “I think what I did is\nethically right.”Mayor Tony Yarber’s spokeswoman, Shelia Byrd, did not return\ncalls Tuesday but emailed a statement.“It is city policy not to comment on\npersonnel matters,” she wrote.In a letter the city provided Yaeger at the time\nof his termination, Powell wrote that Yaeger admitted to the department that\nhe had spoken to a reporter and provided the lead joint to a non-city\nemployee.The lawyer representing Yaeger, Louis Watson, argues that the city is\nviolating his client's First Amendment rights.“He engaged in protected\nactivity, freedom of speech,” Watson said. “They have terminated him here for\nspeaking to the media.”The city's termination letter contended that Yaeger’s\nactions placed the city “in a false light, which may be damaging to the\nreputation of the department.”“(Y)our assertions were not accurate and lacked\nimportant context,” the letter reads. “You were not authorized to take the\nportion of the pipe joint nor provide this city property to a non-city\nemployee.”Yaeger said he obtained the pipe piece from a contractor who had\nplanned to dispose of it. The contractor willingly gave the materials to\nhim.When he first discovered the lead joint, Yaeger said he took his concerns\nto officials in his department, even offering to address City Council, but\nthey discouraged him from doing so.“The advice of my supervisors was 'Don’t\ntalk to the press. Never talk to the press,' ” Yaeger said. “I feel like I was\nbasically asked to withhold information for the sake of the city’s\nreputation.”_The Clarion-Ledger_ contacted Yaeger after learning that he\nobtained the materials. Previously, city officials made no mention of lead\nwithin the distribution system and attributed high levels of lead discovered\nin taps across the city to individual homes’ plumbing.“I made no speculations\nor ascertains that it is leaching,” Yaeger said, adding he only supplied the\npipe piece to address the question of whether the lead could be coming from\nthe distribution system.In a March 15 interview, Powell confirmed that older\ncast-iron pipes in the city's distribution system contain lead joints every 20\nfeet. She was unable to say how much of the city's water system contains these\nmaterials or whether the water makes contact with the lead joints.Powell said\nshe doesn’t believe the joints are contributing to the city’s problem with\nlead-contaminated drinking water because if they were, the city would see more\nwater samples with higher lead levels.In the June sample of 58 homes, 90%\ncontained lead. In the January and February sample of 102 homes, 65% contained\nlead. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the federal Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention both say lead in drinking water is not safe at\nany concentration.City workers are taking samples from the distribution\nsystem, but officials have not released results of that sampling yet, Powell\nsaid.The Yaeger's termination letter states his actions “have contributed to\nfalse information being provided to the citizens of Jackson as well as\npossibly creating unwarranted public fear.”City officials have not specified\nwhat false information has been provided, and _The Clarion-Ledger _has not\nreceived any calls from Public Works Department or other Jackson city\nofficials about inaccuracies in its reporting on Jackson’s lead-contamination\nproblems.The city also argues that Yaeger violated the Code of Ethics for\nEngineers’ Rules of Practice:“The nature of a whistle-blower is you’re unable\nto get the consent; therefore, you go beyond what is employee protocol,”\nYaeger said. “I think that as a public servant, my duty is to provide\ninformation that allows the public to make informed decisions, not to keep\nsecrets for the sake of the city’s reputation.”Yaeger’s lawyer stressed that\nhis client is not yet a licensed engineer and that he never made any\nstatements publicly. Plus, Powell confirmed — for the first time in public\nbecause of Yaeger’s actions — that the lead joints exist.“What false\ninformation has he presented?” Watson said. “None.”Yaeger will appear before a\ncity personnel board in coming weeks in an attempt to regain his\nposition._Follow Anna Wolfe on Twitter: @ayewolfe_The cartoonist's homepage,\nclarionledger.com/opinion (Photo: Marshall Ramsey, The (Jackson, Miss.)\nClarion-Ledger)\n\n","title":"Water worker fired after talking about lead to media","twitter":{"body":"RT @LindaDono: Wrong in so many ways: Water worker fired after talking about lead to media, https://t.co/ggI0xn9tOJ via @ayewolfe https://t…","date":"Wed Mar 30 00:25:40 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714971820680736768"},"retweets":33},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MzMgaA"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023efb"},"content":"WILMINGTON, Del. — A pest control company has agreed to pay $10 million to\nresolve allegations that it was illegally spraying a toxic pesticide that\nsickened and nearly killed a Delaware family vacationing in the U.S. Virgin\nIslands last year.The U.S. Justice Department said Tuesday that Terminix has\nadmitted to using a pesticide called methyl bromide at 14 locations –\nincluding at the Sirenusa condominium resort in St. John where the family was\nvacationing in March 2015.The pesticide, which is odorless and can severely\ndamage the central nervous and respiratory systems, has been banned for indoor\nuse by the Environmental Protection Agency since 1984.A Terminix worker\nsprayed the pesticide in the condo below where the family – Steve Esmond,\nthen-head of Tatnall's middle school; his wife, Dr. Theresa Divine; and their\ntwo sons – was staying for eight nights. The family fell ill two days\nlater.Months later the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands said Esmond and his\nsons were in serious to critical condition and had suffered neurological\ndamage.The family's health condition was so severe that Pope Francis paused to\nbless them, at the urging of U.S. Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware, before leaving\nthe region during his trip to Philadelphia for the World Meeting of Families\nin September.An update on their current conditions was not immediately\navailable Tuesday.James J. Maron, a Wilmington lawyer, had been acting as a\nspokesman for the family, but someone who answered the phone at his law firm\nTuesday declined to comment and would not give a reporter his name.A spokesman\nfor Terminix also did not immediately return a call seeking comment.Steve\nEsmond and his family were poisoned by a pesticide while vacationing in St.\nJohn. (Photo: Submitted)U.S. Attorney Ronald W. Sharpe of the District of the\nVirgin Islands said in a statement that the prosecution demonstrates the\nimportance of complying with environmental regulations.“Tragically, the\ndefendants' failure to do so resulted in catastrophic injuries to the victims\nand exposed many others to similar harm,\" he said.The family's plight has\ndrawn extensive media coverage around the nation and led federal officials to\ninvestigate.Soon after the government began its investigation, Terminix\nvoluntarily ceased its use of methyl bromide in the U.S. and U.S.\nterritories.It is used only in one remaining government contract at the Port\nof Baltimore.The investigation culminated Tuesday in the U.S. Justice\nDepartment and the Environmental Protection Agency announcing that Terminix\nhad been charged with multiple violations of the Federal Insecticide,\nFungicide and Rodenticide Act.In a plea agreement, Terminix and its U.S.\nVirgin Islands counterpart agreed to pay $8 million in fines, $1 million for a\ncommunity service project in the U.S. Virgin Islands and $1 million in\nrestitution to the EPA for response and cleanup costs at the St. John\nresort.The company also agreed to \"make good faith efforts to resolve past and\nfuture medical expenses for the family through separate civil proceedings\"\nwhile the company is on probation for three years, the Justice Department\nsaid.The plea agreement is subject to approval by a U.S. District Court\njudge.Terminix admitted to doing a fumigation treatment with methyl bromide\nfor Powder Post Beetles, a common problem in the islands, using the \"tape and\nseal\" method, meaning the affected area was sealed and customers were told to\nstay out for two to three days, according to the U.S. Justice Department.The\ntreatment method was used at the Sirenusa resort in St. John in October 2014\nand March 2015, according to information filed in federal court in the U.S.\nDistrict Court of the Virgin Islands. It also used the pesticide in 12\nresidential units in St. Croix and one additional unit in St. Thomas between\nSeptember 2012 and February 2015.Assistant Administrator Cynthia Giles for the\nEPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance said in a statement that\nthe Delaware family's case shows the \"real consequences\" of breaking a law\nthat is meant to protect public health.“This incident illustrates how\nimportant it is for EPA to enforce environmental laws and hold anyone\naccountable for endangering our safety. Today’s charges should send a clear\nmessage to the industry, and directs important funds toward training programs\nto help ensure this can’t happen again,\" she said.Officials said the criminal\ninvestigation is ongoing._Follow Jessica Masulli Reyes on Twitter:\n@JessicaMasulli_\n\n","title":"Terminix to pay $10M for poisoning Delaware family","twitter":{"body":"Terminix to pay $10 million for poisoning Delaware family that was vacationing in the Virgin Islands. https://t.co/m5v478LlGO","date":"Wed Mar 30 00:25:05 +0000 2016","favs":27,"id":{"$numberLong":"714971674198847488"},"retweets":47},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MR3v1Q"}

And a\nsuspected prime suspect was set free Monday because of a lack of evidence,\ndespite being charged last week with terrorist killings.Local media named the\nman as Fayçal Cheffou and said he was believed to be the \"man in the hat\"\ncaught on video accompanying two suicide bombers minutes before they blew\nthemselves up at the Brussels Airport. After the man was released, authorities\nsaid they were still looking for the man in the video wearing the hat and\nasked for the public's help to identify him.Responding to criticism from the\nEuropean Union and others of lax security, the country's parliament debated\nproposals to boost police powers, including lifting a ban on nighttime\nproperty searches.The first funerals for those slain in the blasts are planned\nfor this week, including those of Mélanie Defize, 29, a record company\nproduction assistant, and Patricia Rizzo, 48, an Italian who worked at the\nEuropean Union headquarters, which is close to the Maelbeek subway station\ntargeted last week.The Belgian prosecutor’s office on Tuesday revised the\ndeath toll to 32, saying that should be the final number unless any of those\nwounded die from their injuries. The previous tally of 35 included three\npeople twice, spokesman Ine Van Wymersch said.Residents continue to leave\nflowers, candles and chalked messages at the Maelbeek stop and the Place de la\nBourse square in front of the Stock Exchange. City authorities said they were\nphotographing messages and cards placed there to keep a permanent digital\nrecord of the tributes.The mood across the city was sober Tuesday, as\nresidents returned to work after the Easter Monday holiday. Many people\navoided public transport, and crowds were thinner than usual on downtown\nstreets.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f03"},"content":"CHARLOTTE — I’d told Ryan Lochte that I defined my swimming skill level as,\n“Capable of not drowning.” He laughed, but I think he really feared the worst\n— that I’d need floaties or something to make it through our swim lesson.I’d\nthought it’d be pretty fun to have an 11-time Olympic medalist teach me each\nof the four strokes — freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly — that\nhave made him one of the greatest swimmers on the planet. I’d never swam\ncompetitively, so I barely knew anything about technique beyond freestyle,\nwhich most people know. And I could tread water pretty well!My first moment of\nconcern came when I popped into an athletic apparel store back in New York,\ntrying to stock up on all the necessary gear. I wasn’t entirely sure what I\nneeded beyond a bathing suit. There were two Speedos on the rack; one for a\nchild and one two sizes too large for me. I erred on the side of baggy. I\nbrowsed the goggle and swim cap selection, blissfully oblivious to the\ndifferences or advantages in any particular style. I grabbed the slightly more\nexpensive goggles and two swim caps. I had no idea if I purchased the right\nthings.(And I forgot to buy a cheap towel.)By the time I got to Charlotte, I\nknew I had to follow through. Lochte and his coach thought the project sounded\nfun; I knew my performance — particularly as I attempted the butterfly — would\nbe hilariously disastrous. I was game, but still nervous. I didn’t want to\ncompletely flail at every single stroke in front of one of the world’s best\nswimmers. And the probability of that happening still hovered around 80%.One\nof Lochte’s female training partners helped me put on my swim cap, to the\namusement of the rest of the group. Then Lochte and I jumped into a smaller\ntraining pool off to the side of the main Olympic-length pool — so, at least I\nwould be shielded from excess ridicule. Besides, it was only about 3 feet\ndeep, so the risk of drowning went way down.The way the training pool operates\nis it allows you to pick the intensity of the current, so you can swim in\nplace. There’s a bar, too, to work on kicking. Mirrors underwater and on the\nceiling allow you to see your strokes and technique.By the time our lesson\nbegan and Lochte began to teach, I loosened up. He had a knack for explaining\ncomplicated maneuvers in a very easy-to-digest way. In short, he was a great\nteacher. Despite the silly faces he made when I didn’t quite listen to his\ninstructions — I forgot to breathe a few times — he was incredibly patient and\nhelpful … except when it came to the fly. He had this devilish grin on his\nface as he tried to teach me the hardest stroke in swimming. Lochte knew I\nwould look like a dead fish, trying not to drown; that is exactly what I\nlooked like. Twice. He made me try it twice.But for the most part, I think I\nimpressed him. Maybe he thought I’d never actually taken a swim lesson before\n— and sure, it’d been about 20 years but that still counts — or he just\nunderestimated my perfectionist nature. But I did learn a bit, and he told me\nafterward I should swim regularly. He and his coach, David Marsh, started\ngoogling pool locations in Manhattan for me to swim at in the future.\nApparently they see the Olympics in my future (!) … or maybe just the step up\nfrom “not drowning.”I'll pretend it's the former.\n\n","title":"What happens when Ryan Lochte teaches reporter Nicole Auerbach to swim","twitter":{"body":"RT @USATODAYsports: Olympian @RyanLochte teaches reporter @NicoleAuerbach to swim: https://t.co/4H7QxLJiDQ https://t.co/fh991aTPtV","date":"Tue Mar 29 19:47:16 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714901761883025408"},"retweets":15},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MPNQ2U"}

The parents never appeared in\nthat film, but Stanton daydreamed of Keaton, now 70, and Levy, 69, who had\nstarred as the lovable father in 1999's _American Pie._Ellen DeGeneres voices\nthe forgetful fish in 'Finding Dory.' (Photo: Pixar)Stanton circled back for\nhis much-anticipated sequel where Dory remembers glimpses of her childhood and\nheads to Monterey, Calif., to reunite with her long-lost parents.The director\ncalled Keaton, in her first animated voice role, and Levy to see if they would\njoin an array of new _Dory _voices _— _including Ty Burrell as Bailey, a\nbeluga whale, and Kaitlin Olson as a whale shark called Destiny.“One of the\nbig perks of working on the sequel of a big movie is that everybody returns\nyour phone calls,” says Stanton. “They immediately jumped on board.”The loving\nfish parents crucially do not have Dory's memory lapses; Pixar filmmakers\ndecided to keep that issue with the daughter. But Jenny and Charlie did pass\non many of Dory’s trademark characteristics.Eugene Levy and Diane Keaton.\n(Photo: Getty/FilmMagic)“Both parents have a certain amount of\nabsentmindedness, there’s a flavor of that,” says Stanton. “There’s a\nflightiness, almost an _Annie Hall_ la-di-da quality to Diane that you just\nwant to believe was part of Dory’s DNA. And Eugene brings a nerdy, dorky,\nlovable quality.”Levy believes his Charlie is a well-meaning parent whose\njokes can be pretty terrible.“Charlie is a good dad who thinks of himself as\nhaving a great sense of humor, though it’s probably not the sharpest,” says\nLevy. “They make for a cute couple, if 'cute' is the appropriate word for a\nfish couple.”That doesn’t mean they don’t have relationship issues, especially\ndealing with a daughter with an inability to remember much of anything.“We’re\nan everyday, ordinary couple. We love each other and we drive each other nuts\nand bicker,\" says Keaton. “It’s like if (Charlie) doesn’t get off my back, I’m\ngoing to wring his neck.”Keaton had added emotional help to get into her\ncharacter.

We having a very happy and quiet day. Love and hugs to allAcclaimed\nfor her acting (her career dates back to the late 1950s), Duke became best\nknown in later life as an advocate for mental health issues, after she was\ndiagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1982 and wrote about it in her 1987\nautobiography.Experts on brain disorders hailed her courage in being one of\nthe first celebrities to speak out about her disorder, depression and\nsubstance abuse.\"By bravely sharing her personal story — so at odds with her\nprofessional image — with the public, she became an inspiration and role model\nfor people and their loved ones who are dealing with mental illness, and\nworked toward eliminating the stigma that prevents so many people from seeking\nhelp. She will be missed,\" said Jeffrey Borenstein, president and CEO of the\nBrain \u0026amp; Behavior Research Foundation, who interviewed Duke for his PBS\nshow _Healthy Minds_.Duke won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for\nher role in _The Miracle Worker_, becoming the then-youngest person to win an\nOscar and thus one of the most famous American teenagers ever. She earned it\nplaying the blind-and-deaf American icon Helen Keller, first on stage and\nlater in the 1962 film, both of which told the story of how Keller learned to\ncommunicate as a child through her tutor Anne Sullivan (Anne Bancroft).But\nDuke really charmed her way into American pop culture in 1963, when she was\ngiven her own series, _The Patty Duke Show_, created especially for her. At\nthe time, no one knew, not even Duke, that she had bipolar disorder.But\nproducer Sidney Sheldon had noticed that she had two distinct sides to her\npersonality and the two came up with the idea of a show about \"identical\ncousins\" with contrasting personalities, and even different accents.The show,\nwhich ran from 1963 to 1966, was hard work: She played both characters,\nPatricia \"Patty\" Lane, a \"typical\" rock 'n roll American teenager who\noccasionally got into minor trouble at school and home, and Catherine \"Cathy\"\nLane, her more well-behaved cousin from Scotland who adores \"a minuet, The\nBallet Russes and crepe suzette.\"...

RIP Patty DukeBesides appearing on stage and\nscreen, Duke even had success as a singer, with two Top 40 hits in 1965,\n_Don't Just Stand There_ and _Say Something Funny_. She also wrote two books,\n_Call Me Anna_, and _Brilliant Madness: Living with Manic Depressive\nIllness_.And she served as president of the actors union, the Screen Actors\nGuild, from 1983 to 1988.She was married four times and had multiple affairs,\nwhich led to some confusion over the father of one of her three children,\n_Lord of the Rings_ actor Sean Astin (his biological dad turned out to be one\nof her lovers-turned-short-lived husbands).Duke's life and career were\ntumultuous, and not just because of her bipolar disorder or the fact she\nworked so much (her Internet Movie Database page shows she has a movie, _Power\nof the Air_, coming out in 2017), but because of her personal life.\"I think\nmaybe the most important part of her legacy is her acting work,\" said her son\nSean Astin, in an interview with the Associated Press. \"Above and beyond\nanything, the reason any of the other stuff is possible in terms of the scope\nof the impact that she was able to have with people was her talent and her\nwork and her work ethic, her discipline. She worked extremely hard.\"Astin said\nshe had dealt with a multitude of ailments over the years, including emphysema\nafter years of smoking. He said he was grateful to the rush of tributes for\nhis mother.\"It's just such an affirmation of the best part of her and such a\nrelief to be able to enjoy that as opposed to the pain that everyone was\nfeeling,\" Astin said. \"We're so grateful to her for living a life that\ngenerates that amount of compassion and feeling in others.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f0d"},"content":"WASHINGTON — Conservatives bent on crippling the power of public employee\nunions lost their best opportunity in years Tuesday when the Supreme Court\ndeadlocked over a challenge to the fees those unions collect from non-\nmembers.Rather than seeking to reschedule the case for their next term, the\njustices simply announced they were tied 4-4 — a verdict which leaves intact\nthe decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upholding the\nfee collections.That was a major victory for the unions and the court's four\nliberal justices following Justice Antonin Scalia's death last month. During\noral argument in January, it had appeared almost certain that the court would\nstrike down the requirement in 23 states that teachers and government workers\ncontribute to the cost of collective bargaining, even if they disagree with\ntheir unions' demands.The result would have been the demise of a nearly 40\n-year-old Supreme Court precedent that allows unions to impose such\nrequirements on non-members. It would have made it harder for unions\nrepresenting teachers, police and firefighters, and other government workers\nto maintain their power by affecting their pocketbooks.The judicial deadlock\nallows the California Teachers Association to keep collecting the fees, but it\ndoes not have nationwide impact. The 9th Circuit standard applies only to\nstates within its jurisdiction, including Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Montana,\nNevada, Oregon and Washington as well as California.The challengers in the\ncase immediately promised to file a petition asking for a rehearing when the\ncourt returns to full strength. But five votes are required to win that\neffort. The court also could accept a similar case in the future; the National\nRight to Work Foundation has five cases in lower courts now that seek to\nstrike down mandatory union dues and fees.“With the death of Justice Scalia,\nthis outcome was not unexpected,” Terry Pell, president of the Center for\nIndividual Rights, said. “We believe this case is too significant to let a\nsplit decision stand.”It was the second time in two weeks that the justices\nhad deadlocked in the wake of Scalia's death, but the first major case to\nemerge in a tie. And it's an indication that without Scalia, the justices may\nbe equally divided in several other cases before the term ends in\nJune.Although the court's one-sentence opinion did not break down the vote,\noral arguments on the hotly contested labor case made clear that the court's\nfour liberal and four conservative justices were on opposite sides.The\njustices could have rescheduled the case for when the court is back to full\nstrength. But that could take a year or more, because Senate Republicans have\nrefused to consider President Obama's nomination of federal appeals court\nJudge Merrick Garland to replace Scalia.The case, _Friedrichs v. California\nTeachers Association_, signified a major threat to public employee unions that\nrepresent nearly 36% of government workers — far more than the plummeting\naverage for unions overall. Only 11% of Americans belonged to unions in\n2014.Rebecca Friedrichs, who challenged the California Teachers Association's\ncollection of fees from non-members, speaks to the media after oral arguments\nat the Supreme Court in January (Photo: Mark Wilson, Getty Images)If the\njustices had ruled that the free speech rights of non-members entitled them to\ncontribute nothing to the costs of representation — they already can opt out\nof financing unions' political activities — more workers likely would have\nbecome \"free riders.\" That would have led to a drop in membership and\nrevenue.“The U.S. Supreme Court today rejected a political ploy to silence\npublic employees like teachers, school bus drivers, cafeteria workers, higher\neducation faculty and other educators,” said Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president\nof the National Education Association. “In _Friedrichs_, the court saw through\nthe political attacks on the workplace rights of teachers, educators and other\npublic employees. This decision recognizes that stripping public employees of\ntheir voices in the workplace is not what our country needs.”The\n325,000-member teachers union, which spends more on politics than any special\ninterest group in the state, warned in its high court brief that tens of\nthousands of contracts governing millions of workers nationally could be\nthrown \"into disarray.\" More than 4.5 million teachers are union members.The\nlawsuit was brought by the conservative Center for Individual Rights, which\nalong with the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation has sought to\noverturn a 1977 Supreme Court decision that allowed public employee unions to\ncollect \"fair share\" fees from non-members for the costs of collective\nbargaining.Pro-union protesters rally in front of the Supreme Court in\nJanuary, when the justices heard oral arguments in a case challenging public\nemployees union fees. (Photo: Mark Wilson, Getty Images)Rebecca Friedrichs, an\nelementary school teacher who was the lead plaintiff, had spent several years\nas a union officer and found its leadership unwilling to consider her\nsuggestions. She opposed tenure laws that make it harder to fire bad teachers,\nseniority rules that ignore merit — even salary increases that lead to larger\nclass sizes.The battle had divided the nation almost equally between states\nwhere laws govern collective bargaining for public workers and those where\nworkers can't be forced to join unions or contribute to them.Defenders of the\ncurrent system contended that so-called \"right to work\" laws, in states mostly\nled by Republicans, lead to inferior education and public services. Average\ntest scores are lower for students in those states on fourth- and eighth-grade\nmath and reading proficiency tests.A brief filed by 21 states led by Democrats\nsaid fair-share fees lead to improved government efficiency and labor peace,\nbecause states can negotiate with just one union and strikes are more easily\naverted.Moreover, a brief submitted on behalf of public safety unions said a\ndefeat \"risks setting in motion a union 'death spiral' — as membership drops,\nthe union will have to increase dues to cover its expenses, which will create\nfurther incentives for additional workers to quit the union.\"Demonstrators\noutside the Supreme Court in January, when the justices considered Rebecca\nFriedrichs' challenge to the California Teachers Association. (Photo: Mark\nWilson, Getty Images)The challengers didn't buy any of those arguments. Mark\nMix, president of the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, had\nsaid those who oppose their local unions but are forced to pay many hundreds\nof dollars annually to support them \"are not free riders. They're captive\npassengers.\"Michigan and 17 other Republican-led states told the court that\nall collective bargaining at the government level amounts to lobbying, with\ntaxpayers paying for the results. They blamed union contracts for municipal\nbankruptcies from Detroit to Stockton, Calif.The high court's 1977 ruling in_\nAbood v. Detroit Board of Education _upholding union payments by non-members\nwas unanimous, but the current court had moved away from it in two recent\ncases.In 2012, the justices ruled 7-2 that a California public employees union\ncould not impose an additional fee on workers without their assent. In 2014,\nthey ruled 5-4 that Medicaid-funded home-care workers in Illinois did not have\nto pay dues to public employees unions because they were not typical state\nworkers.While neither case overruled _Abood_, the trend appeared clear.\nJustice Samuel Alito wrote in 2014 for the court's conservative majority that\nexcept in rare circumstances, \"no person in this country may be compelled to\nsubsidize speech by a third party that he or she does not wish to support.\"In\nthe end, however, Alito needed Scalia's fifth vote, and the leader of the\ncourt's conservative bloc died before he could provide it.\n\n","title":"Public employee unions dodge a Supreme Court bullet","twitter":{"body":"Public employee unions dodge a bullet with Supreme Court tie https://t.co/8aVNmmiDVl by @richardjwolf (Getty photo) https://t.co/fBJq5pa0Ud","date":"Tue Mar 29 14:23:01 +0000 2016","favs":32,"id":{"$numberLong":"714820160050348032"},"retweets":40},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MPM4ic"}

There’s a crowd outside the theater when you arrive,\nthere are interminable lines for merchandise and the bar and the bathroom. It\ntakes upward of 10 minutes to physically exit the theater once the company has\ntaken their final bows.Much has been posited about why the show has become a\nphenomenon that draws these kinds of crowds eight times a week (and is\ncontinuing to do so for many months in the future — just try to buy tickets).\nThere’s the power behind a cast almost entirely of color playing very white\nhistorical figures. There are performances like that of Leslie Odom Jr., who\ncrafts an intricate, sympathetic and thoroughly understandable portrait of\nAaron Burr. There’s creator and star Lin-Manuel Miranda's music, complex raps\nmarried to traditional Broadway stylizations and repeated themes, with a\nlittle bit of Beyonce and British pop thrown in for added effect. And of\ncourse, there’s the story, told through music, of an impoverished immigrant\nwho went on to shape the very nature of this country.And you know what? The\nshow lived up to every ounce of praise for me. And then some.Few things in\nlife meet that level of hype. And of all things, here's a hip-hop Broadway\nmusical about Alexander Hamilton living up to its insane buildup. In an age\nwhen there are years-long marketing campaigns for the latest franchise movie,\nthere is something refreshingly earnest about a piece of entertainment that is\nexactly what you’ve been told it would be. _Hamilton_ isn’t selling out\ntheaters based on fan obsession with the man on the $10 bill. It’s being sold\non the pure joy that a friend or a critic or a random person on Twitter felt\nas they walked out of the theater. Even better, there is nothing coming next\nto alter this unique experience. There are no sequels. There is no _Hamilton_\nuniverse.When I told friends and family I had tickets, they offered\ncongratulations in awed tones one might expect if I had said I was meeting the\npresident or had won the lottery. I was one of the lucky ones, and not just\nbecause of ticket availability, but because the show is worth it. Even after\nthe 50th or so time I’d heard Lafayette (Daveed Diggs) rap _Guns and Ships_ at\nhome, the experience of seeing it live was better. As much as I thought I knew\nabout Hamilton and Burr, Miranda and Odom’s performances offered more. As good\nas I thought _Hamilton_ would be, it was better.Everything about seeing\n_Hamilton_ is crowded, it’s true. Everything except for the moment you take\nyour seat and the orchestra intones those first few notes. As soon as the cast\nhits the stage and begins to tell the story of a “bastard, orphan, son of a\nwhore,” it doesn’t matter that you’re squeezed into a tiny seat next to\nstrangers. No one else exists. “How lucky we are to be alive right now,” Eliza\nHamilton sings on more than one occasion during the show. How lucky, indeed.\n\n","title":"What it’s really like to see ‘Hamilton’ ","twitter":{"body":"RT @klawls: Hi, here's a thing I wrote about #Hamilton and why it is the perfect antidote to the movie universe world we live in https://t.…","date":"Tue Mar 29 13:08:56 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714801518302662656"},"retweets":22},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/21R55aZ"}

When they arrived, emergency personnel found\nrelatives performing CPR on a 43-year-old man and a 9-year-old girl, who\nauthorities identified as the man's daughter.According to police, a 911 caller\nsaid people were \"turning blue after jumping into the pool.\" Investigators\nbelieve the man jumped into the pool to try to save his daughter. Both\nsuffered electric shocks, which, according to a preliminary investigation, may\nhave been the result of faulty pool wiring, officials said.Police Sgt. William\nHutchinson said victims described a \"tingling feeling\" while in the pool and\nthat faulty wires may have been connected to a light.Hutchinson, however,\ncautioned that an investigation is ongoing and officials have not reached\nfinal conclusions as to what caused the water to become electrified.The man\ndied at a hospital Sunday.Late Monday, the Riverside County coroner’s office\nidentified the man as James Tramel, 43, of Burlingame, Calif.The 9-year-old\ngirl remained in critical condition Monday at another hospital, according to\npolice.No one answered the door at the victims' house Monday evening.A\nneighbor said the family lives in the San Francisco Bay area and visits the\nhouse, which has been in their family for generations, about twice a year.A\ntag on the electrical meter at a house in Palm Springs, Calif., identifies it\nas unsafe after swimmers received an electric shock in a pool Sunday, March\n27, 2016. (Photo: Rosalie Murphy, The (Palm Springs, Calif.)

The man originally wanted to land in either Turkey or\nCyprus, and after some negotiation, they agreed on Larnaca. The jet touched\ndown at 7:50 a.m.The man did not have a gun, but there was still a danger to\npassengers and crew because officials were unsure if the bomb was real or\nfake. Officials reached out to the families of the hostages to let them know\nwhat happened.“We don’t know yet how he got the equipment and whether it is\nreal or not. The reality is we are dealing with it as a real threat, because\nwe can’t take any risks,\" Egyptian Minister of Civil Aviation Sherif Fathy\ntold the news conference in Cairo while the incident was  underway.He said the\nhijacker  made no concrete demands.Reuters reported that Cypriot authorities\ndetermined that the hijacker's suicide belt was fake, citing the Egyptian\nCivil Aviation Ministry. Homer Mavrommatis from the Cypriot Foreign Ministry\nCrisis Center, told CNN the man was unstable.Cyprus' Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs named the suspected hijacker as Seif Eldin Mustafa. The Egyptian\ngovernment apologized to a man it earlier wrongly named as the hijacker, Al\nArabiya reported.Cypriot state media reported that the hijacker's ex-wife was\ntaken from Larnaca to the airport to talk with the man, who  told authorities\nto deliver a four-page letter to her or he would detonate explosives strapped\nto his body.The hijacker has four children with his ex-wife,  Marina\nParaschou, the Kathimerini newspaper reported. It said the hijacker was a\nveterinary professor at the University of Alexandria.Cypriot President Nicos\nAnastasiades told a news conference the incident \"has nothing to do with\nterrorism.\"A journalist asked if it was related to a woman to which\nAnastasiades replied, \"There's always a woman involved.\"Egypt's Ministry of\nCivil Aviation said on its website that the passengers included eight\nAmericans, four Dutch, two Belgians, four Britons, two people from Bali in\nIndonesia, and one passenger each from France, Syria and Italy.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f14"},"content":"A deal to raise California’s minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022 was reached\nMonday by Gov. Jerry Brown and state legislators, making the nation's largest\nstate the first to lift base earnings to that level and propelling a campaign\nto lift the pay floor nationally.The increase will boost the wages of about\n6.5 million California residents, or 43% of the state’s workforce, who earn\nless than $15, according to worker group Fight for $15. The proposal had been\nheaded to a statewide referendum. It's now expected to be approved by the\nstate assembly.“This plan raises the minimum wage in a careful and responsible\nway and provides some flexibility if economic and budgetary conditions\nchange,” Brown said. The governor can temporarily suspend the hikes in the\nevent of poor economic conditions or a large budget deficit.About a dozen\ncities have approved bumps in their minimum wages to $15, including Los\nAngeles, San Francisco, Seattle and several other municipalities in\nCalifornia.In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has proposed a $15 pay floor for New\nYork City starting in 2019 and across the state by 2021. A plan is already in\nplace to hike wages for fast-food and state government workers in both New\nYork City and the state.Increases to $15 in New York and California “clearly\nwould create national momentum for other states to follow their lead,”\nparticularly Democratic- leaning coastal states, said Paul Sonn, NELP’s\ngeneral counsel.Under California’s plan, its minimum wage, currently one of\nthe highest in the nation at $10 an hour, would rise to $10.50 in 2017, $11 in\n2018 and a dollar each year through 2022.The pact was also hailed by labor\nadvocates. “This is a very, very significant increase and for the first time\nwould begin to reverse years of falling pay at the bottom” of the income\nladder, Sonn saidThe California legislation follows a series of one-day\nstrikes by low-wage and other fast food workers demanding a $15 wage over the\npast 3½ years, protests funded by the Service Employees International Union.\nThe crusade was written off as quixotic when it began but NELP officials\ncredited it with prodding lawmakers as well as companies such as Facebook,\nGoogle and Nationwide Insurance to set $15 as base pay.A $15 wage has even\nbecome a centerpiece of the presidential campaign. The Democratic Party\nadopted a $15 minimum in its platform and Sen. Bernie Sanders supports it.\nHillary Clinton has said she backs a $12 pay floor.Proposals to increase the\nfederal minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to about $10 have been blocked by\nRepublicans in Congress. Republicans and other critics say the state-level\nincreases will force some businesses to replace workers with technology and\neven shut down in the face of rising costs._Contributing: Matt Krantz_\n\n","title":"California reaches deal on $15 minimum wage ","twitter":{"body":"Nation's largest state could be the first to raise minimum wage to $15 an hour: https://t.co/jEyBMwm0UU (Photo: AP) https://t.co/Ir5Ugno7VL","date":"Tue Mar 29 12:20:13 +0000 2016","favs":82,"id":{"$numberLong":"714789257693499392"},"retweets":63},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MNxRCm"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f16"},"content":"NEW YORK — I've never been more excited about my student loan debt.Five years\nafter graduating, I have roughly $13,000 and 31 months to go until I'm no\nlonger paying for my journalism degree, and I am pumped. This is,\nunderstandably, not a normal emotional response to thousands of dollars of\ndebt, so let me explain.I recently — as in Sunday night around 7:50 p.m. —\npaid the remaining $1,117 on one of my six student loans using part of my tax\nrefund. I felt elated. I wanted to scream, in a \"Hey, look what I did,\" way,\nnot an, \"I'm dying a slow death by Navient,\" way.One down, five to go. \"Boom,\"\nI thought, \"I've got this.\" The end is in sight. All because of tax season and\nobsessive financial planning.The unexpected upside of graduating with $25,000\nin student loan debt is the financial responsibility it forces on your life. I\nhave to take control of every dollar I spend and know exactly where it's\ngoing. I have to say no to dinners out with friends, Friday night drinks and\nother general fun a lot more often than I can say yes. I stare perplexed at\nthe photos from exotic vacations and Euro trips so many of my Facebook friends\nseem to take every year — or as is so much more common once you pass age 25,\nthe flood of shiny, diamond-clad fingers waving through my newsfeed —\nwondering how exactly these people have that kind of extra cash (or maybe it's\ntheir parents who do).Hadley Malcolm finds the bright side to student loan\ndebt. (Photo: USA TODAY)To be fair, I graduated with what is generally\nconsidered a manageable amount of student loan debt. It hasn't hindered my\nday-to-day life or relegated me to living off of Annie's Mac and Cheese.Still,\nmonth by month, as I've worked to pay off my four years of college, I've\nlearned to set specific goals and felt the thrill of achieving them (I paid\nanother loan off with my tax refund in 2014). I've learned to track my budget\nwith the same commitment and fervor required of purchasing Adele concert\ntickets or standing in line for a cronut. And I admit, I actually enjoy it.\nHaving control of your money, even when you have negative net worth, is oddly\nfreeing.Yes, my student loans have held me back — from saving, investing and\nhaving the freedom not to worry about overdrawing my checking account. But\nI've also gained an awareness of my financial life that will stick with me\nlong after my loans are done dragging me down, an appreciation of the power of\nliquidity and credit scores and emergency savings that will come in handy when\nI have far bigger goals in my sights than being able to go to the movies and\nsplurge on fake-buttered, overpriced popcorn. (Seriously, when did popcorn\nstart costing $1 a kernel?)This hyper-awareness of money has already bled into\nother aspects of my life. When the lease was up on my car earlier this year\nand I turned it back into the dealership — a decision I'd agonized over for\ndays, part of me not wanting to give up the convenience of having my own\nwheels,  and the other part thinking I was ridiculous for paying hundreds of\ndollars a month on something I used once a week to buy groceries — I couldn't\nwait to reallocate all the money I had been paying toward the car. I would\ndouble down on my student loan payments, increase my monthly savings auto\ndebit and let myself boost my restaurant budget.These are the little wins I\nlook forward to. They are small changes, and slow to come, but each one brings\nme closer to living debt-free.So I'm still trudging along, day by day,\nneurotically checking my LearnVest account and weighing whether to go out for\ncoffee this weekend. I know my diligence is worth it — as of today, my\nspreadsheet tells me I have six months to go until my next loan is paid\noff.**How to successfully be in debt:**•** Don't just set goals, visualize\nthem.** Thinking about wanting to do something is a lot different than seeing\nit happen. Use a budgeting app that lets you set specific financial goals or\ncustomize an Excel spreadsheet in order to see exactly how long it will take\nyou to reach your savings target or pay off a loan or credit card.

The question for many is whether\nAmazon will end up owning this vital market by the time it matures.**Like the\niPod**While Amazon and others tout the Echo’s abilities in the connected home\nrealm, the lure for many seems to be an easy-to-use way to play music,\nincluding everything in Amazon Prime's music catalog.“If you’re buying an\nEcho, that becomes your in-home speaker,” said Rob Enderle of the Enderle\nGroup in Bend, Ore..He's getting deja vu from 2001, when the iPod was first\nreleased. The pocket-sized digital music player helped usher in a new and\nalmost unrecognizable computer scene where everyone carries a computer (i.e. a\nsmartphone) in their pocket, driving up Apple sales, profits and share price.\nApple is now the world's most valuable tech company.“When Apple came out with\nthe iPod, suddenly all the FM radios and the CD players went away. All the\niPod did was play music. But eventually it led Apple to the iPhone and then it\nkicked all the phones off the market. It was amazingly viral,” he said.It's\nalready starting to happen with the Echo.Sonos, the maker of the popular WiFi\nspeakers, surprised many in the tech industry when it laid off employees\nearlier this year and at the same time said it would shift focus to paid\nstreaming and voice-activated speakers, noting big advances in voice\nrecognition from Alexa and apps like Siri, Cortana and Google Now.\"Alexa/Echo\nis the first product to really showcase the power of voice control in the\nhome. Its popularity with consumers will accelerate innovation across the\nentire industry,\" said Sonos CEO John MacFarlane in a blog post announcing the\nchanges. \"Voice is a big change for us, so we’ll invest what’s required to\nbring it to market in a wonderful way.\"Sonos spokeswoman Errin Cecil-Smith\nsaid the success of Echo and layoffs at Sonos \"are not directly correlated.\"\nShe declined to provide further comment on the layoffs.**Others mulling**The\nrest of the tech world seems to be taking note. According to a report in tech-\nindustry news site _The Information_, Alphabet is looking into creating a\nvoice-enabled device along the lines of the Echo, leap-frogging off its \"OK,\nGoogle\" voice recognition software. Google-parent Alphabet didn't comment on\nthe report.There’s also a lot of enthusiasm from people who want to create\nEcho-friendly devices, said analyst Charles King with tech analysis firm Pund-\nIT in Hayward, Calif. “At the Consumer Electronics Show, there was tremendous\ninterest among the big commercial developers.\"Already Fitbit, Uber, NBC News,\nDomino’s and financial services firm Capital One, among others, have\nintegrated their services with Alexa.“I think the Echo could be the\ntransformative device so far as what people have generally called the smart\nhome. This is a market that’s been around for ten years but Amazon has now\ndone the heavy lifting that will allow other companies to get into the\nconnected home market with minimum investment,” he said.**Selling well**Amazon\ndoesn't disclose sales figures on the device, but according to Forrester\nanalyst Sucharita Mulpuru, \"we know they've sold over 10,000 and the reviews\nare overwhelmingly positive. That suggests it's indeed a sleeper hit,\" though\nnot yet a blockbuster, she said.Reading the tea leaves, the frequent\nbackorders for customers looking to buy an Echo make it a good bet that sales\nare brisk, said Enderle.\"If they can’t keep up with sales, on a product that\ndoesn’t have any hard-to-source materials, that suggests that demand is\nexceeding their most aggressive forecasts,\" he said.**Skills = Apps**One of\nthe real powers of Echo is that it’s a semi-open system. Amazon allows\ndevelopers to build what it calls “skills” for the Echo, effectively apps that\nare folded into its functionality. They have to be vetted by the company but\nso far over 400 third-party skills have been added, says Amazon spokeswoman\nBrittany Turner.All agree that this type of non-phone-based digital assistant\nis going to take off, though exactly who will end up winning market share is\nthe big unknown.“A company like Samsung could get involved, or even Apple.\nWe’re in really early days with this,” said Pund-IT's King.Amazon clearly has\nboth the software and hardware chops to make it happen, even though not all\nits previous hardware attempts have been successful. The Amazon Fire Phone,\nlaunch with much fanfare in 2014 and quietly discontinued in 2015, was “a\nnotable disaster,” said King.For now, the Echo has the first-mover advantage.\n“From what I’ve seen so far, Amazon’s is among the most promising technologies\nin this space that I can remember ever having seen,” he said._Contributing:\nJefferson Graham from Los Angeles.__Follow Elizabeth Weise on Twitter @eweise_\n\n","title":"Amazon Echo turns into a sleeper hit, offsetting Fire's failure","twitter":{"body":"Amazon Echo is on fire.

Responding to Obama's suggestion that his visit should allow both\ncountries to \"leave the past behind,\" Castro bristled, citing the failed Bay\nof Pigs invasion and the five-decade-old economic embargo as realities that\ncan never be forgotten.\"I suppose all of us were at risk of a heart attack\nupon hearing these words from the President of the United States,\" Castro\nwrote in Cuba's state-controlled newspaper, _Granma_. \"Nobody should be under\nthe illusion that the people of this dignified and selfless country will\nrenounce the glory, the rights or the spiritual wealth they have gained with\nthe development of education, science and culture.\"Obama's historic trip to\nCuba, the first by a U.S. president in nearly 90 years, was designed to\nsolidify the recently re-established political relationship between the Cold\nWar foes. During the trip, Cuban President Raúl Castro met several times with\nObama, conducted a joint press conference hailing the new relationship and\nseemed at ease and jovial with the U.S. president as they sat and watched a\nbaseball game together.Many have wondered how Fidel Castro has been reacting\nto the rapid changes that have taken place in Cuba since he stepped down due\nto an illness in 2008. His brother, Raúl, has since changed many aspects of\nCuba's communist system, allowing people to own, buy and sell their homes for\nthe first time, allowing half-a-million state workers to become private\nentrepreneurs, and ultimately shocking everyone by beginning the process of\nnormalizing relations with the U.S.The revolutionary leader didn't mince words\non the final point, mockingly referring to Obama as \"our illustrious guest\"\nbefore dissecting and criticizing various aspects of his speech to the Cuban\npeople.Castro quoted a section of Obama's address where he discussed the\nshared history of Cuba and the U.S. — both colonized by Europeans who depended\non slaves brought there from Africa. Obama was trying to make the point that\npeople in both countries are descended from slaves and slave-owners, but\nCastro focused on another population.\"The native populations don't exist at\nall in Obama's mind,\" Castro wrote.Obama also mentioned several challenges\nfacing the U.S., including \"racial bias\" in communities around the country and\nwithin the criminal justice system. Castro ignored that section, instead\nblasting Obama for failing to recognize the advances in race relations Castro\nand his government feel they've carried out.Castro wrote that Obama did not\n\"say that the Revolution swept away racial discrimination, or that pensions\nand salaries for all Cubans were decreed ... before Mr. Barack Obama was 10\nyears old.\"Frank Mora, the director of the Latin America and Caribbean Center\nat Florida International University in Miami, summed up his reaction to\nCastro's letter in two words: \"Who cares?\"Mora said the elder Castro is\n\"literally in the history books\" and that his influence over Cuban politics\nhas long since passed. He said Raúl Castro can't stop his older brother from\narguing on the changes taking place, but is clearly moving on despite Fidel's\nobjections.\"(The letter) made him look pretty insignificant as to where this\nrelationship is heading,\" Mora said. \"He represents a different era, a\ndifferent stage in the history of the relationship.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f1c"},"content":"_This column is the first of a __two-part__ series addressing the financial\nsupport of adult children._I write to you not from a place of judgment, but\ninstead I address you based on an immense body of work that has brought me\ngreat clarity. The financial support you are offering your adult children is\ntoxic. You are hurting them, you are hurting yourself, and until you realize\nit’s not money that they need, everyone involved will feel the pain.Think back\nto when you taught your child to ride her bicycle without training wheels. Who\nwas more scared? The idea of letting go of a toddler rocketing across concrete\nwith little protection is terrifying. If you let go, she will fall — she will\nbleed. If you don’t, she will never learn to ride the most elementary\ntransportation device since the invention of feet. Once you let go, and she\nfalls and bleeds, she will quickly learn that balance and control equal the\nabsence of pain. At that moment, everyone moves on with their life.Assuming\nyour now twenty- or thirty-something can ride their bike without training\nwheels, what was the primary element in their initial bike-riding achievement?\nIt was your willingness to remove yourself from the situation, with the\ndisturbing knowledge your absence would result in pain.If you are still\nsupporting your adult child, your absence will lead to their success — not\nyour financial support. You have to remove yourself from the situation.Peter\nDunn, aka Pete the Planner, writes a weekly financial-planning column for The\nIndianapolis Star and Fox59. (Photo: Provided)As you look at your adult\nchild’s life, what is missing? Your child lacks skills on budgeting,\nresourcefulness and, potentially, restraint.To be fair, if your child’s\nproblems stem from student loans, then their lack of independence actually\nmakes sense. However, you must be willing to acknowledge the amount of debt\nour children hold is directly correlated to our willingness and ability to\npre-fund those college expenses, as well as our willingness to encourage our\nchildren to blindly accumulate hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt, with\nabsolutely no plan to pay it off.There’s a giant chasm that exists between not\nbeing able to pre-fund an education and encouraging your children to pursue\nwhat their 18-year-old minds think is an ideal education. That gap can be\nbridged with uncomfortable conversations and restraint. Ignoring the chasm\nwill result in everyone involved falling in.In most cases that I’ve seen of\nparents supporting adult children, the child isn’t allowed to fail because the\nparent either doesn’t want their child to experience temporary discomfort or\nthe parent doesn’t want to admit that they, as parents, have failed. Regular\npayments start to feel like penance. When your child lacks the skills to limit\ntheir expenses based on their income, that’s as much your failure as it is\ntheirs. Guilt sets in. Checks are written. Nothing is solved.I don’t want my\nchildren to fail, but I look forward to their failures. They build character,\nresourcefulness and guile. It’s only when I try and mask their failures that\ntheir failures become my failure.The entire discussion around cutting off an\nadult child can certainly ring of callousness. But your continued support of\nyour adult children will ruin your financial life, and it will ruin their\nfinancial life. There are no winners. You believe you are sacrificing for\nanother, but you aren’t. You are the captain of a sinking ship.One of the\nprimary arguments used to justify this dangerous financial decision is the\nargument of relativity. You decide to help someone financially because you’re\nin a relatively better financial situation than they are. It’s a lose-lose\nsituation. You make them more dependent on you as you head toward retirement.\nThat math doesn’t work.I’d be remiss to not acknowledge scenarios in which\nfinancial support is not only warranted, but necessary. Yet, these situations\nare the exceptions, not the rule.The way out of your conundrum will be messier\nthan you want. If you can’t articulate to your child why your support is a\nproblem, then that’s where you begin, by better understanding the impact of\nyour entangled financial relationship. If your retirement plan is underfunded,\nyou will work deep into your 70s so that your adult child can avoid\nunderstanding how money works.Remember, your support of them isn’t about the\nsacrifice of your money. It’s much the opposite. This is about sacrificing\nyour feelings and letting failure be the teacher._Peter Dunn is an author,\nspeaker and radio host.

There are many factors to weigh when\ndeciding which degree program is the right fit for you and your professional\ngoals. After all, college is an investment. And like any investment, it’s\nimportant to have a good idea of what you stand to gain before taking the\nplunge.With that in mind, OnlineDegrees.com launched an investigation to find\nwhich majors offered students the best potential return on their educational\ninvestment.

Some\nmajors offered great growth rates and low tuition, but lost points because\nthey’re only available at a select number of schools, making them harder for\nthe average student to obtain.It’s no surprise that tech and business majors\ncontinue to dominant top positions.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f1f"},"content":"The depletion of old oil wells is expected to surpass new sources of supply in\n2016, as the ongoing oil price slump puts a long list of oil projects on the\nshelf.Bloomberg flagged new data from the Norwegian consultancy firm Rystad\nEnergy, which predicts that legacy production will tip the supply balance into\nthe negative in 2016 for the first time in years.The production from an\naverage conventional oil field typically ramps up in the early years, plateaus\nand then enters a period of decline. Depletion rates vary wildly from field to\nfield, but a rule of thumb for conventional oil fields – which make up the\nbulk of total global supply – is that they decline something like 6 percent\nper year on average. Again, those depletion rates can differ depending on\nlocation, levels of investment, etc., but one thing that is clear is that the\noil industry needs to bring new oil fields online every year in order to\nmerely keep production flat.Rystad Energy estimates that the crash in oil\nprices has cut into upstream investment so severely that natural depletion\nrates will overwhelm the paltry new sources of supply in 2016. Existing fields\nwill lose about 3.3 million barrels per day (mb/d) in production this year,\nwhile new fields brought online will only add 3 mb/d. This does not take into\naccount rising oil demand, which will soak up most of the excess supply by the\nend of the year.But the 3 mb/d of new supply in 2016 will mostly come from\nlarge offshore projects that were planned years ago, investments that were\nmade before oil prices started crashing. The EIA sees four offshore projects\nstarting up in 2016 – projects from Shell, Noble Energy, Anadarko, and\nFreeport McMoran – plus two more in 2017. The industry completed eight\nprojects in the Gulf in 2015. U.S. Gulf of Mexico production will climb from\n1.63 mb/d in 2016 to 1.91 mb/d by the end of 2017.However, outside of these\nlarge-scale multiyear offshore projects, the queue of new oil fields is\nstarting to be cleared out. By 2017, the supply/depletion balance will go\ndeeper into negative territory. Depletion will exceed new sources of\nproduction by around 1.2 mb/d before widening even further in 2018 and 2019.A\nfew months ago, Wood Mackenzie estimated that around $380 billion in planned\noil projects had been put on ice due to the crash in oil prices. Wood\nMackenzie says that between 2007 and 2013, the oil industry greenlighted about\n40 large oil projects on average each year. That figure plunged to fewer than\n10 in 2015.The coming supply crunch stands in sharp contrast to the short-term\npicture. The EIA reported on March 23 that crude oil storage levels once again\nincreased, surging by 9.4 million barrels last week to break yet another\nrecord. Total inventories in the U.S. now stand at 532.5 million barrels.\nRecord high storage levels, which continue to climb, are signs of short-term\noversupply. The IEA expects supply to continue to outstrip demand by about 1.5\nmb/d until later this year. Oil storage levels will have to fall to more\nnormal levels before oil prices can rise substantially.But the Rystad Energy\nfigures show that the supply-demand balance could quickly swing back in the\nother direction as upstream investment has screeched to a halt. As soon as\nlater this year, or perhaps in 2017, demand could catch up to supply.\nInventories will begin falling quickly and prices will start to rise. However,\nsince supply is inelastic in the short run, the industry may struggle to\nsatisfy demand at stable prices.

DOJ will withdraw its motionto force Apple to break into a terrorist's iPhone after FBI investigators were able to crack the phone’s security function without erasing the contents. Police found the phone in the vehicle of Syed Farook and wife Tashfeen Malik, the San Bernardino, Calif., couple who killed 14 people in December. A fierce legal debate ignited when Apple refused to create a \"back door\" so the FBI could access the phone — and it was all we heard about for weeks, even though hardware security experts said there were at least three ways to break into the phone.Tashfeen Malik, left, and Syed Farook are seen in this 2014 photo. (Photo: AP)**Shots fired at the U.S. Capitol**A suspect is in custody after shots were fired at the Capitol Visitor Center, gateway to the U.S. Capitol, on Monday.

We know the news may leave some feeling jittery, given that it's the height of tourist season in the nation's capital. But officials said that it appeared to be an isolated incident.**Georgia governor flip-flops in the name of not discriminating**You could say it was a flip-flop on an issue, but the flip-flop won support from Hollywood, the NFL and the business community. Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed a bill Monday that would have allowed people and businesses to deny services to gay people based on religious belief. \"I do not think that we have to discriminate against anyone to protect the faith-based community in Georgia,\" the Republican governor said. But he previously said positive things about the legislation. Did threats of boycotts from major studios and the NFL have anything to do with the governor's change of heart? Deal didn't say.**Work hard for the money**Looking for a job is a full-time job. And when you do it for a while and nothing happens, it's easy to get discouraged and give up. That happened to a lot of American workers after 2008, when the recession hit and it became really hard to find work. Some people retired, some went on disability, and some didn't know what to do, so they went back to school. Now the labor market is improving, and many Americans who were hanging on the sidelines are streaming back into the workforce. Employers are raising wages and becoming less selective in the hiring process.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f22"},"content":"SAN FRANCISCO — On Monday the FBI announced it was withdrawing its legal\nattempt to force Apple to aid it in unlocking the iPhone that had been used by\nSan Bernardino terrorist Syed Rizwan Farook. The agency said it had found\nanother way to get at the phone's data.The immediate question for many users\nis: Are iPhones now hackable? The immediate answer is: We don't know.The FBI\nhas not shared what methods it was using to attempt to get into the phone,\nwhat method finally worked or even the name of the \"outside party\" that came\nforward with the method last week. It's only disclosed what method it didn't\nuse: it didn't try making a digital copy of the iPhone's chips, FBI Director\nJames Comey said last week. Apple had no comment for this story.Without the\nFBI's information, it's impossible to know what the security vulnerability the\nagency found is, said Jonathan Ździarski, an iOS forensic expert and author of\na book on how to both hack and secure Apple devices.Given that, it's difficult\nto assess the potential security issues for other iPhones.“If a software\nmethod was used (as have been successfully over the years), then all bets are\noff,” Ździarski said via email.If the FBI was using physical methods to slice\nopen and read the contents of the chip containing the phone's encryption key\n—a highly expensive, time-consuming and potentially destructive method — it's\nunlikely the world's phones are suddenly any more vulnerable than they\nwere.It's also possible that the phone Farook used, an iPhone 5C, is more\neasily broken into than the iPhone 6 series, which is overall more\nsophisticated and more secure.**Mechanism to disclose **While the FBI is under\nno obligation to disclose how it got into the phone, there is a framework\nunder which it could do so, said Andrew Crocker, a staff lawyer with the\nElectronic Frontier Foundation, a San Francisco-based digital liberties\ngroup.The U.S. government has a stated policy of disclosing computer security\nvulnerabilities that it has discovered or that have been made known to it, in\nmost cases, he said.Called the Vulnerabilities Equities Process, it requires\nlaw enforcement and intelligence agencies to weigh the positives and negatives\nof such disclosures. The inter-agency group was established under the\ndirection of the Director of National Intelligence.“The government has said\nthat in the vast majority of cases it will disclose security vulnerabilities,\nthough in a small handful it doesn't,” said Crocker, who spent the last year\nand a half litigating to gain access to documents explaining the policy.“It\nwould be good for everyone’s security if they disclosed, but they probably\nwon’t,” he said.Joseph Lorenzo Hall, with the Center for Democracy and\nTechnology, a digital rights organization, said he thinks Apple will \"find and\nfix the relevant bug.\"This entire process will increase scrutiny on the\nprocess of how government agencies disclose computer security vulnerabilities,\nhe believes. \"When should the FBI be obligated to inform Apple of the details\nof this bug?\" he said.**Users have the power**Apple will likely beef up the\nsecurity of its devices based on speculation about all of the different\nmethods, said Ździarski, though that won't necessarily solve the problem if\nthe company doesn't know what it's protecting against.Users do have the\nability to make themselves less hackable, however, though it means memorizing\na longer passcode.\"I cannot stress how important it is that those looking to\nprotect their privacy use a complex, alphanumeric passcode as opposed to a\nsimple numeric pin\" on their phones, he said.A passcode to unlock an iPhone\nthat uses a string of letters and numbers is much harder to break than a\nsimple four- or six-digit code, he said.Information on how to lock a phone\nwith a passcode longer than six digits is available on Apple's website.\n\n","title":"Does the FBI's move mean iPhones are hackable?","twitter":{"body":"RT @ndiblasio: Does the FBI's move mean iPhones are hackable?

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f23"},"content":"SAN FRANCISCO — Although the government officially withdrew from its battle\nagainst Apple Monday, many observers sense the tech privacy war is just\ngetting started.\"This lawsuit may be over, but the Constitutional and privacy\nquestions it raised are not,\" Congressman Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), who had\ncriticized the Justice Department's legal effort against Apple, said in a\nstatement Monday.The Justice Department withdrew its legal action against\nApple after a method brought to the FBI earlier this month by an unidentified\nentity allowed investigators to crack the security function without erasing\ncontents of the iPhone used by Syed Farook, who with his wife, Tashfeen Malik,\ncarried out the December mass shooting in San Bernardino that left 14 dead.The\ngovernment maintained it was looking for access to one phone, but Apple\ncountered that asking for a code that could access the iPhone 5c would create\na backdoor to all such devices that was exploitable by other entities.\"This\ncase should never have been brought,\" Apple said in a statement released late\nMonday. \"We will continue to help law enforcement with their investigations,\nas we have done all along, and we will continue to increase the security of\nour products as the threats and attacks on our data become more frequent and\nmore sophisticated. ... This case raised issues which deserve a national\nconversation about our civil liberties, and our collective security and\nprivacy.\"In its two-page filing in a California magistrate's court, the\ngovernment noted that due to outside assistance it \"no longer requires the\nassistance from Apple Inc.\" Justice spokeswoman Melanie Newman said the FBI is\nreviewing the contents of the phone as \"consistent with standard investigatory\nprocedures,\" and that \"we will continue to pursue all available options for\nthis mission, including seeking the cooperation of manufacturers and relying\nupon the creativity of both the public and private sectors.\"Government law\nenforcement officials have denied charges the FBI wanted to establish a\nbackdoor to Apple's encryption, and swatted away accusations that they were\nusing the case to gain broader access to consumers' devices.\"The San\nBernardino case was not about trying to send a message or set a precedent; it\nwas and is about fully investigating a terrorist attack,'' FBI Director James\nComey wrote in an editorial last week.The FBI has about a dozen similar cases\npending in which it wants access to smartphone information to assist with a\ncase. So while this particular showdown may be over, \"there are other cases\npending where law enforcement relies on the All Writs Act\" to access tech\ngadget data, referring to an old law that can compel companies to help the\ngovernment in pursuit of its duties, says Denelle Dixon-Thayer, Chief Legal\nand Business Officer at Mozilla, the company behind the Firefox browser.\"This\nquestion is clearly not going away just because the government has withdrawn\ntheir request in this particular case,\" she says.Mozilla and dozens of other\ntech companies that supported Apple with amicus briefs will be watching what\nhappens next carefully.Privacy issues have both societal and financial\nimplications. Given the ubiquity of smartphones and tablets, concerns loom\nabout how rogue regimes could leverage back doors into tech products to go\nafter detractors. Companies like Apple, whose brand identity is anchored to\ndata security, could face declining sales if smartphones and tablets prove\nhackable.All that is counterbalanced by the need for public security in an age\nwhen terrorists use encrypted smartphone communication to secretly plot\ndevastating attacks such as the recent suicide missions in Brussels and\nParis.Justice officials declined to comment on whether the technique used to\nunlock the phone would be applied to other encrypted devices. Authorities also\nrefused comment on whether the method would be shared with Apple.Tashfeen\nMalik, left, and Syed Farook are seen in this 2014 photo. (Photo: AP)Apple\nofficials said on a call with reporters last week that if the iPhone in\nquestion was accessed, the company would want to know how so it can improve\nits encryption techniques. Declining to turn over such details to Apple\nengineers would \"leave ordinary users at risk from malicious third-parties who\nalso may use the vulnerability,\" says Andrew Crocker, staff attorney for the\nElectronic Frontier Foundation.Monday's action concludes six weeks of building\ntensions between the government and the the Silicon Valley i-product giant.\nThe FBI insisted for weeks that only Apple could crack the contents of\nFarook's iPhone. Apple said such an action amounted to a digital \"backdoor\"\nthat could eventually undermine the privacy of consumers — an unwavering\nstance supported by Google, Facebook, Microsoft and other tech giants.The foes\nwere poised to face off in a court room in Riverside, Calif., last week before\nthe Justice Department abruptly asked for — and was granted — a\npostponement.Apple CEO Tim Cook has crusaded in a highly coordinated public\ncampaign against the dangers of weakened security in digital devices. This\nmonth, Apple said the “Founding Fathers would be appalled” because the\ngovernment’s order to unlock the iPhone was based on what it said was non-\nexistent authority asserted by the DOJ.California U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker\nsaid federal authorities had pursued the litigation to “fulfill a solemn\ncommitment to the victims of the San Bernardino shooting — that we will not\nrest until we have fully pursued every investigative lead related to the\nvicious attack.’’Alex Abdo, staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties\nUnion, called the government’s “unprecedented power-grab” a threat to\neveryone’s security and privacy.“Unfortunately, (Monday's) news appears to be\njust a delay of an inevitable fight over whether the FBI can force Apple to\nundermine the security of its own products,” Abdo said in a statement late\nMonday. “We would all be more secure if the government ended this reckless\neffort.”_Marco della Cava and Jon Swartz reported from San Francisco, Johnson\nfrom Washington, D.C._\n\n","title":"FBI hacks into terrorist’s iPhone without Apple","twitter":{"body":"RT @marcodellacava: Breaking: Apple appears to have won its battle with FBI. https://t.co/VRA2GSA8Xz","date":"Mon Mar 28 23:40:48 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714598141526413312"},"retweets":41},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/03/28/apple-justice-department-farook/82354040/"}

Michael Pearson,\nwhose planned departure from the slumping company was announced last week, is\namong several witnesses scheduled for the April 27th hearing, the committee\nsaid Monday.The session is the panel's third public hearing on the impact that\ndrug price increases have had on patients, health insurers and medical\nprofessionals.\"Valeant has been cooperating with the committee's investigation\nand Mr. Pearson looks forward to testifying at the hearing,\" said company\nspokeswoman Laurie Little.Pearson had been credited for leading Valeant's\nrapid expansion in recent years through acquisition of other pharmaceutical\nfirms and their medications. But his tenure has been marred by questions about\nsteep price hikes in dermatology drugs and other medications the Canada-based\ncompany acquired as part of its expansion.A February memo issued by a House\noversight committee conducting a separate Valeant review showed the company\nraised the respective prices on heart medications Isuprel and Nitropress by\n525% and 212% immediately after acquiring them in February 2015.Valeant and\nPearson have also drawn questions and criticism about the company's since-\ncancelled business dealings with Philidor Rx Services, a specialty mail-order\npharmacy that distributed some of Valeant's medications to patients.The\ndrugmaker cut ties with Philidor in October after report by activist short-\nseller Andrew Left's Citron Research accused Valeant of creating a \"network of\nphantom captive pharmacies\" to steer pharmacy benefit managers to Valeant’s\nmore expensive drugs, instead of less-costly alternatives.Valeant denied the\nallegations, but named a special board committee to investigate the Philidor\nrelationship. The company subsequently said it would restate $58 million in\nfinancial earnings from late 2014 into 2015 based on preliminary results of\nthe review.The continuing internal examination review prevented Valeant from\nfiling its annual report before a March 15 deadline, which raised the risk of\npotential default on its bonds.The drugmaker is also under separate\ninvestigations by federal prosecutors in New York and Massachusetts and the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f2b"},"content":"Maybe it’s wishful thinking, but a former college basketball star thinks\nchange could be coming to the top of the women’s game.Chiney Ogwumike, the\n2014 No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft out of Stanford, says she senses a shift if\nConnecticut, as widely expected, wins its fourth consecutive national title\nnext week in Indianapolis. The Huskies take a 72-game winning streak into\nMonday’s Bridgeport (Conn.) Regional final against second-seeded Texas (7\np.m., ET, ESPN).“I think the landscape of women’s basketball is changing in\nthe respect that players want to develop themselves, develop their own brand\nand create their own story,” Ogwumike said. “I don’t know if I’m crazy, but I\nfeel like the younger generation, they are making decisions for themselves\nthat are different. I just feel like the top players are staying home, top\nplayers are going to different schools.“UConn would get the top five or six of\nthe top five or six. Now those top five or six, they want to do their own\nthing on their own terms. UConn will still get amazing talent, but the talent\nis definitely going to disperse.”According to ESPN’s HoopGurlz recruiting\nrankings for 2015, seven of the top 15 players committed to in-state schools\nor to a school in the same region. In the 2016 class, nine of the top 15\nplayers stayed close to home, including the Nos. 1 and 2 players who were from\nTexas — five-star recruits Lauren Cox chose Baylor and Joyner Holmes picked\nTexas. Though there haven’t been many commitments from the 2017 class yet, at\nleast three top-20 prospects aren’t leaving home, either.Jewell Loyd, the\nformer Notre Dame star who was selected first overall by the Seattle Storm in\nthe 2015 WNBA draft, can relate to this. She was also recruited by UConn, but\ncoming from Chicago, she chose the Fighting Irish because she wanted to stay\nclose to family.“I wanted my own destiny, my own story,” said Loyd, currently\nplaying overseas for Galatasaray M.P. Istanbul in Turkey. “I’ll never forget\nwhen I was going through the (recruiting) process, Geno wrote me a handwritten\nletter saying how he was excited to coach against me and he wished me the best\nof luck. … It was hard saying no to him because not a lot of players say no to\nhim. Or get the opportunity to talk to him.”But this style of creating your\nown way is becoming more of a trend.“I think at the grassroots level, kids\nhave more access of how to develop their skills and stay dedicated to\nimproving themselves in a way that’s different,” Ogwumike said.“You have\ntechnology now that can help you figure out how to improve your shot. You\ndon’t need to go to a certain place to get that kind of instruction. You can\ngo to YouTube, watch on Instagram and try to mimic things.”The women’s\ntournament so far has seen some significant upsets. South Carolina and Notre\nDame, both No. 1 seeds, were upset on Friday. Big Ten champ Maryland, a No. 2\nseed and Final Four team last year, lost to No. 7 Washington in the second\nround. Washington then beat No. 3 Kentucky.UConn didn’t always dominate.\nOgwumike, heavily recruited by UConn, traces the Huskies’ monopoly on talent\nreally since winning their first national championship in 1995. As the program\nwas rising to power, Tennessee, who won eight titles under Pat Summitt, was at\nthe peak of its reign. But Tennessee won its last championship in 2008 and\nhasn’t won one since. No program has filled that void.That said, until there’s\nan obvious change — more teams winning championships, UConn not beating\nopponents by margins of 20 points or more — the goal will be to figure out a\nway to overthrow this team.And to set the record straight, though the Huskies\nare often told they’re killing the game, their opponents feel the opposite.“I\nknew every time we played them I was going to learn a lot. I loved playing\nUConn,” Loyd said. “I always knew the games would be really competitive and it\nwould bring out another side of me that I loved being, I loved feeling. I mean\nwe had some great games, overtime games and just back and forth. There were\nalso games we lost by 20.“Against UConn, for a couple of minutes you can feel\nlike you’re in there. And then by the last five they take off and it’s kinda\nlike what the heck just happened? But I loved playing UConn. It brought out\nthe best games for everyone who played in them.”\n\n","title":"Will there finally be parity in women’s basketball after this UConn run? | For The Win","twitter":{"body":"Will there finally be parity after this UConn run? https://t.co/O6p6hZkw4I","date":"Mon Mar 28 18:46:34 +0000 2016","favs":17,"id":{"$numberLong":"714524097972031488"},"retweets":7},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1RBwWta"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f2f"},"content":"LOS ANGELES — A year ago, live video streaming to a smartphone app was mostly\ntalk.But today, as Twitter's live video streaming app Periscope celebrates its\nfirst birthday, the company announced a big milestone — some 200 million live\nbroadcasts have been streamed to date.That’s up from 100 million in January,\n“So we’re seeing extraordinary growth in a short period of time,” says\nPeriscope co-founder Kayvon Beykpour.The company says there are now so many\nlive streams, they equate to 110 years of live video being watched every day\non the app, which is available for Apple and Android devices.A year ago, the\nSouth by Southwest conference had just ended, and live video via the Meerkat\napp was the talk of the show. Then Periscope popped out of the gate and stole\nthe thunder, with its ease of use and ability to stream video directly to\nTwitter feeds. (Meerkat has since announced it was switching its focus.)By the\nend of 2015, Apple had named Periscope \"App of the Year,\" and Facebook jumped\nloudly into live video streaming as well. Now Facebook users can record live\ndirectly into News Feeds.And just last week came word that Google may be\nlooking to start a new live video streaming app for YouTube, YouTube\nConnect.Beykpour isn't worried about the competition.“Live streaming has been\naround for ages,” he says. “We weren’t the first.” Justin.tv, Hang w/,\nUstream, YouNow and many others predate Periscope. “We don’t pay much\nattention to what other people are doing; we’re just focused on making the\nbest mobile experience. That more people are getting involved is great, it\nshows people are taking a broad view of the space.”Fans took to Periscope as\nthe easiest form of video making. There's no big production skills — just hold\nup the smartphone to your face and show what you see, and when you're done,\npress stop. There's no fancy video editing or transfer process needed. Along\nthe way, get massive feedback from folks all over the world, who respond with\nanimated hearts and questions.Periscope took off thanks to a “confluence” of\nevents — better network, software and ubiquity of smartphones able to pull in\nhigh-speed connections, says Beykpour. “Live video used to mean a 30- to\n60-second delay. You could get it done with a video camera tapped   to a big\nbackpack and a laptop, but that wasn’t for the consumer.”Peter Csathy — CEO of\nManatt Digital Media, which invests in and consults with tech start-ups — says\nconsumers responded, thanks to apps like Periscope and Facebook pushing the\ncause.“It’s easy, they tried it and now they understand the power of it,” he\nsays.Beykpour says “being able to see what’s happening in real time anywhere\nin the world is a super power. You can see a map of the world, zoom into a\nneighborhood, and go someplace with a breaking news event and step into the\nshoes of someone there and talk to them — that’s crazy.”While Periscope’s\nnumbers are booming, Csathy says it has a big monkey on its back — ”Facebook\nis a monster,” he says. “Facebook is now very focused on live video, and that\nwill make it much more challenging.”Periscope needs to become a regular part\nof people’s daily lives, like Facebook is, says Csathy. “That’s a huge\nundertaking.”And with Google reportedly entering the live video space, based\non the 1 billion monthly users for the world’s most popular video site, Google\nis primed to take a major chunk of the audience as well, Csathy says.\n\n","title":"200M broadcasts in 1 year for Periscope ","twitter":{"body":"Happy 1st birthday, @periscopeco! 200 million broadcasts and counting: https://t.co/ij0F25N2Sy https://t.co/WBuyHU7OiH","date":"Mon Mar 28 16:55:22 +0000 2016","favs":61,"id":{"$numberLong":"714496113550696453"},"retweets":35},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MN9iWh"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f31"},"content":"The Justice Department issued a scathing report on Ferguson, Mo. a year ago,\nconfirming to the broader public what many blacks and Latinos had been saying\nfor years: that the criminal justice system is rigged against them, sometimes\nwith deadly results. The rage of the #blacklivesmatter movement seemed sure to\ndominate the coming election campaign.Yet now in the midst of that campaign,\nan important national conversation about police brutality and discrimination\nhas faded into the background. Instead, an angry white working class is center\nstage voicing, subtly perhaps, that this election is about recapturing a\nnation now led by its first ever African-American president.Some people have\nhad trouble coping with Barack Obama's race since he was first elected.\nJustice investigators even unearthed evidence of this in Ferguson, where they\nfound emails mocking the first lady, comparing Obama to a chimp and opining\nthat he wouldn’t hold office for long because “what black man holds a steady\njob for four years?”Today there is a palpable anger in the air about Obama’s\npresidency. “We don’t need a president like Obama no more. He’s ruined our\ncountry. He’s ruined Christmas. He’s let the Muslims in. We can’t say that\nword. We’ve got to be ashamed of everything. And we’re not a shamed people.\nWe’re a proud people and we’re going to take our country back so watch out\nObama, we’re coming,” Nancy Mcfadzean said on C-SPAN after a Mechanicsville,\nVa. rally for Sen. Ted Cruz.As Donald Trump has made explicit with his “Make\nAmerica Great Again” campaign slogan, there’s also a desire to regain or\nresurrect something that was lost. What might that be? One possibility is the\ninfluence white voters used to have.Obama did well in 2012 in part because\nblack and Latino voters, who were his strongest supporters, comprised 29% of\nthe electorate. In this election almost one-in-three eligible voters is\nprojected to be a member of a minority group. At least 44% of the Latino\nelectorate are millennials, and 800,000 new Latino voters turn 18 each\nyear**.**At the same time, relations between blacks and whites are eroding. In\n2008, 70% of whites believed that relationships between the two races were\nsomewhat or very good, according to Gallup. By last year, after a sharp drop\nover the last three years, that number had fallen to 45%.When an NPR reporter\nasked Obama what he thinks is “bothering people,” he replied: “If you are\nreferring to specific strains in the Republican Party that suggest that\nsomehow I'm different, I'm Muslim, I'm disloyal to the country, etc…what I'd\nsay there is that that's probably pretty specific to me and who I am and my\nbackground, and that in some ways I may represent change that worries\nthem.”That change should not be what white voters worry about. They have\nplenty in common with minorities when it comes to the economic issues at the\nforefront of this election —too much in common for either voters or\npoliticians to be creating a racial divide by ignoring the anger roiling\nminority communities.Yet the #blacklivesmatter movement, meant to shine light\non the reasons for that anger and to bring change, is not having a major\nimpact on either party’s contest. Part of that is rooted in its own lack of\ncohesion. But part is because politicians have not been eager to focus on its\nconcerns.**POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media**Bernie Sanders\nfaced early protests for his lack of understanding of the movement. And while\nHillary Clinton was able to capitalize on her strong support among blacks,\npolice brutality has hardly been the centerpiece of her campaign. That’s even\nmore true on the Republican side, despite a once huge field and months of\ndebates and interviews.It’s perhaps ironic that a conversation about police\nbrutality and discrimination has been overshadowed in an election year in\nwhich the candidates have included an African American, two Latinos, a Jew and\na woman. Not even the two Latinos, running as historic firsts, have talked\nmuch about discrimination.The presence of the #blacklivesmatter movement is\nmostly felt these days in protests that some candidates are trying to hijack\nfor their own purposes. Trump has had protesters forcibly ejected from his\nrallies. He sometimes counters them by saying that all lives matter, an\nattempt to reclaim the conversation about race from blacks and make it about\nwhites. He really doesn't need to do that.

She went missing Wednesday morning from her\ngrandparents' Spencer home.Parker was a friend of a friend who had visited the\nhouse about a dozen times, even once rocking the child back to sleep when she\nawoke in her crib, Tamera Morgan, Shaylyn's grandmother, has said.Morgan said\nshe put Shaylyn to bed in her crib around 8:30 p.m. ET Tuesday but checked on\nher throughout the night until about 1:30 a.m. Morgan lives in the residence\nwith her husband, Danny Morgan; and two grown sons, including Justin and Adam\nAmmerman. Justin Ammerman is Shaylyn's father.Parker was visiting the home\nthat night, Tamera Morgan said. He and her sons were drinking and hanging\nout.When Tamera Morgan woke up around 8 a.m. Wednesday, Shaylyn was gone, the\ngrandmother said. Police and crews searched the White River and rural Owen\nCounty for Shaylyn for two days before they found her body.Kyle Parker, 22, of\nSpencer, Ind., is accused of killing a 1-year-old girl after he visited the\nhouse of the child's father. (Photo: Owen County (Ind.) Jail)Prosecutors\nallege that Parker removed Shaylyn from her crib, took her in his car and\nstarted driving toward Gosport. But then he pulled over and brutally raped the\ntoddler before smothering her with a cloth in his vehicle.He then used bleach\nto wipe down Shaylyn's body and poured it inside the dead girl, court papers\nindicate.On Friday, a forensic pathologist ruled that Shaylyn's death was\nhomicide by asphyxiation. Shaylyn had \"numerous very apparent injuries\nsustained in a sexual assault,\" the autopsy found, according to an affidavit\nfiled Monday.Forensic pathologist Donna Stewart of Louisville, who specializes\nin pediatric autopsies with sexual battery and molestation, called it the\nworst case of sexual trauma that she had seen in her career.Such horrific\ncases of child abuse are fairly rare, said Sandy Runkle, director of Prevent\nChild Abuse Indiana. Cases of neglect are more common.\"When things happen,\nit's usually not a stranger,\" Runkle said. \"Over 90% of the time, it's someone\na child knows.\"The child's mother, Jessica Stewart, shared custody of Shaylyn\nwith Ammerman. She learned her child was missing when police came to her door,\naccording to news reports.\"I'm just devastated,\" Justin Ammerman said after\nhis daughter's body was found. On Friday, a forensic pathologist ruled that\nShaylyn's death was homicide by asphyxiation.Parker — originally was arrested\non charges of failure to report a body, obstruction of justice and improper\ndisposal of a body — appeared for Monday in Owen County Circuit Court via\nvideo conference. Judge Lori Thatcher Quillen denied bail.Emotionless, Parker\nsaid little, except to ask for a court-appointed lawyer and say he understood\nthe charges he faced.The affidavit reveals a horrifying conclusion to the two-\nday search for Shaylyn, during which family members clung to hope that she\nwould be found safe.Crews used sonar equipment to plumb the depths of the\nWhite River and covered wide expanses of land in rural Owen County with all-\nterrain vehicles. But not until Parker, who was questioned as were the others\nin the home that night, agreed to show police on a map where Shaylyn lay did\nthe details of what happened to the girl began to come together.Parker was at\nthe Morgans' house because Adam Ammerman invited him over to drink and watch a\nmovie, court documents indicated.Sometime between 3 and 4 a.m. Adam Ammerman\nawoke to the sound of the front door shutting. He opened his window and saw\nParker walking away carrying something — and he thought he saw a foot dangling\nin the darkness, the documents show.Friends of Parker say he showed up at\ntheir Gosport home at around 3:40 a.m. Wednesday, pulling his car into their\ngarage and closing the door. He then came inside and began washing his\nclothes, according to Indiana State Police detectives.The friends told police\nthat Parker was quiet and distant and not acting like himself. They also told\ndetectives that Parker is attracted to girls ages 12 to 14.Parker initially\ntold investigators that he had left the Morgans' home between 12:30 and 1:15\na.m. and went straight to his friends in Gosport. But detectives talked with\nParker's stepfather to ask the man to talk to Parker about telling the\ntruth.The stepfather later told police that Parker confessed and said he acted\nalone.When talking to investigators and showing them on a map where Shaylyn's\nbody could be found, Parker had implicated Adam Ammerman.Parker now also is\ncharged with kidnapping, strangulation and aggravated battery._Follow Madeline\nBuckley on Twitter: @Mabuckley88_\n\n","title":"'Friend' charged with rape, murder in toddler's death","twitter":{"body":"\"Friend\" has been charged with rape, murder in Indiana toddler's death https://t.co/EYsCNPSqsJ (Photo: Ind. police) https://t.co/52SV8VmTSE","date":"Mon Mar 28 15:37:39 +0000 2016","favs":35,"id":{"$numberLong":"714476556169687040"},"retweets":40},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MvVHb7"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f34"},"content":"NEW YORK—Leave it to my enthused 9-year old son Samuel to explain why he\nthinks Oculus Rift is “so cool” that he wants me to buy it for him. “It makes\nyou feel like you’re actually in a new world.”Sam mentioned this after being\nchased by (and spit at) by a dinosaur in a museum gallery, after encountering\nan alien on some distant unidentified planet, and especially after driving a\nvirtual race car at high speeds.Almost two years to the day when Facebook CEO\nMark Zuckerberg announced that the social network was spending $2 billion on a\nhot virtual reality startup known as Oculus, the first of the highly\nanticipated Oculus Rifts finally come to market Monday, with people who\npreordered the VR system getting their units over the next several weeks.I’ve\ngotten a chance to check out a review unit of Rift at home a couple of days\nahead of launch and, notwithstanding a few hiccups during set-up, was almost\nas thrilled as Sam and other friends and family members I showed it to.I would\nlike to spend more time with it before deciding whether the high price tag is\njustified. But Oculus was an early hit in my house.**VR WAVE**Alternate and\nmixed reality technologies are poised for the big time. Beside Oculus Rift,\nthe HTC Vive is on the way. Sony's PlayStation VR is coming in the fall.\nMicrosoft is pushing HoloLens, and Google is looking to expand beyond\nCardboard, according to _The Wall Street Journal_. The early target market for\nOculus Rift are gamers, but there are other, broader experiences for those of\nus more casual about gameplay.The Rift review unit arrived in an enormous box\nalong with an Oculus-ready PC and LCD monitor from Asus. The PC (sold\nseparately from the $599 Oculus headset) supplies the requisite horsepower and\ngraphics capabilities to make Rift work.That’s a big difference in the gear\nrequired for the $99 Samsung Gear VR headset which Oculus also powers, where\nyou supply the select Samsung smartphones you snap into the headset.While I\nlike Gear VR and suspect more people will try it than Rift based on price\nalone, the Rift experience is far more engrossing and comfortable. Excellent\naudio enhances the realism.Oculus Rift sensor (Photo: Edward C. Baig)**WHAT\nYOU GET**Rift consists of the headset, sensor, remote control and Xbox\nwireless controller, plus all the required cables to tether it to the PC. An\nadventure game called Lucky's Tale is bundled (as is Eve:Valkyrie Founder's\nPack for those preordered Rift). An optional Touch controller I've previously\ntried out to play virtual ping-pong and tetherball has been delayed until the\nsecond half of the year.Bundles where you can get Rift plus an Oculus Ready PC\nstart at $1499. My test system (without the price of the monitor) costs closer\nto $2,000.The computer features high end graphics from Nvidia, required so the\ngames you play won't stutter or make you feel uncomfortable.**SET-UP**Among\nthe installation challenges is to find a clear enough space in your home in\nwhich to enjoy the VR experience. You’re often standing up and walking around\na bit. The 4-meter custom headset cable and 2 ½ meter sensor cable that tether\nthe Rift to the computer are plenty long enough, but you can easily lose your\nbearings. I occasionally bumped into physical objects or watched others do\nso.Speaking of watching others, it’s fun to gauge people’s reactions—you can\nsee what they’re seeing (minus the thrills) on the PC screen.As part of the\nsetup, you choose a profile picture, pick privacy settings, supply credit card\ninformation, even add your height (to help the sensor with calibration). The\nOculus remote and sensor weren’t immediately recognized and I had to summon\nhelp from the company.I also had to fiddle a bit with the headset to focus and\nget a proper fit—I felt a bit of pressure on the bridge of my nose. Before\nlong, though, I donned the headgear, pulled the attached (but removable)\nheadphones over my ears, grabbed the remote and was good to go.Oculus Rift and\nOculus Remote (Photo: Edward C. Baig)**ENTER OCULUS**You're initially taken to\nthe Oculus Home virtual environment, a large handsomely-decorated loft-like\nspace. You can walk onto a sizable area rug that has books and pillows on it\nand is crumpled in one corner.As you look in front of you, you can move your\nhead to position a pointer onto an icon for the Oculus Store, which promises\nmore than 30 games at launch.You’ll also see an icon for the Library, where\nthe apps you’ve already downloaded reside. Some games require Internet access,\nsome don’t, and some are multiplayer.One annoying feature: on some of the apps\nI started installing through the headset, I had to complete the process on the\nPC. Some downloads are large and take awhile.You can launch menus and apps\nwhile wearing the headset via the Oculus remote or the Xbox Controller, the\nlatter of which is required for some games. You don't need an Xbox\nitself.**TENNIS, DREAMDECK, RACING**I started out exploring some of the\nexperiences in Oculus Dreamdeck and was freaked out when I found myself on an\nexposed platform near the top of a skyscraper—I’m afraid of heights and it was\nall-too-real.I was more relaxed at center court in a fun game called VR Tennis\nOnline, even though I couldn’t win a point off my virtual opponent.And I\nenjoyed traveling through the bloodstream learning about cells and such inside\nThe Body VR, which Oculus describes as one of the experimental “concepts” that\nare on the cutting edge of VR.Project Cars in action (Photo: Oculus)Alas, I\ndidn’t fare as well as Samuel driving on the Scottish race track Bannochbrae\nRoad Circuit inside a game called Project Cars. Not only was my driving lousy,\nbut afterwards I felt a bit nauseous.Sam’s reaction was very different and\nportends a positive reception for Oculus: “Oh my God, this is awesome, this is\nsick!”Email: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist\n@edbaig on Twitter**The bottom line**Oculus Rift$599 for Rift; $1499 on up for\nRift and Oculus-Ready PC bundles; www.oculus.comPro.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f37"},"content":"**Spoiler alert! The following contains spoilers for _The Walking Dead_ season 6, episode 1 \"East.\" To read our recap of episode 14, click _here_.**“You’ll be alright.”That’s what we hear Dwight say after he shoots Daryl. It’s not clear who he’s talking to, or why he’s saying it, as it’s after the screen goes black, but he might as well have been saying it to all of us. You’ll be alright, because even though you think it can’t, _The Walking Dead_ can go on without its favorite son.Let’s get this over with right away -- after the Great Glenn’s Not Dead Fiasco of 2015, there is _bound_ to be speculation -- and say that, given the information in this episode, Daryl is gravely injured and possiblydead. We all just saw it. We saw someone shoot him in what looked like his chest or neck from point-blank range. We saw the blood spatter. It hit the camera lens. We heard the sound of the body drop. Minus some insane Glenn-like shenanigans (which we are not ruling out entirely), Daryl Dixon could be very much gone.Now you might be saying, he’s only shot, we’re not sure he’s dead, maybe he can recover. I’ll remind you that the show very pointedly killed off its doctor last week. I’ll remind you that Dwight is not likely to want to get Daryl medical attention. I’ll remind you that they are far from Alexandria, and Glenn, Michonne and Rosita are captive and Rick and the rest don’t know where they are. But, this show has showed a marked disregard for actual stakes when it comes to their truly main characters.This, by the way, is the biggest problem with the Glenn guessing game last fall. It wasn’t that the show strung us along about Glenn specifically, it was that allowing him to survive the impossible makes us believe anyone can survive the impossible. And we will continue to do so. Even as I saw the blood hit the camera lens, I was unwilling to believe the show had really done this. I watched it over and over again just to make sure I saw what I saw. And yet, even as I try to convince you that he might be dead or die soon, a small part of me is not convinced the show would ever really do this.That said, if Daryl ends up being alive, it will actual be kind of sad for the show, since it will be impossible to believe any character on this show ever even _could_ die in the future. So as much as we love him, and as much as we wish the show hadn’t taken away one of its strongest characters, he needs to be truly dead. Or someone needs to die at the hands of Negan and the Saviors. Because _The Walking Dead_ will lose so much more if people keep being magically alive.NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! (Photo: Gene Page, AMC)Carol’s plan to leave in order to prevent herself from adding to her long list of kills isn’t working out so well thus far. In what appears to be just hours after she left, she comes across some Saviors on the road that she has to dispense with. In true Carol fashion, the deed is done quickly and efficiently (although not as thoroughly as it might have been in the past, she did miss one who may become a problem later). Once more the rosary she’s been bumming around with has come to good use, as well as her ability to come off as a meek and fearful victim.But as great a fighter as she is, her sojourn did not solve her problem of killing too much. Her conscience is still nagging her, and not having someone to fight for didn’t stop the death. Because she at the very least always has herself to fight for.  But all that may be moot, anyway, considering the final seconds of this episode. We doubt much could keep Carol and her knives away from the man who attacked Daryl.Morgan has been espousing a very different philosophy and morality from the rest of our survivors for awhile, and it’s surprising that it took this long for him and Rick to truly hash it out. But they did, and with significantly less violence than when Carol and Morgan had the same conversation. Morgan fesses up to keeping the Wolf alive, but argues that it all happened for a reason (since he later saved Denise who later saved Carl). Rick is incredulous, but a little more moved by Morgan than we would have guessed. After the pair encounters what seems like yet another Savior (really charismatic leader, this Negan guy, huh?) on their hunt for Carol, Morgan convinces Rick to just leave. To stop killing (at least in that moment, not forever). To just wait and let him do the dirty work and find Carol. To go home to the people he loves.Too bad now that Rick finally has someone to come home to, she’s not there.What is the point, I ask you, of living in the most secure location in the post-apocalypse, if you’re just going to up and leave all the time? We now have two deaths in as many episodes that could have easily, _easily_ been prevented by the respective people simply not wandering past the gate. Did Denise _need_ to go check out that apothecary? No, someone else could have or they could have lived without the medical supplies. Did Daryl _need_ to go on an avenging rampage after her? No, he really, really didn’t. Especially not when his friends and family begged him not to.But he did. And Glenn and Michonne and Rosita went after him. And he had one chance to change his mind and go back and prevent all of this. But still, he made the rash, emotional decision to go and try to fix what he feels was his grave mistake. And then Glenn and Michonne were captured after following him into what are clearly Savior-controlled woods. And then even before he and Rosita were able to stage a rescue attempt (like Abraham last week), Dwight had a gun to his head. And then? We're not totally sure. But whatever it truly was, it wasn't good for Daryl.Like I said above, we don’t know everything, and many signs point to Daryl’s death. It would be a shame for us, as he is one of the most interesting and fully-drawn characters the show has ever offered. It’s a shame for the show, as it would certainly feel the lack of Norman Reedus’ presence in every episode after this. But if Daryl is truly dead or dies soon, we know one thing for sure: The war with the Saviors is only just beginning.Super great time for Maggie to be screaming in pain and clutching her stomach, right? That's definitely a good thing?Here's to hoping the season finale next week offers up some answers.\n\n","title":"‘The Walking Dead’ recap: Everybody dies","twitter":{"body":"RT @klawls: Hi friends.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f3b"},"content":"Nearly a year ago, officials from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\nsaid work was underway to create a health-hazard standard for lead in drinking\nwater, records from agency advisory group meetings show.Yet despite growing\npublic concern about high levels of lead coming out of taps in Flint, Mich.,\nas well as at homes and schools in all 50 states, the EPA still hasn’t\nreleased results of computer models estimating what level of lead in water\nposes a serious health threat and should trigger local health department help\nfor families.“People across the country and in Flint need to know what EPA\nthinks the level is at which a household should consider taking action,” said\nTom Neltner, a member of the EPA’s lead and copper work group and chemicals\npolicy director for the Environmental Defense Fund.“I think it’s stuck within\nthe EPA decision-making,” Neltner said. “I think they have it. I think they\nare arguing about it.”EPA officials declined to grant an interview and did not\nanswer USA TODAY NETWORK questions about why the analysis is taking so long\nand what deadlines agency leadership has set to ensure timely progress.“EPA is\nanalyzing data on lead exposure, blood lead level models and exposure\npathways,\" the agency said in an emailed statement. \"Once the agency has a\nscientifically robust analysis, and completes internal agency reviews, we\nintend to seek external peer review.”The EPA hasn't begun an internal review\nyet because, among other things, it still is evaluating approaches that at\nleast five offices within the agency use for predicting a person's blood-lead\nlevel based on exposures, the statement said. The goal is for the level to be\nincluded in a package of regulatory proposals the agency expects to publish\nsometime in 2017.Current EPA regulations do not include a health-hazard\nstandard for lead in drinking water. In regulating water systems, the EPA has\nset what it calls an “action level” for lead of 15 parts per billion to\ntrigger water-treatment actions if more than 10% of faucets sampled exceed\nthat level.But the number is only an engineering standard that, when it was\nset in 1991, was considered to be the lowest amount of lead in water that\nsystems could achieve reliably through adding anti-corrosion chemicals.“Right\nnow people are using the current action level as if it had meaning for health,\neven though it is not based on health,” Neltner saidSome studies have\ndocumented harm from drinking water contaminated at far lower levels. The EPA\nand the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention both say lead in\ndrinking water is not safe at any concentration.The EPA has set a maximum\ncontaminant goal of zero for lead in drinking water. The goal is not\nenforceable, and experts say it also is impossible to achieve because millions\nof U.S. homes receive water that passes through lead pipes and\nplumbing.Without a health-hazard level, the public and water systems can't put\nlead test results in any context or know when immediate action is needed, said\nMarc Edwards, the Virginia Tech water engineering expert whose team has\nindependently investigated Flint’s contamination issues.In this Feb. 25, 2016\nfile photo, signs warn not to drink the lead contaminated water from a water\nfountain at Woodside Church in Flint, Mich. (Photo: Jacquelyn Martin, AP)“You\nhave to have some level that requires people to know when their health is in\ndanger,” Edwards said. “Whatever they set, I think they’re fearful of the\nfallout.\"People are measuring lead in schools again, and they’re getting\nlevels in the hundreds of parts per billion,” he said.This month, a USA TODAY\nNETWORK investigation revealed that nearly 2,000 water systems serving about 6\nmillion people have failed to meet the EPA’s existing lead standard since\n2012. About 350 of the failing systems are dedicated to serving schools and\nday care centers, and about 600 of the systems had tests at some taps showing\nlead levels topping 40 ppb, EPA enforcement data show.\"Your series has really\ndriven it home, more so than anyone else, how widespread this problem is,\"\nEdwards said. \"EPA has to make a decision about some level of contamination\nthat poses a health threat.\"Meeting minutes from an EPA drinking water expert\nadvisory group indicate agency staff made progress coming up with a health\nhazard number last year and thought it might even be released by late 2015.As\nof this past April, EPA staff told the lead and copper working group that the\nagency had an existing computer model to help determine what level of lead in\na home’s tap water posed a serious health risk. Joyce Donohue of EPA’s Office\nof Science and Technology discussed factors that would need to be considered\nin the modeling.At that time, the working group was in the process of drafting\nrecommendations for creation of a household action level for lead.The group’s\nrecommendation was for the EPA to come up with a level of lead in drinking\nwater that posed a health danger to those considered.At greatest risk were\ninfants fed formula made with tap water, the group said. The modeling should\nestablish a hazard level that would protect them from having dangerous levels\nof lead in their blood.If a water test found lead above this household action\nlevel, the group wanted public health experts notified so they could\ninvestigate and help.In June, records show that members asked about the EPA’s\nprogress in developing a household action level, which EPA officials dubbed\nHAL.Eric Burneson of the EPA’s Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water\n“indicated that EPA is working on establishing the HAL, but that it will take\nsome time because the HAL must undergo a peer review and quality assurance. It\nmay or may not be available for the full (advisory council) meeting in late\n2015.” Burneson is the director of the water office’s standards and risk\nmanagement division.“Nine months ago, EPA said it needed to complete quality\nassurance and peer review before releasing a draft household action level,”\nNeltner said.But he said he believes that the EPA has an obligation as a\npublic health agency to release information about a hazard level as quickly as\npossible.\"It makes no sense to wait for rulemaking to help parents who must\ndecide whether to invest in a filter for the water they use to make up their\nchild’s infant formula,\" he said.The lead and copper working group is part of\nthe EPA’s National Drinking Water Advisory Council, which in December formally\nsent numerous recommendations to the agency, including for the creation of the\nhousehold action level. Jill Jonas, advisory council chairwoman and the\ndrinking water chief for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources,\ndeclined to be interviewed.In wake of the crisis in Flint, Mich., concern is\ngrowing about lead in drinking water across the USA. (Photo: Juri Samsonov,\nGetty Images)Several of the experts who served on the advisory council's\n16-member lead and copper working group were traveling, unavailable or\ndeclined to be interviewed.June Swallow of the Rhode Island Department of\nHealth said through a spokesperson that she doesn’t recall the EPA committing\nto a particular time frame for developing the health-action level. Evaluating\nhow long it should take “is not her area of expertise,” she said.Leon Bethune\nof the Boston Public Health Commission, declined to be interviewed about the\nEPA's progress developing the action level. Through a spokesperson, he issued\na statement: “It was a great experience meeting with the folks from health\ndepartments and water utilities from around the country, using our own\nexperiences, knowledge and research to come to consensus on how to improve the\nlead and copper rule.”Another working group member, Lynn Thorp of the advocacy\ngroup Clean Water Action, said in an interview the EPA indicated last year\nthat agency staff were working to create the household-action level.“I don’t\nknow why it hasn’t come out yet,” Thorp said. “If there is a gap in public\nhealth and exposure science or other data that we need to answer this\nquestion, then we need to know that so there can be public support for\ngovernment agencies undertaking that work.”From at least 2002 into 2004,\narchived webpages show the EPA’s website said a lead concentration of 40 ppb\nor more in drinking water was cause for \"immediate action.\"  At that level,\nthe water posed an “imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of\nchildren and pregnant women.”The agency acknowledged the level was on its\nwebsite for several years but told the USA TODAY NETWORK it never was formally\nadopted and hadn't undergone peer review.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f3e"},"content":"BLOOMINGTON, Ind. — Back in 1978, Luke Gillespie was a jazz musician and\neducator in David Baker's office at Indiana University and saw the Miles Davis\nLP _Kind of Blue_ on the turntable. It looked worn and scratched, like it was\nplayed over and over, Gillespie said.“Wow,” Gillespie said to Baker, his\nteacher. \"You have gotten a lot of mileage out of this record.”Baker's reply,\nGillespie said, changed his life.\"Yeah, that's my seventh copy,\" Baker told\nhim.Gillespie, a professor in the IU Jacobs School of Music and performer of\njazz and classical piano music, surmised that Baker would have had to play the\nvinyl record hundreds, or even thousands, of times, before the grooves became\ntoo worn to allow the needle to stay within the line.And Baker was on his\nseventh copy.It was a moment, Gillespie said, that for him, encapsulates\nBaker's influence as an educator.\"I thought I had listened a lot, but I had\nnever listened enough to wear out even one record,\" Gillespie said. \"I\nrealized that I hadn't really listened as much as I needed to really absorb\nthe music.\"Baker, a renowned jazz performer and composer, died Saturday,\ncolleagues and friends confirmed. He was 84.Baker was a professor at the IU\nmusic school and founder of its Jazz Studies program.An Indianapolis native,\nBaker racked up numerous awards during an illustrious musical career that\nbegan early in his time as a student at Crispus Attucks High School in the\n1940s, when, according to a 2008 _Indianapolis Star_ report, he would \"sneak\ninto the smoky clubs of Indiana Avenue to soak up the atmosphere.\"At Crispus\nAttucks, Baker cultivated a love of jazz.\"We went to Attucks at a time that\nwas very exciting. There was a great tradition of jazz already there by then,\"\nBaker said in 2008. \"We had the creme de la creme of mentors — a large music\ndepartment of maybe four, five teachers. In retrospect, it was seemingly the\nbest of all possible worlds.\"Baker was an aspiring trombone player then, but\nhe would grow to be a Grammy-nominated artist with more than 1,000\ncompositions. He took up the cello after a car accident injured muscles in his\nface.Among Baker’s honors are becoming an Indiana Living Legend in 2001, an\nNEA Jazz Master in 2000, a Grammy nominee in 1979 and Pulitzer Prize nominee\nin 1972.He taught and performed throughout the United States, Canada, Europe,\nAustralia, New Zealand and Japan, according to Baker's retirement biography,\nwritten by Gillespie. He also co-founded the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks\nOrchestra, Gillespie said.Baker founded IU's Jazz Studies program after he was\nhired at the school of music in 1966. He received a bachelor's and master's\ndegree in music education at IU.\"He kind of opened my eyes to a lot of\ndifferent things,\" said Rob Dixon, a jazz saxophonist who studied under Baker.\n\"When he said something, you would perk up, when he said, 'Listen to Sonny\nRollins; check out Joe Henderson.'\"Brent Wallarab, a professor at IU's music\nschool  and a trombone player, said Baker was an educator who had the ability\nto see talents in students before they saw it themselves.\"He always had that\nintuitive sense,\" said Wallarab, who studied under Baker first in 1987 and\ncontinued a long professional relationship with him. \"From the very beginning,\nhe seemed to see things in me as a young musician that I hadn't even\nrecognized.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f3f"},"content":"I went to Stanford, and I voted for Donald Trump. So did my husband. He went\nto Yale.And so we spent more than three hours standing in line in Washington,\nD.C., to vote in the Republican presidential caucus on March 12. We suspected\nthat this would be time spent quixotically, as Washington is the bull's-eye of\nthe anti-Trump GOP political and intellectual establishment. Sure enough,\nestablishment favorite Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida won the majority of the\ndelegates, and Trump finished a poor third. Even so, we wanted to be part of\nthe nationwide rebellion against the establishment that has resulted in\nTrump’s becoming the clear GOP front-runner practically everywhere else in\nAmerica. And we weren’t alone. Trump is actually enjoying surprisingly strong\nsupport among highly educated people like us — and for good reason.The common\nwisdom is that the majority of Trump’s supporters are barely literate knuckle-\ndraggers. They’re “low-information,” in the words of Trump’s leading GOP rival\nnationwide, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. And it’s true that the largest education-\nlevel cohort among the Republicans who have consistently given Trump a double-\ndigit lead in the primaries consists of people with high-school educations or\nless.But in Massachusetts, home of Harvard and MIT and ranked as the No. 1\nstatefor residents possessing at least a bachelor’s degree, a CNN exit poll\nfor the March 1 GOP primary showed Trump winning over 46% of voters with\ncollege degrees and even edging out Ohio “moderate” Gov. John Kasich (29% to\n28%) among voters with postgraduate sheepskins. Exit polls in other states\nshow similar resultsFor nearly 25 years — since President George H.W. Bush\nlost his bid for a second term in 1992 — the Republican Party has been unable\nto field a presidential candidate who could excite enough of its own party\nmembers to the ballot box so as to win a majority of the popular vote. (In the\nlone exception, George W. Bush squeaked by with 50.7% in 2004 in a patriotic\nsurge after 9/11.) The main reason: the GOP establishment’s suicidally\ninexplicable but intractable commitment to “comprehensive immigration reform”\n(amnesty for 11 million illegal immigrants and continued mass migration) and\nso-called free trade.Voters of both political parties cite the U.S. economy,\nfaltering since 2008, as one of their top concerns. And Republican voters can\nsee perfectly well that it makes no sense to import around 400,000 illegal\nimmigrants annually, the vast majority of them unskilled, into a labor market\nwhere, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the real unemployment rate\nis close to 10% if you count people who have given up looking for work because\nthey can’t find it, or who are working part-time because they need the money\nbut would prefer to work full-time. Furthermore, only the most Pollyanna-ish\nof economists would argue that unlimited immigration in a weak economy doesn’t\ndepress wages.Free trade is an elegant concept in the 18th century pages of\nAdam Smith’s _The Wealth of Nations_. The Portuguese export wine to Britain,\nand the British export woolen goods to Portugal — a win-win situation, your\nEcon 101 professor would say. In the real world of the 21st century, “free\ntrade” means 25 years’ worth of treaties and arrangements in which the U.S.\nhews to the Smith playbook while China, for example, puts its thumb onto the\nscales via rock-bottom wages, allegedly ignored labor violations, poison-level\nair and water pollution and a manipulated currency. And free trade hasn’t\nexactly delivered Smith’s promised export benefits to the U.S. We currently\nrun an almost $366 billion trade deficit with China alone and a $484.1 billion\ntrade deficit worldwide.**POLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice,\nmedia**I’ve been a journalist by profession for more than three decades, and\nmy reporting trips have taken me on many occasions across the vast coast-to-\ncoast Rust Belt left behind as one U.S. company after another has outsourced\nits manufacturing operations to low-wage havens abroad. I’ve seen the\nconstruction industry, once a decently paying bulwark for skilled working\nclass American men without much educational aptitude, turned over to non-\nEnglish-speaking illegal immigrants toiling for labor contractors at under-\nthe-table wages a fraction of what on-the-books employees make. The Republican\nestablishment’s response to this has been pathetic: a “reformicon” agenda of\nusing the refundable earned-income tax credit to hand out welfare to the\ndisplaced American workers.Trump promises to turn America into a country that\ndoes what nations ought to do: Put the interests of its own citizens first.\nThat’s why he has promised to build a wall along our southern border and to\nchange our tariff practices to comport with export-import reality. He has also\nmanaged to grow the Republican Party, apparently generating record primary\nturnouts and inspiring thousands of onetime Democrats to switch to the GOP.\nThat’s why my husband and I will be casting our ballots for Trump in November\nshould he become the Republican nominee.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f42"},"content":"**Spoiler alert: This story contains substantial details about “East,” Sunday’s episode of AMC's _The Walking Dead_.**Blood sometimes seems to flow like water on _The Walking Dead_, so it can take something out of the ordinary to really jolt the audience.The end of Sunday’s episode accomplished that, with blood flying into the viewer’s face – or at least into the camera – just before the picture went to black. The larger shock, however, is that the blood belongs to fan favorite Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus), whose fate will remain unknown at least until next Sunday’s Season 6 finale (AMC, 9 p.m. ET/PT).Reedus tells USA TODAY that there’s no sleight of hand in the tightly focused shot, which features Saviors enemy Dwight (Austin Amelio) sneaking up behind Daryl, who is almost out of the frame, and shooting him when he turns around.“It’s exactly what you see. That’s (Daryl’s) blood that hits the camera. There’s no trick there,” he says. As to whether the shot kills Daryl, “You don’t know, but he’s definitely not looking good.”Saviors foe Dwight (Austin Amelio) has been a thorn in Daryl Dixon's side since they met earlier in Season 6 of AMC's 'The Walking Dead.' (Photo: Gene Page, AMC)Reedus, who appeared on the big screen this year in _Triple 9 _and stars with Diane Kruger in _Sky_ (April 15), suggests not reading too much into Dwight’s post-shooting final words: “You’ll be alright.”“You don’t know who he’s talking to,” he says. “He could be saying that to anyone there. There’s other people standing there.”Daryl and Dwight have been headed toward a deadly confrontation since they met earlier in the season, when Dwight and two female companions captured Daryl. Daryl regained control and considered inviting Dwight to join the survivors at Alexandria, before the Savior took Daryl’s signature crossbow and motorcycle at gunpoint.Dwight’s rejection of compassion helped sour Daryl on being open to outsiders. When Dwight uses the crossbow to kill Denise (Merritt Wever), it only strengthens Daryl’s resolve to destroy him, even if it means taking the risk of doing it on his own.“That arrow to Denise’s head is something Daryl is not going to get over. … That was his arrow that went through her eye and killed her in front of him. He wants revenge,” Reedus says. “Sometimes, when you think with your passion and your heart and not your brain, you put yourself in a situation that comes back to bite you in the (behind), which has happened to him at least twice with that guy.”However, even Reedus is surprised Dwight got the drop on Daryl. “Daryl is an expert tracker and he’s smarter than that, but he just wants revenge so badly that he let this guy sneak up on him and shoot him. I was shocked that that would happen to Daryl. But, when you’re acting out of passion, sometimes you make a mistake. In that world, you can’t make mistakes like that.”Glenn (Steven Yeun) and Maggie (Lauren Cohan) were in different places in Sunday's episode of 'The Walking Dead,' but both were in trouble. (Photo: Gene Page, AMC)Daryl isn’t the only one whose life hangs in the balance going into the season finale. Dwight and his fellow Saviors hold Michonne (Danai Gurira), Glenn (Steven Yeun) and Rosita (Christian Serratos) captive; a bloody trail is the only evidence of Carol (Melissa McBride); and pregnant Maggie (Lauren Cohan) is stricken by abdominal pains.“There’s absolutely nobody in the cast who’s untouchable,” Reedus says. “Everyone can go at any minute.”And they haven’t even met Savior boss Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a major character from _The Walking Dead _comic books who makes his much-anticipated debut in Sunday's season finale.\"I can say it's the most gut-wrenching episode we've ever done,\" Reedus says.\n\n","title":"'Walking Dead's' Reedus talks characters' plight","twitter":{"body":"RT @billkev: Spoiler alert: @wwwbigbaldhead discusses Sun.'s @WalkingDead_AMC.

They knew it was\nanother attack.“We realized the situation immediately because we knew about\nthe airport,” he said. “At the time there was no one there from the official\nauthorities, so we did what we could.”Emergency responders arriving at the\nscene used the hotel lobby as a triage center. Van der Biersen said 40 to 50\npeople with burns on their hands, arms and backs were treated at the Hotel\nThon.“It was very disciplined, very calm … very quiet,\" he said. \"I imagine it\nwas because everyone was in total shock. We just went into autopilot.”Some\nstaff members said what happened began to sink in Wednesday, when authorities\nallowed foot traffic back into the area so people could place flowers near the\nstation.“At that moment, I had some tears,” Van der Biersen said.Over the\nweekend, the hotel's street reopened to cars, people strolled down the\nsidewalk, and although the subway station remained closed, trains still ran on\nthe track.And next week, the hotel will have therapists come in to help\nemployees deal with the tragedy.For some, like Jean Sebastien Morelle, 18, a\nhotel intern who was there, the attack was personal.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f4b"},"content":"If Oklahoma’s Buddy Hield wasn’t already a superstar, he certainly is now.The\nPlayer of the Year favorite is on his way to the Final Four with Saturday’s\n80-68 win over Oregon. But individually, Hield is in the midst of something\ntruly special. His 37-point performance against Oregon was a clinic that\nshowed just how lethal Hield is as an offensive force.Hield is the Steph Curry\nof this NCAA tournament, and with two more wins, he’ll surpass Curry’s\nbreakout 2008 tournament run.As a team, the Sooners already have.In case you\nweren’t into college basketball back in 2008, a little-known, babyfaced guard\nfor No. 10 seed Davidson grabbed the NCAA tournament spotlight. Curry’s 2008\nrun was everything we love about March Madness. With scoring games of 40, 30,\n33 and 25, he led the Wildcats to the Elite Eight.He scored 40 points in the\nfirst round against No. 7 seed Gonzaga with 30 points coming in the second\nhalf. He did to Gonzaga what he currently does to NBA teams on a regular\nbasis, which made these highlights so fun to watch.Hield is that sort of\nplayer for Oklahoma.Yes, the Sooners entered the tournament as a popular Final\nFour pick, but to get there, Hield had to be on his game. But not many\nexpected Hield to overwhelm his opponents to the degree that he has en route\nto the Final Four. He’s scored 27, 36, 17 and 37 points in his tournament\ngames. He’s made 47.5 percent of his 3s, and he’s shot 56.7 percent from the f\nloor.![hield_curry](https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/hield_curry1.p\nng?w=1000\u0026h=499)Where Davidson had a great one-two punch with Curry and Jason\nRichards, Oklahoma has far too many weapons to put all the attention on Hield.\nSo, when a team defends Hield well (which isn’t often), Jordan Woodard or\nIsaiah Cousins are more than capable of making teams pay. Hield finds space so\nwell off screens — it really is a nightmare.But let’s say a team can stick\nwith him through all of that, Hield is capable of making the contested 3 with\nconsistency. Oregon learned that the hard way, as he was able to knock down\neight 3s — many of which were defended well.Buddy Hield made 8 threes today.\nThat's a lot. #MarchMadness https://t.co/l021v91hCI— NCAA March Madness\n(@marchmadness) March 27, 2016Very few players can get on a roll like Hield\nhas in the NCAA tournament. Kemba Walker’s 2011 run was up there, but he shot\n32 percent from the field in the Final Four and title game. Curry took 90\nfield-goal attempts through the Elite Eight.

According to the Census Bureau, the state is 37.5% Asian,\n26.7% white, 23% two or more races, 10% native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, 2.5%\nblack and 0.4% American Indian/Alaska native._Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\nclaimed political momentum in the Democratic presidential race Sunday after\nscoring lopsided victories in Saturday caucuses in Alaska, Hawaii and\nWashington State.But delegate math continued to favor rival Hillary Clinton as\nthe campaign headed toward the Wisconsin primary on April 5 and the New York\nprimary on April 19. The former secretary of State now leads Sanders among\npledged delegates by 1,243 to 975, according to the Associated Press. When\nunpledged \"superdelegates\" are included, her lead stretches to 1,712 to 1,004.\nNeeded for nomination: 2,383.\"We have won five of the six last contests in\nlandslide fashion,\" Sanders said on NBC's _Meet the Press_, then referred to\nhimself in the third person. \"I think a lot of the superdelegates are now\nbeginning to look at which Democratic candidate is the best place to defeat\nDonald Trump. I think some of them are beginning to understand that it's\nBernie Sanders.\"With all precincts reporting, Sanders trounced Clinton by\n81.6%-18.4% in Alaska; 69.8%-30% in Hawaii, and 72.7% to 27.1% in Washington\nState. Democratic rules require that delegates be allocated proportionately,\nmaking it harder for Sanders to make up the deficit he faces against Clinton\nthan under GOP rules that allow winner-take-all contests.All three states held\ncaucuses, the sort of partisan contest in which Sanders has been boosted by\nthe enthusiasm of his supporters and their willingness to turn out to\nparticipate. Of the 14 states Sanders has won so far, 10 were caucuses; four\nwere primaries. In the three states that voted Saturday, less than 5% of the\npopulation in each are African-Americans, the voters who have given Clinton\nher biggest margin of victory.Looking ahead, just two of the remaining state\ncontests are caucuses, in Wyoming and North Dakota, and the big primaries\nahead include states such as New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where more\nthan one in 10 residents are black.Sanders predicted he would \"do well\" in\nWisconsin, which holds the next primary on April 5, and has \"a real shot in\nNew York,\" which holds its primary on April 19, \"and then we go out to\nCalifornia.\" The Golden State votes on June 7, the final big primary day.That\nsignaled his determination to stay in the race until the end, and he rebuffed\nquestions about what it would take for him to endorse Clinton. \"I hope very\nmuch, Chuck, that you will be asking her that question,\" he said to NBC's\nChuck Todd.Sanders defended his increasingly caustic tone toward his rival.\n\"Secretary Clinton has super PACS; she has raised some $15 million at least\nfrom Wall Street, money from the fossil fuel industry and the drug companies,\"\nhe said on ABC's _This Week_. \"Do I think the American people need to know\nthat? Is that an important issue? I think it is. Our votes on the war: I voted\nagainst the war in Iraq. She voted for the war in Iraq. That's an important\nissue.\"On NBC, Sanders said he had \"a little bit of concern\" that Clinton\nwould not participate in more debates. In February, the two campaigns agreed\nto add four debates to the original schedule, including a New Hampshire debate\nthat took place in February and a debate in Flint, Mich., that took place this\nmonth.The Clinton campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for\ncomment.\"I would hope very much that as we go into New York State, Secretary\nClinton's home state, that we will have a debate -- New York City, upstate,\nwhatever -- on the important issue facing New York and in fact the country,\"\nSanders said. Both contenders have roots in the Empire State: Sanders was born\nin Brooklyn, and Clinton was twice elected to the U.S. Senate from New\nYork.The most recent statewide poll, taken by the Emerson College Polling\nSociety March 14-16, Clinton held a daunting lead, 71%-23%. The automated\nsurvey of 373 likely Democratic primary voters, taken only of landline phones,\nhas a margin of error of +/- 5 percentage points.In Wisconsin, an Emerson poll\ntaken March 20-22 showed Clinton with a narrower lead, 50%-44%. The survey of\n354 likely Democratic primary voters has an error margin of +/-5.2 points.\nClinton has scheduled campaign stops Monday and Tuesday in Madison, Milwaukee,\nLaCrosse and Green Bay.\n\n","title":"Momentum v. math as Sanders claims victories while Clinton keeps delegate lead","twitter":{"body":"RT @SusanPage: The math: 10 of Bernie Sanders' 14 state victories so far have been in caucuses; just 2 more states caucuses ahead. https://…","date":"Sun Mar 27 22:56:55 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714224710905700352"},"retweets":63},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1MtXqhd"}

The region has long been more peaceful than other\nparts of Pakistan, which features constant skirmishes along its borders with\nAfghanistan and India. Critics have accused Nawaz of tolerating attacks in\nother parts of the country in exchange for keeping his province safe, a charge\nhe strongly denies.In recent years, Punjab has increasingly become a target.In\nFebruary 2015, five people were killed when a suicide bomber aligned with a\nTaliban splinter groups attacked a police complex in Lahore.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f50"},"content":"Many retirees rely on Social Security for most or all of their income in\nretirement. Before you make a decision that will have major financial\nimplications for the rest of your life, it's important to know everything at\nstake in the timing of when you take your benefits. Here are a few things to\nconsider.**Fewer big payments vs. more small payments**  \nMost people have what amounts to an eight-year window to claim Social\nSecurity. Earliest eligibility is at age 62, and 70 is the latest age at which\nSocial Security provides any financial incentive to wait. The key decision\nwith Social Security is whether to take a reduced benefit that will give you\nthe maximum _number _of monthly Social Security payments, or whether to wait\nand take a higher monthly benefit but receive it for a shorter period of\ntime.You can find plenty of articles discussing the trade-offs involved with\nclaiming at age 62 versus waiting until full retirement age (currently 66) or\nage 70 to claim. But a lot depends on your individual situation. For instance,\nsingle retirees who won't have anyone else claiming on their work history can\nlook solely at their own personal situation to make a smart decision about\nwhen to take Social Security. For those with family members who will receive\nspousal or survivor benefits, decisions that might make sense solely from your\npoint of view might not be the best for your family as a whole. You can run\nnumbers projecting which choice will result in your receiving more total\nmoney. But only you can make a personal assessment whether the true value of\nthat extra money is worth the trade-off of having to wait for it. The\nimportant thing is not just to make a knee-jerk decision but rather to\nconsider all the factors involved and what they mean to you and your life.**If\nyou're working and claim early, Social Security could take back your benefits\nanyway**  \nThe worst result in many people's eyes is to start collecting Social Security\nbenefits only to have the government take them away. Yet that's what happens\nto some people who continue to work in their early 60s and choose to take\nearly benefits.If you haven't yet reached full retirement age, there's a limit\non how much you can earn before Social Security forces you to forfeit\nbenefits. If you will not reach full retirement age this year and earn more\nthan $15,720, then you'll lose $1 in annual Social Security payments for every\n$2 above the limit you earn. For those who hit full retirement age during the\nyear, a higher limit of $41,880 applies to earnings before the day of the year\nyou reach full retirement age, and the forfeiture is $1 for every $3 above the\nlimit.This forfeiture doesn't result in a complete loss, because the Social\nSecurity Administration treats you as if you had delayed taking Social\nSecurity for any full month of forfeited benefits. But if that's what's going\nto happen anyway, it can make more sense just to delay filing until your\nincome will be under the threshold — or until you reach full retirement age.If\nyou change your mind, you can get a do-over. (Photo: Getty Images)**You can\nget a do-over on your decision, but only for a limited time**  \nMany people regret their decision on when to take Social Security after the\nfact. There _is _a way to undo your claiming decision, but you have only a\nlimited time to do so, and there are some key requirements that pose a\nhardship for many.In order to get a do-over, you have to use a strategy that's\nknown as withdrawing your Social Security applications. Form SSA-521 provides\nfor this request, and it provides space for you to indicate the reason for the\nwithdrawal and other related information. You can only file Form SSA-521 once\nin your lifetime, and it's only available within the first 12 months after\nyour initial application for Social Security benefits.The hardest part of the\nwithdrawal application is that if approved, you have to return any money you\nreceived from Social Security since you claimed benefits. Many retirees aren't\nin a position to pay back up to a year's worth of Social Security payments,\nand that can make the strategy impractical for them.The decision of when to\ntake Social Security is a key one. Being informed is the first step toward\nmaking sure you do the best thing for your situation.**SPONSOR CONTENT: The\n$15,978 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook**  \nIf you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your\nretirement savings. But a handful of little-known Social Security secrets\ncould help ensure a boost in your retirement income. In fact, one MarketWatch\nreporter argues that if more Americans knew about this, the government would\nhave to shell out an extra $10 billion annually. For example: one easy,\n17-minute trick could pay you as much as $15,978 more... each year!

The delays in reporting came as the party experienced a\nsurge in voter turnout comparable to the 2008 caucus when then-senator Obama\nwas running against Hilary Clinton for president.Party chairwoman Stephanie\nOhigashi told the Associated Press the polling station where she voted on Maui\nwas organized. Thousands of new members joined the party before the caucus,\nand some polling stations had massive crowds, which may have contributed to\nthe delay.Some of the new party members were residents who had lived through\ninternment camps or immigrated to Hawaii, Ohigashi said. They joined to\nbolster the party's chances of stopping Donald Trump from becoming\npresident.But another factor in the delay was the party leadership's decision\nnot to release partial results.The holdup drew ire from voters across the\ncountry, including many Sanders supporters who called it a \"media\nblackout.\"March 26, 2016 will be forever known as the day when a Google doc\nbroke news of the #HIcaucus winner before mainstream media. #mediablackoutI\nthink I'd get results quicker by actually flying to Hawaii... ✈️  \n#HIcaucusIf only we had 24hr cable news networks or digital media outlets\nsomebody could be covering the Hawaii caucuses. #HIcaucusSalisbury, who\nsupports Sanders for president, echoed some of their sentiments.

Sanders fought hard for the state, holding big rallies in the\nlast week to drive turnout among the kinds of young and liberal voters who\nhave helped him prevail in earlier caucuses.Sixteen delegates were at stake in\nAlaska.\"We are making significant inroads in Secretary Clinton's lead, and we\nhave a path toward victory,\" Sanders told a cheering crowd in Madison, Wis.,\non Saturday, following his Alaska win. \"It is hard for anyone to deny that our\ncampaign has the momentum.\"Sanders' drive to win Saturday's trio of Western\nstates comes as the race heads back to the Midwest and Northeast next month,\nterritory that could prove favorable to Clinton, who has outperformed Sanders\nin more racially diverse states. Next up: Wisconsin, which votes April 5.\nClinton's home state of New York, where a whopping 291 delegates are up for\ngrabs, will vote April 19.It was no coincidence that Sanders celebrated his\nWestern victories in a Wisconsin college town Saturday night.Democratic\npresidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. (Photo:\nAP)Sanders, who outraised Clinton in January and February, is expected to\nparlay his weekend wins into a fresh round of online donations.Despite his\nvictories Saturday, the delegate math still favors Clinton.She headed into\nSaturday's contests with a big lead among pledged delegates. When party\nofficials, known as superdelegates, are added in, Clinton’s advantage grows\neven larger.The states making their choices Saturday were friendly ground for\nSanders, who relied on caucus victories in seven of the 11 states he had won\nheading into this weekend. In addition, some of his strongest performances in\nthe nomination battle have come from states in which white voters make up a\nlarge share of the electorate, indicating an edge in Alaska and Washington.In\nmore diverse Hawaii, Clinton has the support to several top officials,\nincluding Sens. Brian Schatz and Mazie Hirono. Sanders, however, has the\nbacking of a popular figure in the state, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, a rising\nDemocratic star who resigned her post as vice chairwoman of the Democratic\nNational Committee last month to openly campaign for Sanders in the Aloha\nState. Gabbard, a combat veteran, cut an emotional commercial for Sanders,\nhighlighting the toll of overseas combat and Sanders' opposition to the Iraq\nwar.Washington had been the most hotly contested of the three states staging\ncontests Saturday.Clinton dispatched her husband, former President Bill\nClinton, and daughter, Chelsea, there on her behalf. Sanders himself\ncrisscrossed the state.Even with Sanders' big wins Saturday, Clinton also\nadded delegates to her column because the party awards them\nproportionally.Clinton and her allies already are looking past the nomination\nfight to the general election and a potential match-up against GOP front-\nrunner Donald Trump, who is engaged an increasingly ugly fight with Texas Sen.\nTed Cruz for their party’s nomination. On Friday, the two bickered over Cruz’s\naccusation that Trump planted a tabloid story about Cruz allegedly having\nextramarital affairs, a charge Trump denied. Cruz called the _National\nEnquirer_ story “garbage” and “completely false.”A pro-Clinton super PAC\nrecently announced it was reserving $70 million in television advertising to\nstart after the national convention in Philadelphia.Sanders’ fundraising\nprowess, however, could give him staying power deep into the primary election\ncalendar. He has collected nearly $140 million over the course of the election\ncycle.Clinton's camp, anticipating a strong Sanders’ performance Saturday,\nissued a fundraising appeal before his wins had been announced. “We’re still\nbeing outspent on the air in key states, we haven’t caught up in online\nfundraising,” campaign manager Robby Mook told supporters in the email.One\nclear sign that Sanders intends to stick around: On Saturday, he opened a\ncampaign office in Brooklyn — the same New York borough as Clinton’s national\nheadquarters — in preparation for the state's primary.\n\n","title":"Three for three: Sanders wins Hawaii, Washington, Alaska","twitter":{"body":"#BREAKING @AP: Bernie Sanders wins Hawaii's Democratic caucus, following victories in Washington and Alaska https://t.co/6nK4qjkvV7","date":"Sun Mar 27 08:08:54 +0000 2016","favs":138,"id":{"$numberLong":"714001233267265536"},"retweets":139},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1RsqWRj"}

The building's bullet-riddled columns still reflect\nthat it was used for six days, starting on Easter Monday in 1916, as the\nheadquarters of a revolt that aimed, but failed, to overthrow 700 years of\nBritish reign.A minute of silence for those killed was observed, the Irish\nflag was lowered to half-staff, and there was a flypast by the Irish air\nforce.More than 450 people were killed and 2,500 injured during the failed\nuprising. The rebellion and the execution of 16 of its leaders led to a series\nof events that did give Ireland its independence in 1922.Outside the post\noffice Sunday, Capt. Peter Kelleher, an Irish military officer, recited the\nrebels' 1916 proclamation of independence. Former Irish presidents Mary\nMcAleese and Mary Robinson, as well as former prime minister Bertie Ahern were\nalso present.#EasterRising parade. pic.twitter.com/hdUL8unKhHBen Phillips, the\ngreat-grand nephew of one of the executed rebels, told USA TODAY he continues\nto be amazed by the valor and sacrifices made by the rebels 100 years later.\n\"They knew they were going to die when they started this,\" he said. \"They were\ntaking on an empire that had never really, with the exception of in the United\nStates, been beaten.\"Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny joined Higgins in leading\nthe commemoration ceremony, saying it was \"important that we bear witness this\ncentenary year to all those who gave their lives during Easter 1916.\"Ireland\nhas long struggled to embrace Easter Rising as its national day of\nindependence, in part because the country's two dominant political parties,\nFine Gael and Fianna Fail, both claim to be the inheritors of the rebels'\nnationalist ideals.Complicating this year's event, after an inconclusive Feb.\n28 election, Fine Gael and Fianna Fail are currently locked in a dispute over\nwhether to form a coalition government.Meanwhile, some ultra-nationalist\ngroups, such as Republican Sinn Féin or RSF — not to be confused with Sinn\nFéin, the Irish republican political party active in Ireland and Northern\nIreland — say there is unfinished business to attend to north of the\nborder.\"The state is trying to dilute 1916, to turn it into some kind of\nhistory-fest,\" Des Dalton, who runs RSF's offices in Dublin, told the _Irish\nTimes_ on Saturday.\"We uphold the right, as of all peoples, to defend our\nnational territory from foreign aggression or invasion. Whether people like it\nor not, as long as there is a British presence in Ireland, there will always\nbe an IRA to oppose it,\" he said, a reference to the six northern Irish\ncounties that voted to stay with the United Kingdom instead of joining\nIreland.Still, out on the streets of Dublin this weekend there was less\nconcern with the bigger political picture and more worry about the here and\nnow.Colin Smith, a New Yorker with Irish roots, was part of an American\nmarching bagpipe band performing near St. Stephen's Green, a public park in\nDublin. \"I didn't know much about this (Easter Rising), but I looked into it\nwhen I knew we were coming over,\" he said. \"I'm having a great time.\"Ciaran\nMac Annraoi, an Internet technology worker from Dublin who for the past 12\nweeks has been taking part in historical re-enactments of the Easter Rising,\nhad other concerns. He wore a replica of a military uniform from 1916 and\ncarried a heavy rifle. \"I can't wait for Monday, so I can take a break from\nwearing this,\" he said.\n\n","title":"Ireland commemorates Easter Rising centennial","twitter":{"body":"RT @khjelmgaard: 'We seem to have lost; but we have not lost.'

{"_id":{"$oid":"57012fa2dea3b36c6f023f54"},"content":"DUBLIN — Ben Phillips looks and sounds more like a member of a privileged\nBritish social class than the great-grand nephew of the man who led Ireland's\nEaster Rising in 1916, a daring, bloody and unsuccessful attempt by\nnationalists to overturn British rule.\"When I was growing up in London, in an\nEnglish family, we were really proud of Patrick Pearse's legacy,\" Phillips\nsaid here Saturday, speaking in a posh British accent that sets him apart from\nthe average Irish brogue.\"The value of the Rising transcends nationality. It's\nabout equality for men and women, Catholic and Protestant, rich and poor,\" he\nsaid.Phillips, 39, lives in Nairobi, Kenya, where he works for an aid\norganization. Outwardly, he has the polish and comportment of a judge or a\nBritish financier. But he is also one of about 3,500 relatives from around the\nworld whose family members either took part in the Rising or were caught up in\nits monumental act of defiance.Many are in Dublin this weekend to mark the\n100th anniversary of the event, which accelerated Ireland to securing its\nfreedom in 1922. They have traveled from as far afield as Canada, England,\nGermany, the United States and Wales to give speeches, lay wreaths and attend\na parade, among other forms of remembrance.More than 450 people were killed\nand 2,500 wounded, the majority of them civilians, when an untrained group of\nvolunteers determined to overthrow 700 years of British domination sought to\nseize control of Dublin from the British army and proclaim a republic.The\ngroup, which included actors, playwrights and poets armed with outdated German\nrifles, held out for a week. Sixteen of the uprising's senior insurgents,\nincluding Pearse, a teacher and political activist who would come to be seen\nas the event's leader, were later executed.According to the diary kept by the\nBritish army officer who commanded the firing squads, Pearse \"whistled as he\ncame out of his cell.\"Phillips is Pearse's closest living relative. His great-\ngrandmother was the Irish rebel's first cousin on his mother's side. That\ngreat-grandmother married an Englishman and moved to England.Phillips is quick\nto dismiss any awkwardness, real or imagined, that might arise from being an\nEnglish-sounding relation of an Irish rebellion's most significant son. \"When\nIrish people hear my accent, no one is bothered by it,\" he said.\"It's a great\nblessing to be able to do this (the commemoration). The Rising really is\nIreland's gift to the world. It showed that the British empire had an end\ndate. When I talk to people (in former British colonies) in Africa now, for\nexample, they say they feel a connection to it,\" he said. \"I hope I'm around\nfor the 150th.\"Dubliner Cathal Brugha, 67, also has deep familial connections\nto the Rising. He is the grandson of two well-known Irish nationalists. One of\nthem, his namesake, was second in command at an important position in south\nDublin held by the rebels that fended off several major assaults by the\nBritish army.He was later found propped against a wall in a pool of his own\nblood clutching a pistol and taunting the British troops.\"When the Rising\nfailed the British didn't execute my grandfather because he was so badly\nwounded they thought he was going to die. He was very fit and very strong. He\nstayed alive by singing to himself. He sang 'God Save Ireland,'\" Brugha said\nSaturday at his home near University College Dublin, where he teaches in the\nbusiness department.That grandfather would later found the Irish Republican\nArmy and serve as Ireland's first president. The other, Terence MacSwiney, was\na playwright and politician in Cork who raised the profile of the Irish\nstruggle for self-determination after being imprisoned for sedition by the\nBritish in 1920. He died after 74 days on hunger strike.\"My grandfathers\nrealized it wasn't enough to write and put on plays, you also had to have\naction,\" Brugha said.\n\n","title":"Despite bloodshed, Easter Rising is Ireland's 'gift to the world'","twitter":{"body":"What does #EasterRising mean today? @khjelmgaard explains. https://t.co/W8lgdijH26","date":"Sun Mar 27 07:40:05 +0000 2016","favs":25,"id":{"$numberLong":"713993983161147392"},"retweets":21},"topic":"all","source":"usatoday","link":"http://usat.ly/1RsCCmR"}

It follows a string of military setbacks for the\nIslamic State, also known as ISIS or or ISIL, in its efforts to create a\nSunni-based caliphate from a wide swath of Syria and Iraq.“Palmyra city is now\nfully cleared of ISIS terrorists after the army established complete control\nover all its parts,” the army said in a statement through the government-\ncontrolled Syrian Arab News Agency.The British-based Syrian Observatory for\nHuman Rights confirmed Syrian army gains, saying government forces and Shiite\nmilitias were also taking control of neighborhoods on the outskirts of the\nUnited Nations heritage site known in the region as \"the bride of the Syrian\ndesert.\"عاجل #تدمر محررة بالكامل تحت سيطرة رجال الجيش السوري وقوات صقور\nالصحراء.The bitter struggle against Islamic State fighters continues in Syria\nwhile a brittle cease-fire between U.S.-backed rebels and army forces loyal to\nembattled Syrian President Bashar Assad continued to hold.The Pentagon did not\nimmediately respond to a request from USA TODAY for comment on the Palmyra\nreports, which provided political capital for Assad and for Moscow, pressing\ntheir cases as leaders in the war on terror.Assad issued a statement saying\nthe victory showed his army's efforts were more effective than that of the\nU.S.-led coalition combating Islamic State in the region. Rebel leaders\ndismissed Assad's assertions.“The government wants, through this operation, to\nwin the favor of Western nations by fighting against terrorism, while\nobscuring its responsibility as providing the reasons for the spread of\nterror,” Khaled Nasser, a member of the opposition coalition, told the\nAssociated Press.Hours before Assad's claim of victory, Russia said it had\nflown 40 airstrikes in the area in a 24-hour period.  \n  \n\"The Russian warplanes delivered strikes against 158 terrorist objectives,\nkilling over 100 militants, destroying four tanks, three artillery pieces,\nfour depots with ammunition and five motor vehicles,\" the Russian news agency\nTASS reported.The Islamic State began evacuating civilians this week to other\nparts of its territories in Syria.
