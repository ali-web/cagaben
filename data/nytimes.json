{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013b1"},"content":"At a preview of the new American Museum of Natural History exhibition\n“Dinosaurs Among Us,” scientists gave a tip of the hat to Thomas Henry Huxley,\nthe man who proposed in the 1860s that dinosaurs never really vanished from\nEarth. Most did go extinct, but their evolutionary legacy lives all around us.\nThey are birds, all 18,000 species of them.While Charles Darwin’s book of\nbooks, “On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection,” was still in\nprint in 1859, Huxley, a lecturer in paleontology and natural history in\nLondon, wrote a favorable review and became a convert to Darwin’s theory. In a\ndebate the next year, Huxley got the better of the bishop of Oxford, and\nbecame known thereafter as Darwin’s bulldog. He was also the first in a long\nline of Huxleys who distinguished themselves in science and the arts.A few\nyears later, Huxley enlisted Archaeopteryx, a fossil specimen found in a\nBavarian limestone quarry, in his defense of Darwin. He was struck by the\nspecimen’s many reptilian features; but for a feather in the fossil, it would\nprobably have been misidentified as a reptile. In a report in 1867, Huxley\nestablished the evolutionary relationship of birds and reptiles, citing 14\nanatomical features that occur in birds and reptiles alike, but not in\nmammals.Archaeopteryx was one of those “missing links” in the fossil record\nthat Darwin worried was a weakness in this theory of evolution. Huxley called\nattention to the feathers and wishbone of this early bird and the long bony\ntail of a reptile. This was a species in transition.Why has it taken so long\nto recognize that Huxley had almost certainly been right about the origin of\nbirds from some meat-eating theropod dinosaurs?Mark A. Norell, the chairman of\nthe division of paleontology at A.M.N.H. and curator of the exhibition, had\nlong been a staunch proponent of a dinosaur-bird link. A lot of evidence\namassed over the last two decades, especially the numbers of feathered\ndinosaurs found in China, moved paleontologists to organize the exhibition as\na kind of victory lap.“I think this is really going to shake up the way people\nthink of dinosaurs,” Dr. Norell said.Most ornithologists, though not\ncompletely won over, had already ceased raising blanket objections to the\ndinosaur-bird link. They seemed at a loss to conceive of alternative\nexplanations for the gathering evidence, paleontologists say.The slow\nevolution of the practice of paleontology itself was another reason for the\ndelay in recognizing Huxley’s insight. For the rest of the 19th century and\nthe first half of the 20th, the big game of fossil hunting was the bigger and\nmore bizarre dinosaurs that drew people to museums. Expeditions to remote\nlands widened the search to nearly all continents, piling up skeletons faster\nthan could be analyzed in depth.Roy Chapman Andrews became the real-life\nIndiana Jones in the 1920s, bringing back from the Gobi Desert of Mongolia a\nvariety of new dinosaur species and the first dinosaur eggs. If only he had\nfound feathered dinosaurs then and there, paleontologists say, the dinosaur-\nbird link might have been recognized much sooner. That was not to happen until\nthe end of the century.By that time, the field work of fossil hunters remained\nimportant, but only as the first step in discovery. For example, in 1964, John\nH. Ostrom of Yale University saw a birdlike claw sticking out of the ground in\nMontana. He named the dinosaur Deinonychus, or “terrible claw.” But it\nreminded him of Huxley’s evolutionary insight, leading Dr. Ostrom to link\nbirds to new generations of dinosaur research.In the last two or three\ndecades, biological disciplines have joined dinosaur studies, applying tools\ncapable of transcending the terrible claw limitations of fossilized skulls and\nbones. Geologists once dominated the field, Dr. Norell said, but “now so many\nof us could be called paleobiologists.”Also, thousands of fossils with feather\nimprints have been discovered in Liaoning Province in northeastern China in\nthe last 15 years, Dr. Norell said. Birds are the only feathered creatures\nalive today, but 150 million years ago, early birds and dinosaurs of all\nshapes and sizes came with feathers, not necessarily for flight. Feathers,\nmuseum researchers said, are one of the most useful skin coverings that ever\nevolved for insulation or mating display as well as gliding or powered\nflight.Paul C. Sereno, a University of Chicago paleontologist, has analyzed\nmany recent Chinese fossils of animals that had lived more than 100 million\nyears ago that were found in lake bed sediments.“Huxley was a brilliant\nanatomist,” Dr. Sereno said. “Some of the first birds from the Chinese site\nlook just like Archaeopteryx. This time, the dinosaur-bird transition has\nbecome ascendant.”So what is there not to like about evolution if it indeed\naccounts for the few surviving dinosaurs transformed into flocks of birds?\nMonstrous dinosaurs may captivate first graders, who thrill at being scared at\na safe distance in time.They may also draw comfort from knowing the eating\nhabits (carnivore or herbivore) of dinosaurs — their know-it-all grown-ups\ncan’t even pronounce their names. Need there be more reason for a fascination\nwith strange and mighty dinosaurs when you are little in a big world?From my\nback porch in the country, I hear crows squawking high in the trees. Crows are\nsmart, clever enough to pry open garbage cans down the road, if raccoons had\nnot gotten there first — which might account for their squawking. Some birds,\nlike blue jays at the feeder, seem to enjoy chasing off chickadees and\nsparrows.Better to be hearing the bullying jays or cardinals singing their\nvespers, however, than to have a fearsome T-rex peering in at you through your\nupstairs windows at daybreak, ready for breakfast.\n\n","title":"‘Dinosaurs Among Us’ Retraces an Evolutionary Path - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Birds are the only things with feathers alive today.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013b2"},"content":"The day he left Syria with instructions to carry out a terrorist attack in\nFrance, Reda Hame, a 29-year-old computer technician from Paris, had been a\nmember of the Islamic State for just over a week.His French passport and his\nbackground in information technology made him an ideal recruit for a rapidly\nexpanding group within ISIS that was dedicated to terrorizing Europe. Over\njust a few days, he was rushed to a park, shown how to fire an assault rifle,\nhanded a grenade and told to hurl it at a human silhouette. His accelerated\ncourse included how to use an encryption program called TrueCrypt, the first\nstep in a process intended to mask communications with his ISIS handler back\nin Syria.The handler, code-named Dad, drove Mr. Hame to the Turkish border and\nsent him off with advice to pick an easy target, shoot as many civilians as\npossible and hold hostages until the security forces made a martyr of him.“Be\nbrave,” Dad said, embracing him.Mr. Hame was sent out by a body inside the\nIslamic State that was obsessed with striking Europe for at least two years\nbefore the deadly assaults in Paris last November and in Brussels this month.\nIn that time, the group dispatched a string of operatives trained in Syria,\naiming to carry out small attacks meant to test and stretch Europe’s security\napparatus even as the most deadly assaults were in the works, according to\ncourt proceedings, interrogation transcripts and records of European wiretaps\nobtained by The New York Times.Officials now say the signs of this focused\nterrorist machine were readable in Europe as far back as early 2014. Yet local\nauthorities repeatedly discounted each successive plot, describing them as\nisolated or random acts, the connection to the Islamic State either overlooked\nor played down.“This didn’t all of a sudden pop up in the last six months,”\nsaid Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general who ran the Defense\nIntelligence Agency from 2012 to 2014. “They have been contemplating external\nattacks ever since the group moved into Syria in 2012.”Mr. Hame was arrested\nin Paris last August, before he could strike, one of at least 21 trained\noperatives who succeeded in slipping back into Europe. Their interrogation\nrecords offer a window into the origins and evolution of an Islamic State\nbranch responsible for killing hundreds of people in Paris, Brussels and\nbeyond.European officials now know that Dad, Mr. Hame’s handler, was none\nother than Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the Belgian operative who selected and trained\nfighters for plots in Europe and who returned himself to oversee the Paris\nattack, the deadliest terrorist strike on European soil in over a decade.The\npeople in Mr. Abaaoud’s external operations branch were also behind the\nBrussels attacks, as well as a foiled attack in a suburb of Paris last week,\nand others are urgently being sought, Belgian and French officials say.“It’s a\nfactory over there,” Mr. Hame warned his interlocutors from France’s\nintelligence service after his arrest. “They are doing everything possible to\nstrike France, or else Europe.”For much of 2012 and 2013, the jihadist group\nthat eventually became the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, was\nputting down roots in Syria. Even as the group began aggressively recruiting\nforeigners, especially Europeans, policy makers in the United States and\nEurope continued to see it as a lower-profile branch of Al Qaeda that was\nmostly interested in gaining and governing territory.One of the first clues\nthat the Islamic State was getting into the business of international\nterrorism came at 12:10 p.m. on Jan. 3, 2014, when the Greek police pulled\nover a taxi in the town of Orestiada, less than four miles from the Turkish\nborder. Inside was a 23-year-old French citizen named Ibrahim Boudina, who was\nreturning from Syria. In his luggage, the officers found 1,500 euros, or\nalmost $1,700, and a French document titled “How to Make Artisanal Bombs in\nthe Name of Allah.”But there was no warrant for his arrest in Europe, so the\nGreeks let him go, according to court records detailing the French\ninvestigation.Mr. Boudina was already on France’s watch list, part of a cell\nof 22 men radicalized at a mosque in the resort city of Cannes. When French\nofficials were notified about the Greek traffic stop, they were already\nwiretapping his friends and relatives. Several weeks later, Mr. Boudina’s\nmother received a call from a number in Syria. Before hanging up, the unknown\ncaller informed her that her son had been “sent on a mission,” according to a\npartial transcript of the call.The police set up a perimeter around the\nfamily’s apartment near Cannes, arresting Mr. Boudina on Feb. 11, 2014.In a\nutility closet in the same building, they found three Red Bull soda cans\nfilled with 600 grams of TATP, the temperamental peroxide-based explosive that\nwould later be used to deadly effect in Paris and Brussels.It was not until\nnearly two years later, on Page 278 of a 359-page sealed court filing, that\ninvestigators revealed an important detail: Mr. Boudina’s Facebook chats\nplaced him in Syria in late 2013, at the scene of a major battle fought by a\ngroup calling itself the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.According to a brief\nby France’s domestic intelligence agency, he was the first European citizen\nknown to have traveled to Syria, joined the Islamic State and returned with\nthe aim of committing terrorism. Yet his ties to the group were buried in\nFrench paperwork and went unconnected to later cases.Including Mr. Boudina, at\nleast 21 fighters trained by the Islamic State in Syria have been dispatched\nback to Europe with the intention of causing mass murder, according to a Times\ncount based on records from France’s domestic intelligence agency. The\nfighters arrived in a steady trickle, returning alone or in pairs at the rate\nof one every two to three months throughout 2014 and the first part of\n2015.Like the killers in Paris and Brussels, all of these earlier operatives\nwere French speakers — mostly French and Belgian citizens, alongside a handful\nof immigrants from former French colonies, including Morocco.They were\narrested in Italy, Spain, Belgium, France, Greece, Turkey and Lebanon with\nplans to attack Jewish businesses, police stations and a carnival parade. They\ntried to open fire on packed train cars and on church congregations. In their\npossession were box cutters and automatic weapons, walkie-talkies and\ndisposable cellphones, as well as the chemicals to make TATP.Most of them\nfailed. And in each instance, officials failed to catch — or at least to flag\nto colleagues — the men’s ties to the nascent Islamic State.In one of the\nhighest-profile instances, Mehdi Nemmouche returned from Syria via Frankfurt\nand made his way by car to Brussels, where on May 24, 2014, he opened fire\ninside the Jewish Museum of Belgium, killing four people. Even when the police\nfound a video in his possession, in which he claimed responsibility for the\nattack next to a flag bearing the words “Islamic State of Iraq and Syria,”\nBelgium’s deputy prosecutor, Ine Van Wymersch, dismissed any connection.“He\nprobably acted alone,” she told reporters at the time.Though the degree to\nwhich the operatives were being directed by the Islamic State might have been\nunclear at first, a name began to appear in each successive investigation:\nAbdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian citizen who counterterrorism officials say rose\nthrough the ranks to become a lieutenant of the Islamic State’s external\noperations efforts.In the months before the Jewish museum attack, Mr.\nNemmouche’s phone records reveal that he made a 24-minute call to Mr. Abaaoud,\naccording to a 55-page report by the French National Police’s antiterror unit\nin the aftermath of the Paris attacks.“All of the signals were there,” said\nMichael S. Smith II, a counterterrorism analyst whose firm, Kronos Advisory,\nbegan briefing the United States government in 2013 on ISIS’ aspirations to\nstrike Europe. “For anyone paying attention, these signals became deafening by\nmid-2014.”It was in the summer of 2014 that the link to the terrorist\norganization’s hierarchy became explicit.On June 22 of that year, a 24-year-\nold French citizen named Faiz Bouchrane, who had trained in Syria, was\nsmuggled into neighboring Lebanon. He was planning to blow himself up at a\nShiite target, and during interrogation, he let slip the name of the man who\nhad ordered him to carry out the operation: Abu Muhammad al-Adnani.Mr. Adnani\nis the spokesman for ISIS and is considered one of its most senior members.\nJust a few days after Mr. Bouchrane checked into a budget hotel in Beirut, Mr.\nAdnani released an audio recording announcing the establishment of the\ncaliphate.“Adnani reportedly leads the external operations planning of the\nIslamic State,” said Matthew G. Olsen, the former director of the National\nCounterterrorism Center.Intelligence officials in the United States and Europe\nhave confirmed the broad outlines of the external operations unit: It is a\ndistinct body inside ISIS, with its command-and-control structure answering to\nMr. Adnani, who reports to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-proclaimed caliph of\nthe Islamic State.The unit identifies recruits, provides training, hands out\ncash and arranges for the delivery of weapons once fighters are in position.\nAlthough the unit’s main focus has been Europe, external attacks directed by\nISIS or those acting in its name have been even more deadly beyond Europe’s\nshores. At least 650 people have been killed in the group’s attacks on sites\npopular with Westerners, including in Turkey, Egypt and Tunisia, according to\na Times analysis.Within the hierarchy, Mr. Abaaoud was specifically tasked\nwith mounting attacks in Europe, according to the French police report and\nintelligence brief.“Abaaoud, known as Abou Omar, was the principal commander\nof future attacks in Europe,” Nicolas Moreau, a French jihadist who was\narrested last year, told his French interrogators, according to the report by\nFrance’s antiterror police. “He was in charge of vetting the applications of\nfuture candidates.”In an audio recording released on Sept. 22, 2014, Mr.\nAdnani, the ISIS spokesman and chief of the external operations wing,\naddressed the West.“We will strike you in your homeland,” he promised, calling\non Muslims everywhere to kill Europeans, “especially the spiteful and filthy\nFrench.” And he urged them to do it in any manner they could: “Smash his head\nwith a rock, or slaughter him with a knife, or run him over with your car,” he\nsaid, according to a translation provided by the SITE Intelligence Group,\nwhich monitors extremist propaganda.In the months that followed, a man\ndecapitated his employer near the French city of Lyon, sending a snapshot of\nthe severed head to the Islamic State. Another man stormed a police station in\nParis, carrying a butcher’s knife and a photocopy of the Islamic State’s\nflag.These are among around two dozen plots linked to the Islamic State that\nwere documented in the year after Mr. Adnani’s speech. In most, there were no\ndirect operational ties back to Syria, but there were clear signs that the\nattacker had consumed the terrorist group’s propaganda online.The low potency\nof these attacks, with single-digit death tolls, combined with the fact that\nmany of the perpetrators had a history of mental illness, prompted analysts\nand officials to conclude that the Islamic State remained a distant second to\nAl Qaeda in its ability to carry out attacks on Western soil.Experts now\nbelieve that the Islamic State was actually adopting a strategy first put\nforward by an earlier operations leader for Al Qaeda, who argued that the\ngroup would become obsolete if it worked only on 9/11-size plots that took\nmonths or years to mount. He instead called for Al Qaeda to also carry out a\npatter of small- and medium-size plots, and to use propaganda to inspire self-\ndirected attacks by supporters overseas.In a recent issue of its online\nmagazine in French, Dar al-Islam, the Islamic State explained the approach.\n“The Islamic State has deployed its resources to generate three types of\nterrorist attacks,” the article states, specifying that they include large-\nscale plots coordinated by the group’s leaders, down to “isolated actions of\nself-radicalized people, who have absolutely no direct contact with ISIS, and\nyet who will consciously act in its name.”The same article says the group’s\nmethod for carrying out jihad in Europe involves an adaptation of\nAuftragstaktik, a combat doctrine within the German Army in the 19th century.\nThose tactical guidelines call for commanders to give subordinates a goal and\na time frame in which to accomplish it, but otherwise to give them the freedom\nto execute it.The Islamic State explains in the article that it adopted the\nsystem to give recruits “complete tactical autonomy,” with few fingerprints\nthat could be tracked back to the group, and “no micromanaging.”By early 2015,\nthe Islamic State’s external operations branch had personnel dedicated to\nspending their days in Internet cafes in Syria pumping out propaganda, aimed\nboth at inciting lone-wolf attacks and at luring new recruits.Among the people\nwho took the bait was Reda Hame, the young technology professional from Paris,\nwho later told investigators that he had joined in hope of fighting to bring\ndown President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Instead, upon arriving in Syria in\nJune 2015, he walked directly into the Islamic State’s pipeline for foreign\nattacks.During his intake interview in Raqqa, Syria, in June 2015, the Islamic\nState administrator taking notes on a computer across from him expressed\nsatisfaction when he learned that Mr. Hame was from Paris and had a background\nin technology, according to his lengthy account to France’s domestic\nintelligence agency, the Direction Générale de la Sécurité Intérieure, or\nD.G.S.I. The details were recorded in more than 16 hours of questioning,\naccording to a transcript obtained by The Times and first reported on by the\nFrench newspaper Le Monde.Days later, a man wearing a mask called Mr. Hame\noutside, told him to lie down in the bed of a pickup truck and covered him\nwith a tarp. He was warned to keep his eyes lowered and not to look out.They\ndrove at high speed, and when the truck stopped, a fighter speaking Arabic\ndirected him to a sport utility vehicle idling nearby, its tinted windows\nobscuring its occupants. When Mr. Hame opened the door to the back seat, the\ndriver said, “Monte devant,” French for “Get in the front.”The driver, Mr.\nHame said, was Mr. Abaaoud, by then considered the most wanted terrorist in\nEurope. As they drove through the Syrian countryside, the future architect of\nthe Paris attacks explained to Mr. Hame that if he faced the enemies of Islam\nalone, he would receive double the reward in heaven.“He asked me if I was\ninterested in going abroad,” Mr. Hame told investigators. “He said to imagine\na rock concert in a European country — if you were given a weapon, would you\nbe ready to open fire on the crowd?”When Mr. Hame reiterated that he wanted to\nfight the Assad government instead, Mr. Abaaoud became terse. “He said he\nwould show me those wounded in the war and buildings that had been destroyed,\nso that I would realize how lucky I was to be sent back to France rather than\nstay to fight here,” Mr. Hame recounted.Videos released by the Islamic State\nafter the Paris attacks in November included footage of eight of the 10\nattackers while they were still in territory the terrorist group controlled in\nIraq and Syria. They announced that they were acting on the orders of Mr.\nBaghdadi, the caliph of the Islamic State, and then proceeded to shoot or\nbehead a captive, most of them in grotesquely choreographed scenes shot\nagainst a desert backdrop, according to the footage archived by the SITE\nIntelligence Group.Officials have deduced that the footage was filmed between\nFebruary and September 2015, suggesting the Paris attacks were being planned\nmonths before they took place. It is now known that at the same time Mr.\nAbaaoud was laying the groundwork for the devastating plot, he was recruiting,\ncajoling and training Mr. Hame and others for smaller, quick-hit attacks.The\nnight they met, Mr. Abaaoud dropped off Mr. Hame at a house in Raqqa with a\nwhite gate, according to the transcript. He said he would come for Mr. Hame\nthe next morning, and warned him that if he did not agree to the mission, his\npassport, which was about to expire, would be given to another recruit who\nwould go to Europe in his place.When Mr. Abaaoud returned the next day, his\nface was covered with a brown scarf with slits for his eyes. He wore a\nholstered handgun. “He told me that he was now going to explain the mission to\nme,” Mr. Hame said after his arrest, describing how the discussion occurred in\nthe senior operative’s speeding vehicle. “He told me I didn’t have a lot of\ntime; he said he was just waiting for the confirmation of his emir. I told him\nthat I would go.”Mr. Hame said his training began about a 30-minute drive from\nRaqqa, in a villa that acted as Mr. Abaaoud’s classroom. There, the senior\noperative demonstrated how to load a Kalashnikov rifle. When Mr. Hame tried,\nhe jammed his thumb in the metal, hurting himself. Mr. Abaaoud made him repeat\nthe exercise again and again.The next day, Mr. Abaaoud drove Mr. Hame to a\npark covered in dry grass for target practice. Throughout the lesson, Mr.\nAbaaoud repeatedly lost his temper, annoyed by his recruit’s lack of skill.“He\nyelled at me because when I was shooting in volleys, it went into the air,”\nMr. Hame recounted. “He made me practice a lot, to the point that the grass\ncaught fire.”The instructor appeared even more on edge during the third and\nfinal day of Mr. Hame’s military training, when he drew a silhouette on the\nwall of an abandoned building and demonstrated how to throw a grenade.\nInexperienced and struggling in the suffocating heat, Mr. Hame did not throw\nit far enough and was cut by shrapnel. Only when Mr. Abaaoud saw him bleeding\ndid he relent, driving his student to a nearby clinic to be bandaged.At night,\nMr. Hame was dropped off at an apartment in Raqqa that appeared to be a\ndormitory for members of the external operations branch. One room served as an\narsenal, with stacks of suicide belts, jugs of explosives, body armor and\ncombat boots. The other recruits were also French speakers, including a man\nwho said he had been training for eight months. He and Mr. Hame were told to\nteam up by Mr. Abaaoud, who decided to send them back to Europe the same\nday.They were among the many pawns that Mr. Abaaoud was positioning across the\nContinent.If Mr. Hame was not handy with weapons, he had other qualities that\nwere attractive to the Islamic State: He had a French passport and had worked\nas a computer technician for Astrium, a subsidiary of the French aeronautics\ngiant Airbus. It was at least the second time that Mr. Abaaoud had chosen a\nfighter with information technology credentials: Sid Ahmed Ghlam, who was\ndispatched last April to attack churches in France, was in the second year of\na five-year computer science program, according to news reports.The final\nphase of Mr. Hame’s training took place at an Internet cafe in Raqqa, where an\nIslamic State computer specialist handed him a USB key. It contained CCleaner,\na program used to erase a user’s online history on a given computer, as well\nas TrueCrypt, an encryption program that was widely available at the time and\nthat experts say has not yet been cracked.The external operations unit was on\na drive to improve its operational security after months of embarrassing\nfailures.More than a year and a half earlier, the would-be Cannes bomber,\nIbrahim Boudina, had tried to erase the previous three days of his search\nhistory, according to details in his court record, but the police were still\nable to recover it. They found that Mr. Boudina had been researching how to\nconnect to the Internet via a secure tunnel and how to change his I.P.\naddress.Though he may have been aware of the risk of discovery, perhaps he was\nnot worried enough.Mr. Boudina had been sloppy enough to keep using his\nFacebook account, and his voluminous chat history allowed French officials to\ndetermine his allegiance to the Islamic State. Wiretaps of his friends and\nrelatives, later detailed in French court records obtained by The Times and\nconfirmed by security officials, further outlined his plot, which officials\nbelieve was going to target the annual carnival on the French Riviera.Mr.\nHame, in contrast, was given strict instructions on how to communicate. After\nhe used TrueCrypt, he was to upload the encrypted message folder onto a\nTurkish commercial data storage site, from where it would be downloaded by his\nhandler in Syria. He was told not to send it by email, most likely to avoid\ngenerating the metadata that records details like the point of origin and\ndestination, even if the content of the missive is illegible. Mr. Hame\ndescribed the website as “basically a dead inbox.”The ISIS technician told Mr.\nHame one more thing: As soon as he made it back to Europe, he needed to buy a\nsecond USB key, and transfer the encryption program to it. USB keys are\nencoded with serial numbers, so the process was not unlike a robber switching\ngetaway cars.“He told me to copy what was on the key and then throw it away,”\nMr. Hame explained. “That’s what I did when I reached Prague.”Mr. Abaaoud was\nalso fixated on cellphone security. He jotted down the number of a Turkish\nphone that he said would be left in a building in Syria, but close enough to\nthe border to catch the Turkish cell network, according to Mr. Hame’s account.\nMr. Abaaoud apparently figured investigators would be more likely to track\ncalls from Europe to Syrian phone numbers, and might overlook calls to a\nTurkish one.Next to the number, Mr. Abaaoud scribbled “Dad.”Mr. Hame was\ninstructed to make his way back to Paris, employing an itinerary that mimicked\nthe journey of a backpacker on a summer holiday: He was to travel to Istanbul\nand spend a few days wandering the streets of the tourist district around\nTaksim Square.Then he was to fly to Prague and buy a Czech SIM card. He would\nagain check into a hotel, pretend to be a tourist and leave quick missed calls\non Mr. Abaaoud’s Turkish phone number. The record of the call would be Mr.\nAbaaoud’s notification of his trainee’s progress. Mr. Hame was expected to\nrepeat the procedure for each leg of his journey, including in Amsterdam and\nthen Brussels, before returning by train to Paris.Once Islamic State leaders\nknew that Mr. Hame had made it home, they would use the encryption and the\nTurkish drop box to coordinate further instructions, he said.The mission began\non the morning of June 12, when Mr. Abaaoud drove Mr. Hame and a second\nrecruit to the Turkish border. Both had USB keys with TrueCrypt, and each was\nhanded €2,000, in €500 bills, Mr. Hame said. Both had the same general agenda\n— to hit a soft target in Europe — but they were instructed to take separate\npaths, with Mr. Hame returning to France while the second recruit was headed\nto Spain.But Mr. Hame’s comrade was picked up after he flew to Spain, and\nunder interrogation, he divulged Mr. Hame’s plan as well. After being\nnotified, the French police tracked Mr. Hame to his mother’s apartment in\nParis. Behind a couch, they found his USB stick from the Islamic State, and in\nhis bag a piece of paper showing his login credentials for TrueCrypt. They\narrested and began interrogating him last August, almost three months to the\nday before the worst terrorist attack in French history.In many ways, it was\nanother clear failure for the Islamic State’s operational security. Mr. Hame\nagreed to cooperate with investigators, and confirmed that the group was bent\non attacking in Europe and was already interested in picking out a concert\nhall to strike.Yet many aspects of the group’s security protocol were working.\nIn the end, Mr. Hame had few specifics he could share with the authorities. He\ndid not know the names or even the nationalities of the other operatives he\nhad met; they had been introduced to him only by their aliases.Two of Mr.\nAbaaoud’s other small plots around the same time did not go any better. Sid\nAhmed Ghlam was ordered by Mr. Abaaoud to open fire on a church in Villejuif,\nsouth of Paris, according to the report by France’s antiterrorism police.\nInstead, he shot himself in the leg. Ayoub El Khazzani, the other attacker\nsent by Mr. Abaaoud, was tackled by passengers after his weapon jammed while\nhe tried to open fire inside a high-speed Thalys train last August, officials\nsaid.Though they failed, the thwarted plots kept counterterrorism officials\nstretched thin in the months before the November attacks in Paris.“It served\nto put all of our agencies on edge,” said France’s chief antiterrorism judge,\nMarc Trévidic, who debriefed Mr. Hame, Mr. Ghlam and Mr. Khazzani before\nretiring last summer. “Just like a smoke screen, it allowed them to calmly\nprepare.”Among the clearest signs of the Islamic State’s growing capacity for\nterrorist attacks is its progress in making and deploying bombs containing\ntriacetone triperoxide, or TATP.  \nThe white explosive powder was found in the suicide belts of the Paris\nattackers and in the suitcases of the Brussels bombers, as well as in two\nother ISIS-led plots in 2014 and 2015.Before ISIS, Al Qaeda repeatedly tried,\nbut mostly failed, to deploy TATP bombs, starting in 2001 when Richard Reid\ntried to destroy an American Airlines flight by sneaking TATP onboard in the\nsole of his shoe. He was thwarted when the fuse failed to ignite.TATP has\nbecome terrorists’ go-to explosive in Europe because the main ingredients,\nacetone and hydrogen peroxide, can be found in common household goods like\nnail polish remover and hair bleach, experts say.But while the building blocks\nare easy to come by, TATP is difficult to make, because the ingredients are\nunstable once combined and can easily detonate if they are mishandled. Over at\nleast two years, Islamic State operatives were working to get it right.The\nthree bombs found in Mr. Boudina’s building near Cannes in 2014 were beverage\ncans filled with the explosive powder and wrapped in black tape, according to\nthe French court filing in the case.Though he had successfully cooked the\nexplosive, Mr. Boudina was still struggling to set it off. He had jammed a\nfilament into a cavity in the body of each can, most likely to use as a crude\nfuse, investigators concluded. However, the online searches he had conducted\non his laptop just before his arrest indicated that he did not know how to\nmake the final component. He searched “how to make a remote detonator,”\n“detonation by cellphone,” and finally “where to buy firecrackers?”By\ncomparison, the team sent from Syria to carry out the Paris assaults in\nNovember had ironed out the final details.Two months before those attacks, the\nman suspected of handling logistics for the assailants, Salah Abdeslam,\nstopped by a fireworks shop northeast of Paris to buy a mechanism used to\ndetonate fireworks from a distance, according to the French prosecutor. The\nFirework Magician shop’s in-house lawyer, Frédéric Zajac, remembered little\nabout the young man with a Belgian accent, except that “unlike other clients,\nhe didn’t ask questions about how it all worked.”Mr. Abdeslam is believed to\nbe the only direct participant in the assaults to have survived, and he was\narrested last week in Belgium after a continentwide manhunt.The attackers he\nhad been helping successfully detonated their suicide belts in seven locations\nin Paris, indicating that the group had mastered both how to mix the compound\nand how to set it off.“To be able to assemble it safely, and to detonate it\nrepeatedly, suggests a more organized effort,” said Michael Marks, a retired\nNaval Criminal Investigative Service special agent who was the post-blast\ninvestigator on the Navy destroyer Cole. “It suggests a network.”That network\nstretched like a web across Europe to at least a dozen other accomplices,\nincluding a cell holed up in an apartment in the Brussels neighborhood of\nSchaerbeek, where two other teams of Islamic State fighters prepared the bombs\ndetonated last week in Brussels Airport and a metro station.The overpowering\nodor that comes with refining and storing TATP was noticed by the building’s\nowner weeks before the bombings, Belgian officials said, but he did not report\nit until after the attacks.While each of the explosive vests used in Paris in\nNovember had about a pound of finished TATP, the bombs used at the departure\nterminal of the airport and inside a subway car in Brussels are estimated to\nhave weighed 30 to 60 pounds each, according to Claude Moniquet, a veteran of\nFrance’s intelligence service who now heads the European Strategic\nIntelligence and Security Center.That marked another level of achievement in\nmaking the explosive: The higher the volume of TATP, the more volatile it\nbecomes.The attacks last week could have been worse: Inside the attackers’\napartment were more of the precursor ingredients used to make the explosive —\nnearly 40 gallons of acetone and eight gallons of hydrogen peroxide — as well\nas a suitcase containing over 30 pounds of ready-to-go TATP, according to the\nBelgian police.The one thing the attackers had not thought of was that the\ntaxi they called to take them to the airport had room for only three\nsuitcases, so they abandoned the fourth upstairs, Mr. Moniquet said.Their taxi\ndriver told the Belgian newspaper DH that the customers had refused to let him\nhelp them load the heavy bags, and that during the drive to the airport, they\nsat in tense silence.The driver could not help but notice a strong odor\nwafting into the taxi from the sealed trunk.\n\n","title":"How ISIS Built the Machinery of Terror Under Europe’s Gaze - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Inside the ISIS terror cell attacking Europe https://t.co/PLhejjO4w2","date":"Sun Apr 03 05:07:38 +0000 2016","favs":55,"id":{"$numberLong":"716492332791689216"},"retweets":33},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21Xdh9O"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013b3"},"content":"OAKLAND, Calif. — Once upon a time, Sadiki Fuller made his living by dressing\nup in a skintight bodysuit. Foam-enhanced muscles formed mountain peaks on his\narms, and he wore a blue mask framed by a lightning bolt that swept toward the\nheavens.Fuller played the role of Thunder, the onetime mascot of the Golden\nState Warriors — a fading and sometimes forgotten piece of franchise lore.A\ntrampoline-bouncing, basketball-dunking, uniform-wearing superhero, Thunder\nwas banished to the mascot junkyard in 2008 when the Oklahoma City Thunder\nwere set to debut. It was a sad bit of nickname confluence that meant the\nmascot had to go. The Warriors never replaced him.Fuller, who was inside the\ncostume when Thunder made his grand entrance in 1997, entertained fans for\nfive seasons before he left to pursue a career in comedy. Playing the role of\nThunder was fun, Fuller said, but not without its challenges. The Warriors\nback then were not the record-breaking deities that they are now. Their\noverall record during his tenure was 97-281.“Steph Curry would have made my\njob so easy,” Fuller said in a recent telephone interview from his home in the\nLos Angeles area. “You know how hard it is to get 18,000 people to scream when\nthey feel like the team is just going to lose again?”Fuller got his start in\nthe business under the tutelage of Jerry Burrell, a former mascot for the\nHouston Rockets. Burrell assembled a squad of costumed trampoline dunkers that\nroamed the country performing shows, and Fuller, who had trained as a gymnast,\njoined the team.“Incredibly gifted,” Burrell said. “He really understands what\nmakes people tick, which is one of the things that makes him great as an\nentertainer.”As a part of its travels, the squad made regular appearances at\nWarriors games. During the 1996-97 season, the Warriors relocated to San Jose\nArena while their facility in Oakland, now known as Oracle Arena, underwent\nrenovations. The team tried to draw new fans — or at least distract the old\nones from the on-court mess — by unveiling a mascot named Berserker, who did\nnot exactly dazzle crowds. It was a brief experiment.“Berserker died after one\nseason,” said Brett Yamaguchi, the Warriors’ director of game\noperations.Fuller, who got to know members of the team’s production crew\nthrough his work with Burrell’s dunk squad, felt that the Bay Area market had\nuntapped mascot potential. The Warriors were planning to rebrand upon moving\nback to Oakland for the 1997-98 season, with a new logo that featured a\nlightning bolt. Soon, Thunder was born. Fuller got the gig.“I was living the\ndream,” Fuller said. “I still can’t believe I got that opportunity.”Fuller\nfelt obliged to help sell people on the team, he said, because the Warriors\nwere not — how to put this mildly? — setting the region ablaze. He recalled\nrunning into the lobby of a bank near the team’s offices — in full costume, no\nless. That alone was a startling sight, and then Fuller opened his mouth and\nsaid, “This is a stickup!”In hindsight, Fuller said, it was not the most\njudicious way to build a connection with the community.“I was overzealous when\nI first got the job,” he said.Nobody making a deposit that day recognized\nThunder as an N.B.A. mascot. Most were under the impression that a less-than-\nsane person in a superhero outfit was attempting to rob the bank until Fuller\nbackflipped out of the lobby while shouting, “Go Warriors!”When Fuller\nreturned to the team’s headquarters, he was met by several members of the\nteam’s front office. They had received word of his marketing ploy.“They were\nlike, ‘Listen, it’s great that you’re doing everything with so much\nenthusiasm, but you can’t run into banks,’ ” Fuller said. “I was young. I\ndidn’t get it.”Fuller was only a few months into the job when Latrell Sprewell\nchoked P.J. Carlesimo, who was then the team’s coach. It was an infamous\nepisode that was, in so many ways, a sign of things to come. Those were lean\nyears for the Warriors, who never won more than 21 games in each of Fuller’s\nfive seasons with the team.“But he took his bag of tricks and became a star\nthere,” Burrell said. “There are still people who are like, ‘My God, Thunder\nwas the best.’ Because there wasn’t anything else going on. The team was that\nbad. But Sadiki came in there and started doing things that they had never\nseen before.”Courtside, Fuller said, he met luminaries like Johnnie Cochran,\nthe famed lawyer, and Roger Craig, the former 49ers running back. Fuller\nrecalled playing a full-court game of one-on-one against Chris Mullin.\nShaquille O’Neal once spent 15 minutes trying to remove Thunder’s mask.“Like,\nman, can’t I have a secret identity?” Fuller said.Thunder was often\nresponsible for the game’s few highlights. He was like an action figure come\nto life. While the Warriors occupied themselves by bricking jump shots,\nThunder spent timeouts soaring for dunks. The aesthetics of the costume itself\nwere a stark departure from industry standards, and fans were receptive.“He\nwas sleek and muscular,” Yamaguchi said. “Up to that point, most teams had\nthese mascots that were fluffy and huggable and kind of clumsy.”There were on-\nthe-job hazards, however. As Fuller put it, “With any superhero, you’re going\nto have some limitations.”Velcro, for example, was dangerous. Any contact with\nthe material was harmful to the structural integrity of the costume.Also,\nFuller wore wraparound sunglasses under his mask, which gave Thunder a sleek,\nbuglike look. The problem was that the lights occasionally dimmed in the\narena, making it tough for Fuller to see. Darkness only increased the degree\nof difficulty on many of his stunts: leaping from the top of backboards,\nriding motorcycles, jumping off trampolines.“We always did an extravagant\nentrance,” Fuller said. “We worked our hardest to do something amazing before\nthe start of each game.”One such installment of amazingness involved Fuller\ndescending from the rafters by rope and harness, except that he got distracted\nand slammed his head against the court.“I got up and went to the team huddle,”\nFuller said, “and all the players were like, ‘You O.K., man?’ ”There were\nother close calls. Thunder was not waterproof. Fuller made an appearance at a\nbirthday party, he said, where a group of children pushed him into a swimming\npool.“I don’t know if you’ve ever had a thin layer of spandex over your face,”\nFuller said, “but when that gets wet, you can’t breathe.”Fuller made dozens of\npublic appearances each season, showing up at school functions and store\nopenings in addition to performing for fans at the team’s 41 home games.\nThunder was unique in that he was allowed to speak. (Most mascots are not.)\nBut things tended to get uncomfortably warm in that suit. Once in a while,\nFuller caught a break.“Maybe it’s a 10-minute thing and you’re just running\nthrough somebody’s office, like, ‘Hiiiiii! It’s a happy birthday telegram from\nthe Warriors!’ ” he said.But the work was usually more strenuous. Fuller\nlaundered his Thunder outerwear regularly.“I mean, Spider-Man did his own\nlaundry, too,” he said.Several others played the role of Thunder for the\nWarriors after Fuller left for his new career in Los Angeles, but the mascot’s\ndays were numbered.Not so long ago, Thunder was actually spotted working in\nChina — a production crew from the Warriors reported that he had fallen in\nlove with a young woman there — so perhaps he was able to sidestep mascot\npurgatory and land a second act overseas.As for the Warriors, the team appears\ndetermined to go mascot-free for now. During all those losing seasons, Thunder\nfilled a vital role. But these days?“The show,” Yamaguchi said, “is on the\ncourt.”\n\n","title":"The Golden State Warriors’ Superhero, Back When They Needed One - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Once upon a time, the Golden State Warriors had a mascot.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013b4"},"content":"Leandro Barbieri, a jazz saxophonist who was a pioneer in Latin jazz and who\nwon a Grammy Award for his music in the film “Last Tango in Paris,” died on\nSaturday. He was 83.His death was confirmed by Jordy Freed, the vice president\nof marketing and communications for the Blue Note Entertainment Group. Mr.\nBarbieri’s wife, Laura, said he died of pneumonia at a New York hospital, The\nAssociated Press reported.“I’m so grateful we had these 20 years together,”\nMs. Barbieri told The Associated Press. She said a public memorial was being\nplanned but details had not been finalized.Mr. Barbieri, who was born on Nov.\n28, 1932, in Argentina, recorded 35 albums between 1967 and 1982. He earned\nthe nickname Gato, which means “the cat,” in the 1950s because of the way he\nscampered between clubs in Buenos Aires with his saxophone to make it to his\nnext gig.“Music was a mystery to Gato, and each time he played was a new\nexperience for him, and he wanted it to be that way for his audience,” Ms.\nBarbieri said. “He was honored for all the years he had a chance to bring his\nmusic all around the world.”A biography of Mr. Barbieri on Blue Note’s website\ndescribed him as “mystical yet fiery, passionately romantic yet supremely\ncool.”Though in poor health, Mr. Barbieri, still sporting his trademark black\nfedora, had been performing monthly at the Blue Note jazz club in New York.\nHis last public performance was on Nov. 23, Mr. Freed said. He started\nperforming there in 1985.“He was a worldly free spirit, a really sweet man,”\nMr. Freed said. “He really was a pioneer. He really helped pave the way for\nLatin jazz.”Last year, Mr. Barbieri received a Latin Grammy lifetime\nachievement award for a career that covered “virtually the entire jazz\nlandscape.” The citation, from the Latin Recording Academy, credited him with\ncreating “a rebellious but highly accessible musical style, combining\ncontemporary jazz with Latin American genres and incorporating elements of\ninstrumental pop.”Mr. Freed said that Mr. Barbieri’s fans — and even those\noutside the jazz world — would most appreciate his work in “Last Tango in\nParis,” which was released in 1972 and starred Marlon Brando and Maria\nSchneider. Mr. Barbieri won a Grammy Award for his work on the film.When the\ndirector, Bernardo Bertolucci, sought music for the steamy movie, he chose Mr.\nBarbieri and his characteristic tenor sax sound.“It was like a marriage\nbetween the film and the music,” Mr. Barbieri said of the soundtrack that made\nhim an international star, in a 1997 interview with The Associated Press.\n“Bernardo told me, ‘I don’t want the music to be too much Hollywood or too\nmuch European, which is more intellectual. I want a median.’”Barbieri said\ntango had a special appeal because it was deeply tied to his Argentine\nsoul.“Always in the tango is tragedy she leaves him, she kills him,” he said.\n“It’s like an opera but it’s called tango.”\n\n","title":"Gato Barbieri, Latin Jazz Trailblazer, Dies at 83 - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Gato Barbieri, Latin Jazz Trailblazer, Dies at 83 https://t.co/o4oetQ7Aiq","date":"Sun Apr 03 04:43:49 +0000 2016","favs":105,"id":{"$numberLong":"716486339269672960"},"retweets":121},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/230GINW"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013b5"},"content":"When Corey Patterson heard about the terrorist attacks in Brussels last week,\nhe had a clear-cut response to people who asked if he was going to cancel a\ncoming trip to Belgium.“That’s exactly what the terrorists want, so absolutely\nnot,” Mr. Patterson, 45, said on Twitter.He’s in the Netherlands now, visiting\na former roommate and his family, and will head to Belgium in a few\ndays.“Anything can happen anywhere at any time,” Mr. Patterson, a Texas\nresident, said through messages on Twitter. “You can’t stop living life, and\nthis world is worth seeing, so I chose to do it.”He’s not alone.“Americans\nespecially seem to be fairly resilient and do not panic and cancel trips,\nunless perhaps they are traveling in the next few days,” Jennifer Michels\nJones, vice president of communications for the American Society of Travel\nAgents, said in an email.After the attacks in Paris last fall, 64 percent of\nthe association’s agents found that their clients did not plan to delay or\ncancel travel to and from or within Europe.The travel alerts issued by the\nState Department also fall far short of advising people to cancel their\nplans.“We’re not saying, ‘Don’t travel,’ especially not to Europe, but we are\nsaying, ‘Be careful if you do,’” said Michelle Bernier-Toth, the managing\ndirector of the federal Office of Overseas Citizens Services.Here are seven\nways to take care when traveling to Europe, or really, anywhere.**1\\. Log\ntravel plans with the State Department. **Enrolling in the Smart Traveler\nEnrollment Program gives the government the ability to send email alerts to a\ntraveler about potential problems, like demonstrations. “And it gives us a\ngeneral idea of how many U.S. citizens might be in a country,” Ms. Bernier-\nToth said.**2\\. Know how to contact the American Embassy.**Embassy information\nis available on the government’s travel website. Use the search box to pull up\ninformation about an individual country. The first pull-down menu lists all\nthe embassy information. Heading to Belgium? The number: 32-2-\n811-4000.“Knowing how to get ahold of us is important,” Ms. Bernier-Toth said.\n“In the event of a major event, we will work as quickly as possible to\nidentify people who need our assistance and do what we can to help.”**3\\. Find\nout how to contact local authorities in case of an emergency.**On the page\nopened in Step 2, each country’s equivalent to “911” is listed, as well.\nBritain’s equivalent is 999. In France, it’s 112. In Belgium, it’s 101 if it\nrequires the police, or 112 for everything else. This information is under the\n“Safety and Security” pull-down menu, though not usually at the top.**4\\.\nThose phone numbers are only useful for working phones.**Your phone plan may\nnot work abroad. Most carriers offer international plans, and they may be\nexpensive. There are alternatives, like renting a phone or buying a SIM card\nlocally. “It’s very useful to have an international SIM card,” Ms. Bernier-\nToth said. Phones may have to be unlocked, which you can ask your carrier to\ndo.But if something does happen, the number of people trying to make phone\ncalls around the same time can overwhelm phone lines. “But often text messages\nwill go through,” Ms. Bernier-Toth said. Social media sites, like Facebook,\nand free messaging services, like WhatsApp or WeChat, are alternatives,\ntoo.**5\\. Be vigilant when in public places and using mass transit. **“I don’t\nthink you can avoid using mass transit, but be smart about that,” Ms. Bernier-\nToth said. “Know the exit strategy.” The same applies to major tourist\nattractions, sporting events, restaurants and other crowded areas.Find travel\nalerts, like the one advising American citizens that terrorist groups continue\nto plan attacks throughout Europe, on the same website mentioned above.**6\\.\nGive a copy of your itinerary to family members or friends.**“We get a lot of\ncalls from people who are worried sick about their family members overseas but\ndon’t have any idea where they are,” Ms. Bernier-Toth noted.**7\\. Understand\nthe differences among travel insurance policies.**Some policies will cover\nmedical expenses. Others won’t. And there are always clauses to worry\nabout.“We recommend travelers ask the travel insurance provider about force\nmajeure clauses and whether or not they are covered,” Mrs. Michels Jones said.\n“These are things in contracts that are unavoidable accidents or chance\noccurrences that cannot be planned.”\n\n","title":"Is Europe Safe for Travelers?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013b6"},"content":"A Brooklyn man charged with manslaughter in the beating death of a transgender\nwoman in Harlem told prosecutors and detectives he had been flirting with her\njust moments before the attack, unaware that she was transgender.In a taped\nconfession played in court on Friday, the man, James Dixon, said he became\nenraged when he heard a friend making fun of him and then realized he was\ntalking to a transgender woman. “I just remember lashing out,” he said.Mr.\nDixon, 25, said that he pushed himself away from the woman, Islan Nettles, and\nstarted to walk away, but that Ms. Nettles shoved him from behind, forcing him\nto trip. He got to his feet quickly, he said, whirled and hit her with his\nright hand, knocking her to the sidewalk, then punched her a second time as\nshe lay on the ground, apparently unconscious. Then, he said, he turned on her\ncompanion, another transgender woman, and said, “You want some too?”The\naccount of the crime that Mr. Dixon gave to prosecutors was played in State\nSupreme Court in Manhattan during a pretrial hearing to determine whether the\nconfession could be used as evidence at his trial, which is scheduled for next\nweek. Justice Daniel P. Conviser ruled that the statements, as well as two\nothers Mr. Dixon made to the police earlier, were admissible.For much of the\nhourlong interview shown on the videotape, Mr. Dixon gave vague and sometimes\ncontradictory answers about how the fight with Ms. Nettles had started and who\nwas present, while two detectives and two prosecutors, clearly skeptical,\npressed him for details.Ms. Nettles, a 21-year-old assistant at a fashion\ncompany, was attacked just after midnight on Aug. 17, 2013, outside a police\nstation at 147th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard. She was walking with\ntwo transgender friends when she encountered Mr. Dixon and a group of at least\nsix other young men, who were walking south on the boulevard, according to\nprosecutors.Ms. Nettles died of head injuries she sustained when her head\nrammed into the pavement as Mr. Dixon hit her, prosecutors say. Battered\nbeyond recognition, she was taken off life support after a week in a coma.The\nkilling of Ms. Nettles incensed transgender people in New York, prompting\nvigils and protests. For many, her death was emblematic of violence against\ntransgender people, who are frequently the targets of beatings.Three days\nafter the assault, Mr. Dixon, of Classon Avenue in Brooklyn, turned himself in\nto the police and confessed, telling a detective he had flown into “a blind\nfury” when he discovered he was talking to a transgender woman. The next\nmorning, he was videotaped repeating the story for prosecutors.His confession\nnotwithstanding, Mr. Dixon was not indicted until March 2015, because some\nwitnesses had identified Paris Wilson, a casual friend of Mr. Dixon’s, as the\nattacker, muddying the investigation. In the end, charges were dropped against\nMr. Wilson.In his confession, Mr. Dixon said he and two friends had been\ndrinking and were walking uptown on Frederick Douglass, headed to a party not\nfar away. Near 148th Street, he said, he met Mr. Wilson and some other young\nmen who were headed south and told him the party had been canceled.Though he\ninitially gave a different account of his encounter with Ms. Nettles, Mr.\nDixon admitted while being questioned by a homicide detective that he had seen\nsome of his friends talking to her and a second transgender woman, who was\nmore heavy set and wore a white top and sandals. He crossed the street and\nbegan chatting with Ms. Nettles, whom he did not realize was transgender. “I\nremember asking her what is her name, where are you from,” he said. “That’s\nhow I roll up.”Then, he said, he heard one of his friends mocking him, saying,\n“That’s a guy,” and he became enraged. “They were clowning me,” he told the\ndetectives.It was not the first time he had been ridiculed, Mr. Dixon said in\nhis videotaped statement. A few days earlier, he had been deeply embarrassed\nwhen two transgender women approached him while he was doing pull-ups on a\nscaffolding at 138th Street and Eighth Avenue. Not realizing they were\ntransgender, he flirted with them, he said, and was teased badly by his\nfriends.Mr. Dixon, who is not charged with a hate crime, denied during his\nconfession he had used slurs when he hit Ms. Nettles, as has been reported. He\nalso declared he bore no hatred for transgender people as a group.“I don’t\ncare what they do,” he said. “I just didn’t want to be fooled.”\n\n","title":"Man’s Confession in Transgender Woman’s Death Is Admissible, Judge Rules - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Man charged in woman's death said he was flirting with her and became enraged when he realized she was transgender https://t.co/2OUnsheNBt","date":"Sun Apr 03 04:22:24 +0000 2016","favs":129,"id":{"$numberLong":"716480948032946176"},"retweets":157},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25Dcqjf"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013b7"},"content":"‘It just seems like a beautiful day in Southern California,” Bryan Caforio\nsaid.It was late January in Porter Ranch, an affluent neighborhood on the\nnorthern fringe of Los Angeles. Caforio and I sat at a Starbucks overlooking\nan oceanic parking lot crowded with shoppers. The air was still, dry, 70\ndegrees. Caforio, a young trial lawyer running for Congress in the state’s\n25th District, gestured at the pink and orange striations of sky above Aliso\nCanyon, its foothills bronze in the falling daylight. “It seems like a\nbeautiful sunset in a wonderful community,” Caforio said, “and we’re sitting\noutside, enjoying a wonderful coffee.”But there were scattered clues that\nsuggested that everything was not so wonderful. Near a trio of news vans\nparked in front of the Starbucks, antenna masts projecting from their roofs, a\ncameraman stared quizzically up at the canyon. Next to the SuperCuts, security\nguards stood outside two nondescript storefronts; stenciled on the windows\nwere the words “Community Resource Center” and, in smaller letters,\n“SoCalGas.” The guards asked for identification and dismissed anyone who tried\nto take a photograph. At the entrance to Bath \u0026amp; Body Works, a device that\nresembled an electronic parking meter was balanced on a tripod; the digital\ndisplay read “BENZENE,” followed by a series of indecipherable ideograms. The\nparking lot held a preponderance of silver Honda Civics bearing the decal of\nthe South Coast Air Quality Management District. Inside the cars, men sat in\nsilence, waiting.Beyond the Ralphs grocery store and the Walmart rose a\nneighborhood of jumbo beige homes with orange clay-­tiled roofs and three-car\ngarages. The lawns were tidily landscaped with hedges of lavender, succulents,\ncactuses and kumquat trees. The neighborhood was a model of early-­1980s\nCalifornia suburban design; until October, it was best known for being the\nlocation where Steven Spielberg shot “E.T.” But now the meandering streets\nwere desolate, apart from the occasional unmarked white van. As you ascended\nthe canyon, reaching gated communities with names like Renaissance, Promenade\nand Highlands, the police presence increased. On Sesnon Boulevard, the\nneighborhood’s northern boundary, an electric billboard propped in the middle\nlane blinked messages: “REPORT CRIME ACTIVITY; L.A.P.D. IN THE AREA; CALL\n911.” Holleigh Bernson Memorial Park was empty aside from three cop cars,\npatrol lights flashing.But the most significant clues were the spindly metal\nstructures spaced along the ridge of the canyon. They resembled antennas or\nconstruction sites or alien glyphs. Until recently, most residents of Porter\nRanch did not pay them much attention.“You look at the hills, you see a few\ntowers,” Caforio said. “But do you really know what they are?” He shook his\nhead. “You try to say, ‘Hey, we’re having an environmental disaster right\nnow!’ But it just looks like a beautiful sunset.”**The first sign **of trouble\ncame on Oct. 25, when the Southern California Gas Company filed a terse report\nwith the California Public Utilities Commission noting that a leak had been\ndetected on Oct. 23 at a well in its Aliso Canyon storage facility. Under\n“Summary,” the report read: “No ignition, no injury. No media.”The local news\nmedia began to take notice, however, when Porter Ranch residents complained of\nsuffocating gas fumes. In response, SoCalGas released a statement on Oct. 28\npointing out that the well was “outdoors at an isolated area of our mountain\nfacility over a mile away from and more than 1,200 feet higher than homes or\npublic areas.” It assured the public that the leak did not present a\nthreat.Timothy O’Connor, the director of the Environmental Defense Fund’s\nCalifornia Oil and Gas Program, had read about the complaints. But he did not\nthink much of them until Nov. 3, when, at a climate-­policy event in downtown\nLos Angeles, he learned from an acquaintance who worked at SoCalGas that the\ncompany was flying in experts from around the country to help plug the leak.\nAt home that night, O’Connor read everything he could about the Aliso Canyon\ngas field. How much gas was stored inside the canyon? How much could leak\nout?The foothills on which Porter Ranch was built, O’Connor learned, once\nbelonged to J.Paul Getty. His Tide Water Associated Oil Company hit crude in\n1938 and did not sell the land until the early 1970s, after it had extracted\nthe last drop. The drained oil field was bought by Pacific Lighting, which\nused it to store natural gas. With a capacity of 84 billion standard cubic\nfeet, the cavity, which lies between 7,100 and 9,400 feet below the surface,\nis one of the country’s largest reservoirs of natural gas (which is composed\nmainly of methane). The facility functions as a kind of gas treasury. When\nprices are low, the company hoards the gas inside the canyon; when they are\nhigh, it releases the gas into pipelines that snake through Los Angeles,\nheating homes, fueling stoves and providing power to solar-­and ­wind-­energy\nfacilities.The 115 wells in Aliso Canyon can be imagined as long straws\ndipping into a vast subterranean sea of methane. The leaking well, SS-25, is a\nsteel tube seven inches in diameter that descends 8,748 feet from the canyon’s\nridge. The well is plainly visible from many of the streets in Porter Ranch.\nFrom the ground, it resembles a derrick, set beside a series of low white\nbuildings. If you look at it through a pair of binoculars, you can make out,\nflying from its highest girder, an American flag.After conducting some basic\ncalculations, O’Connor arrived at a shocking conclusion. Given the pressure\nand quantity of gas stored within, the canyon was like an overinflated\nballoon; a puncture could release in a single day as much gas as 1,785 houses\nwould consume in a year. As it turned out, O’Connor was mistaken — the figure\nended up being much higher than that — but he included it in an urgent letter\nhe sent the next day, on Nov. 4, to the governor’s senior energy adviser and\nmembers of the California Air Resources Board, Public Utilities Commission,\nEnergy Commission and Department of Conservation. He demanded that the\nagencies conduct “an accurate and public accounting of the gas lost at Aliso\nCanyon.”That evening, O’Connor attended a hearing at the Community School in\nPorter Ranch with about 100 panicked residents. They complained that the gas\nfumes were causing headaches, respiratory problems, nosebleeds and vomiting.\nThe next morning, having yet to receive a response to his letter, O’Connor\nrealized that he didn’t have to wait for the state to take action. He could\ncall Stephen Conley.Conley is an atmospheric scientist at the University of\nCalifornia, Davis, and the founder of Scientific Aviation. He flies a\nsingle-­engine Mooney TLS that looks like something Cary Grant might have\nflown in “Only Angels Have Wings.” Public agencies, scientists and nonprofit\norganizations that study the climate hire Conley to loop over oil and gas\nfields at low altitudes, measuring methane concentrations with a device called\na Picarro analyzer. At 10:30 a.m. on Nov. 5, Conley took off from Lincoln\nRegional Airport, just north of Sacramento. As a courtesy, O’Connor notified\nJill Tracy, the director of environmental services at SoCalGas. He began to\nreceive a flurry of text messages from executives at SoCalGas. They said the\nflight was unsafe and inappropriate. But SoCalGas was not concerned for the\nsafety of the pilot, as O’Connor first assumed. The executives claimed to be\nconcerned for the workers on the ground, who were operating cranes and drills\nin an effort to plug the leak. The workers, Tracy wrote, might become\ndistracted by the sight of an airplane overhead, with catastrophic\nconsequences.O’Connor found this reasoning odd, because Porter Ranch lies in\nthe flight path of Van Nuys Airport. Nearly 600 flights take off or land there\nevery day. He proposed that the airplane keep one mile away from the well\nsite. SoCalGas executives said they still considered this unsafe. O’Connor\nasked whether there was a safe distance from the well at which the airplane\ncould fly. The company said there was not. Conley was forced to turn back.Two\ndays later, though, Conley was back in the air, this time on assignment for\nthe California Energy Commission. Over the course of the next four months,\nConley flew 15 flights over the site. On his first flight, Conley’s Picarro\nanalyzer registered 50 parts per million. The normal concentration of methane\nin the atmosphere is two parts per million. Conley thought something was wrong\nwith the instrument. But a backup analyzer gave the same reading. He recalled,\n“That’s when I said, Oh, my God, this is real.”**What is real **to a climate\nscientist is abstract to the rest of us. The study of the climate is a study\nof invisible gases. In order to translate findings to a public lacking a basic\nunderstanding of atmospheric chemistry, climatologists must resort to metaphor\nand allegory. They must become writers, publicists, politicians. This doesn’t\nalways come easily. The leak at Aliso Canyon, Conley discovered, was the\nlargest methane leak in the country’s history. But what did that mean?You\ncould begin by comparing emissions from the gas leak at Aliso Canyon with\nother pollution sites. Conley had logged about 1,500 hours of flight time over\noil and gas fields, moonscapes like the Barnett and Eagle Ford Shales in\nTexas, the Julesburg Basin in Colorado and the Bakken Formation in North\nDakota. The highest methane-emission rate he had ever recorded was three\nmetric tons per hour. The methane was leaking from Aliso Canyon at a rate of\n44 metric tons per hour. By Thanksgiving, it had increased to 58 metric tons\nper hour. That is double the rate of methane emissions in the entire Los\nAngeles Basin. This fact takes some effort to absorb. It means that the steel\nstraw seven inches in diameter plugged into Aliso Canyon was by itself\nproducing twice the emissions of every power plant, oil and gas facility,\nairport, smoke stack and tailpipe in all of greater Los Angeles combined.In a\npaper published in the February issue of Science, Conley and his co-­authors\nestimate that 97,100 metric tons of methane escaped the Aliso Canyon well in\ntotal. Over a 20-year period, methane is estimated to have a warming effect on\nearth’s atmosphere 84 times that of carbon dioxide. By that metric, the Aliso\nCanyon leak produced the same amount of global warming as 1,735,404 cars in a\nfull year. During the four months the leak lasted — 25 days longer than the BP\noil spill in the Gulf of Mexico — the leak contributed roughly the same amount\nof warming as the greenhouse-­gas emissions produced by the entire country of\nLebanon. If well SS-25 were a nation-­state, it would have contributed to\nglobal climate change at a rate exceeding that of Senegal, Laos, Lithuania,\nEstonia, Zimbabwe, Albania, Brunei, Slovenia, Nicaragua, Panama, Jamaica,\nLatvia, Georgia, Guinea, Equatorial Guinea, Costa Rica, Honduras, Tajikistan,\nArmenia and Iceland. SS-25 would rank just behind Mali.These facts, despite\ntheir world historical significance, still failed to make much of an\nimpression locally and nationally, let alone internationally. What was one\nmore airborne toxic event at a time when the global climate was itself an\nairborne toxic event? The World Health Organization has called climate change\nthe greatest global health threat of the 21st century, an opinion shared by\nthe United Nations, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National\nInstitutes for Health, among others. By 2030, increased rates of heat stress,\ninfectious-­disease transmission and malnutrition caused by climate change are\nexpected to cause an additional 250,000 deaths a year. Yet as gargantuan as\nthe Aliso Canyon emissions might be, their influence on the climate would have\nno immediate or direct effect on the lives of the residents of Porter Ranch.\nResidents were as concerned about the leak’s contribution to atmospheric\nwarming in the years and centuries to come as everyone else on the planet —\nwhich is to say, not especially. We are already immersed in leaking invisible\ngases with largely invisible effects too overwhelming to control. What\ndifference was another Lebanon’s worth of emissions?**The residents of\n**Porter Ranch were very concerned, however, about what the inhalation of the\ngas might do to their brains and their lungs. Some residents found the smell\nof gas so overwhelming that they sealed their windows and doors and refused to\ngo outside. Others could not smell the gas and experienced no symptoms.\nSometimes those with severe symptoms and those without lived in the same\nhousehold. In the absence of reliable information from SoCalGas or state\nagencies, the residents of Porter Ranch underwent their own transformation:\nThey became amateur scientists, epidemiologists, sociologists, political\ntheorists. They began to develop their own hypotheses.“Yellow spots,” Charles\nChow said, “are coming out of the atmosphere.”I met Chow, a 76-year-old\nretiree with mirthful eyes and springy joints, in his driveway in late\nJanuary. He was installing new shocks on his 1992 burgundy Cadillac Brougham\nElegante. Beside the Cadillac was a 1986 Silver Spirit Rolls-­Royce. In the\nstreet, which is called Thunderbird Avenue, there was a 2002 Black\nThunderbird. Chow pointed out the spots. They were about the size and color of\na yellow split pea. They had appeared on the windshields of his cars, on the\nCadillac’s vinyl roof, on the canyon-­facing windows of his home.Chow first\nbecame concerned about the Aliso Canyon leak in October, when Chaka Khan, his\nChihuahua-­miniature pinscher, began having severe respiratory problems. His\nwife, Liz, who is 73, began suffering chronic headaches, eye irritation and a\nsore throat. Her doctor said there was nothing he could prescribe her. The\nonly thing she could do, he said, was to leave Porter Ranch. Most of their\nneighbors fled before Thanksgiving. On their block alone, Chow estimates that\n15 households, mostly retirees, relocated. Since then, the Chows have driven\nfour times a month to a vacation rental they share on the Baja Peninsula, 60\nmiles south of the border, “just to get out of the atmosphere,” Chow said. In\nthe Mexican air, Liz’s symptoms vanished.Chow was soon joined in his driveway\nby Rick Goode, a neighbor of 25 years with a slender build and a birdlike\ngait. Goode wanted Chow’s advice about legal representation: About two dozen\nplaintiff’s firms had descended on Porter Ranch since October, competing to\nsign as many clients as possible. What did Chow think of Robert Kennedy’s\nfirm? Or Weitz \u0026amp; Luxenberg, which had sent Erin Brockovich to solicit\nclients? The previous week, Brockovich told reporters that she “started\nfeeling kind of dizzy” within 10 minutes of arriving in Porter Ranch. Chow\nruled her out.“You don’t get sick that fast,” he said.“I’ve been having\nterrible headaches,” Goode said. “Have you?”“My wife has headaches every day,\nsore throats,” Chow said. “I don’t. We both live in the same house. Everybody\nis different.”Liz returned from a doctor’s appointment. She removed her\nsunglasses to reveal a new cyst on her eyelid. She searched for a word to\ndescribe her general condition since October. “A malaise,” she said\nfinally.Barbara Weiler, 64, who was walking her dog very slowly several blocks\naway, first experienced the malaise in gym class. “You felt like you were\nlazy,” she said. “It was obvious when we were using the resistance bands. We\nfelt like we didn’t want to work as much as we normally would.”Paula Vasquez\nfound the smell of gas so strong in late October that she was certain there\nwas a leak inside her house. She hasn’t opened a window since. She and her\nfamily — she lives with her husband, their 33-year-old daughter and their 13\n-year-old grandson — have experienced bloody noses, blurred vision and nasal\ncongestion. But Vasquez has also noticed other signs. She pointed to fruit\ntrees in her neighbors’ backyard. “I see them picking lemons,” she said. “I\ndon’t say anything, but I’m concerned for them. Is there gas in the fruit?”She\nshowed me photographs she made her grandson take on her cellphone while she\nwas driving home on the Ronald Reagan Freeway. In the sky above Porter Ranch,\na heavy funnel of clouds was lit neon orange.“It looks like a big atomic\ncloud,” she said. Vasquez had a warm, cheerful manner; horror did not come\nnaturally to her. “Creepy, huh? But I don’t know anything about science.”**We\nare a show-me** species, wired to look for visible evidence of invisible harm.\nThat impulse can lead a person to blame global warming for a hot day in\nFebruary or, conversely, make a climate-­change denialist find vindication in\na snowstorm. But the world’s largest natural-­gas leak has no known effects on\nclouds or lemons. (It may, however, create yellow dots. Michael Jerrett, the\ndirector of the Center for Occupational and Environmental Health at U.C.L.A.,\nexplained that the dots are most likely a residue of the petroleum-­laced\nslurry used to plug the leak.) The most dangerous threats to our species are\nprecisely those that are most difficult to visualize: long-term,\nslow-­to-­emerge, amorphous. These threats include not only warming\ntemperatures but also mutating viruses and political corruption and tend to be\ninvisible, dimensionless and pervasive, like death. Like natural gas.While the\nyellow dots were coming out of the atmosphere and staining the vinyl roof of\nCharles Chow’s Brougham Elegante, the planet was enduring the warmest January\non record. It was the fourth consecutive month in which global temperatures\nbeat historical averages by more than one degree Celsius, another novelty.\nThis news, when publicized at all, tended to be accompanied by NASA’s map of\nthe world, overlaid muddily with orange and red splotches denoting temperature\nincreases; otherwise there appeared stock photographs of sunbathers on beaches\nor icicles melting. Then came February, the warmest month in recorded history.\nThe threat to human civilization is advancing faster than ever before — the\nclimate is warming faster than at any time in the last 65 million years — but\nall we can see are sunbathers and melting icicles.All that the residents in\nPorter Ranch could see during those months of yawning uncertainty were empty\nstreets and mysterious white vans. They were desperate for answers: Was the\ngas making them sick? How could they protect themselves? Who would be held\nresponsible? The personal-­injury lawyers were well prepared. They offered\nclarity, assurance, optimism. They could predict, with confidence, the future\n— a profitable future for the residents of Porter Ranch. Since November, the\nfirms had been holding weekly informational meetings at local churches and\nhotels. At each session, lawyers answered questions from the community, often\nfor several hours at a time, and circulated client forms.Rick Goode and the\nChows attended one such meeting in late January, two days after their driveway\nconversation on Thunderbird Avenue. It was hosted by R.Rex Parris at the\nHilton in Woodland Hills, about 10 miles south of Porter Ranch. R.Rex Parris\nbelongs to a consortium of law firms that on Dec. 2 filed the first\nclass-­action complaint against SoCalGas and its parent company, Sempra\nEnergy, the nation’s largest natural-­gas utility, on behalf of thousands of\nPorter Ranch residents. The group’s news release anticipated that the leak\nwould end up costing Sempra shareholders “well over $1 billion.” On this\nmorning, about 20 community members sat at conference tables, grazing on the\nfree coffee, doughnuts and bagels. A young lawyer, who seemed to have consumed\na large quantity of the coffee, stood at the front of the room, delivering her\nsales pitch.“Anything SoCal tells you,” she said, “don’t listen to it.\nEverything they say means nothing.”She advised the residents to keep daily\njournals. They were to note each occurrence of a physical symptom or a gas\nsmell and list all expenses incurred by relocation or illness. Someone asked\nwhether he could qualify as a plaintiff even if he lived 10 miles from Aliso\nCanyon.“Nothing’s been established yet,” the lawyer said. “I’ve heard between\nfive and 10 miles. But we don’t have the data yet.”“They claim it started on\nOct. 23,” one older woman said. “But in April, my dog, a boxer, died within\ntwo weeks. I know it was the gas.”“It was earlier than Oct. 23,” the lawyer\nsaid. “I just don’t know when. We want it to be as early as possible, so we\ncan get much more money for everyone.”The residents nodded in approval.The\nlawyer explained that about 30 attorneys were assigned to the case. The firms\nwould receive as their fee 30 percent of any payouts. “We’re predicting a\nsettlement,” she said.A Russian man who resembled Gérard Depardieu exclaimed,\n“I escaped Chernobyl for this!”The man, Igor Volochkov, later told me that in\n1986 he moved from Kiev, 60 miles south of Chernobyl, to Los Angeles when his\nwife was pregnant with their son. “We ran away to save our lives and the lives\nof our children.”Volochkov said he knew something was wrong in October, when\nhis parrot, Bon, dropped dead. He bought a new parrot and a parakeet, Gosha\nand Margosha, but they died within a month. The same thing happened in Kiev,\nwhen, he said, nuclear radiation from Chernobyl killed his parakeet,\nPetruschka. Volochkov said his son had asked why they moved from one Chernobyl\nto another Chernobyl.“Maybe,” Volochkov replied, “our destiny is to fight\nagainst Chernobyls.”**In mid-­november, **nearly a month into the leak, the\nLos Angeles County Department of Public Health ordered SoCalGas to pay for new\nhousing for anyone affected by the gas odors. Nearly 6,000 households, about\nhalf of Porter Ranch’s population, accepted the offer, moving to hotels,\napartments and houses in surrounding neighborhoods. Those who did not relocate\nimmediately struggled to find available short-term rental properties, but\nothers took advantage of the gas company’s largess. Charles Chow said he knew\na family paying $10,000 in monthly rent. “People are gouging the gas company,”\nhe said. “I don’t believe in unfair practice. I was a businessman. I think\nfair is fair. All I might take is reimbursement for money I’ve had to pay the\nvet for Chaka Khan.”Jerry McCormack, another neighbor of the Chows, has rarely\ndetected an odor and has not been sick. “I think there’s a lot of foolishness\ngoing on,” he said. “This is not Fukushima. The rental market has gone crazy.\nEveryone is out to get the gas company. The hysteria is proportional to the\nnumber of lawyers coming to town.” He conceded that his wife, who is\nrecovering from cancer, “can smell it quite well” and is concerned. Her\noncologist advised her to leave.Adam and Mindi Grant, a couple in their mid-\n40s, live a mile from the leak site. Their three children play basketball and\nswim outside. “We’ve legitimately smelled it one day,” Adam said. “We joke\nabout it. Every time someone gets a bloody nose, we say, It’s the gas!”Adam\nteaches world history at a local high school. Mindi is an insurance lawyer. “I\nhave friends with real symptoms,” she said. “Some, maybe not. They’re setting\nup for a money grab. They think there’s big money, deep pockets. But they’re\ngoing to have trouble showing causation.”“Had the smell been horrific,” Adam\nsaid, “we would have relocated. But because it’s not affecting us as a family,\nI’m a little lackadaisical about it.”If the smell of gas makes one person\ndizzy while the neighbor next door can’t smell anything, is one of them lying?\nIf a man does not actually inhale gas but develops headaches and nausea\nanyway, is his suffering any less? Disaster psychiatrists call this phenomenon\n“somatization,” a word that has replaced “hysteria” and “psychosomatic,” terms\nnow considered offensive. “In man-made disasters, the psychological\nconsequences can be very severe and ongoing,” David Eisenman, the director of\nthe Center for Public Health and Disasters at U.C.L.A., told me. “Unexposed\nindividuals can have symptoms similar to people who have exposure.” Fear makes\nyou sick. As it turns out, inhaling poisonous gas causes the same symptoms as\nthe fear of inhaling poisonous gas: headaches, dizziness and nausea.Porter\nRanch residents had reason to be afraid. Nobody could tell them what they were\nbreathing. Methane was gushing from the leak, of this they could be certain,\nbut methane was not what they smelled. Methane is odorless. What they smelled\nwere mercaptans: sulfur compounds that in nature are released in animal feces.\nMercaptans are added to natural-­gas pipelines to provide an olfactory alarm\nin case a leak occurs, the way banks insert exploding dye packs into bags of\ncash. Inhalation of mercaptans can cause headaches, dizziness and nausea, but\nlike methane, they are not currently known to cause significant long-term\nhealth effects. The main health concern about the leak was that other, more\ntoxic gases might also be escaping from the bowels of Aliso Canyon — including\ngases remaining from its previous life as an oil field.Chief among these was\nbenzene, a known carcinogen. Los Angeles air, among the most polluted in the\nnation, tends to have a background concentration of benzene between 0.1 and\n0.5 parts per billion. The World Health Organization has declared that “no\nsafe level of exposure can be recommended.” In November, readings taken by\nSoCalGas near its facility found benzene concentrations fluctuating wildly\nbetween 0.3 p.p.b. and a nightmarish 30.6; readings taken by the company in\nPorter Ranch shot as high as 5.5 p.p.b. Other toxic gases — toluene, xylene,\nhexane and hydrogen sulfides — were also detected at higher-­than-­normal\nconcentrations. The South Coast Air Quality Management District tested the air\nin Porter Ranch during the first two months of the leak, but the monitoring\nwas sporadic and conducted at only a handful of locations. By mid-January,\nafter efforts to depressurize the well had managed to reduce the leakage rate\nconsiderably, a more rigorous study by Michael Jerrett of U.C.L.A. found that\nthe air in Porter Ranch was in fact unusually clean — most likely because of\nthe absence of so many residents and their cars.California health officials\nbelieve that there will be no long-term health effects from the leak.\n“Increased cancer risk is very small,” said Dr. Melanie Marty, the acting\ndeputy director for scientific affairs for California’s Office of\nEnvironmental Health Hazard Assessment. “Much smaller than routine risks we\nexperience every day.” But Jerrett suspects that during the first six weeks of\nthe leak, when the gas escaped at a much higher rate, conditions might have\nbeen dangerous, particularly for children and older residents. On March 10,\nfollowing complaints from relocated residents who suffered nosebleeds and skin\nrashes after moving back home, Jerrett took dust samples at seven houses in\nPorter Ranch. Two contained benzene and hexane, a finding that Jerrett found\n“concerning.”The actual composition of the gas was only the beginning of what\nthe residents of Porter Ranch did not know about the invisible fumes seeping\nfrom Aliso Canyon. They did not know how far the gas was drifting or in what\nquantities. It seemed that the smell was stronger the higher you went up the\nmountain and stronger at dusk and dawn, but there was little data to support\nthis. There was also the mystery of the complex local wind patterns, which\nresemble those of no other part of the Los Angeles Basin and change direction\ncapriciously.No one even knew what had caused the leak in the first place,\nthough a broken safety valve, removed by SoCalGas in 1979 and never replaced,\nreceived some blame. In 2012, President Obama signed a pipeline-­safety bill\nthat should have prevented a leak of this kind. “We have the law, but no one\nis complying,” said Mel Reiter, the editor of The Valley Voice, a monthly\nnewspaper that may be the only local business to profit from the leak: More\nplaintiffs’ law firms sought full-page ads than it has pages. “There are 115\nactive wells, and more than two-thirds were built before 1980,” Reiter said.\n“If one is leaking, what are the odds that 30 more are, or will\nsoon?”Regulations are in place, but nobody knows who can enforce them. When\nMatt Pakucko, a lead plaintiff in the class-­action lawsuit, first smelled the\nleak on Oct. 24, he called SoCalGas. He said he was told that the company was\nmerely “releasing gas into the air,” which was “something that they do\nperiodically,” and that there wasn’t a leak. He knew that the South Coast Air\nQuality Management District was responsible for investigating air-­quality\ncomplaints. But SoCalGas, a private utility, did not fall under the regulatory\noversight of any single agency. Besides the Air Quality Management District,\nagencies responsible for responding to the leak included the State Energy\nCommission; the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health; the Air\nResources Board; the Public Utilities Commission; the Division of Occupational\nSafety and Health; the Department of Conservation’s Division of Oil, Gas and\nGeothermal Resources; the Environmental Protection Agency; the Office of\nEnvironmental Health Hazard Assessment; the County Fire Department; and the\nGovernor’s Office of Emergency Services. In January, the Los Angeles County\nBoard of Supervisors called for the creation of yet another regulatory\n“structure,” to oversee gas-­storage facilities.For most Porter Ranch\nresidents, all this confusion added up to a single fact: An invisible gas was\nthreatening their lives. “We don’t know what methane is,” said Sam\nKustanovich, a Belarussian pawnbroker who had the misfortune of buying his\nhouse two months before the leak was detected. “Nobody knows. It could mean\nexplosions. Me, I’m afraid of explosions.”**The global climate,** even in\ndrought-­stricken Southern California, is not an especially consequential\ncampaign issue. A menacing disaster that causes mass vomiting and mass\nnosebleeds in a wealthy, vote-rich community, however, is a candidate’s dream.\nIn this election season, the procession of scientists and lawyers heading to\nPorter Ranch has been trailed by a caravan of Californian politicians. None\nhave come out in favor of mass nosebleeds. Though the 25th Congressional\nDistrict reaches only its pinkie toe into Porter Ranch, Bryan Caforio, a\nDemocrat, has made the leak a central issue of the election, which promises to\nbe one of few closely contested races in the House. The Republican incumbent,\nSteve Knight, who has received campaign donations from Sempra Energy, said in\nDecember that he was confident that SoCalGas was “working on this as\ndiligently as they can” but more recently called for a congressional hearing\non the matter and introduced safety regulations for natural-­gas storage. Even\na Los Angeles County supervisor, Michael Antonovich, a Republican who has\nvoted consistently against regulation efforts, has loudly proclaimed his\ndetermination to hold SoCalGas responsible.“We’re all kind of feeding on it in\na weird way,” said Henry Stern, a Democrat who is running for State Senate in\nthe local district. He previously served as senior counsel on energy and\nenvironmental policy for the district’s current senator, Fran Pavley, a\nDemocrat who cannot run again because of term limits. “How often are there\nclimate disasters in suburbia?”Stern has been struck at community meetings by\nthe comments of local residents, many of them self-­identifying conservatives,\nwho have begun to question the wisdom of relying on fossil fuels. “Climate\nchange is not a real thing for most of these people,” Stern said. “But you\nchange your mind quick when your kids are puking.”The only politician who has\nfailed to use the gas leak for political gain is Gov. Jerry Brown. His Office\nof Emergency Services, following protocol, began monitoring the leak in\nOctober and began coordinating the state’s response in mid-­November,\noverseeing the various state agencies responsible for responding to it. On\nDec. 18, Brown, a Democrat, sent a stern letter to the chief executive of\nSoCalGas, urging cooperation and demanding accountability. “Everything that\ncould be done under the authority of the governor was being done,” Mark\nGhilarducci, the director of the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services, told\nme. But Brown did not visit Porter Ranch until January, when he toured the\nSoCalGas facility and met privately with four members of the local\nNeighborhood Council; this was 11 weeks into the leak and nearly a month after\nhe attended the United Nations climate talks in Paris, where he boasted of\nCalifornia’s emissions-­reduction plan, the most ambitious in North America.\nBrown declared a state of emergency in Aliso Canyon on Jan. 6, but for many in\nPorter Ranch, that wasn’t nearly soon enough.“We’re suffering because Jerry\nBrown is so not involved in this,” Matt Pakucko said. “There he was in Paris,\nsaying look how green California is, while 10 years of green stuff is going\ninto the air right now.”Ghilarducci disputes this. “This concept that nothing\nhappened and the governor was not engaged until he issued a state of emergency\non Jan. 6 is just absolutely not correct,” he said. “Let’s face it: We deal\nwith so many emergencies out here. This is not Vermont, this is not Oklahoma.\n... This is a nation-­state.” He continued, “The governor is very confident\nthat he doesn’t need to be on the scene, holding a press conference, to show\nthat he’s doing something.”The governor’s reputation in Porter Ranch was not\nhelped by the revelation that his younger sister, Kathleen Brown, is a paid\nboard member of SoCalGas’s parent company, Sempra Energy. “I’m sure there’s a\nconflict of interest,” Rick Goode said. “My feeling is it’s an ‘I scratch your\nback, and you scratch mine.’ It concerns me.” In 2013 and 2014, Kathleen Brown\nreceived $456,245 in compensation, including stock awards. A partner at the\nfirm of Manatt, Phelps \u0026amp; Phillips, she also has, according to the Public\nAccountability Initiative, a $949,653 stake in the Forestar Group, a real\nestate and natural-resources company, where she is a director and major\nshareholder. Forestar is developing Hidden Creeks Estates, a gated community\nof 188 luxury homes, right next to Porter Ranch, on property abutting\nSempra’s.Kathleen Brown’s office at Manatt referred me to Doug Kline, the\ndirector of corporate communications for Sempra Energy. He would not give a\nspecific comment on Brown’s role, but he did say, “Our board of directors has\nbeen actively engaged and regularly briefed on the Aliso Canyon incident.”\nDeborah Hoffman, Jerry Brown’s deputy press secretary, wrote in a statement\nthat any implication that the state did not exercise “its full regulatory and\noversight authority” was “scurrilous and irresponsible.”**SoCalGas announced**\non Feb. 18 that the well had been sealed. Chris Gilbride, a spokesman for\nSoCalGas, wrote in an email, “Throughout the incident, air samples for benzene\nand other compounds were found to be at or near levels seen in the rest of the\ncounty and below levels of concern.” He continued, “The Los Angeles County\nDepartment of Public Health has consistently reported that no long-term health\neffects are expected due to the leaking well.” In late February, many\nresidents, including Rick Goode and Igor Volochkov, said they still smelled\ngas or still suffered symptoms. “Maybe SS-25 is capped,” said Kyoko Hibino,\nMatt Pakucko’s girlfriend. “But I think there is still something seeping up\nfrom underground. I think other wells are continuing to leak. The smell is\nstill pretty strong. It is out there still.”It is uncertain whether the\nresidents of Porter Ranch will experience health effects in the long term. It\nis certain that the atmosphere will experience long-term effects. But the\neffects will be as indecipherable as a plume of colorless gas leaked into a\nwindswept canyon. How do we make sense of the addition to the atmosphere of\nthousands of tons of invisible gases that will have semi-­invisible effects on\nus and only slightly more visible effects on generations we won’t live to\nsee?“If you compare the Aliso Canyon leak to other leaks,” said Stephen\nConley, the aviator-­scientist, “it’s top dog. It’s a monster. It throws off\nL.A.’s emissions for the year. It’s a significant percentage of California’s\nannual carbon budget. But it’s about 0.002 percent of the global methane\nbudget. It’s not like next year will be warmer because of Aliso Canyon.”This\nis true. It’s not like next year will be warmer because of the car trips that\nPorter Ranch residents make to their temporary rental homes, or the gas they\nuse to cook dinner, or the energy required to heat their swimming pools.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013b9"},"content":"HOUSTON — Renegades, that’s what they were, banding together in opposition and\ncommiseration Saturday night, like enemies slowly realizing that their\ndifferences were outweighed by what they had in common.With Hall of Fame\ncoaches, blue-chip recruits, sizzling brand names and a shared propensity for\nrunning afoul of N.C.A.A. regulations, North Carolina and Syracuse were\nirresistible bedfellows on the stage of the Final Four, college basketball’s\nmarquee event.They were both representatives of the Atlantic Coast Conference,\nand of the products of the N.C.A.A.’s investigative influence, which might be\ndescribed as bittersweet. Last season’s penalties motivated Syracuse, and the\nthreat of sanctions hardened Carolina. So here they were.The Tar Heels, the\nlast No. 1 seed remaining in this N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament,\nprolonged their dominating campaign with a decisive win over the upstart\nOrange, 83-66, at NRG Stadium.The Tar Heels (33-6) will face Villanova on\nMonday in an effort to win their first national title since 2009 and their\nsixth over all. They wore down Syracuse, a No. 10 seed, with a relentless\noffensive attack in which four players scored at least 13 points. It was the\nteam’s fifth straight win by at least 14 points.“Needless to say, we’re\necstatic,” North Carolina Coach Roy Williams said.Syracuse (23-14) excused\nitself from the tournament last year as a self-imposed punishment for\ninfractions the program had committed over the course of nearly a decade. When\nthe N.C.A.A. levied its sanctions last March, they included a nine-game\nsuspension for Coach Jim Boeheim, now in his 40th year.Those games were\ndisappointing for Syracuse — it lost five of them — and torturous for Boeheim.\nHe watched the games from home, screaming at the television.The acrimony with\nwhich he responded to his relatively short respite raised questions about\nwhether Boeheim, 71, might really be ready to retire after the 2017-18 season,\nas he says is his intention. He said last week that he was in good health,\nthanks to Pilates and a new weight-lifting routine. His passion on the\nsidelines has not receded.“I told the players after the game that I’m more\nproud of this team than any I’ve ever coached,” Boeheim said.Retirement\nquestions have also haunted Williams, 65, as his program waits for the end of\nthe N.C.A.A.’s investigation into long-running academic fraud — and waits, and\nwaits, and waits.Williams, for his part, sidestepped questions about the\ninquiry last week but bristled at any suggestion that it had adversely\naffected his health.“I’ve got a head cold right now, a sinus infection, two\nbum knees,” Williams said, “and never felt better in my life than I feel right\nnow.”The Tar Heels opened 0 of 10 from 3-point range, including three early\nmisses by the senior point guard Marcus Paige. But Carolina went small and\nwent on a 9-0 run late in the half. The Tar Heels’ frontcourt of Brice\nJohnson, Kennedy Meeks and Isaiah Hicks combined for 23 points and 11 rebounds\nto help the Tar Heels take a 39-28 lead into halftime.In the locker room,\nWilliams pointed to the stat sheet. He told his team to focus on where it was\nsucceeding.“Inside, we were 17 of 25 in the first half,” Paige said. “Forget\nthe 0 for 10.”The lead grew to 16 within minutes in the second half, but no\none expected the Orange to feel daunted. Few teams had produced a more\nimprobable ascension than Syracuse, the fourth double-digit seed to reach the\nFinal Four.The Orange had demonstrated a knack for comebacks, having rebounded\nfrom double-digit deficits in the two previous games, against Gonzaga and\nVirginia. They were led by Trevor Cooney, the only player in program history\nto appear in two Final Fours.Behind Cooney (22 points), Syracuse trimmed the\nlead to 9 with 8 minutes 44 seconds remaining. But while the Orange tried to\nforce the tempo, they had to contend with Carolina’s ability on the open\nfloor, and on the glass, where the Tar Heels outrebounded them, 43-31.“They’re\njust too big and strong and good,” Boeheim said. “They’ve got a great\nbasketball team.”With six minutes left, the Orange went into their press,\nwhich had worked wonders against Virginia. But this was an A.C.C. opponent who\ncould handle it.“I was proud of the way our guys listened to our scouting\nreports and did the things on the court,” Williams said.The two coaches met in\nthe national title game 13 years ago, while Williams was at Kansas. Carmelo\nAnthony led the Orange past the Jayhawks then, handing Boeheim his first\nchampionship. But he had a word with Williams before he could celebrate:\n“You’re going to get one, too.”Indeed, Williams would eventually win two\ntitles with the Tar Heels, in 2005 and 2009. But they had yet to meet again in\nthe N.C.A.A. tournament, until Saturday. And Williams got his revenge.\n\n","title":"North Carolina Tops Syracuse to Vie for Its Sixth Title - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"North Carolina 83, Syracuse 66: North Carolina Tops Syracuse to Make Sixth Trip to Title Game https://t.co/ZrwFScHiGR","date":"Sun Apr 03 03:11:46 +0000 2016","favs":132,"id":{"$numberLong":"716463174078308352"},"retweets":74},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/220D2G3"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013ba"},"content":"The Black Panther may not be the mightiest superhero on the planet, but he’s\ncertainly among the coolest. Created in 1966, he was the first black superhero\nin mainstream comics. While his cape-wearing peers spend their off hours\nslogging away at mundane day jobs — reporter at a major metropolitan\nnewspaper, say — the Panther is a king, the sovereign ruler of Wakanda, the\nfictional, technologically advanced African nation. And then there’s his\ncostume: skintight and jet black from head to toe. His former wife, Ororo\nMunroe (Storm of the X-Men), can summon hurricanes.Even so, the Panther has\nnever enjoyed the popularity of many of his superpowered colleagues. That\nlooks to change, however, thanks to a confluence of events that begin with the\nmuch-anticipated release, on Wednesday, April 6, of the new Marvel comic book\nseries “Black Panther.”Most comics don’t generate that much buzz, but then\nagain, most comics aren’t written by Ta-Nehisi Coates, a national\ncorrespondent for The Atlantic and the best-selling author of “Between the\nWorld and Me,” which won the National Book Award last year. One of the most\ncelebrated authors about race in America writing about a black superhero who\nhas pummeled Captain America and members of the Ku Klux Klan? The collective\nresponse from fans of comics and Mr. Coates alike: I’d read that.The book\narrives during the 50th anniversary of the Black Panther, who first appeared\nin issue No. 52 of the Fantastic Four (and yes, he beat them up, too). Next\nmonth, the superhero will make his big-screen debut in Marvel’s “Captain\nAmerica: Civil War,” with Chadwick Boseman (“42,” “Get On Up”) as the Wakandan\nroyal. And in 2018, Mr. Boseman will reprise his role in the feature film\n“Black Panther,” to be directed by Ryan Coogler (“Creed”).The Coates/Marvel\ncollaboration stems from a 2015 conference hosted by The Atlantic, where the\nauthor interviewed the Marvel editor Sana Amanat in a seminar titled “What if\nCaptain America Were Muslim and Female?” Soon after, another Marvel editor,\nTom Brevoort, asked Mr. Coates if there were any characters that he might like\nto write for them. A lifelong fan of Spider-Man and the X-Men, Mr. Coates sent\nthem some favorites. “Black Panther was not on my list,” he said with a\nlaugh.But when he learned that Marvel was looking to feature the character in\nhis own book once again (his last one ended in 2012), Mr. Coates was\nimmediately intrigued. When Stan Lee and Jack Kirby first dreamed up the Black\nPanther for Marvel, he was at the top of his game. Descended from a long line\nof kings, the Panther, a.k.a. T’Challa, had protected his country from\neveryone from neighboring tribes to alien shape-shifters. In recent times,\nhowever, Wakanda had taken it on the chin — flooded by Namor the Sub-Mariner\nand ravaged by a team of supervillains.When Mr. Coates’s book opens, this\nlatest version of the Panther is still reeling from these defeats. “As we get\ndeeper into the book, there’s this whole question: Is T’Challa actually a good\nking?,” Mr. Coates said, speaking by telephone from his home in Paris.\nThroughout his history, the author noted, the Panther has spent much more time\nhanging out with guys like Iron Man and Captain America than handling affairs\nof state. “I’m not sure he actually likes being king,” Mr. Coates said. “This\ndude is showing up in New York all the time. It’s like, he always had\nsomething else to do besides being king.”“And there’s a bigger question,” Mr.\nCoates continued. “Wakanda’s the most advanced country in the world, with a\nreally educated population. Why would they even accept a monarchy?”Although\nrace is an issue in the comic — “race is always there,” Mr. Coates said — it\nwon’t be at the forefront early on. “The book is probably much more concerned\nwith gender than it is with race,” he said. In the first issue, Mr. Coates\ncreated a plotline about the Dora Milaje, an elite, all-female cadre of\npersonal bodyguards who first appeared in 1998. They were enlisted to protect\nthe king and serve as “wives in training.”“I always thought there was\nsomething creepy about it,” he said. “Women who were taken from various tribes\nwho _may_ become the Panther’s wives? They don’t actually have sex with him,\nthey’re just scantily clad and are always just sort of around him? It defied\nall logic of what I knew about men, of what a man would be like in an absolute\nmonarchy.” His first impulse, he said, was to eliminate the Dora Milaje\naltogether. But instead of cutting them out, Mr. Coates positions them as\nperhaps the embattled Wakanda’s last, best hope for salvation.Illustrating the\nbook is the longtime comic artist Brian Stelfreeze, who was offered the job in\nSeptember. Someone really good was going to write the series, he recalled\nbeing told, but he wouldn’t learn who until he signed on. “When they dropped\nthe name on me,” Mr. Stelfreeze said, “it blew my brains out.”Even after\ntaking the job, Mr. Stelfreeze wasn’t sure what to expect from Mr. Coates.\nWould he be aloof? Was he just going to phone it in? Instead of handling it as\nan amusing side gig, Mr. Coates hit Mr. Stelfreeze with questions and notes,\nand notes on notes. “I probably communicate with him more than any other\nwriter I’ve ever worked with,” Mr. Stelfreeze said. “He gives me comments on\nevery page.”According to Jonathan Hickman, the most recent author of the\nPanther’s adventures, “the thing that people should understand about Ta-Nehisi\nis that he’s a comic-book superfan. He knows his stuff.”The film director and\nproducer Reginald Hudlin (“House Party,” “Django Unchained”) wrote a series of\nBlack Panther comics starting in 2005, continuing even while serving as the\nBET network’s president of entertainment. He said he was “absolutely looking\nforward” to Mr. Coates’s version. “I love when people like that go into\ncomics. It’s like, what, you love this too?”As for the film treatments, Mr.\nBoseman, the actor, has to contend with creating a character within the\nintricate confines of the so-called Marvel Cinematic Universe. “There are a\nlot of moving parts here,” he acknowledged. “You have to constantly be aware\nof how it all fits together, not just for this movie but for the ones to\ncome.”And then there’s the challenge of playing a leader of a country that\ndoesn’t actually exist. Wakanda is “the Mutapa empire of 15th-century\nZimbabwe,” he said in an email interview. “Wakanda is the stargazing kingdom\nof the Dogon. There are many things you can fuse together here, many rulers\nand warriors throughout world history that your imagination can draw from at\nany given moment.”Perhaps not surprisingly in a world dominated by superhero\nmovies, Marvel’s editor in chief, Axel Alonso, uses film terms to describe the\ncomic book. “This is grand entertainment, wide-screen action,” he said. “But\nit goes without saying that some of the themes that Ta-Nehisi’s going to draw\nupon will be familiar to anyone who has read his prose.”Of course, comics\naren’t the same as essays — as Mr. Coates will be the first to tell you. The\nbiggest rule in superhero stories? “People need to hit each other,” he said.\n\n","title":"Ta-Nehisi Coates Helps a New Panther Leave Its Print - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"He may not be the mightiest superhero on the planet, but he’s certainly among the coolest https://t.co/0tQBTmBIfP https://t.co/HKXR4B8hBr","date":"Sun Apr 03 03:07:19 +0000 2016","favs":463,"id":{"$numberLong":"716462054698147841"},"retweets":207},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25BiQiH"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013bb"},"content":"The most advanced recycling operations in the world divert 75 percent or more\nof community waste away from landfills. In their efforts to achieve 100\npercent recycling, or so-called Zero Waste, three products have proved\nparticularly stubborn:The trouble is twofold: Diapers tend to be made of\ncomposite materials, including more than one type of plastic, and there is, of\ncourse, the organic waste.Gary Liss, a recycling consultant in Northern\nCalifornia who sits on the board of several nonprofit recycling groups,\nincluding Zero Waste USA, said he knew of one model for recycling diapers,\nstill in the trial stage in Santa Clarita, Calif., that involves separate\ncurbside pickup for used diapers and then the pulling apart and cleaning of\nthe constituent parts. But it’s expensive, Mr. Liss said, and economics are a\nbig part of any recycling equation.One way to pay for an approach like this\nwould be for diaper manufacturers to include in the diaper’s sales price the\ncost of picking up used diapers and peeling them apart. But that is unlikely\nto happen anytime soon.Mr. Liss said the diaper problem might get worse before\nit gets better. The reason: baby boomers. “It’s going to be an increasing\namount of material as we use adult diapers,” he said. “We’re all headed that\nway.”They are inexpensive and great for lugging light loads. But they are a\nnightmare for recycling plants, because they are so diaphanous that they float\nand cling and wrap and gum up multimillion-dollar machinery.They’re such a\nproblem at Recology, an advanced recycling operation in San Francisco, that it\nused to shut down twice a day so that workers with box knives could cut the\nplastic bags out of the spinning discs that help separate paper from cans and\nbottles.In 2012, San Francisco banned plastic bags at retail stores, but they\nstill show up at the recycling plant and force workers to do regular cleanings\n— “like clearing your lungs,” said Robert Reed, Recology’s spokesman.A growing\nnumber of cities require retailers to charge for bags at checkout,\ndiscouraging their use. And Patty Moore, president of Moore Recycling\nAssociates, in Sonoma, Calif., which does recycling consulting and research,\nsays there are roughly 18,000 plastic-bag drop-off sites in the United States,\nmany of them at grocery stores.From there, the bags — and other plastic\n“film,” like the plastic used to wrap toilet paper or paper towel rolls — are\nshipped to recyclers. The material is made into new bags or used for composite\ndecking or other plastic products. (Bags are not alone among the plastic\nproducts that present recycling challenges; packing foam peanuts, for example,\nare also problematic.)They are a perfect example of composites, a vexing\ncategory for recyclers that includes a wide range of items, like furniture or\nconsumer packaging that binds different materials together, such as plastics\nand metal and paper fibers. See, too: diapers. (The juice-box industry says a\ntypical nonrefrigerated carton, as it’s called, includes 74 percent paper, 22\npercent polyethylene and 4 percent aluminum.)Those layers help preserve\ndrinks, but also make the boxes extremely difficult to pull apart.And to\nrecycle, you must first sort. “It’s like separating an egg yolk from an egg,”\nMr. Liss said of the composites problem. “It’s much easier to do before you\nstir it up.”One possible solution is to create packaging that allows the\nmaterials to be more easily separated. Mr. Liss said an industry recycling\ngroup, The Carton Council, had been created to address the problem by\ndeveloping additional sorting equipment. “The good news is that the industry\nis trying to figure it out,” Mr. Liss said. “They saw the problem, and they’re\nstepping up to address it.”\n\n","title":"Three Headaches for the Recycling Industry - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The most advanced recycling operations in the world struggle with these 3 products https://t.co/LtsCHbzgip https://t.co/KnEIRDhgKe","date":"Sun Apr 03 02:53:06 +0000 2016","favs":275,"id":{"$numberLong":"716458474805309440"},"retweets":243},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PL2Xug"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013bc"},"content":"For almost six decades, it was missing, all 400-plus revealing, handwritten\npages. The diary of Alfred Rosenberg, a Nazi theorist whose views on race are\nthought to have helped incite Hitler’s persecution of Jews, vanished after its\nauthor was convicted of war crimes and hanged at Nuremberg in 1946.It would\ntake two men — a former F.B.I. agent who specialized in recovering stolen art\nand the former chief archivist at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nin Washington — a dozen years to track down the elusive artifact, one of few\nknown diaries by a member of Hitler’s inner circle.Working with federal\ninvestigators, they found it in 2013, in the offices of a publishing house in\nupstate New York, a place far more modest than the Bavarian castle atop a\nhill, Kloster Banz, where it had been first discovered in a vault after the\nwar.The recovery of the diary, now held by the Holocaust Museum, was announced\nthree years ago. But the story of the hunt for it, of the tip that finally\npanned out, of the undercover work to track it and the crucial role played by\nHomeland Security investigators and a federal subpoena, is now being discussed\nin a new book, “The Devil’s Diary: Alfred Rosenberg and the Stolen Secrets of\nthe Third Reich” (Harper), by the former F.B.I. agent, Robert K. Wittman, and\nthe journalist David Kinney.“It really was like catching a tiger by the tail,\na big one,” Mr. Wittman said in an interview.The diary starts in 1934 and\nspans a 10-year period in the life of Rosenberg, who had a sizable influence\non Hitler but was less well known than other aides like Heinrich Himmler and\nJoseph Goebbels, whose diary has also been found. Rosenberg also wrote “The\nMyth of the Twentieth Century,” a book that espoused Aryan supremacy and anti-\nSemitic beliefs and was second in sales only to Hitler’s book, “Mein Kampf,”\nduring the Nazi period. Rosenberg, who was close in age to Hitler, also edited\na Nazi newspaper and oversaw the widespread theft of art by the Nazis and the\nbrutal occupation of the Soviet Union.The diary has been published, in German,\nby the Holocaust Museum and a typed transcript, also in German, has been\nposted online by the museum, which said it hoped that it would be analyzed\nfurther by historians and other scholars. In the diary, Rosenberg recalls his\nconversations with Hitler. He recounts how he convinced Hitler that the\nBolshevik Revolution in Russia was connected to a global conspiracy by Jews.\nFor that reason, and others, Rosenberg wrote, Jews were a threat to\nGermany.The diary also reveals Rosenberg’s role in the deportation of German,\nAustrian and Czech Jews, and it shines a light on the infighting and struggles\nwithin the upper echelons of the Third Reich to secure Hitler’s favor.“What\nled us to believe this was potentially of extreme historical importance,” said\nHenry Mayer, the archivist who tracked the diary with Mr. Wittman, “is the\nrarity of having a diary from someone of Rosenberg’s stature in the Nazi\nhierarchy and his close association with Hitler and his positions as looter in\nchief and murderer in chief and possibly a witness to the actual order from\nHitler authorizing the Final Solution.”Mr. Wittman noted, though, that while\nthe diary documents the evolution of attitudes that would lead to the\nHolocaust, it does not detail the specific plan for it.“There is no place in\nthe diary where we have Rosenberg or Hitler saying that the Jews should be\nexterminated,” he said. “All it said was ‘move them out of Europe.’”The diary\nis considered federal property, but investigators say Robert Kempner, a\nNuremberg prosecutor, held onto it after the tribunal concluded. After Mr.\nKempner’s death in 1993, his heirs turned over his papers to the Holocaust\nMuseum but, still, the diary was not among them.After years of false leads,\nMr. Mayer, who lost relatives in the Holocaust, said that in 2012 he finally\ncalled again on Mr. Wittman, now retired from the F.B.I. and an art security\nconsultant, to see if he might make one last push to find it. Mr. Wittman\npursued a tip that had come to Mr. Mayer from the sister of Mr. Kempner’s\nonetime secretary and mistress. The sister said she had overheard her sibling\ntell a German reporter that the diary had been given for safekeeping to a\nreligious studies scholar, Herbert Richardson, who ran a publishing house in\nLewiston, N.Y., about a 20-minute drive from Niagara Falls.Mr. Wittman said he\nwent to the area, scouted around and felt he had good reason to believe that\nMr. Richardson might have the diary. He called in Homeland Security\ninvestigators who traveled to see Mr. Richardson in February 2013.“He agreed\nto be interviewed, but he was not helpful,” said David Hall, a former federal\nprosecutor who was involved in the case. According to Homeland Security case\nreports, Mr. Richardson said he did not know where such a diary was. The\ninvestigators told him that possessing it was a potential crime and presented\nhim with a grand jury subpoena for the diary, according to court records.“And\nwe suggested that he get a lawyer,” Mr. Hall said.Weeks later, Mr.\nRichardson’s lawyers told federal officials that the diary had been found.In\nan interview, a lawyer for Mr. Richardson, Vincent Doyle III of Buffalo, said\nthat his client had not realized the diary was among a bunch of papers inside\nboxes that he had that were related to Mr. Kempner. Mr. Richardson found it,\nMr. Doyle said, in a taped bag from a German store that was inside a box.“Mr.\nRichardson is a publisher and scholar and if he knew that he had it, he\nprobably would have published it,” Mr. Doyle said.The diary and some other\npapers were turned over to federal officials in April 2013.Mr. Mayer said he\ncould still remember the relief he felt after such a “tough slog” to find\nit.“I kept telling myself, ‘Don’t let the bastards win,’” he recalled. “I felt\na great deal of satisfaction. It was my white whale.”\n\n","title":"Tracking an Elusive Diary From Hitler’s Inner Circle - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesarts: For almost six decades, a diary that influenced Hitler was missing.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013bd"},"content":"In the middle of the Civil War a colonel named Robert McAllister from the 11th\nRegiment of New Jersey tried to improve the moral fiber of his men. A\nPresbyterian railroad contractor in private life, he lobbied and preached\nagainst profanity, drinking, prostitution and gambling. Some of the line\nofficers in the regiment, from less genteel backgrounds, rebelled.They formed\nan organization called the Independent Order of Trumps. In sort of a\nmischievous, laddie way, the Trumps championed boozing and whoring, cursing\nand card-playing.In her book “The Gentlemen and the Roughs,” Lorien Foote\nnotes that this wasn’t just a battle over pleasure. It was a contest between\ntwo different ideals of masculinity. McAllister’s was based on gentlemanly\nchivalry and self-restraint. Trumpian masculinity was based on physical\ndomination and sexual conquest. “Perceptions of manliness were deeply\nintertwined with perceptions of social status,” Foote writes.And so it is\ntoday.These days we’re living through another great redefinition of\nmasculinity. Today, both men and women are called upon to live up to the\ntraditional ideals of both genders. So the ideal man, at least in polite\nsociety, gracefully achieves a series of balances. He is steady and strong,\nbut also verbal and vulnerable. He is emotionally open and willing to cry, but\nalso restrained and resilient. He is physical, and also intellectual.Today’s\nideal man honors the women in his life in whatever they want to do. He treats\nthem with respect in the workplace and romance in the bedroom. He is\nsuccessful in the competitive world of the marketplace but enthusiastic in the\nkitchen and gentle during kids’ bath time.This new masculine ideal is an\nunalloyed improvement on all the earlier masculine ideals. It’s a great\nachievement of our culture. But it is demanding and involves reconciling a\ndifficult series of tensions. And it has sparked a bad-boy protest movement\nand counterculture, currently led by a group we might once again call the\nIndependent Order of Trumps.Donald Trump’s presidential campaign is a\nrevolution in manners, a rejection of the civility codes of the educated\nclass. As part of this, he rejects the new and balanced masculine/feminine\nideal that has emerged over the past generation. Trump embraces a masculine\nidentity — old in some ways, new in others — built upon unvarnished\nmisogyny.Trump’s misogyny is not the historical moralistic misogyny.\nTraditional misogyny blames women for the lustful, licentious and powerful\nurges that men sometimes feel in their presence. In this misogyny, women are\nthe powerful, disgusting corrupters — the vixens, sirens and monsters. This\ngynophobic misogyny demands that women be surrounded with taboos and purgation\nrituals, along with severe restrictions on behavior and dress.Trump’s\nmisogyny, on the other hand, has a commercial flavor. The central arena of\nlife is male competition. Women are objects men use to win points in that\ncompetition. The purpose of a woman’s body is to reflect status on a man. One\nway to emasculate a rival man is to insult or conquer his woman.Writing for\nSlate, Frank Foer has one of the best (and most disgusting) compilations of\nDonald Trump’s history with women. Most of the episodes are pure dominance\ndisplay.For example, A. J. Benza was a writer who confessed that his\ngirlfriend had left him for Trump. Trump called into a radio show he was\nappearing on to brag: “I’ve been successful with your girlfriend, I’ll tell\nyou that,” Trump said. “While you were getting onto the plane to go to\nCalifornia thinking she was your girlfriend, she was some place that you\nwouldn’t have been very happy with.”When the commentator Tucker Carlson\ncriticized him, Trump left voice mail bragging about how much more sex he\ngets. He told an interviewer that you have to treat women like dirt.It’s not\nquite right to say that Trump is a throwback to midcentury sexism. At least in\nthose days negative behavior toward women and family members was restrained by\nthe chivalry code. Political candidates didn’t go attacking their rivals’\nwives based on their looks. Trump’s objectification is uncontrolled. It’s pure\nego competition with a pornogrified flavor.In this way, Trump represents the\nspread of something brutal. He takes economic anxiety and turns it into sexual\nhostility. He effectively tells men: You may be struggling, but at least\nyou’re better than women, Mexicans and Muslims.I’ve grappled with determining\nhow much to blame Trump’s supporters for his rise. Many of them are victims of\neconomic dislocation and it is hard to fault them for seeking a change, of\ncourse, even if it is simplistic and ignorant.But in the realm of cultural\npolitics, Trump voters do need to be held to account. They are participating\nin a descent into darkness. They are supporting a degrading wrong. This is the\nworld your daughters are going to grow up in.\n\n","title":"The Sexual Politics of 2016 - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Donald Trump has given misogyny a twist https://t.co/URRD8HgRT7 via @nytopinion https://t.co/h3lugWiuYL","date":"Sun Apr 03 02:26:18 +0000 2016","favs":503,"id":{"$numberLong":"716451731169796096"},"retweets":498},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25BiSHh"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013bf"},"content":"WHEN Rob Ford’s time as mayor of Toronto became a reality show that lurched\nfrom one cringe-inducing revelation to another, one question loomed: How did\nhe come to lead Canada’s largest city? His rumpled suits, fondness for\nprofanity, racist and homophobic remarks, public drunkenness, admitted drug\nuse and general boorishness made Mr. Ford seem like an outlier in a city that\nhad carefully cultivated a reputation for multiculturalism, tolerance and\nsophistication.But Mr. Ford, who died on March 22 while being treated for a\nrare form of cancer, wasn’t a sign that something was wrong with the city, but\nevidence of the smart planning and foresight that helped Toronto avoid many of\nthe problems that plague American cities. In short, Toronto works because its\nsuburbs never separated themselves economically or politically from the city\ncore. Mr. Ford, a suburban populist, may have been an embarrassment to some,\nbut his election shows that the system works.In 1953, the city itself was\ndoing just fine, but the 12 smaller municipalities surrounding it were\nstruggling to keep up with their postwar sprawl. So the province of Ontario\nimposed a metropolitan government over the entire region to handle big, costly\nprojects: policing, water and sewer systems and major roads. Each of the\ncities, still run by their local councils, paid into the kitty according to\ntheir tax base assessments. Toronto, which had 57 percent of the population,\npaid 62 percent of the metropolis’s bills.The system certainly had its\nproblems, but it made common cause between the suburbs and the city center.\nBut the rapid rise of suburbia swiftly reversed that cash flow. Just nine\nyears later, Toronto made up just 38 percent of the metropolitan area’s\npopulation and it contributed 44 percent of its budget.The system was tweaked\nover time, and the number of municipalities consolidated to six. Then in 1998,\nthe provincial Progressive Conservative government (including Doug Ford, Rob’s\nfather), forced the amalgamation of all six cities into a single large\nunit.That set off a political tug of war between the suburbs and the city. Mel\nLastman, the longtime mayor of suburban North York, became the first mayor of\nthe new city, and he was, in many ways, the spiritual father of Rob Ford. The\nowner of the Bad Boy appliance store chain who frequently appeared in the\nstore’s television commercials (the catchphrase was, “Who beats Bad Boy?\nNobody!”), Mr. Lastman became something of a national punch line when he\ncalled in the army to clean up after a series of heavy snowfalls. And while\nhis personal transgressions pale in comparison with Mr. Ford’s, it emerged in\n2000 that Mr. Lastman had secretly fathered two children with a mistress.After\nMr. Lastman, the old Toronto reasserted itself and David Miller, a Harvard-\neducated lawyer and center-leftist, became mayor. But while the original city\nwas prospering again, the suburbs were struggling with a loss of manufacturing\njobs.When Mr. Ford campaigned in 2010, he virtually ignored the old city and\ncatered to suburbia’s complaints while condemning what he called downtown’s\nisolated and unresponsive elites. Once in power, he pushed some fiscal and a\nlot of symbolic support toward the suburbs but was largely kept in check by\nthe City Council. While not enough time has passed to definitively declare a\npattern, Mr. Ford’s successor is John Tory, a centrist and certified member of\nthe old Toronto establishment.The tension between the old Toronto and its\nsuburbs is unlikely to vanish, nor are shifts in fortune between the two\nsides. But throughout all the battles, Toronto’s unified tax base has\nsupported both and mitigated any political consequences.Compare Toronto’s good\nfortune with that of one of its closest American neighbors: Detroit. As David\nMaraniss’s new book, “Once in a Great City,” explains, Detroit had for years\nhoped to tie its tax base to that of the surrounding suburbs. Mr. Maraniss\nunearthed a population study from 1963 that presciently forecast how the\nmovement to the suburbs would accelerate, and warned that the city was being\n“abandoned by all except those who suffer from relatively great housing,\neducational and general economic deprivations.”Complicated by questions of\nrace, efforts to create metropolitan government for Detroit never gained\nmomentum and the city, a fraction of its former size, hit bottom in\nbankruptcy: an abandoned center surrounded by wealthy suburbs that simply look\nthe other way. While other cities in the United States eventually formed metro\ngovernments, only Portland, Ore., has followed Toronto’s model and elected a\nregional council.Toronto, like all big cities, has its problems. But it also\nhas a healthy economy, well-funded public transit, beautiful neighborhoods, a\nvibrant street life, exceptional cultural institutions and an enviable ethnic\nand racial mix (despite his occasional comments, Rob Ford drew a lot of\nsupport from the suburb’s large immigrant communities). Toronto the Good, so\nnamed for the purse-lipped Methodists who once dominated the city, has become\nToronto the Great. A couple of Rob Ford jokes on the Jimmy Kimmel show seem a\nsmall price to pay.\n\n","title":"Why U.S. Cities Should Envy Toronto for Electing Rob Ford - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Why U.S. cities should envy Toronto for electing Rob Ford https://t.co/OK5FGPOh4q via @nytopinion","date":"Sun Apr 03 01:25:04 +0000 2016","favs":132,"id":{"$numberLong":"716436323654041600"},"retweets":74},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1MKb1AS"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013c0"},"content":"BURAIDA, Saudi Arabia — The men were not hardened militants. One was a\npharmacist, another a heating and cooling technician. One was a high school\nstudent.They were six cousins, all living in Saudi Arabia, all with the same\nsecret. They had vowed allegiance to the Islamic State — and they planned to\nkill another cousin, a sergeant in the kingdom’s counterterrorism force.And\nthat is what they did. In February, the group abducted Sgt. Bader al-Rashidi,\ndragged him to the side of a road south of this central Saudi city, and shot\nand killed him. With video rolling, they condemned the royal family, saying it\nhad forsaken Islam.Then they fled into the desert. The video spread rapidly\nacross the kingdom, shocking a nation struggling to contain a terrorist\nmovement seen as especially dangerous not just because it promotes violence,\nbut also because it has adopted elements of Saudi Arabia’s conservative\nversion of Islam — a Sunni creed known as Wahhabism — and used them to\ndelegitimize the monarchy.“Wahhabism is fundamental to the Islamic State’s\nideology,” said Cole Bunzel, a scholar of Wahhabi history at Princeton\nUniversity and the author of a recent paper on Saudi Arabia and the Islamic\nState. “It informs the character of their religion and is the most on-display\nfeature, in my opinion, of their entire ideology.”Among 20 terrorist episodes\nin Saudi Arabia since late 2014, the killing of Sergeant Rashidi was the third\nin which citizens had secretly joined the Islamic State and killed relatives\nin the security services. In each case, they justified their acts by saying\nSaudi Arabia practiced a corrupted version of the faith, a charge aimed at a\nkingdom that holds itself up as the only true Islamic state.The Islamic State,\nlike Al Qaeda before it, accuses the Saudi monarchy of corrupting the faith in\norder to preserve its power. But Qaeda networks in the kingdom were dismantled\nyears ago, and the group’s leadership abroad has discouraged killing Muslim\ncivilians.The Islamic State, however, has been able to infiltrate the kingdom\nthrough digital recruiting, and it has found devotees willing to kill fellow\nSunnis, as well as Shiites, to destabilize the monarchy.In July, a 19-year-old\nman murdered his uncle, a police colonel, before carrying out a suicide attack\nnear a prison, wounding two guards.In an audio message released by the Islamic\nState after his death, he addressed his own mother.“Your apostate brother was\na loyalist to the tyrants,” he said. “Were it not for him, the tyrants would\nnot exist.”Maj. Gen. Mansour Turki, a spokesman for the Saudi Interior\nMinistry, said that terrorist attacks over the past two years had killed\nscores of people, along with about two dozen militants.In addition, about\n3,000 Saudis have joined militant groups abroad, and more than 5,000 have been\nincarcerated at home on terrorism charges, a large increase in recent\nyears.Saudi Arabia has a tangled history with Islamic militant groups. For a\nlong time, it backed them as proxy forces to push its agenda in places like\nBosnia, Chechnya and Afghanistan (where it worked with the United States). But\nthat largely ended in 2003, when Al Qaeda turned its focus on the kingdom and\nstaged a series of deadly attacks.Now the Islamic State poses a new challenge,\nby turning aspects of Saudi Arabia’s conservative creed against it. Wahhabism\nhas been molded over the years to serve the interests of the monarchy,\nemphasizing obedience to the rulers and condemning terrorist attacks, even\nagainst those seen as apostates.Still, among the Islamic State’s many enemies,\nSaudi Arabia is the only one that considers the Quran and other religious\ntexts its constitution, criminalizes apostasy and bans all forms of\nunsanctioned public religion.The country was founded on an alliance between\nthe Saud family, whose members became the monarchs, and a cleric named Sheikh\nMuhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab, whose teachings were used to justify military\nconquest by labeling it jihad against those deemed to be infidels, most of\nwhom were other Muslims.Sheikh Abdul-Wahhab’s descendants still dominate the\nreligious institutions of the Saudi state, which now play down the violence in\nthe country’s history and emphasize aspects convenient to an all-powerful\nroyal family, like the importance of obeying the leadership.Saudi officials\nreject comparisons between their ideology and that of the Islamic State,\nnoting that millions of non-Muslims live in the kingdom and that the\ngovernment is closely allied with the United States and participates in the\nAmerican campaign against the militant group.They also say that Saudi Islam\ndoes not promote the caliphate, as does the Islamic State, and that senior\nclerics condemn the terrorist attacks and have branded the group “deviant.”But\ncritics argue that many Saudi clerics have never renounced the aspects of the\nWahhabi tradition that the Islamic State has adopted, especially with regard\nto Shiites, who make up an estimated 10 percent of the kingdom’s 20 million\ncitizens. Many Saudi clerics consider Shiites heretics and accuse them of\nloyalty to Saudi Arabia’s regional rival, Iran.The jihadists have exploited\nthis by repeatedly launching suicide attacks on Shiite mosques and then\naccusing Saudi clerics of hypocrisy for condemning the violence.“It is clearly\nhard for Saudi clerics to condemn outright attacks on Shiites,” said Mr.\nBunzel, the Princeton scholar. “And you get the feeling that they don’t care\nas much if the Shiites get attacked, since they’re not really Muslims in their\nview.”As elsewhere in the world, the Islamic State has relied on social media\nto reach inside the kingdom, find recruits and dispatch them to attack, often\nunder the noses of their closest relatives.This has made plots hard to\nprevent, General Turki said, citing the example of a man arrested last year\nafter killing two police officers in a drive-by shooting near Riyadh. One\nIslamic State supporter had given him the car, and another had provided the\ngun, but the attacker never learned their names.Still, the group had struggled\nto target the security forces, so it told recruits to kill officers from their\nown families. General Turki summarized their message as, “You are closer, so\nno one will know you.”In September, two men abducted their cousin, a soldier\nin the Saudi Army, and filmed a video of him bound and begging for mercy in\nthe sand as they pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and shot him dead.\nThe security forces killed one of them and arrested the other.Soon after came\nthe abduction and murder of Sergeant Rashidi by the six cousins, following a\nprocess of radicalization that no one in their families noticed.The\nringleader, Wael al-Rashidi, who addressed the camera in the video, had a\npharmacy degree and worked in a Riyadh hospital, two of Sergeant Rashidi’s\nbrothers said in an interview. He had smoked cigarettes, a practice shunned by\nmost devout Muslims, and spent hours “hacking” on his computer or playing war\ngames on his Xbox.One of his two brothers who joined the plot played the oud,\nalso an act religious conservatives frown on.Three other attackers were\nuniversity students; two were brothers, and two were roommates, both studying\nShariah at a state university in Riyadh.About two years ago, Wael al-Rashidi\nbecame more religious and withdrew from family functions, but that did not\nraise alarms in a society where religious conservatism is common.“We all saw\nthat he was growing a beard and going to the mosque, but there are lots of\npeople like that here, so we had no idea he was planning something else,” said\nSergeant Rashidi’s foster brother, Mishari.Even more puzzling was that Wael’s\nfather was a retired officer in the domestic intelligence service, an agency\ncharged with detecting jihadist threats, Sergeant Rashidi’s brothers said. The\nfather of another of the attackers still works for the force.“Maybe he didn’t\nknow, or he was scared to report him or thought he would straighten out,” said\none of Sergeant Rashidi’s brothers, Bandar. “Only he knows.”While the\nattackers were not personally close to Sergeant Rashidi, they told him they\nhad a gift from their mother for him to deliver. He met them, and they\nabducted and killed him a few hours later.The family’s dread grew in the\nfollowing days as relatives noticed that their sons were missing and had\nturned off their phones. Then the Islamic State released the video, confirming\nthe family’s suspicions.On March 11, Saudi security forces tracked the six men\nto a remote location and killed them all in a shootout, local news outlets\nreported.Sergeant Rashidi’s brothers are glad the six are dead, but the\nepisode has left them deeply suspicious.“If anyone calls and says, ‘Where are\nyou? I want to see you,’ you don’t trust him anymore,” Bandar said.“We don’t\ntrust anyone.”\n\n","title":"ISIS Turns Saudis Against the Kingdom, and Families Against Their Own - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Six Saudi cousins vowed allegiance to the Islamic State.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013c1"},"content":"Donald J. Trump, who in recent days has mocked a political opponent’s wife,\ndefended a campaign aide arrested on a charge of battery and suggested\npunishing women who terminate pregnancies, may have surrendered any remaining\nchance to rally Republicans strongly around him before the party’s July\nconvention in Cleveland.At a moment when a more traditional front-runner might\nhave sought to smooth over divisions within his party and turn his attention\nto the general election, Mr. Trump has only intensified his slash-and-burn,\nno-apologies approach to the campaign.“He should have started uniting the\nparty in March,” said Henry Barbour, a Republican National Committee member\nfrom Mississippi who previously supported Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, “and\nhe is making it harder on himself.”Republicans who once worried that Mr. Trump\nmight gain overwhelming momentum in the primaries are now becoming preoccupied\nwith a different grim prospect: that Mr. Trump might become a kind of zombie\ncandidate — damaged beyond the point of repair, but too late for any of his\nrivals to stop him.Should Mr. Trump lurch into the convention so fatally\ncompromised with general election voters and a sizable faction of Republicans,\nit could make it easier for the party to wrest the nomination away from him.\nBut it would also make the consequences of failing to defeat him all the more\nruinous if the specter of choosing a seemingly unelectable nominee does not\ndeter Mr. Trump’s supporters.Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker who has\nfrequently praised Mr. Trump’s insurgent campaign, said the front-runner had\nmade a series of bewildering and irrational mistakes. Mr. Trump’s campaign, he\nsaid, had failed to evolve beyond the “personal gunslinger, random-behavior\nmodel” characterized by the candidate.“None of the mistakes have been forced,\nand nobody forced him to react negatively,” Mr. Gingrich said. “It’s almost as\nthough he is so full of himself that he can’t slow down and recognize that\nbeing president of the United States is a team sport that requires a stable\npersonality, that allows other people to help him.”Polls show that Mr. Trump\nhas struggled to attract a majority coalition even within the Republican\nParty, and that the distress of mainstream Republicans has grown as Mr.\nTrump’s general election numbers have crumbled. In next week’s crucial\nWisconsin primary, Mr. Trump now trails Senator Ted Cruz of Texas by nearly 10\npoints, according to a poll published Wednesday by Marquette University.In\nWisconsin and elsewhere, the strongest Republican opposition to Mr. Trump\ncomes in suburban areas and among college-educated voters and women. His\nconduct over the past week is unlikely to win over those groups.In the past\nfew days, Mr. Trump has declined to apologize for circulating on social media\nan unflattering photo of Mr. Cruz’s wife, Heidi, and bitterly criticized a\nfemale reporter who accused his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, of\nmanhandling her.Mr. Trump has said he believes Mr. Lewandowski is innocent,\nand that his mockery of Mrs. Cruz was a response to lewd criticism of his own\nwife from a group that opposes his campaign.On Wednesday, he said that if\nabortion were illegal, it would be appropriate to punish women who seek out\nthe procedure — before issuing a statement reversing himself, saying that only\ndoctors performing abortions should be “held legally responsible” under those\ncircumstances.Asked to address Republican critics who said Mr. Trump’s style\nwas fracturing the party, Hope Hicks, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, said he\nwas “a counterpuncher” who viewed himself as standing up for the people\nclosest to him. “This is what he will do for the country,” she said.In the\npast, Mr. Trump’s political missteps have done little to hinder his progress\nin the campaign.He has built a powerful delegate lead in the race for the\nRepublican nomination, with about three-fifths of the 1,237 delegates he\nneeds. Mr. Cruz, his nearest competitor, is about 270 behind.And while Mr.\nTrump has not yet won over a majority of Republican primary voters, he still\npolls well ahead of Mr. Cruz and a third candidate, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio.A\nNew York Times/CBS News poll released last week showed Mr. Trump with support\nfrom 46 percent of Republicans nationally, compared with 26 percent for Mr.\nCruz and 20 percent for Mr. Kasich.After Wisconsin, the primary battle moves\nonto decidedly favorable turf for Mr. Trump: his native New York, on April 19,\nfollowed by a series of Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic states, including\nPennsylvania and Delaware, where he is expected to run strong.Still, Mr. Trump\nhas been unable to consolidate support the way a conventional front-runner\nwould. His share of the vote in the primaries has remained relatively steady —\nin the high 30- to low 40-percent range — even as his opponents have dwindled\nto just two.An analysis circulated in mid-March by the Republican strategist\nAlex Gage showed Mr. Trump’s average support in primaries to be nearly flat\nover the past two months, compared with a rapid climb Mitt Romney experienced\nin his campaign over the same period in 2012.Thomas M. Reynolds, a former\nRepublican congressman from New York, said he expected Mr. Trump to do well in\nthe delegate-rich state despite his evident limitations as a candidate.But Mr.\nReynolds said the Trump method of “kind of ad-libbing” his way through the\nrace had left him as the master of a strong plurality of Republican voters —\nand still short of a coalition that would make him a commanding winner.“He has\nsuccessfully been able to say whatever he wants without retribution,” Mr.\nReynolds said, “but I am not seeing him grow in the Republican base at this\npoint.”Jim McLaughlin, a Republican pollster who has worked with Mr. Trump in\nthe past, said Mr. Trump had plainly not yet convinced a majority of primary\nvoters that he is prepared to hold the country’s highest office. Mr. Trump, he\nsaid, “hasn’t figured out a closing message.”And his political position is\nslipping nationally, Mr. McLaughlin said: In a poll taken in late March by Mr.\nMcLaughlin’s firm, about two-thirds of general election voters said they now\nhad an unfavorable view of Mr. Trump, including seven in 10 women. (An ABC\nNews/Washington Post survey in early March had similar findings.)“He needs to\nstart acting more like the commander in chief,” Mr. McLaughlin said. “At some\npoint folks ask themselves, ‘Am I comfortable in terms of wanting to give this\nperson the nuclear codes?’ ”Mr. Trump has periodically seemed determined to\nreassure voters on that front.Starting on the night of the “Super Tuesday”\nprimaries on March 1, he has held a string of news conferences in ornate\nsettings, wrapping himself in presidential pomp even as he continued to engage\nin mockery of his rivals.He has given two lengthy interviews focused on\nforeign policy, and after facing questions about the sophistication of his\ncampaign operation, he announced the hiring of a longtime Republican\nstrategist, Paul J. Manafort, to lead his delegate-wrangling efforts.It may\nstill be enough, Republicans say, for Mr. Trump to win the barest of delegate\nmajorities before the Cleveland convention. But had he taken a more deliberate\nand less divisive approach in the past two weeks, Mr. Trump’s nomination might\nbe inevitable, and he might be less wounded as a candidate in November.“He\nwould be miles ahead of this kind of junk,” Mr. Gingrich said, referring to\nMr. Trump’s feuding over Mr. Lewandowski and Mrs. Cruz. “I don’t understand\nit. I don’t think it works.”As it is, Mr. Gingrich said, “I think he has a\nreal possibility of, having surged amazingly, to miss the golden ring.”\n\n","title":"G.O.P.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013c2"},"content":"Bookended by ads for Trojan condoms and Malibu Ultra Light cigarettes, the\nlengthy interview in Playboy magazine is a remarkably prophetic document.\nTwenty-six years ago this month, Donald J. Trump sat down with Glenn Plaskin,\na celebrity columnist, and, over a glass of chilled Coke, offered a grievance-\nfilled economic agenda, a searing denunciation of weak-kneed American\nleadership and a keen understanding of his appeal to blue-collar Americans\nthat uncannily resembled the White House campaign he is waging today — without\nTwitter, which didn’t yet exist.A glossy time capsule, the interview is\ntestament to consistency, stubbornness or stuntedness, depending on your\nview.Below are excerpts from the original interview, along with an analysis of\nhow they stack up against his 2016 message.** ****On which Americans would\nsupport a hypothetical Trump bid for the White House:****1990** “The working\nguy would elect me. He likes me. When I walk down the street, those cabbies\nstart yelling out their windows.”**2016** The working guy _is_ electing him,\nstate after state, as he marches to the Republican nomination.**On the\naspirational power of his ostentatious wealth — the yacht, towers and\nplanes:****1990 **“Props for the show. ... The show is Trump, and it’s sold-\nout performances everywhere. I’ve had fun doing it and will continue to have\nfun, and I think most people enjoy it.”**2016 **Now they are props for his\ncampaign, signifying his financial success and voters’ desire to replicate it.\nMr. Trump’s gold-plated 757 is a fixation of cable news, its landings and\ntakeoffs chronicled live. And in Iowa, the real estate mogul offered free\nrides to children aboard his $7 million helicopter.**On allies taking\nadvantage of America’s generosity:****1990** “We Americans are laughed at\naround the world for losing a hundred and fifty billion dollars year after\nyear, for defending wealthy nations for nothing, nations that would be wiped\nout in about 15 minutes if weren’t for us. Our ‘allies’ are making billions\nscrewing us.”**2016** He makes precisely the same argument today, wondering\nwhy the United States adheres to costly “one-sided” defense agreements with\nnations like Japan and South Korea — and suggesting that they develop their\nown nuclear capabilities so America need not rush to their aid.**On whom he\nwould trust to carry out his vision in government:****1990** “I think if we\nhad people from the business community — the Carl Icahns, the Ross Perots —\nnegotiating some of our foreign policy, we’d have respect around the\nworld.”**2016** On this, Mr. Trump is strikingly consistent, right down to his\nmention of Mr. Icahn, a billionaire corporate raider, as an archetypal\nnegotiator. Mr. Trump still names him as a future member of his cabinet.**On\nthe lameness of previous presidents:****1990 **“We’re still suffering from a\nloss of respect that goes back to the Carter administration, when helicopters\nwere crashing into one another in Iran. That was Carter’s emblem. There he\nwas, being carried off from a race, needing oxygen. I don’t want my president\nto be carried off a racecourse. I don’t want my president landing on Austrian\nsoil and falling down the stairs of his airplane. Some of our presidents have\nbeen incredible jerk-offs. We need to be tough.”**2016** In only slightly more\npolite terms, Mr. Trump makes the same case now: American leaders are “stupid”\nand “weak” (if better oxygenated), and the country desperately needs his no-\nnonsense, bruising style. A favorite line on the stump still echoes from 1990:\n“We gotta be tough.”**On his lust for the counterpunch:****1990 **“When\nsomebody tries to sucker-punch me, when they’re after my ass, I push back a\nhell of a lot harder than I was pushed in the first place. If somebody tries\nto push me around, he’s going to pay a price. Those people don’t come back for\nseconds.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013c3"},"content":"HOUSTON — In a 95-51 demolition of Oklahoma on Saturday night, Villanova not\nonly punched its ticket to the national title game but also set a standard for\nFinal Four blowouts. Through 78 Final Fours — dating to the first, in 1939,\nwhich also featured the Wildcats and the Sooners — 44 points is the largest\nmargin of victory.That includes games involving the U.C.L.A. teams that were\npart of seven straight national championships; Bob Knight’s great Indiana\nteams; the high-scoring 1991 Nevada-Las Vegas team; the Duke team that beat\nthat U.N.L.V. team. Whichever great college team is sepia-sketched in your\nmemory as historically dominant, know that it did not do what Villanova did\nSaturday.Consider Bill Russell. Bill Bradley. Bill Walton. Many great college\nbasketball players not named Bill: Wilt Chamberlain, Michael Jordan, Christian\nLaettner, Anthony Davis. None have participated in so spectacular a rout.“They\nmade shots,” Oklahoma’s Buddy Hield said after his final college game. “We\nwere trying to find a way to make shots. They just played terrific\ntonight.”The second-seeded Wildcats (34-5) indeed made shots: 11 of 18 3-point\nattempts, a 61.1 percent accuracy rate, and 35 of 49 over all from the field,\nor 71.4 percent. Villanova’s field-goal percentage was the second highest in\nFinal Four history, surpassed only by that of the 1985 Villanova team, a No. 8\nseed that upset Patrick Ewing and Georgetown in the title game.Hield entered\nSaturday’s game as the second-leading scorer and most effective 3-point\nshooter in Division I. In his senior year, he built on catch-and-shoot wing\nplay that had led to his being named the Big 12 player of the year as a\njunior. Hield added the ability to create shots off the dribble, whether by\ndriving to the hoop or by taking step-back 3-point jumpers that have drawn\ncomparisons to Stephen Curry’s game.But nearly as impressive as Villanova’s\noffensive attack was its defensive performance. The Wildcats held Hield to 9\npoints — his second-lowest total of the season — on 4-for-12 shooting, with\njust one 3-pointer.Villanova’s frantic defense — sometimes pressing, sometimes\nman-to-man, sometimes zone, always aggressive — flustered the Sooners.Hield\nseemed to receive more open looks in the second half, but he struggled to\nconvert them, missing all three of his 3-point attempts.Oklahoma (29-8) was\nnot exactly a surprise entrant in the Final Four. It was a No. 2 seed that had\nalready knocked off No. 3-seeded Texas A\u0026amp;M and No. 1-seeded Oregon. The\nSooners had even beaten Villanova by 28 points in December. On Saturday, with\nVillanova creating 17 turnovers and holding Oklahoma 29 points under its\naverage of 80 per game, that earlier game felt as if from the Mesozoic\nEra.Villanova players had spent several days telling anyone who would listen\nthat no matter how well known the team’s four-guard, perimeter-oriented\noffensive sets were, and no matter how much flashier 3-pointers and fast\nbreaks might be, defense was what made the Wildcats tick.“We don’t care too\nmuch about offense,” Mikal Bridges, a redshirt freshman, said recently,\nadding: “Us stepping up on defense is just the biggest thing. I’d rather have\nthat than just making shots.”After Saturday’s game, the junior Josh Hart said:\n“Obviously we love when we can hit shots. But this program is really built on\njust dialing in defensively, being tough.”Villanova’s home court, the\n6,500-seat Pavilion, is dwarfed by NRG Stadium, which holds more than 70,000,\nbut the Wildcats appeared unfazed, taking what Coach Jay Wright described on\nFriday as a business-first approach.It showed in the first half, as Villanova\nshot 18 for 27 from the field and had three players with at least 8\npoints.Ryan Arcidiacono, playing in his program-record 143rd game, finished\nwith 15 points and 3 assists. The junior Kris Jenkins scored 18 points.Hart is\nprobably Villanova’s most talented player — most likely the one, along with\nthe freshman guard Jalen Brunson, with the best chance at a successful N.B.A.\ncareer — and he was brilliant on offense. Wright has spoken of Villanova’s\nimproved decision-making, and he may as well play on a loop the possession in\nwhich Hart got the ball behind the 3-point line, passed up a contested shot to\ndribble in and made a midrange jumper. He finished with 23 points, 8 rebounds\nand 4 assists.Bridges, a 6-foot-7 player, benefited from his team’s San\nAntonio Spurs-style ball movement. On one first-half possession, the ball\nricocheted from Arcidiacono to Daniel Ochefu in the high post and back out to\nthe wing, where Bridges sank a 3-pointer. He scored 11 points on only four\nfield-goal attempts.Villanova built a 14-point lead in the first half with a\n21-4 run. Hield scored just 7 points and made only 1 of 5 3-point attempts,\nwith three turnovers. He went more than 15 minutes without a basket.“At\nhalftime I felt good, like we were focused in and we were playing good\nbasketball,” Wright said. “I didn’t think it was ours at that point, but I\nfelt good that what we decided to do was working.”Oklahoma came out in the\nsecond half with a press and seemed to make some headway. Sooners fans were\ncatalyzed less than four minutes in when guard Jordan Woodard missed a free\nthrow, rebounded the ball and converted a putback in one fluid motion, cutting\nVillanova’s lead to 9 and prompting Wright to call a timeout.But Villanova\nresponded. Hart took the ball at the other end, rebounded his own miss and\nlaid it in, drawing a foul.It only grew worse from there for the Sooners, who,\nduring one stretch in the second half, made 1 of 13 shots from the field. With\nmore than seven minutes left, Villanova led by 36. The Sooners senior Ryan\nSpangler, a native Oklahoman, rubbed his bleary eyes with a towel, as if in\ndisbelief.\n\n","title":"Villanova Wipes Out Oklahoma and a Record to Reach the Title Game - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTSports: Fast-moving Villanova shuts down Oklahoma, 95-51, to reach title game https://t.co/NwfpiGyQyV https://t.co/iQlp8K2MKp","date":"Sun Apr 03 00:34:16 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716423536886292482"},"retweets":230},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SJLx62"}

The musician\nrecently had bypass surgery to remove a blood clot.\"Music was a mystery to\nGato, and each time he played was a new experience for him, and he wanted it\nto be that way for his audience,\" she said. \"He was honored for all the years\nhe had a chance to bring his music all around the world.\"The Argentine-born\nmusician recorded some 35 albums between 1967 and 1982, when he stopped\nconsistently making new records. He toured regularly and went on to record\nfour more albums, including 1997's smooth jazz \"Que Pasa,\" which reached No. 2\non Billboard's contemporary jazz charts.Though in poor health, Barbieri, still\nsporting his trademark black fedora hat, had been performing monthly at the\nBlue Note jazz club in New York, since 2013. He last performed at the club on\nNov. 23.\"He was my best friend,\" Laura Barbieri said Saturday. \"I'm so\ngrateful we had these 20 years together.\" She said a public memorial was being\nplanned, but details have not been finalized.Last year, Barbieri received a\nLatin Grammy lifetime achievement award for a career that covered \"virtually\nthe entire jazz landscape.\"The citation from the Latin Recording Academy\ncredited Barbieri with creating \"a rebellious but highly accessible musical\nstyle, combining contemporary jazz with Latin American genres and\nincorporating elements of instrumental pop.\"Barbieri won a Grammy for best\ninstrumental composition in 1973 for his music for \"Last Tango In Paris,\" the\ncontroversial erotic drama starring Marlon Brando and Maria Schneider that\nearned two Oscar nominations.When director Bernardo Bertolucci needed sexy\nmusic for \"Last Tango,\" he turned to Barbieri who was known for his\ndistinctive, sensuous, huge-toned tenor sax sound.\"It was like a marriage\nbetween the film and the music,\" said Barbieri of the soundtrack that made him\nan international star, in a 1997 interview with The Associated Press.\n\"Bernardo told me, 'I don't want the music to be too much Hollywood or too\nmuch European, which is more intellectual. I want a median.'\"Barbieri said\ntango had a special appeal because it is deeply tied to his Argentine\nsoul.\"Always in the tango is tragedy — she leaves him, she kills him. It's\nlike an opera but it's called tango,\" Barbieri said in 1997, noting that half\nof Argentinians, including him, had roots in Italy. \"The lyrics and the\nmelodies are very beautiful. It's very sensual.\"Born on Nov. 28, 1932, in\nRosario, Argentina, Barbieri grew up in a family that included several\nmusicians, but did not take up an instrument until he was 12 when he heard\nbebop pioneer Charlie Parker's recording of \"Now's the Time\" and began\nstudying clarinet.After moving to Buenos Aires in 1947, Barbieri picked up the\nalto saxophone. He earned the nickname \"El Gato,\" which means \"The Cat,\" in\nthe 1950s because of the way he scampered between clubs with his saxophone.He\ngained national prominence playing alto saxophone in an orchestra led by Lalo\nSchifrin, the pianist and composer who later made a big impact with his TV and\nfilm scores, including \"Theme from Mission: Impossible.\"Later in the 1950s,\nBarbieri switched to tenor saxophone as he began leading his own groups.In the\n1960s, splitting his time between Rome and New York, Barbieri became part of\nthe Ornette Coleman-inspired free jazz revolution, working extensively with\ntrumpeter Don Cherry from Coleman's groundbreaking quartet. Influenced by\nother modern jazz saxophonists — including John Coltrane, Albert Ayler and\nPharoah Sanders — he developed a warmer, grittier sound on the tenor sax. He\nrecorded and performed with such avant-garde jazz musicians as Cherry, Carla\nBley and Mike Mantler.But he soon rediscovered his roots, incorporating South\nAmerican rhythms, harmonies and melodic themes on albums starting with \"The\nThird World\" in 1969 — and eventually developed his own contemporary jazz\nsound. He followed that with the live album \"El Pampero\" in 1971.After\nreleasing the \"Last Tango\" album in 1972, Barbieri recorded a series of\nmellower Latin-infused soul-jazz and jazz-pop albums, including four \"Chapter\"\nalbums for the Impulse! label, which explored Brazilian, Afro-Cuban and\nArgentine rhythms. He then released \"Caliente\" (1976) for the A\u0026amp;M label,\nwhich included his popular rendition of Carlos Santana's \"Europa.\"Barbieri\nrecorded new material consistently until 1982, when a dispute with his record\nlabel led him to focus solely on touring. He recoded only intermittently in\nthe 1980s, and did not release any albums from 1988-97. He released \"Que Pasa\"\nin 1997 after dealing with the turmoil of losing his Italian-born wife of 35\nyears to a degenerative illness in January 1995, and then undergoing triple\nbypass heart surgery two months later.He had to recover physically and\novercome depression at the death of his wife to finish the album, which he\ncredited with being a healing force.\"The only way I saw was to go out and do\nsomething every day,\" he said. \"The music gave me life.\"Barbieri would release\nonly three more albums over the rest of his life — including \"The Shadow of\nthe Cat\" in 2002, a Latin-flavored smooth jazz session featuring guest\ntrumpeter Herb Alpert, and \"New York Meeting\" in 2010 on which he played\nstraight-ahead jazz standards, such as Thelonious Monk's \"Straight, No Chaser\"\nand Miles Davis' \"So What.\"Barbieri married again in 1996 and had a son,\nChristian, who turns 18 on Sunday. Besides his wife and son, he is survived by\nhis sister Raquel Barbieri, who lives in Buenos Aires.In lieu of flowers, his\nfamily requests that donations be sent to The Reciprocity Foundation, a\nnonprofit that works to help homeless and foster youth in New York\nCity.___This story has been corrected to show Barbieri's first name was\nLeandro, not Leonardo, and to correct the label for \"Caliente\" to A\u0026amp;M, not\nthe Impulse!

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013c5"},"content":"WASHINGTON — YOU could hear how hard it was for Donald Trump to say the\nwords.“Yeah, it was a mistake,” he said, sounding a bit chastened. “If I had\nto do it again, I wouldn’t have sent it.”I was telling him he lost my sister’s\nvote when he retweeted a seriously unflattering photo of the pretty Heidi Cruz\nnext to a glam shot of his wife, Melania.He repeated his contention that he\ndidn’t view the Heidi shot “necessarily as negative.” But I stopped him,\nsaying it was clearly meant to be nasty.Trump also got into his schoolyard\nexcuse of “he did it first” and “that wasn’t nice,” insisting that Ted Cruz\nwrote the words on the digital ad put up by an anti-Trump group aimed at Utah\nMormons; it showed Melania in a 2000 British GQ shot posing provocatively and\nsuggested that it was not First Ladylike. Cruz denies any involvement.Truth be\ntold, Trump said he “didn’t love the photo” of Melania. “I think she’s taken\nbetter pictures,” he said, also protesting: “It wasn’t a nude photo, either.\nIt wasn’t nude!”It’s ridiculous how many mistakes Trump has made in rapid\norder to alienate women when he was already on thin ice with them — and this\nin a year when the Republicans will likely have to run against a woman.He did\na huge favor for Hillary, who had been reeling from losing young women to a 74\n-year-old guy and from a dearth of feminist excitement. And for Cruz, who\nstarted promoting himself as Gloria Steinem, despite his more regressive\npositions on abortion and other women’s issues.Wouldn’t it have been better, I\nasked, if Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski had simply called the\nreporter Michelle Fields and apologized for yanking her arm?“You’re right, but\nfrom what I understand it wouldn’t have mattered,” Trump said.In an MSNBC\ninterview with Chris Matthews, the formerly pro-choice Trump somehow managed\nto end up to the right of the National Right to Life Committee when he said\nthat for women, but not men, “there has to be some form of punishment” if a\nPresident Trump makes abortion illegal.Trump quickly recanted and even told\nCBS’s John Dickerson that “the laws are set. And I think we have to leave it\nthat way.”“This was not real life,” he told me. “This was a hypothetical, so I\nthought of it in terms of a hypothetical. So that’s where that answer came\nfrom, hypothetically.”Given his draconian comment, sending women back to back\nalleys, I had to ask: When he was a swinging bachelor in Manhattan, was he\never involved with anyone who had an abortion?“Such an interesting question,”\nhe said. “So what’s your next question?”I pressed, how he could possibly win\nwith 73 percent of women in this country turned off by him?He chose another\npoll, murmuring, “It was 68 percent, actually.”Trump doesn’t have a plan to\nturn it around with women, except to use Ivanka as a character witness and to\nchant that “nobody respects women more than I do.”“I’m just going to be\nmyself,” he said. “That’s all I can do.”I asked how he would get past the\ndamage done by his insults about women’s looks.“I attack men far more than I\nattack women,” he said. “And I attack them tougher.”Besides, he noted, he gets\nattacked on his looks, too. “My hair is just fine, but I get attacked on my\nhair,” he said. “But if I attack someone else on their hair, they’d say, ‘Oh,\nwhat a terrible thing to do.’”How do you rate your own looks, I\nasked.“Phenomenal,” he said with a trace of self-deprecation. “Hey, it’s\nworked. What can I say?”He was trying to be careful — an unfamiliar approach —\nin talking about women.When I told him that Hillary called him “an id with\nhair” at a New York fund-raiser, he was subdued. “Yeah, what is that all\nabout?” he said. “Huh?”And Rosie O’Donnell was there and compared him to a\nHarry Potter villain. “Give me a break, Rosie,” he said. “I won’t comment on\nRosie. I wish her the best. See? In the old days — tell your sister, I’m\nmaking progress.”I mentioned that Megyn Kelly wants him on her show. “I think\nI’d probably do it,” he allowed.The front-runner has a right to be paranoid,\nwith everyone plotting to steal his prize. He said he doesn’t want to “act\nlike someone overly aggrieved,” but he was stewing in aggrievement about how\n“unbelievably badly” he gets treated by the press. The brand expert knows his\nbrand is not so shiny these days.“It’s a very interesting question because I\ndo enjoy life a lot and I have fun with life and I understand life and I want\nto make life better for people, but it doesn’t come out in the media,” he\nsaid.Has he missed the moment to moderate, to unite, to be less belligerent,\nto brush up on his knowledge about important issues?“I guess because of the\nfact that I immediately went to No. 1 and I said, why don’t I just keep the\nsame thing going?” he mused. “I’ve come this far in life. I’ve had great\nsuccess. I’ve done it my way.”He added: “You know, there are a lot of people\nwho say, ‘Don’t change.’ I can be as presidential as anybody who ever lived. I\ncan be so presidential if I want.”Then start.\n\n","title":"Trump Does It His Way - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytopinion: Dowd: A rare admission from Donald Trump about retweeting a photo of Heidi Cruz and Melania. https://t.co/V2xzH3jChM https:…","date":"Sat Apr 02 23:55:05 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716413676358656000"},"retweets":56},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1qnQF6B"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013c6"},"content":"WASHINGTON — The wall of Republican opposition to the nomination of Judge\nMerrick B. Garland to the Supreme Court has been shored up by two Republican\nsenators revoking their support for holding confirmation hearings.Their moves\nhighlight the immense pressure that Republican leaders are placing on senators\nas they try to build unified opposition to President Obama’s choice to replace\nJustice Antonin Scalia, who died in February.As the White House heralds the\ngrowing number of Republicans agreeing to meet with Judge Garland, Senators\nJerry Moran of Kansas and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska have reversed themselves\nand say they now back the decision made by Senator Charles E. Grassley of\nIowa, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, not to hold hearings.“Senator Moran\ncalled Senator Grassley to discuss his position,” said a statement released by\nMr. Moran’s office on Friday. “As Senator Moran has said, he is opposed to\nPresident Obama’s Supreme Court nominee. He has examined Judge Garland’s\nrecord and didn’t need hearings to conclude that the nominee’s judicial\nphilosophy, disregard for Second Amendment rights and sympathy for federal\ngovernment bureaucracy make Garland unacceptable to serve on the Supreme\nCourt.”Mr. Moran’s announcement, first reported by National Review, came a\nweek after he said the Senate should move forward with the nomination process,\nincluding holding hearings and meeting with Judge Garland.“As I have said\nsince the vacancy was created, I believe I have a duty to ask tough questions\nand demand answers,” he said in a statement on March 25. “I am certain a\nthorough investigation would expose Judge Garland’s record and judicial\nphilosophy, and disqualify him in the eyes of Kansans and Americans.”On March\n21, according to The Garden City Telegram, Mr. Moran told constituents, “I\nwould rather have you complaining to me that I voted wrong on nominating\nsomebody than saying I’m not doing my job.”Similarly, a spokeswoman for Ms.\nMurkowski, Karina Petersen, said the Alaska senator also no longer supported\nholding hearings, though she will meet with Judge Garland to discuss cases\nthat are important to her state.“Senator Murkowski respects the decision of\nthe chair and members of the Judiciary Committee not to hold hearings on the\nnominee,” Ms. Petersen wrote in an email.In February, before Mr. Obama named\nJudge Garland as his pick, Ms. Murkowski told reporters in Alaska that the\nnominee should be granted a hearing. Though she emphasized, in a Facebook post\nthe next day, that she opposed Mr. Obama’s making the nomination, Ms.\nMurkowski had declined to directly address her stance on holding hearings\nsince her comments in February.Their announcements leave just two Republicans\nwho openly support holding hearings and even voting on Judge Garland’s\nnomination: Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Mark S. Kirk of Illinois. Mr.\nKirk became the first Republican to meet with Mr. Obama’s pick on Tuesday,\nchastising his fellow senators who refused to follow suit. Ms. Collins is\nscheduled to meet with Judge Garland this week, as is Senator John Boozman,\nRepublican of Arkansas, who opposes his nomination.Republicans who have broken\nfrom party leaders have suffered blowback from conservative groups. Mr. Moran\nweathered particularly brutal attacks, with some threatening to back a last-\nminute primary challenger against him in his re-election bid.\n\n","title":"2 Republican Senators Revoke Support for Garland Hearings - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"2 Republican Senators Revoke Support for Garland Hearings https://t.co/6ERJA52mfi","date":"Sat Apr 02 23:46:59 +0000 2016","favs":81,"id":{"$numberLong":"716411638363070464"},"retweets":58},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/2303Mwf"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013c7"},"content":"Donald J. Trump’s dominance in the Republican primary is upending the campaign\nfor control of Congress, as Republican lawmakers seek to distance themselves\nfrom him while Democrats seize on the chance to run against a candidate who\nhas offended huge sections of the American electorate.Nominating Mr. Trump\ncould create a political battlefield of extraordinary breadth and volatility.\nPolling shows that he would enter the general election trailing badly against\nHillary Clinton, and he has become deeply unpopular outside of his white,\nheavily male political base.While Mr. Trump would most likely draw throngs of\nwhite, working-class voters in Democratic-leaning states like Michigan and\nOhio, he would also drive away women, nonwhites and voters with college\ndegrees in conservative-leaning states like Georgia and North Carolina.Both\nparties are now racing to gauge the impact further down the ballot of a\ncandidacy that could shatter traditional lines of combat in national\npolitics.Former Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota, an influential Republican\nstrategist and fund-raiser, said Mr. Trump’s nomination could imperil even the\nparty’s seemingly iron grip on the House. Mr. Coleman said major donors were\nincreasingly focused on building a “firewall” around Congress, because they\nbelieve Democrats would easily defeat Mr. Trump and keep control of the White\nHouse.“Everything is in play: the presidency, the Supreme Court, the Senate\nand potentially the House,” he said.Mr. Coleman said Republicans would have to\ndecide on a case-by-case basis how to handle Mr. Trump in their races. “If it\nwere me and I were running, and Trump were going to be at the top of the\nticket, I would disavow him,” he said.Republicans, who hold the Senate 54 to\n46 and maintain control of the House by 30 seats, believe it would be\nessential for candidates running in diverse or comparatively affluent areas to\nbreak with Mr. Trump on matters of policy, and perhaps to denounce his\nnomination in blunt terms.With control of the Senate resting in large part on\nDemocratic-leaning states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Republicans are\npreparing to run aggressively localized campaigns aimed at persuading voters\nto split their ballot for a Republican senator even if they support a Democrat\nfor president.Some party leaders remain hopeful that they can block Mr. Trump\nby denying him a majority of the delegates to the July convention and\ncoalescing support around another candidate.But the National Republican\nSenatorial Committee has already conducted polling to test the message that\nRepublicans must control the Senate as a check against a President Hillary\nClinton, and that Democrats must not be allowed to fully control the\nappointment and confirmation of Supreme Court judges, according to two people\nbriefed on the research, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because it\nwas intended to be confidential.Democrats see Mr. Trump as increasing their\nchances, especially in diverse and fast-growing states like Arizona and\nVirginia, where the party often struggles to turn out Hispanic voters who can\nhelp its candidates. And the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is\nmounting a late push to stretch the political map by recruiting candidates in\nas many as 10 conservative-leaning House districts, in states like Florida and\nKansas, where analysts believe Mr. Trump will harm Republicans.The Democratic\ncommittee, eager to cut into the Republicans’ majority, has begun a large data\nproject to model both support for and opposition to Mr. Trump. Meredith Kelly,\na spokeswoman for the committee, confirmed that its data team was studying\nwhich of Mr. Trump’s ideas and comments would be most offensive to key voting\nblocs, and how best to project those themes in congressional races.Gov. Dannel\nP. Malloy of Connecticut, chairman of the Democratic Governors’ Association,\nsaid Republicans had a no-win situation on their hands: They could either run\nfrom Mr. Trump and risk depressing Republican turnout, or embrace him and have\nto defend “views that are abhorrent” to many people.“Quite frankly, we’re\ngoing to hold people accountable: Are you with Trump and his policies, or are\nyou against him?” Mr. Malloy said.Both sides believe it is too early to\nmeasure the precise effect Mr. Trump will have on other elections this fall,\nin part because Mr. Trump has shown himself to be an unpredictable candidate\nwith few compunctions about changing proposals and themes of his candidacy.Mr.\nTrump has said he anticipates that Republicans will ultimately embrace him in\nthe general election; Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign,\npredicted he would buoy Republicans down the ballot.“It is clear he has\nbrought millions of voters to the party, received tremendous support and\ngarnered millions more votes than any of his opponents,” Ms. Hicks said.Still,\nthe hope among Republicans is that Mr. Trump will be seen by many voters as a\nself-contained phenomenon: a one-man celebrity road show who does not reflect\nthe totality or the values of the Republican Party.There is some optimism that\nMr. Trump may prove useful to candidates in specific areas, helping draw out\nblue-collar voters in places like western Wisconsin and eastern Ohio. Yet\nearly public polling and primary results suggest he would struggle badly in\nsuburban, educated areas, and especially with women, Hispanics and black\nvoters. Even in states where he won Republican primaries, like Georgia and\nVirginia, he lost many affluent suburban communities.In Virginia, for example\n— home to rapidly growing Hispanic and Asian populations, and multiple\ncompetitive congressional races — Mr. Trump won the primary by a few\npercentage points. But Senator Marco Rubio of Florida crushed him in densely\npopulated Fairfax County, a diverse and relatively affluent Washington suburb\nwhere elections in the state are often decided.A small number of Republicans\nin difficult races, like Representatives Robert Dold of Illinois and Carlos\nCurbelo of Florida, have said that they will not vote for Mr. Trump or that\nthey are undecided about supporting him over Mrs. Clinton.“Donald Trump’s\nhighly offensive comments toward millions of Americans — toward women, to\nLatinos, to Muslims, to veterans — have, in my view, really disqualified him\nfrom serving as our commander in chief,” said Mr. Dold, who represents a\nmoderate, highly educated district in suburban Chicago.Of his own vote, Mr.\nDold said, “I will probably be writing someone in.”Other Republicans have not\nyet gone that far, but have taken pains to emphasize their own, locally\nsignificant accomplishments.And conservative groups tied to the billionaire\ndonors Charles G. and David H. Koch are planning a major offensive this spring\naimed at keeping the Senate in Republican hands, said James Davis, a spokesman\nfor the Koch-backed group Freedom Partners.Josh Holmes, a top political\nadviser to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said Republicans\nexpected to be able to distinguish their candidates from Mr. Trump, who “has\nbeen introduced to the American electorate as a reality TV host and a lot of\nother things, besides a Republican, over 30 years.”“You could see a scenario\nwhere you’ve got suburban, center-right women supporting a Republican Senate\ncandidate in droves, but not being there on the top of the ticket,” Mr. Holmes\nsaid.But Democrats have already begun a concerted push to link Republicans\nrunning for other offices to Mr. Trump. The Democratic group American Bridge,\nwhich assembles research and video files on Republican candidates, has kept\ntrack of which candidates have pledged to vote for the Republican presidential\nnominee, even if that person is Mr. Trump.A handful of Democratic candidates\nhave begun to exploit that opening. In North Carolina, the Democratic nominee\nfor governor, Roy Cooper, has criticized the incumbent Republican, Pat\nMcCrory, by warning about the policies of a “Trump-McCrory administration.”\nAnd in Arizona, Senator John McCain’s Democratic challenger, Representative\nAnn Kirkpatrick, has rebuked Mr. McCain for repeatedly vowing to vote for the\nRepublican nominee in November.“His rhetoric is offensive and sexist,” Ms.\nKirkpatrick said, “and yet John McCain keeps saying he’ll support Trump in a\ngeneral election.”\n\n","title":"Donald Trump’s Success Upends Battle for Control of Congress - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Donald Trump's nomination could imperil even the Republican party’s seemingly iron grip on the House https://t.co/qLKc9da4Hl","date":"Sat Apr 02 23:40:32 +0000 2016","favs":235,"id":{"$numberLong":"716410016987815936"},"retweets":146},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25BiSHj"}

Mr. Masterson is Rooster, the unsung older\nbrother who replaced Colt 15 years earlier as the not-quite-golden son at\nhome. Sam Elliott is their father, Beau, an anti-P.C. cowboy type who wields\nlove like a weapon. And Debra Winger is their mother, Maggie, who shuttles\nbetween the Airstream behind her bar and the bed of her hardheaded\nspouse.“Danny was one of my first friends out here, and we’ve stayed closely\nconnected over the years,” said Mr. Kutcher, calling from Los Angeles, where\nhe lives with his wife, Mila Kunis — another “’70s Show” alum — and their 18\n-month-old daughter, Wyatt Isabelle. “Even our kids are friends.

And we put this\nkind of Archie Bunker character at the center of it. Rather than make fun of\nthe views of that audience, we decided to speak to them and their belief in\nGod and country. We also felt it would be really topical.**Are things about\n“The Ranch” similar to your upbringing in Iowa?**I was raised in a town with a\nlittle more than 100 people, so I’m pretty familiar with ranching and farming.\nI also know that the heartland isn’t always represented correctly in the\nmedia, and nobody really makes content for them.**Why, after a huge, network\nChuck Lorre show, did you go with Netflix?**We wanted to disrupt the sitcom.\nWe wanted the characters to talk like real people, to use irreverent language,\nto have an edge.

She told\nVICE in an interview that year that the vintners behind it were\n“ganjapreneurs” who were “on the front line of this thing.”The market for\nlegal marijuana products has seen explosive growth in recent years as the drug\nhas become legal in more states. The recreational use of marijuana is legal in\nfour states plus Washington, D.C., and its medical use is permitted in 19\nmore.A report by two marijuana analysis and investment firms, the ArcView\nGroup and New Frontier, estimated that $5.4 billion worth of legal marijuana\nproducts were sold nationwide in 2015, up from $4.6 billion the year before.\nThey predicted $6.7 billion in legal sales in 2016.In an interview with Vanity\nFair magazine, Ms. Goldberg emphasized that her products were intended to be\nmedicinal. She may have alleviated menstrual pain in the past by lighting up a\njoint, but that is not what her new company is all about.“For me, I feel like\nif you don’t want to get high high, this is a product specifically just to get\nrid of discomfort,” she told the magazine. “Smoking a joint is fine, but most\npeople can’t smoke a joint and go to work.”\n\n","title":"Whoopi Goldberg Joins Marijuana Industry With Products for Women - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Whoopi Goldberg is launching a line of marijuana products for women.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013ca"},"content":"Donald J. Trump’s presidential candidacy has stunned the Republican Party. But\nif he survives a late revolt by his rivals and other leaders to become the\nparty’s standard-bearer in the general election, the electoral map now coming\ninto view is positively forbidding.In recent head-to-head polls with one\nDemocrat whom Mr. Trump may face in the fall, Hillary Clinton, he trails in\nevery key state, including Florida and Ohio, despite her soaring unpopularity\nratings with swing voters.In Democratic-leaning states across the Rust Belt,\nwhich Mr. Trump has vowed to return to the Republican column for the first\ntime in nearly 30 years, his deficit is even worse: Mrs. Clinton leads him by\ndouble digits in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.Mr. Trump is so\nnegatively viewed, polls suggest, that he could turn otherwise safe Republican\nstates, usually political afterthoughts because of their strong conservative\ntilt, into tight contests. In Utah, his deep unpopularity with Mormon voters\nsuggests that a state that has gone Republican every election for a half-\ncentury could wind up in play. Republicans there pointed to a much-discussed\nDeseret News poll last month, showing Mrs. Clinton with a narrow lead over Mr.\nTrump, to argue that the state would be difficult for him.Horse-race polls\nthis early are poor predictors of election results, and candidates have turned\naround public opinion before. And the country’s politics have become so\nsharply polarized that no major-party contender is likely to come near the\n49-state defeats suffered by Democrats in 1972 and 1984.But without an\nextraordinary reversal — or the total collapse of whoever becomes his general-\nelection opponent — Mr. Trump could be hard-pressed to win more than 200 of\nthe 270 electoral votes required to win.Mr. Trump has become unacceptable,\nperhaps irreversibly so, to broad swaths of Americans, including large\nmajorities of women, nonwhites, Hispanics, voters under 30 and those with\ncollege degrees — the voters who powered President Obama’s two victories and\nrepresent the country’s demographic future. All view him unfavorably by a\n2-to-1 margin, according to a recent New York Times/CBS News poll.In some\nstates, Mr. Trump has surprised establishment-aligned Republicans with his\nbreadth of support beyond the less-educated men who form his base. Even so,\nhis support in the nominating process, in which some 30 million people may\nultimately vote, would be swamped in a general election, when turnout is\nlikely to be four times that.“We’re talking about somebody who has the\npassionate devotion of a minority and alternately scares, appalls, angers — or\nall of the above — a majority of the country,” said Henry Olsen, a\nconservative analyst. “This isn’t anything but a historic election defeat just\nwaiting to happen.”What could ensure a humiliating loss for Mr. Trump in\nNovember are his troubles with constituencies that have favored Republicans in\nrecent elections. Among independents, a group that Mitt Romney carried even as\nhe lost to President Obama in 2012, Mr. Trump would begin the fall campaign at\na considerable disadvantage: 19 percent have a favorable opinion of him, but\n57 percent view him unfavorably, the Times/CBS survey found. Given his loathed\nstanding among Democrats and the possibility that many in his own party would\nspurn him, Mr. Trump would need to invert his numbers among independents to\neven be competitive in November.With white women, a bloc Mr. Romney easily won\neven in defeat, Mr. Trump is nearly as unpopular: 23 percent view him\nfavorably, while 54 percent have an unfavorable opinion of him. And that was\nbefore Mr. Trump attacked Senator Ted Cruz’s wife, ridiculed a female reporter\nagainst whom Mr. Trump’s campaign manager was charged with committing battery,\nand suggested that women who have abortions should face criminal punishment\nbefore reversing himself.Mr. Trump’s penchant to offend and his household-name\ncelebrity are a potentially lethal combination, as most voters have both firm\nand deeply negative opinions of him. His incendiary comments about minorities\nand the disabled, and proposals to bar Muslims from entering the United States\nor to force Mexico to pay for a wall on the southern border, have resounded so\nwidely that half of all voters said they would be scared if he were elected\npresident, according to the Times/CBS poll.“There is no precedent for this,”\nsaid Neil Newhouse, a veteran Republican pollster. “In the modern polling era,\nsince around World War II, there hasn’t been a more unpopular potential\npresidential nominee than Donald Trump.”Stan Greenberg, the longtime\nDemocratic pollster, released a survey Friday summing up Mr. Trump’s\nvulnerabilities under the headline, “Earthquake?” Mr. Trump trails Mrs.\nClinton by 23 points among women in Mr. Greenberg’s poll, suggesting the\npossibility of a gender gap of historic proportions. (The Times survey last\nmonth had Mrs. Clinton leading by 20 points among women.) The largest gender\ngap in the last 36 years was Bob Dole’s 11-point loss among women against Bill\nClinton in 1996.“His gains with men have been neutralized with women,” Mr.\nGreenberg said of Mr. Trump. “There’s no play here. The math just doesn’t\nwork.”Nationally, Mrs. Clinton leads Mr. Trump by about 10 percentage points\nin most head-to-head polls — the widest margin at this point in a presidential\ncampaign in 16 years.If Mrs. Clinton somehow loses the Democratic race —\nunlikely given her delegate advantage — Mr. Trump could fare even worse in a\ngeneral election against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has higher\nmargins than Mrs. Clinton in head-to-head polling against Mr. Trump in most\nswing states.Even among the working-class whites, who have been the foundation\nof his success in the Republican primaries, Mr. Trump would enter the general\nelection with substantial difficulties. He is viewed unfavorably by a majority\nof whites without college degrees, according to an ABC News/Washington Post\npoll early last month.It is possible that Mr. Trump could improve his standing\nwith blue-collar voters who are crucial in Rust Belt states like Pennsylvania\nand Wisconsin, where polls now show him faring worse than Mr. Romney did in\n2012. But doing so would not be cost-free.“By leaning into white grievance\npolitics, you give back whatever gains you made as you move up the economic\nscale,” said Liam Donovan, a Republican strategist who has written extensively\non Mr. Trump’s vulnerabilities. “There just aren’t enough votes left in the\nplaces where Trump could be strong, like rural areas, to offset the vote-rich\nplaces where Trump repels.”Or, as Mr. Olsen put it, referring to Michigan: “If\nyou bring in 30,000 blue-collar voters from Flint, but you lose 50,000 from\nsuburban Detroit, you’ve not helped yourself very much.”This losing trade-off\nhas been largely overlooked because of Mr. Trump’s success so far and the\nfailure of more affluent Republican primary voters to unite behind any of his\nrivals.But the general-election universe is vastly larger and more diverse\nthan the Republican primary electorate. There are likely to be around 30\nmillion votes in this year’s Republican primary once all 56 states and\nterritories finish voting in June. In the 2012 contest between Mr. Obama and\nMr. Romney, about 129 million voters cast ballots.“You’re talking about a\nsignificantly more conservative, partisan, older and whiter group of voters\nthan the general electorate,” Mr. Newhouse said. “It’s like night and day.”Mr.\nTrump’s hopes rest largely on his energizing a coalition of the disaffected:\nmillions of people who have not voted in recent elections but who have found\nin Mr. Trump someone giving voice to their anger. High primary turnouts have\nfed speculation that Mr. Trump could lure back the so-called missing white\nvoters — populist-minded Americans thought to have skipped the 2012\npresidential election, and who, depending on their numbers, offer a glimmer of\nhope for many conservatives in an era of unfavorable demographic shifts.But\nMr. Trump cannot count on such a surge. The actual number of missing white\nvoters is quite low in the closely contested states, where turnout remained\nhigh or even rose in 2012.Moreover, there is scant evidence that white voters\nwho did stay home would be inclined to support Mr. Trump. In fact, they were\nfar younger and much more likely to be registered Democrats than the white\nvoters who did turn out, according to the census and data from L2, a\nnonpartisan voter file vendor.\n\n","title":"Electoral Map Is a Reality Check to Donald Trump’s Bid - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"In recent head-to-head polls, Donald Trump trails Hillary Clinton in every key state https://t.co/h16GOXnJbQ","date":"Sat Apr 02 23:10:05 +0000 2016","favs":374,"id":{"$numberLong":"716402353365196801"},"retweets":242},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1POtDKR"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013cb"},"content":"MOSCOW — Donald J. Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate, was\nwidely condemned when he called for the United States to “take out the\nfamilies” of terrorists.His approach — even after he clarified that he was not\ntalking about killing the relatives — was dismissed by many as immoral and\nunlawful. Yet, it is the very tactic that Russia has pursued for decades.It is\nthe signature, though officially unacknowledged, policy behind Moscow’s\ncounterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategies, and Russia’s actions in\nsmashing a Muslim separatist rebellion in the Caucasus provide a laboratory\nfor testing Mr. Trump’s ideas.The family ties that bind in terrorist groups\ncame into focus last week after the police in Brussels disclosed that two of\nthe three suicide bombers in the attacks there were brothers, Ibrahim and\nKhalid el-Bakraoui. All told, analysts estimate that a third of the\nparticipants in terrorist acts are related to another attacker.In the conflict\nthat began in Chechnya and has since metastasized into a loosely organized\nIslamic rebellion throughout the Caucasus region, Russian security services\nroutinely arrest, torture and kill relatives, rights groups say.The Russian\napproach, enough to make supporters of waterboarding wince, has by some\naccounts been grimly effective. Abductions of family members unwound the rebel\nleadership in Chechnya, for example.And siblings have a bloody track record\nhere, as elsewhere.In 2004, Chechen sisters blew themselves up in an airplane\nand a subway station a week apart. In 2011, the police say, a teenager and his\nolder sister from Ingushetia, another troubled region, helped build a bomb\nthat their brother exploded in the unguarded arrivals hall of Domodedovo\nAirport in Moscow, killing himself and 36 other people.In the Russian view,\nthe family is the thread that needs to be pulled to unravel the terrorist\ngroup.“He should understand his relatives will be treated as accomplices,”\nKirill V. Kabanov, a member of President Vladimir V. Putin’s human rights\ncouncil, said of a potential suicide attacker.“When a person leaves to become\na terrorist, he can kill hundreds of innocents,” he said. “Those are the\nmorals we are talking about. We should understand, the relatives must fight\nthis first. If the relative, before the fact, reported it, he is not guilty.\nIf he did not, he is guilty.”By law, Russian security services have no\nauthority to specifically target relatives. But the intelligence forces seldom\nlet a detail like the lack of a legal basis interfere with their activities.In\nChechnya and neighboring Dagestan, they routinely burn or demolish the houses\nof people suspected of being insurgents or terrorists. Most strikingly, whole\nextended families are rounded up in high-profile cases, and are often held\nuntil the militant either gives up or is killed.Maryam Akmedova, from\nKabardino-Balkaria region in the North Caucasus, has seen it firsthand.\nDistressing though it was, she says she understood when Russian prosecutors\naccused her eldest son of participating in a terrorist attack, as he had never\ndenied his involvement.But her woes hardly stopped there.Soon enough, security\nagents were questioning her younger son, though there was no evidence linking\nhim to the attack his brother was accused of in the city of Nalchik in 2005.\nEventually, the younger brother was shot and killed in 2013 by Russian\nsecurity forces during an attempted arrest under murky circumstances.“He had\nno involvement with anything,” Ms. Akmedova said in a telephone interview.\n“They killed him because his brother was in prison.”The most sweeping\napplication of the tactic came during the pacification of Chechnya, after Mr.\nPutin engineered the recapture of the separatist territory early in his\ntenure.Relatives were used as “hooks” to lure in militants. If the militant\ndid not switch sides, the family member disappeared. Chechnya had about 3,000\nto 5,000 unresolved disappearances from 2000 to 2005 or so. The policy,\nexecuted by the Chechen leader, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, the scion of a prominent\nChechen family that itself switched sides, broke the organized resistance.The\nRussian security services have also manipulated relatives for various ends,\nsuch as to inadvertently pass poisoned food to suspected militants on the\nrun.The practice, not surprisingly, has spawned dozens of cases in the\nEuropean Court of Human Rights and widespread criticism of tactics that, while\nseemingly effective in the short term, have deeply alienated extended families\nwhose members bear grudges to this day.“There is systematic abuse of the\nfamily members of insurgents,” Ekaterina Sokirianskaia, an analyst at the\nInternational Crisis Group, and an expert on the Caucasus, said in a telephone\ninterview.“There can be short-term results, but I wouldn’t call it success,”\nshe said. “You can prevent some episodes of violence at the moment, but you\nare radicalizing whole communities.”“When innocent Muslims are targeted for\nthe expediency of security services, this legitimizes the jihadist cause,” she\nsaid.Ms. Akmedova explained how the sense of injustice and outrage develops.\nAfter her younger son was killed in 2013, she said, the police came by and\ntold her and her son’s widow that the grandchildren, despite being in\nkindergarten and elementary school, would be put on watch lists.“The children\ngo to kindergarten,” Ms. Akmedova, 63, a retired drugstore clerk, said. “They\nare no different from any other children.”In perhaps the highest-profile\noperation, Russian security services detained in 2004 several dozen members of\nthe extended family of the Chechen rebel defense minister, Magomed Khambiyev,\nincluding the wives of his brothers. Aslanbek Khambiyev, a 19-year-old cousin\nwith no known ties, other than familial, was abducted from a university,\nbeaten semiconscious and shoved from a car in the rebel leader’s home\nvillage.“Yes, they detained my relatives,” Magomed Khambiyev told the\nKommersant newspaper after he surrendered to save their lives. “But they were\nguilty. Do you understand? Because they were my relatives.”“If I’m a bandit,\nthen they’re bandits, too,” he explained.\n\n","title":"Russia Shows What Happens When Terrorists’ Families Are Targeted - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Russia shows what happens when terrorists' families are targeted https://t.co/FbnbzywLaa","date":"Sat Apr 02 22:42:50 +0000 2016","favs":162,"id":{"$numberLong":"716395494109478912"},"retweets":133},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25BiSHf"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013cc"},"content":"WASHINGTON — In Douglas Laux’s final days as a C.I.A. officer, the futility of\nhis mission prompted him to quote George Orwell to his boss.Mr. Laux had spent\nmonths in 2012 working with various Middle Eastern nations that were trying to\nship arms to Syria to help disparate rebel groups there. But it had become\nclear to him that the C.I.A had little ability to control the squabbling and\nbackstabbing among the Saudis, Qataris and other Arabs.He told a senior C.I.A.\nofficer he felt like Winston Smith, the character in “1984” known for his\nfatalism, because he was carrying out his work without comprehending the\npolitics and competing agendas thwarting progress in aiding the rebellion. “I\nunderstand the how,” Mr. Laux said, paraphrasing one of Smith’s famous lines.\n“I do not understand the why.”It is a sentiment that might sum up much of Mr.\nLaux’s career at the C.I.A., an organization he served for eight years as an\nundercover case officer and soldier in the agency’s shadowy conflicts\noverseas. His career at the agency began with a tour at a remote firebase in\nsouthern Afghanistan and ended with a spot on the agency’s Syria Task Force —\na life in war zones that is emblematic of the lives of a large cadre of\nAmerican spies who joined the C.I.A. after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. He\nleft the agency three years ago, but is speaking publicly about his\nexperiences there for the first time in conjunction with the release of a\nmemoir.The collective weight of all C.I.A. memoirs written since the Sept. 11,\n2001, attacks could collapse a bookshelf, but Mr. Laux brings a raw\nperspective to the canon. His memoir is not filled with recollections of White\nHouse meetings or lengthy defenses of waterboarding. Mr. Laux was thousands of\nmiles from Washington, a grunt in a secret war.“We have officers who have only\ndone war-zone stuff since they walked in the door,” said Mr. Laux, an intense,\nsometimes edgy 33-year-old with an athletic build and a trimmed beard. “The\nbig question for the C.I.A. is whether it can be sustained, and whether it\nfinds enough people to invest that time psychologically and emotionally.” Mr.\nLaux spoke in a recent interview in a quiet Washington bar owned by one of his\nfriends.He arrived in southern Afghanistan as part of a surge of C.I.A.\nofficers to the country in early 2010, at the same time that President Obama\nhad ordered the deployment of tens of thousands of additional military service\nmembers in the hope of beating back a resurgent Taliban. He lived in a\nconcrete fortress that was once a prison built by the Soviets during their war\nin Afghanistan in the 1980s, part of a ramshackle base surrounded by razor\nwire. He spoke Pashto, which he learned during his C.I.A. training.Raised in\nrural Indiana, Mr. Laux had never ventured far from home when he watched the\nWorld Trade Center crash to the ground via a television on the campus of\nIndiana University, where he was a freshman. He submitted an online\napplication to the C.I.A. in his senior year — he had noticed an advertisement\nfor the spy agency on a campus job board — waited months and, after a series\nof mysterious phone calls, was told to report for an interview in Washington.\nHe was accepted into a C.I.A. program that eventually led to the standard\ncourse for operations officers at “the Farm,” the agency’s training facility\nat Camp Peary in Virginia.Mr. Laux was in Afghanistan when American troops\nwere dying in large numbers, many of them from roadside bombs built in\nmakeshift factories across the border in Pakistan. In his book, Mr. Laux\nrecounts how he ran a web of informants to try to hunt down people who had\nturned the bomb making into a lucrative business. (The book’s title, “Left of\nBoom,” is Pentagon-ese for efforts by soldiers and spies to dismantle the\nmilitant networks before they were able to plant the bombs.)The role that\nPakistan’s intelligence service, the Directorate for Inter-Services\nIntelligence, played in the bomb making is most likely central to Mr. Laux’s\nstory, but C.I.A. censors have blacked out those sections, along with other\nlarge chunks of the narrative, as part of an agency review process required\nfor all books by former C.I.A. employees.Mr. Laux said he was struck by how\nlittle the military seemed to know about Afghanistan after so many years in\nthe country, and that many C.I.A. officers had developed little more insight.\nSoldiers and spies served short tours of duty — with much of that time spent\njust becoming familiar with their surroundings — and then turned their jobs\nover to new arrivals forced to make the same mistakes as their predecessors.By\n2011, Mr. Laux said it became a common refrain among Americans in Afghanistan\nthat the United States had not been in the country for 10 years. “It had been\nin Afghanistan one year, 10 times,” he said.Thousands of American troops were\npatrolling eastern Afghanistan hunting for Taliban fighters, while C.I.A.\noperatives focused almost exclusively on Al Qaeda. Mr. Laux recalls the\nconfusion this sowed, and the occasionally tragicomic results.One example was\nthe military’s regular practice of broadcasting on Pashto-language radio\nstations the names of Taliban fighters they were hunting, offering money for\ninformation about their possible whereabouts. Mr. Laux and other C.I.A.\nofficers, not knowing of the military broadcasts, would pay people who\napproached them with what they claimed was specific information about the same\nnames that had been on the military broadcasts. The information was often\nbogus.Mr. Laux and his colleagues, who at first thought it was valuable\nintelligence about high-level Taliban fighters, eventually realized it was a\ngame that had been going on for years. The Americans were desperate for\nintelligence, and some Afghans were exploiting that desperation to line their\npockets.Mr. Laux, concerned about reprisals from his former employer, refused\nto give details about what is in the redacted sections of his book — including\na section about collecting information about a Qaeda operative who appears to\nhave been killed by a C.I.A. drone. A source had been tracking the operative,\nand one day sent Mr. Laux a text message “*73”— the signal that the operative\nwas in a specific location.Mr. Laux said that 20 minutes later, his source\nconfirmed that the Qaeda militant, given the code-name Scimitar, had been\nkilled. But how he was killed is redacted from the book.“He ended up dying,”\nis all Mr. Laux would say about the operation’s outcome.He returned from\nAfghanistan feeling a stranger in his own country, and his life began a\ndownward spiral of alcohol and OxyContin. Mr. Laux said he tried hard to keep\nhis substance abuse from his bosses at the C.I.A., who had little oversight\nover case officers in between their overseas postings.The C.I.A. initially\ndeclined to comment when it was asked earlier this week about Mr. Laux’s book.\nOn Friday afternoon, a spokesman said in a statement that maybe “with age and\ngreater maturity” Mr. Laux might at one point have a different perspective on\nhis time at the agency.“The American people should know that his former\ncolleagues continue to do extraordinary work despite his departure, and do so\nwithout the need for public recognition,” said the spokesman, Ryan Trapani.In\nthe spring of 2012, as the civil war in Syria escalated, the C.I.A. sent Mr.\nLaux to the Middle East as part of the agency’s nascent task force charged\nwith making contact with the Syrian rebels.He developed relationships with the\nrebels, but frustration followed. The Obama administration was deeply divided\nover how much to support the rebels, and Saudi Arabia and Qatar and other\nnations decided to arm them on their own, usually keeping their efforts from\nthe C.I.A. Many of the details of Mr. Laux’s time working on the Syria\noperation are redacted. A version of a plan he drafted to arm the Syrian\nrebels was eventually adopted by David H. Petraeus, the C.I.A. director, who\nthen proposed it to the Obama White House.He left the agency in 2013, burned\nout from the deployments and frustrated by bureaucracies both foreign and\ndomestic. He said he began writing the book almost immediately after leaving\nthe C.I.A., when the memories and emotions were fresh.He insists that the book\nshould not be read for cosmic conclusions about the state of American\nintelligence, but as the account of one person’s C.I.A. career. But he hopes\nit can be a useful snapshot for understanding how the post-9/11 wars changed\nthe C.I.A., and the lives of the people who fought them.Or, he jokes, maybe it\nis a self-help book.“Want to kick your drug habit?” he said. “Go to Syria.”\n\n","title":"A C.I.A.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013cd"},"content":"ELKHART, Ind. — Seven years ago President Obama came to this northern Indiana\ncity, where unemployment was heading past 20 percent, for his first trip as\npresident. Ed Neufeldt, the jobless man picked to introduce him, afterward\ndonned three green rubber bracelets, each to be removed in turn as joblessness\nfell to 5 percent in the county, the state and the nation.It took years — in\n2012, Mr. Neufeldt lamented to a local reporter that he might wear his\nwristbands “to my casket” — but by last year they had all come off. Elkhart’s\nunemployment rate, at 3.8 percent, is among the country’s lowest, so low that\nemployers here in the self-described R.V. capital of the world are advertising\nelsewhere for workers, offering sign-up bonuses, even hiring from a local\nhomeless shelter.Mr. Obama, whose four trips here during 2008 and 2009 tracked\nthe area’s decline, is expected to return for the first time in coming weeks,\nboth to showcase its recovery and to warn against going back to Republican\neconomic policies. Yet where is Mr. Neufeldt leaning in this presidential\nelection year? He may keep a photograph of himself and Mr. Obama on a desk at\nthe medical office he cleans nightly, but he is considering Donald J. Trump.“I\nlike the way he just won’t take nothing off of nobody,” Mr. Neufeldt said,\nthough days later he allowed: “He scares me sometimes.”Billboards proclaim,\n“Hiring: Welders. Up to $23/hour,” but for all the progress, many people here\n— like Americans elsewhere — harbor unshakable anxiety about stagnant wages,\ntheir economic future and the erosion of the middle class generally.\nAntigovernment resentments over past bank bailouts linger, stoked by\ncandidates in both parties (though taxpayers got their money back, with\ndividends). And social issues such as abortion, gun rights, same-sex marriage,\nthe Affordable Care Act and immigration loom larger than any other for some\nvoters.The enduring wounds of the Great Recession, together with discouraging\neconomic trends that long predated it, have fueled anger on the left but\nespecially on the right, thanks to Mr. Trump, the maverick Republican front-\nrunner. Mr. Obama is not getting the recognition historically accorded a\npresident who presides over economic revival, but then again, neither are\ndivided Republicans seen as offering a positive alternative.“Whether he gets\nthe credit or not, people’s home equity has gone back up, fuel prices are the\nbest we’ve had in a long time, there’s a lot of things that make this all go,”\nLarry Thompson, a former longtime mayor of nearby Nappanee and a Republican,\nsaid as he showed off an expanding cabinetry factory, Kountry Wood\nProducts.“But I think that maybe it’s just some of the other things he’s been\ninvolved with that people in our area” — Mr. Thompson stopped, shaking his\nhead in unspoken reference to various social issues.For Mr. Obama, pondering\nhis legacy and hearing how it is debated in the contest for his successor, the\ndearth of credit is plainly vexing. “We avoided a Great Depression,” he\ninterjected during an onstage interview last month in Austin, Tex., adding\nsardonically, “Thanks, Obama.”Few people here are thanking him for their\nrecovery, despite benefits from the administration’s $800 billion stimulus\npackage — Mr. Obama came here in August 2009 to personally announce one grant\n— and from the rescues of the auto and financial industries.“He gets very,\nvery little credit, and I think that’s too bad because we got quite a bit of\nhelp,” said Dick Moore, Elkhart’s mayor the past eight years, a Democrat who\nlost election to a third term in November. “I don’t know what we would have\ndone without it.”Instead, it is Mr. Trump who is making the impression. The\nNew York billionaire routinely attacks Carrier Corporation since it announced\nin February that it would close two Indiana factories and shift about 2,000\nheating and air-conditioning jobs to Mexico. Recently a high school basketball\ngame west of here drew national attention after students hoisted Trump signs\nand taunted “Build that wall!” at fans from the rival, heavily Latino\nschool.Many workers remain discouraged. Around Elkhart, “People still don’t\nfeel like they’re doing well,” said Mike Perez, a director at Faith Mission,\nwhich provides meals for the poor and shelter for about 150 who are homeless.\nMany earn less than before the recession, he said. “There still isn’t a sense\nthat everything’s O.K.”In 2008 Mr. Obama won Indiana, the first Democratic\npresidential candidate to do so since 1964. In 2012 he did not even contest\nthe state. Among those who opposed him was Mr. Neufeldt. Now 69, he holds four\npart-time jobs, but boasts that a daughter and three sons-in-law again have\ngood jobs in Elkhart’s boom-and-bust recreational vehicle industry where he\nworked 32 years. His problem with the president is over abortion.Brian A.\nHowey, publisher of the Howey Politics Indiana newsletter and once a reporter\nin Elkhart, sounded stumped, even allowing for the state’s conservatism: “I’m\na lifelong Hoosier. I’m just amazed that not only do people not appreciate\nwhat happened in ’09, but there’s a lot of hostility toward Obama. I think\npart of it is racial and a lot of it is political.”“This state stood to lose\n150,000 auto jobs if Chrysler and G.M. had liquidated,” Mr. Howey added. “We\nwould have had a bona fide depression here.”Senator Joe Donnelly, a Democrat\nwho represented this area in the House until his election to the Senate in\n2012, likewise praised the administration’s auto and financial rescues for\naverting disaster. “President Obama had about half the people on his own team\ntelling him to let Chrysler go,” he recalled.Now, Mr. Donnelly noted, Chrysler\nplants employ more than 5,000 people to the south in Kokomo, up from 100 at\ntheir nadir, and 7,000 statewide. Yet autoworkers are more apt to complain\nabout the president’s gun proposals than to acknowledge the auto\nturnaround.While Indiana’s presidential primaries are relatively late in the\nrace — May 3 — and polls are lacking, Mr. Howey predicted that Mr. Trump would\ndo well.Nearly half of Elkhart County’s jobs are in manufacturing, a higher\nproportion than in all but 13 of the 3,140 counties nationwide, according to\nJerry Conover, director of the Indiana Business Research Center at Indiana\nUniversity. With so many skilled factory workers, he said, local wages are\nabove national averages though education levels are relatively modest.For\n2014, economic growth was up 48 percent from 2001, double the nation’s growth\nrate. Yet the area’s reliance on a narrow range of manufacturing, mostly\nR.V.-related, makes it “quite vulnerable,” Mr. Conover said. Locals’ awareness\nof that possibility explains some of their economic insecurity.Mr. Obama\nsought to help the county diversify, with $39 million from the stimulus money\nto develop electric trucks at a former R.V. factory. But the effort fizzled,\nthe owners sold the plant and now it is back to making R.V.s exclusively. (Mr.\nNeufeldt, still a believer in Mr. Obama’s push for green jobs, again wears\ngreen wristbands to signify that cause.)Additional stimulus money went to\nimprove the municipal airport and local highways, buy law enforcement\nequipment, remove lead and weatherize buildings — purposes that did not create\nmany jobs but helped avoid layoffs, said Kyle Hannon, the president of the\nGreater Elkhart Chamber of Commerce.“We knew we would be back,” Mr. Hannon\nsaid, reflecting locals’ sense of their resilience and self-sufficiency,\nregardless of government’s hand.Now, with unemployment so low, local leaders\nsay the challenge is finding workers who can pass employers’ drug\ntests.“Everybody is back to work,” Mr. Neufeldt said recently, driving past\nonce-closed plants lining county roads, their lots full of employees’ vehicles\nand, in many, newly manufactured R.V.s.Mark Dobson, the president of the\nEconomic Development Corporation of Elkhart County, said his group was using\nsocial media to advertise widely that Elkhart offers “head-of-household\nopportunities” — industrial jobs that pay perhaps $75,000, enough for a single\nwage earner to sustain a family.“Anytime we see a mention of a plant closure\nand some significant number of people who have been laid off” — like from\nCarrier — “we’re making sure they know there are jobs in Elkhart County,” Mr.\nDobson said.Busy employers also are turning to Faith Mission, the homeless\nshelter. Dan Browning, its programming director, said he gets dozens of calls\nmonthly — the previous day a boat maker sought 75 workers — and no longer\ndeals with companies that will not pay more than minimum wage.“Now the\nemployers are desperate,” he said. “Before it was the workers who were\ndesperate.”\n\n","title":"Obama Gets Scant Credit in Indiana Region Where Recovery Was Robust - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Elkhart, Ind., devastated by recession, has crawled back.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013ce"},"content":"WASHINGTON — Hospices often bill Medicare for a higher level of care than\npatients need, and Medicare often pays twice for the prescription drugs\nprovided to people who are terminally ill, federal investigators say in a new\nreport. The extra cost to Medicare was put at more than $260 million a\nyear.“Many hospices have been billing far more than they should have,” said\nNancy T. Harrison, a deputy regional inspector general at the Department of\nHealth and Human Services who led the investigation.The investigators found\nthat Medicare was paying hospices almost four times as much as it should have\nfor some patients. The patients were receiving “inpatient care” when all they\nneeded was less-expensive routine care in their homes, the report\nsaid.Medicare now pays hospices an all-inclusive rate of $720 a day for\ninpatient care and no more than $187 a day for routine home care.Most hospice\ncare is provided to Medicare beneficiaries in their homes. But if their pain\nor symptoms become too difficult to manage at home, they can be admitted to a\nhospital, nursing home or hospice inpatient unit.The department’s inspector\ngeneral, Daniel R. Levinson, found that hospices were billing Medicare for a\nhigher, more expensive level of care than patients needed in about a third of\nsuch cases.In response to the report, Andrew M. Slavitt, the top Medicare\nofficial, said he was stepping up supervision of hospices because he was\nconcerned about “care being billed for but not provided, long lengths of stay\nand beneficiaries receiving unnecessary care.”Medicare’s hospice benefit\ncovers a combination of medical, social and counseling services, as well as\nprescription drugs, for people with a life expectancy of six months or less.\nIt emphasizes the alleviation of pain and suffering rather than the cure of\nillness. Hospice patients generally forgo Medicare coverage for curative\ntreatment of the terminal illness and related conditions.In about 20 percent\nof hospice claims for inpatient care, Mr. Levinson said, the Medicare\nbeneficiary did not need such care at all. In another 10 percent, he said, the\npatient needed the higher level care for only part of the inpatient stay.And\n“in 1 percent of stays,” he said, “there was no evidence that the beneficiary\nelected hospice care or was even certified as having a terminal\nillness.”Commenting on the report, William A. Dombi, a vice president of the\nNational Association for Home Care and Hospice, a trade group, said: “There\nare no real objective standards to determine when people need inpatient care.\nSome hospices tend to use it much more than others.”The standard daily rate,\npaid to hospices by Medicare, covers the cost of prescription drugs that are\nused primarily to relieve pain and manage symptoms related to a patient’s\nterminal illness. But investigators found that some patients also had\ninsurance coverage under Part D of Medicare that paid for the same\ndrugs.“Medicare is paying twice when Part D pays for drugs that are already\ncovered” by the hospice benefit, the report said. In these cases, it said,\nbeneficiaries may incur extra costs, in co-payments under Part D of\nMedicare.In two cases cited by the inspector general, Medicare paid hospices\nfor providing more than seven weeks of inpatient care to people who needed\nonly routine home care.The findings came two weeks after an influential\nfederal panel, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, expressed concern\nthat some hospices were seeking out profitable patients, “some of whom may not\nmeet the eligibility criteria.”“In 2014,” the commission said in a report to\nCongress, “Medicare spent nearly $9 billion, more than half of all hospice\nspending that year, on patients with stays exceeding 180 days.”Since Medicare\npays a daily rate for hospice care, the commission said, “long stays are more\nprofitable than short stays.”In 2014, it said, the average length of stay was\nhigher among for-profit hospices than among nonprofit hospices: 107 days,\ncompared with 67 days. And for-profit hospices had a higher return on their\nMedicare business, meaning that their Medicare payments exceeded their costs\nby a wider margin.Ms. Harrison, from the inspector general’s office, said, “We\nfound that for-profit hospices were more likely than other hospices to bill\ninappropriately for general inpatient care.”Jonathan Keyserling, a senior vice\npresident of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, a\nnonprofit group that represents providers of hospice care, said, “Any\ninappropriate behavior or spending is unacceptable and ought to be rectified.”\nMr. Keyserling said the group had advised its members to pay strict attention\nto the requirements for inpatient care.Of the Medicare beneficiaries who died\nin 2014, 48 percent used hospice care, up from 23 percent in 2000, according\nto the Medicare payment commission.“It’s extraordinarily gratifying to see\nhospice so widely accepted,” Mr. Keyserling said. “It shows that we are\nmeeting the needs of patients and their families in a holistic fashion.”\n\n","title":"Medicare Is Often Overbilled by Hospices, and Pays Twice for Some Drugs - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Medicare is often overbilled by hospice and often pays twice for drugs provided to the terminally ill, report says https://t.co/niAhHaI7Vw","date":"Sat Apr 02 21:53:44 +0000 2016","favs":167,"id":{"$numberLong":"716383138373623808"},"retweets":148},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1qnYAB4"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013cf"},"content":"Virgin America, founded on the premise of being a cool airline shuttling\npeople from New York to California in style, is near a deal to sell itself to\na competitor originally created to ferry people 330 miles across Alaska.Alaska\nAirlines is poised to buy Virgin for about $2 billion, a person briefed on the\nmatter said on Saturday, describing a move that would unite two popular\nsmaller airlines in the latest round of consolidation within the\nindustry.Should Alaska reach an agreement to acquire Virgin — details were\nstill being negotiated and could still fall apart — an announcement could come\nas soon as Monday, said the person, who was not authorized to speak about the\nmatter.A sale of Virgin would be the latest instance of deal-making in an\nindustry that has shrunk drastically over the past decade, concentrating power\nin the hands of a few major airlines.Virgin, Alaska and JetBlue compete in a\ntier below the giants that are American, Delta and United. When Virgin put\nitself up for sale this year, it drew preliminary interest from a host of\npotential suitors. But the biggest domestic airlines, constrained by antitrust\nregulations, soon gave way to smaller competitors eager to expand their\nnetworks.Alaska and JetBlue squared off in the final round of bidding, with\nofficial offers coming in recent days. But Alaska, one of the rare airlines to\nhold an investment-grade credit rating and one with more cash on its books\nthan some others, appears to have triumphed.During the contest, Alaska also\nargued that it would need to divest fewer airport slots than JetBlue would,\nsince its network has fewer overlaps with Virgin’s, according to the person\nbriefed on the matter.Any transaction will probably draw close scrutiny from\ngovernment regulators, who have become more suspicious of airline mergers\nbecause of the potential for them to result in higher prices. The Justice\nDepartment went to court to challenge American’s takeover of US Airways,\nthough it lost that legal fight.A sale of Virgin would mean a quick end to\nindependence for an airline that began flying more than a decade ago. The\ncompany was the brainchild of Richard Branson, the outspoken billionaire\nbehind the Virgin empire of brands.The idea behind Virgin was to create a new\nlower-cost carrier with a higher level of service than traditional airlines\nprovided, furnishing its planes with purple lighting, onboard Wi-Fi and\ninteractive video displays.The company went public in the fall of 2014, and as\nof Friday’s market close it was valued around $1.5 billion.While the company\nshares a name with Mr. Branson’s kingdom, the British mogul holds only a 31\npercent stake in the airline. The hedge fund Cyrus Capital Partners owns 24\npercent.Virgin sometimes complained that it had trouble competing against\nbigger rivals for necessary space at desirable airports, potentially prompting\nthe company to consider becoming part of a larger rival.Acquiring Virgin would\ngive Alaska — which despite its name and origins has been based in Seattle for\ndecades — an opportunity to expand into the lucrative California market,\nparticularly in the hubs of San Francisco and Los Angeles.Alaska’s capacity of\nseats offered at San Francisco International Airport would rise to about 15\npercent from 4 percent, while its capacity at Los Angeles International\nAirport would increase to 11 percent from 5 percent.Alaska has steadily moved\nto expand its network beyond the West Coast, pushing into transcontinental\nflights as well as those to Hawaii. But it has faced renewed pressure in its\nhometown, Seattle, from a nominal partner, Delta, which has sought to make the\nPacific Northwest a major hub for its network.The parent company of Alaska,\nwhich also owns Horizon Air, is the country’s sixth-biggest airline by\npassenger count, flying 32 million passengers last year.JetBlue, which was\ncreated by a former executive of Southwest Airlines, is the country’s fifth-\nbiggest airline, moving about 35 million passengers.Virgin America is much\nsmaller and newer, having been founded in 2007. The company, based in the San\nFrancisco area, has a fleet of about 60 single-aisle Airbus planes that fly to\n23 airports in the United States and Mexico.Airlines have been emboldened in\npart by lower oil prices, which have helped them report stronger earnings last\nyear. Virgin America generated almost six times more net income — $340 million\n— in 2015 than in the prior year and had only about $308 million in debt,\naccording to data compiled by S\u0026amp;P Capital IQ.News of the state of the\ndiscussions was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal.\n\n","title":"Alaska Airlines Said to Be Near $2 Billion Deal for Virgin America - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Alaska Airlines is said to be near a $2 billion deal to buy Virgin America https://t.co/7UU6QKBbAT","date":"Sat Apr 02 21:43:03 +0000 2016","favs":165,"id":{"$numberLong":"716380450143473664"},"retweets":212},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1MKkAjn"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013d0"},"content":"HOUSTON — It’s been hard to miss Buddy Hield.There he was at this N.C.A.A.\ntournament, smiling and trash-talking and sprinting up the court on a fast\nbreak to pull up early and sink a 3 from way beyond the arc.And whoa, look at\nHield again, cutting through a cluttered lane as if it were a wide-open slice\nof blacktop on a neighborhood court, for an easy layup that no one could\nstop.Hield, a senior, was here and there and everywhere as Oklahoma’s star\nguard. Not just this season, but in past ones, too. So many seasons that it\nseems like forever.Those Sooners who played with him against Villanova on\nSaturday in a national semifinal — they looked so familiar. Why? Because most\nhad played with Hield for what amounts to an eternity at this level of college\nbasketball.The core four in Oklahoma’s starting five this season — three\nseniors and a junior — each scored at least 1,000 points with the program and\nstarted 105 consecutive games together.That’s one impressive streak,\nconsidering all that could have derailed it. Stomachaches. Twisted ankles.\nFamily problems. Suspensions. A coach who wants to change things up, just\nbecause. Life choices, as in deciding to forgo this college thing to head to\nthe N.B.A. (Because you know Hield is headed to the N.B.A., where he will\nshine.)Instead, the core four — Hield, Isaiah Cousins, Ryan Spangler and\nJordan Woodard — stuck together, which was great for Oklahoma basketball. It’s\nwhy the Sooners came within two victories of a championship.It doesn’t matter\nthat the Sooners were blown out, 95-51, in the semifinal, losing to a\nVillanova team that made a remarkable 71 percent of its shots from the field.\nThis Oklahoma team was still great for college basketball.The one-and-done\nmentality, with players heading to the N.B.A. after just one year, has eroded\nthe richness of the college game. It used to be that Final Four teams were\nchock-full of seniors, players you recognized and rooted for or against, based\non years of past performances. That was part of the beauty of the\ntournament.Not anymore. These days, deep into the championship push, it’s\nuncommon to see a team dominated by players just months from a college degree.\nMore common is seeing underclassmen, and the best of those young players often\nhave one foot in the N.B.A. draft.No one could have guessed that the Oklahoma\nplayers who came together years ago would have clicked the way they did, and\nfor so long. The chemistry they created was a miracle of recruiting by\nOklahoma’s assistants, Coach Lon Kruger said before Saturday’s loss. They\nassembled a Final Four team from guys who couldn’t be more different.Hield\ngrew up in Eight Mile Rock, a village outside Freeport, the Bahamas, where he,\nhis six siblings and his mother slept on the floor, on two mattresses pushed\ntogether. He stole milk crates from his grandmother and sawed off the bottoms\nof them so he could fashion makeshift basketball hoops. He would nail those\nhoops onto backboards he built from plywood he had stripped from\nbuildings.Long past sundown, his mother would shout into the night for Hield\nto come inside — he was keeping everybody awake with his constant dribbling.\nHe arrived at Oklahoma via Sunrise Christian Academy in Wichita, Kan.Then\nthere’s Spangler, a white kid from Bridge Creek — an Oklahoman who had always\nwanted to play at Oklahoma. The problem was that he wasn’t recruited by the\nSooners. So he had to get there via Gonzaga, by transferring after his\nfreshman year.And there’s Woodard, a black kid from Arcadia, Okla., who was\nactually recruited by Oklahoma.From way across the country came Cousins, from\nMount Vernon, N.Y. He’s a tough kid from a tough place, and his mother wanted\nto get him out of there. Then, bad luck: While on a school break in 2014, he\nwas shot in the shoulder when gang members were shooting at one another. He\nbounced right back into basketball, without needing surgery.This season’s\nfifth starter was Khadeem Lattin, whose grandfather David Lattin, known as Big\nDaddy, was one of the players in the all-black Texas Western starting five\nthat beat Kentucky in the 1966 N.C.A.A. title game.“For those backgrounds to\nmesh together would have been hard to project,” Kruger said.But sometimes, for\nsome reason, those players do mesh — and it’s magic.Every player came to\nOklahoma with his own story. But to succeed, the Sooners leaned on Hield, who\naveraged 25 points per game — and 29.3 in the N.C.A.A. tournament before his\ndisappointing 9-point outing against Villanova.That dominance could easily\nstir up jealousy. Yet the others accepted their supporting roles because,\nhonestly, Hield was just so charismatic and likable.Just look at how he\nreacted to Saturday’s embarrassing loss. He didn’t pout or cry or bury his\nhead beneath a towel after Kruger took him out of the game in the waning\nminutes. He turned to his teammates and shook their hands and told them he\nloved them. He assured them that they would be brothers and friends\nforever.“It hurts now, but this one game doesn’t define us,” Hield told them.\n“It’s been fun. It’s a tough loss, but life goes on.”Even before the game,\nKruger reminded his players to appreciate how special their run was.Good\nadvice, because Hield and his team were not only hard to miss; they will also\nbe missed.\n\n","title":"Oklahoma Has a Familiar Look, Now Rarely Seen - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTSports: OU is more than just Buddy Hield, and that's good for college hoops, @JulietMacur explains https://t.co/djMNd70rGv https://t…","date":"Sat Apr 02 21:33:27 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716378035218477056"},"retweets":42},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SJlITI"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013d1"},"content":"FORT PAYNE, Ala. — Nine years ago, when she was 27 and unhappily selling real\nestate, Gina Locklear went to her parents with a proposition. She wanted to\nmake socks. Not the basic white socks the family had specialized in, but\nfashionable socks, with organic cotton and dyes.“I want to get into the sock\nbusiness,” she told them. “I want to make a sustainable sock.”Ms. Locklear,\nnow 36, grew up in the business. Her parents, Terry and Regina Locklear,\nstarted a mill in Fort Payne, Ala., in 1991. They made white sport socks for\nRussell Athletic, millions of them, destined for big-box stores and your own\nfeet if you took gym class.Gina’s younger sister, Emily, recalled the girls\ngoing to the mill after school, where they helped their parents sort socks\ninto dozens or played in the bins. Named after the two daughters, Emi-G\nKnitting bought the Locklears a house, bought Terry a vintage Corvette and\npaid for the girls’ college educations.Still, the idea of Gina and her parents\nmaking organic fashion socks, or any socks at all, seemed totally crazy, given\nthe time and place.The mid-2000s was a devastating period for Fort Payne.\nNestled in the state’s mountainous northeast, the town of 14,000 had for\ndecades billed itself as “the Sock Capital of the World.” The cushioned sock\nwas invented here, and one in every eight pairs of socks sold globally was\nsaid to be knitted in Fort Payne.At the industry’s peak in the 1990s, more\nthan 120 mills employed roughly 7,500 workers. But cheap foreign labor and\nfree-trade agreements made the town a loser in the game of global economics.\nSeemingly overnight, the mills closed, and the new Fort Payne became a town in\nChina called Datang. The 2008 financial crisis finished off those who were\nstill hanging on.“It was like a vacuum cleaner pulled all the people out of\ntown,” Terry said.The Locklears held on to their mill, but barely. Orders\ndried up, including those from Russell Athletic, and they cut the work force\nto almost nothing. Terry’s goal was to keep the lights on, because he knew if\nhe and Regina closed the doors and turned the power off, they’d never start\nback up.“We’d just come here and sit,” Terry said. “We would talk, and it was,\nlike, ‘I just don’t know what we’re going to do.’ We still had our\nknowledge.”It was during these depths that Gina approached her parents with\nher idea. While almost everyone else in the sock business was being thrown to\nthe exits, she passionately wanted in. “I was 12 when my parents started\nmaking socks,” Gina said. “And the realization that our family business might\nclose made me mad.”Her parents were skeptical. They knew how hard it was to\ncompete and how much money it would take to start a brand. They didn’t get the\nwhole organic thing. Most of all, they didn’t want their oldest daughter to do\nsomething she’d soon regret or tire of.“But it’s been everything except any of\nthat,” her father said.Her mother added: “She absolutely loves what she does.\nShe’s on fire.”When you hear the words textile mill, you may picture a brick\nbuilding a century old and as big as a city block. You may hear the clack-\nclack of jittery machinery. But Emi-G Knitting is a modern contained operation\nin a squat metal building on the outskirts of Fort Payne.One recent morning,\nGina was in her office, working on spring orders. She produces two lines:\nZkano, an online brand she started in 2008, and Little River Sock Mill, which\nwas started in 2013 and is sold in stores like Margaret O’Leary in\nManhattan.Zkano’s “crews” and “no shows” are a youthful riot of stripes and\ncolors, while the Little River socks are more refined (the fall line was based\non Southern quilt patterns). Both cost $13 to $30 a pair.Going organic (the\ncotton comes from a farm in Lubbock, Tex., the dyes from North Carolina) has\ngiven Gina a marketing niche. Her socks appeal to millennials, who study\nlabels and like a compelling origin story.“I’m not sure most customers can\ndetect it, but it’s certainly a bonus that they’re made from organic cotton —\nit adds a point of difference,” said Billy Reid, the Alabama-based men’s wear\ndesigner, who partnered with Gina to make socks based on his designs.Last\nfall, Martha Stewart and the editors of Martha Stewart Living presented Gina\nwith an American Made award, which they give each year to a few artisans and\nsmall-business owners to provide a boost of recognition.“Encouraging the\nAmerican public to buy American-made matters,” Ms. Stewart said. “The more\nsocks she sells, the more people she can employ.”Besides, “It’s a sensible\nbusiness,” Ms. Stewart said. “Everyone needs socks. Women are wearing socks as\na fashion statement like never before. Turn the pages of Vogue and almost\nevery fancy dress is worn with a pair of socks.”Indeed, the humble sock is\nhaving a moment. Brands like Stance Socks, which partnered with Rihanna on a\ncollection, and Slate \u0026amp; Stone are selling vibrant hosiery, or pop socks,\nwhile Miu Miu recently outfitted runway models in marled and argyle socks.Gina\nplans to introduce men’s socks to Little River this fall. Zkano already offers\nthem. Tony Hale’s character on “Veep” wears Zkano socks, as does the actor\nhimself.Gina notices socks everywhere she goes, and in winter wears two pairs,\none during daytime, another to bed. Her office décor is entirely hosiery-\nrelated: spools of candy-colored yarn on a shelf, mateless samples pinned to\ncorkboards.She lives with her husband, Al Vreeland, in Birmingham, Ala., an\nhour and a half’s drive away, and spends part of each week in Fort Payne,\nstaying in her childhood bedroom. Her husband, a lawyer, is “cool” with the\narrangement, she said, adding, “It’s been this way ever since we started\ndating.”They were married three years ago, during the busy holiday season, at\na chapel in Santa Fe, N.M., on a Saturday. “We came home on Sunday,” she said.\n“And then I went to Fort Payne on Monday. And that’s my life.”When she’s at\nthe mill, her focus is on the knitting machines and whether they are aiding or\nconspiring against her. The machines are aqua blue and boxy like ovens. Above\nthem, a halo of metalwork holds the yarn being fed into their bellies. Gina\nwatched a machine work, and after a moment, in a Willy Wonka flourish, a\nplastic tube spit out an orange-striped sock.“I love that,” she said.Pointing\nto a machine that was noticeably different from the others, she said: “It’s\nthe newest sock machine you can get. It’s made in Italy. It’s like a\nFerrari.”She spotted Vance Veal, Emi-G’s plant manager, and waved him over.\nWhen her parents laid off all but their most vital workers, they kept him on\nthe payroll. Mr. Veal, 48, has worked in sock mills since he was 18. His\ngrandparents, mother and brothers worked in the mills, too.Since Gina came\nalong with her six-color fashion socks, he has made the machines do things no\none at Emi-G thought possible, himself included. “We didn’t used to make\npattern socks,” Mr. Veal said. “Gina keeps me on my toes. She’s made me better\nat what I do.”In a honeyed voice, Gina said, “Vance is the most patient person\never.”With Mr. Veal’s expertise, Gina can make socks in small batches on site,\nfine-tuning and experimenting with colors, patterns and materials. It’s a\ncompetitive advantage. But running a sock mill in the age of globalization is\na “roller coaster,” she said. Her parents’ business making specialty athletic\nsocks now comes in fits and bursts, nothing like the steady, profitable\nRussell contract. And Zkano and Little River don’t yet sell enough to sustain\nthe mill alone.Last year, Emi-G downsized its work force from 45 to 30. If\nthere is a customer service issue, Gina handles it herself — in addition to\nordering yarn, designing both lines, doing social media marketing, processing\ncredit card orders and lying awake nights with worry.“If something happened to\nVance, I wouldn’t know what we would do,” she said later. “When the sock\nindustry left, a lot of the workers left town, and their knowledge left,\ntoo.”Gina and her parents drove into town to have lunch at what’s referred to\nin Fort Payne as the Big Mill. Now an antique store and restaurant, the Big\nMill is indeed a century-old brick building as big as a city block. It’s where\nW. B. Davis ran the town’s first hosiery mill in the early-1900s. It’s the\nbuilding that begot an industry.Over pimento cheese sandwiches, Terry and\nRegina recalled their beginnings. Terry’s mother had worked in a mill, and his\nolder brother owned one. When he was miserable selling cars down in\nTuscaloosa, it seemed natural to come home and try socks.Asked if the current\nbuilding was their original location, Terry, who is 71 and has a bashful\ncharm, said: “No. I’m almost ashamed to tell you. We started in a renovated\nchicken house.”There was no air-conditioning. In the summer, they would open\nthe big doors on both ends to get a little breeze going. “Birds would fly\nthrough while we worked,” Terry said.With so few mills left in Fort Payne,\nGina and her parents are now the old guard. But with the industry’s\ndiminishment, they carry little of the economic or civic power of the mill\nowners before them.Framed portraits of men like Mr. Davis and W. H. Cobble Sr.\nhang inside the Hosiery Museum, in a historic storefront downtown. The photo\nof V. I. Prewett, the  founder of Prewett Mills, shows a gray-haired man\nholding a pair of tube socks.Among the museum’s historic machinery is a brass\nwhistle on a pole that was once used to signal the start of the workday at the\nBig Mill. In the morning darkness, said Olivia Cox, the vice president of\nlandmarks for DeKalb County, Ala., the mountainside behind the factory\nappeared “lit by fireflies,” with the workers “walking down footpaths by\nlantern light to get to the Big Mill before that whistle blew.”Everyone in\nFort Payne was touched by the hosiery industry in some way. That night, Gina\nstopped for dinner at a barbecue place in town; the young man behind the\ncounter had worked in a machine shop that repaired the type of knitters Emi-G\nuses. His name was Bo Doeg.He and Gina got to reminiscing about Hosiery Week,\na yearly festival that Mr. Doeg described as “Mardi Gras — but for socks.”Mr.\nDoeg shook his head. “This is a different world than it used to be,” he said.\n“Have you seen the vast number of empty buildings?”Gina was back at the mill\nby 8:30 the next morning, logging orders from store buyers and considering\nideas for the next Little River line, which she develops with a designer in\nBirmingham. “We’re thinking about Appalachian florals,” she said.She talked\nabout the challenges she faces, from getting organic cotton at a good price to\nwanting a family but not knowing how, since she spends so much time at the\nmill. “I’ll just be honest, it’s been a struggle,” she said.But she is\ndetermined to keep going, to make Fort Payne a place where socks are once\nagain made by the millions.“It’s hard every day but I still love it,” she\nsaid. “It’s what I want to do forever.”\n\n","title":"The Sock Queen of Alabama - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"An Alabama woman fights to keep a town alive through the power of organic socks https://t.co/mhP8hjOQc6 https://t.co/g3E16vHJEy","date":"Sat Apr 02 21:25:03 +0000 2016","favs":351,"id":{"$numberLong":"716375918164512769"},"retweets":166},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25D5QZQ"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013d2"},"content":"The manufacturing executives had gathered in an Atlanta conference room last\nyear to honor their senior United States senator, Johnny Isakson, for his\ntireless efforts on their behalf in Washington. But as the luncheon wound\ndown, Mr. Isakson found himself facing a man from Coweta County. The man, Burl\nFinkelstein, said trade policies with Mexico and China were strangling the\nfamily-owned kitchen-parts company he helped manage, and imperiling the jobs\nit provided. Mr. Isakson politely brushed him off, Mr. Finkelstein recalled,\nas he had many times before.So when the Georgia primary rolled around this\nmonth, Mr. Finkelstein, along with many others in his town, pulled the lever\nfor Donald J. Trump, who made him feel that someone had finally started\nlistening. “He gets it,” Mr. Finkelstein said in a recent interview. “We’ve\nsold ourselves out.”As the Republican Party collapses on itself, conservative\nleaders struggling to explain Mr. Trump’s appeal have largely seized on his\nunique qualities as a candidate: his larger-than-life persona, his ability to\ndominate the airwaves, his tough-sounding if unrealistic policy proposals.\nOthers ascribe Mr. Trump’s rise to the xenophobia and racism of Americans\nangry over their declining power.But the story is also one of a party elite\nthat abandoned its most faithful voters, blue-collar white Americans, who\nfaced economic pain and uncertainty over the past decade as the party’s\ndonors, lawmakers and lobbyists prospered. From mobile home parks in Florida\nand factory towns in Michigan, to Virginia’s coal country, where as many as\none in five adults live on Social Security disability payments, disenchanted\nRepublican voters lost faith in the agenda of their party’s leaders.In dozens\nof interviews, Republican lawmakers, donors, activists and others described —\nsome with resignation, some with anger — a party that paved the way for a\nTrump-like figure to steal its base, as it lost touch with less affluent\nvoters and misunderstood their growing anguish.“This is absolutely a crisis\nfor the party elite — and beyond the party elite, for elected officials, and\nfor the way people have been raised as Republicans in the power structure for\na generation,” said Ari Fleischer, who served as press secretary for President\nGeorge W. Bush. “If Donald Trump wins, he will change what it means to be a\nRepublican.”Many trace the rupture to the country’s economic crisis eight\nyears ago: While Americans grew more skeptical of the banking industry in the\naftermath, some Republicans played down the frustrations of their own\nvoters.While wages declined and workers grew anxious about retirement,\nRepublicans offered an economic program still centered on tax cuts for the\naffluent and the curtailing of popular entitlements like Medicare and Social\nSecurity. And where working-class voters saw immigrants filling their schools\nand competing against them for jobs, Republican leaders saw an emerging pool\nof voters to court.“They have to come to terms with what they created,” said\nLaura Ingraham, a conservative activist and talk-radio host. “They’ll talk\nabout everything except the fact that their policies are unpopular.”The\ndistance was magnified by the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in the Citizens\nUnited case, which gave wealthy donors rising weight in Republican circles,\neven amid signs that the party’s downscale voters were demanding more of a\nvoice.Most of these voters had long since given up on an increasingly liberal\nand cosmopolitan Democratic Party. In Mr. Trump, they found a tribune: a blue-\ncollar billionaire who stood in the lobby of a Manhattan skyscraper bearing\nhis name and pledged to expand Social Security, refuse the money of big\ndonors, sock it to Chinese central bankers and relieve Americans of unfair\ncompetition from foreign workers.The Democratic Party is also reckoning this\nyear with a populist insurgency, driven in part by economic pain and growing\nanger against Washington and Wall Street. But while Senator Bernie Sanders\ntrails Hillary Clinton in delegates, Mr. Trump’s unlikely campaign has become\na seemingly unstoppable force, one that Republican lawmakers, donors and\nactivists are only now fully confronting.“The Republican Party is being\ndramatically transformed,” said Foster Friess, a Wyoming investor and\nphilanthropist who is among the party’s most significant donors. Republicans\nand Democrats alike, Mr. Friess said, had neglected “the people who truly make\nour country work — the truck drivers, farmers, welders, hospitality\nworkers.”Six years ago, as the 2010 elections neared, everything seemed to be\nfalling into place.Republicans celebrated an impending repudiation of\nPresident Obama in congressional races, in which they would eventually pick up\n63 seats. On the ninth floor of the storied Beresford apartment building on\nCentral Park West, guests clinked glasses at a fund-raiser for Republican\nSenate candidates hosted by Paul Singer, the billionaire investor.A self-\ndescribed Goldwater conservative and proponent of an immigration overhaul\ndeal, Mr. Singer had publicly lamented “indiscriminate attacks by political\nleaders against anything that moves in the world of finance.” In 2010, Mr.\nSinger tripled his campaign giving, doling out almost $3 million in\ncontributions to Republicans.As Mr. Obama’s presidency unfolded, Mr. Singer\nbecame one of the pillars of a new Republican donor class. He gave generously\nto conservative “super PACs” and to the rising political network overseen by\nCharles G. and David H. Koch. He and other donors groomed rising stars like\nMarco Rubio of Florida, a Tea Party ally elected to the Senate in the 2010\nwave, and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the new chairman of the\nHouse Budget Committee.Mr. Ryan, a devotee of supply-side economics and an\nadvocate for privatizing Social Security, became one of the party’s leading\npolicy voices, and later the House speaker. His “Ryan budgets” — which called\nfor large income tax cuts for the wealthy, lower taxes on capital gains and\nthe shifting of Medicare to a voucher system — became the gold standard for\nRepublican policy, and drew plaudits from big donors for their seriousness and\ndepth.In Washington, Republicans read Tea Party anger over Mr. Obama’s health\ncare law as a principled rejection of social welfare programs, despite\nevidence that those voters broadly supported spending  they believed they\ndeserved, like Social Security and Medicare. Amid intense anger at Wall\nStreet, Republicans urged voters to blame the recession on excessively\ngenerous federal home-lending policies, while moving to roll back regulation\nof one of their biggest sources of campaign money, the financial\nindustry.“These voters would have loved someone to stand up and say, ‘We\nshould put someone in jail,’” said Matthew Dowd, former chief strategist to\nPresident Bush.While the party was drawing more of its money from an elite\ngroup of the wealthy, it was drawing more votes from working-class and middle-\nincome whites. Between 2008 and 2012, according to the Pew Research Center,\nmore lower-income and less-educated white voters shifted their allegiance to\nRepublicans.These voters had fled the Democratic Party and were angry at Mr.\nObama, whom they believed did not have their interests at heart. But not all\nof them were deeply conservative; many did not think about politics in\nideological terms at all. A 2011 Pew survey called them the\n“Disaffecteds.”Older white voters with little education beyond high school,\nunder enormous economic stress, the Disaffecteds surged to the Republican\nParty early in Mr. Obama’s first term. But they were as cynical about business\nas they were about government. They viewed immigrants as a burden and an\neconomic threat. They opposed free trade more than any other group in the\ncountry.Some conservative intellectuals warned that the party was headed for\ntrouble. Republicans had become too identified with big business and the\nwealthy — their donor class. They urged Republican lawmakers to embrace\npolicies that could have a more direct impact on pay and economic prospects\nfor these voters: wage subsidies, relocation aid to the long-term unemployed,\neven targeted infrastructure spending. But much of the party’s agenda remained\nfrozen.“They figured, ‘These are conservative voters, anti-Obama voters. We’ll\ngive them the same policies we’ve always given them,’” said James Pethokoukis,\na fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. “High-earner tax cuts, which\npeople are skeptical of; business tax cuts, even though these businesses seem\nto be doing great. It didn’t resonate with the problems in their lives.”During\nthe 2012 campaign, the party’s donors rallied behind Mitt Romney, a patrician\nformer private equity executive. Fully exploiting the Citizens United\ndecision, they poured tens of millions of dollars into a super PAC that helped\nMr. Romney overcome more populist challengers during the primary. Mr. Romney\nadvocated tax cuts and deregulation, and selected Mr. Ryan as his running\nmate. At the Republican National Convention, the party approved a platform\nblasting Mr. Obama for delays in trade deals and pledging to complete\nnegotiations for a new trans-Pacific trade pact. Mr. Trump, who endorsed Mr.\nRomney, was denied a live convention speaking slot.When Mr. Romney lost, the\nRepublican National Committee commissioned a detailed review, as did the Kochs\nand other outside groups. Advisers to the Kochs, finding that Mr. Romney had\nincreased the party’s share of elderly voters, concluded that proposals to\noverhaul entitlements were not hurting Republicans.The committee’s review made\none notable recommendation on policy: The party should “embrace and champion\ncomprehensive immigration reform,” or “our party’s appeal will continue to\nshrink to its core constituencies only.”But rank-and-file Republicans had\nother ideas. For many blue-collar Republicans, anger against Mr. Obama now\nextended to their own party’s leadership, whom they viewed as not only failing\nto stand up to Mr. Obama, but also as colluding with him to make their lives\nworse.They saw illegal immigration not only as a cultural and security threat,\nbut also as an economic one, intertwined with trade deals that had stripped\naway good manufacturing jobs while immigrants competed for whatever work\nremained.In 2013 in western New York, one of the last remaining American\nmanufacturers of dinnerware went out of business, adding 110 lost jobs to the\nRust Belt toll. Representative Chris Collins, a Republican from the Buffalo\narea, had been the plant’s majority owner until the previous year, when voters\nelected him to Congress. His former firm had been undercut by Chinese imports\nthat were a third cheaper, Mr. Collins argued, propped up by Chinese currency\nmanipulation.“I’ve seen what happens when a country is allowed to undersell\nthe U.S.,” said Mr. Collins, who was the first member of Congress to endorse\nMr. Trump. “Those jobs were stolen. And the politicians let it happen.”While\njobs in places like Buffalo were vanishing, Washington was coming to resemble\na gilded city of lobbyists, contractors and lawmakers. In 2014, the median\nwealth of members of Congress reached $1 million, about 18 times that of the\ntypical American household, according to disclosures tabulated by the Center\nfor Responsive Politics. During the same year, real hourly wages remained flat\nor fell for nearly all American workers.Ed McMullen, a public relations\nexecutive who worked for the conservative Heritage Foundation in the 1980s,\nwatched the gulf widen between the Washington establishment and the working\npeople in his home state, South Carolina.“Thirty years later, the same people\nare sitting in Washington that I worked with, making a million a year, going\nto fancy dinner parties, and they’ve done nothing to move the ball,” said Mr.\nMcMullen, who has joined the Trump campaign. “Therein lies the great chasm\nbetween the think tanks, the ideologues and the real world.”In early 2014, a\ngroup of neighbors from a Florida mobile home community called Carriage Cove,\nnear Daytona, took seats in a town-hall-style meeting with Representative Ron\nDeSantis, a Republican. It was a mix of Republicans and Democrats, almost all\nof them seniors living on fixed incomes.They had come to ask Mr. DeSantis why\nhe had put his name on a letter urging Republican leaders to take up Mr.\nObama’s offer of a deal to overhaul Social Security. Mr. DeSantis seemed\ncaught off guard, neighbors who attended the meeting recalled. He did not\nnecessarily agree with everything in the letter, he told them. When they\npersisted, Mr. DeSantis left, explaining that he was not feeling well.In\nVirginia, an unheralded college professor from the Richmond suburbs named Dave\nBrat announced a primary challenge to Representative Eric Cantor, the majority\nleader. Mr. Brat attacked Mr. Cantor for his ties to Wall Street. But as the\ncampaign heated up, Mr. Brat recalled in an interview, he began railing\nagainst his party’s immigration proposals. “I saw this very crony-ist aspect\nof the nation’s power structure pushing this agenda,” Mr. Brat said.That\nmessage helped propel Mr. Brat to victory, though many Republican leaders\ndismissed his election as a fluke. Elsewhere in the country, with the help of\nbusiness groups, they tamped down insurgent conservative candidates. That\nfall, Republicans won control of the Senate — further confirmation, seemingly,\nthat the party had corrected course.But some remained worried. In August 2014,\nKellyanne Conway, a prominent Republican pollster, met with leading Republican\ndonors at a law firm in Chicago. Among the party’s base, immigration remained\na simmering issue, one they should seize. Her polling showed “a new open-\nmindedness to populist approaches, regardless of partisan or ideological\npreferences,” Ms. Conway wrote in a memo to the party’s donors.The donors\nresponded tepidly, Ms. Conway recalled, and were wary of efforts to curb\nimmigration. “They said, ‘We need labor and we need votes.’”Last March,\nRepublican members of the House Ways and Means Committee filed into a Capitol\nHill conference room to discuss trade. The Obama administration, negotiating a\ntrade pact with Pacific Rim nations, was seeking congressional approval to\nfast-track the deal. Opposition was intense not only among labor unions, but\namong many Republican voters, while the party’s leadership, atypically, was\nsupporting Mr. Obama’s effort.For help, the lawmakers turned to Frank Luntz,\nthe Republican messaging guru. For two decades, Mr. Luntz had instructed\nRepublicans on how to talk about thorny issues. Do not say “estate tax.” Say\n“death tax.” Do not privatize Social Security. “Personalize” it.Few issues\nwere now as dangerous to them as trade, Mr. Luntz told the lawmakers,\nespecially a trade pact sought by a president their voters hated. Many\nAmericans did not believe that the economic benefits of trade deals trickled\ndown to their neighborhoods. They did not care if free trade provided them\nwith cheaper socks and cellphones. Most believed free trade benefited other\ncountries, not their own.“I told them to stop calling it free trade, and start\ncalling it American trade,” Mr. Luntz said in an interview. “American\nbusinesses, American services — American, American, American!”While\nRepublicans debated rhetorical approaches, Mr. Trump took a radically\ndifferent tack. Announcing his campaign a few months later, he spun a tale of\nunfair trade deals hashed out by lobbyists, backscratchers and incompetent\npresidents who were stealing jobs from Americans. He would stop the flow of\njobs over the border with Mexico, Mr. Trump promised, and build a wall to stop\nthe flow of people.That message has resonated with lower-income voters, and\nhelped drive Mr. Trump’s string of successes. In Mississippi and Michigan,\nboth of which Mr. Trump won, six in 10 Republican primary voters said that\nfree trade cost the country more jobs that it produced, exit polls showed.But\nit has done little to convince Republican leaders that they need to rethink\ntheir approach or devise new proposals for blue-collar workers who are\nhurting.During a recent interview with CNBC, Mr. Ryan was asked if Republicans\nneeded to respond to less-affluent voters who believed that Republicans were\ntending only to the interests of those at the top.Mr. Ryan, who during the\nsame interview called again for the overhaul of entitlements and the reduction\nof debt, rejected that idea.“People don’t think like that,” he said. “People\nwant to know the deck is fair. Bernie Sanders talks about that stuff. That’s\nnot who we are.”But it is no longer so certain what the Republican Party is.\nThis month, as the party’s leading donors met at the Ritz-Carlton in Miami\nBeach, there was plenty of spirited chatter about Mr. Trump, but less\ndiscussion of the voters who fueled his rise, and little about what could be\ndone to assuage them.Haley Barbour, a former party chairman, spoke as women in\nsundresses and men in dark suits sipped evening cocktails on a patio\noverlooking the Atlantic. In sometimes subdued tones, he told them that he\ncould not predict what would come next.“We’re cursed to live in interesting\ntimes,” Mr. Barbour said. “Anyone that tells you that they’ve seen anything\nlike this, they’ll lie to you about other things. I don’t know where we’re\ngoing to end up.”\n\n","title":"How the G.O.P.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013d3"},"content":"OUR infrastructure is inexcusable, much of our public education is miserable\nand one of our leading presidential candidates is a know-nothing, say-anything\negomaniac who yanks harder every day at the tattered fabric of civil discourse\nand fundamental decency in this country.But let’s by all means worry about the\ngays! Let’s make sure they know their place. Keep them in check and all else\nfalls into line, or at least America notches one victory amid so many\ndefeats.That must be the thinking behind Republican efforts to push through\nso-called religious liberty laws and other legislation — most egregiously in\nNorth Carolina — that excuse and legitimize anti-gay discrimination. They’re\ncynical distractions. Politically opportunistic sideshows.And the Republicans\nwho are promoting them are playing a short game, not a long one, by refusing\nto acknowledge a clear movement in our society toward L.G.B.T. equality, a\ntrajectory with only one shape and only one destination.They’re also playing a\nprovincial game, not a national one, and scoring points in their corners of\nthe universe at the expense of the Republican Party’s image from north to\nsouth and coast to coast, a brand that needed a makeover — remember the\nbroadly ballyhooed “autopsy” following Mitt Romney’s 2012 defeat? — and\nsomehow didn’t get so much as a tweezed eyebrow or dab of blush.Yes, two of\nthe four longest-lasting candidates for the party’s presidential nomination,\nTed Cruz and Marco Rubio, are the sons of Cuban immigrants, but much of the\noratorical gunfire they exchanged revolved around who would be tougher on\nimmigration. The autopsy didn’t recommend that.Nor did it want Republican\nleaders to spotlight divisive social issues and hurtle anew into the culture\nwars, which is precisely what Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina, who is up\nfor re-election in the fall, just did. He hastily signed a sweeping anti-gay\nand anti-transgender law that was rushed through the State Legislature as if\nthe state’s security and economy were in immediate peril.It takes forever in\nthis country to build a new bridge, tunnel or train line, but it took no time\nflat for politicians in the Tar Heel State to convene a special session,\nformally ostracize North Carolina’s L.G.B.T. voters and wrap conservative\nChristians in a tight embrace. Who says America’s can-do spirit is dead?What\nhappened in North Carolina is a problem for Republicans atop the major trouble\n(Cruz, Donald Trump) that they already had. It exposes divides within the\nparty that are ever more difficult to paper over and contradictions that\naren’t easy to explain away.While the marriage of the party’s evangelical and\nbusiness wings has never been a cuddly one, it’s especially frosty now, their\nincompatible desires evident in the significant number of prominent\ncorporations that have denounced the North Carolina law and that successfully\npressed the Republican governor of Georgia, Nathan Deal, to veto recent\nlegislation that would have permitted the denial of services to L.G.B.T.\npeople by Georgians citing religious convictions.Corporations want to attract\nand retain the most talented workers, and that’s more difficult in states with\ndiscriminatory laws. They want to reach the widest base of customers and sow\nloyalty among young consumers in particular, and the best strategy for that is\nan L.G.B.T.-friendly one, given that eight in 10 Americans between the ages of\n18 and 29 support non-discrimination laws, according to a 2015 Public Religion\nResearch Institute survey.So they’re increasingly at loggerheads with the\nG.O.P., whose gay-rights advocates are still in the minority and whose\nsocially conservative members still profit from and promote a derisive view of\ngays.The gay-rights front isn’t the only one on which there’s tension between\nthe party and big business. The Republican primaries are awash in anti-\nimmigrant sentiment and screed; corporate America generally backs immigration\nreform. The protectionism and nativism that have had such currency in the\ncontest so far conflict with many corporations’ interests.What’s more, several\nmajor companies are so concerned about the brew of misogyny, racism and\nxenophobia stirred up by Trump that they are debating whether to follow\nthrough with their usual sponsorship of the Republican National Convention, as\nThe Times’s Jonathan Martin and Maggie Haberman reported last week.THE party’s\nanti-gay efforts not only undermine its pro-business stance but also\ncontradict conservatives’ exaltation of local decision making. The North\nCarolina law was drafted and passed expressly to undo and override an\nordinance in the state’s most populous city, Charlotte, that extended L.G.B.T.\nprotections against discrimination to transgender people who want to use\nbathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. The law went so far as\nto forbid any municipality from instituting its own anti-discrimination\nprotections, lest they contradict the state’s.Apparently conservatives love\nthe concept of local control when the locality being given control tilts\nright, but they have a different view when it leans left. Rural sensibilities\nmust be defended while cosmopolitan ones are dismissed.North Carolina harbors\nboth. Its tensions are America’s in miniature, and in terms of gay rights,\nthey’re a reminder that the Supreme Court’s ruling last June to legalize same-\nsex marriage nationwide was hardly the finish of the fight.That ruling was\ncertain to prompt the kind of backlash now occurring in North Carolina,\nGeorgia and elsewhere, because the steadily growing majority of Americans who\nfavor gay equality is not yet overwhelming, and the climate of acceptance\nchanges greatly from state to state and county to county.Too many of us\nL.G.B.T. Americans and our allies were too busy celebrating to stay alert to\nthat. Too few of us acknowledged the tenaciousness of opponents who will\nresort to whatever they must, including the hallucinated specter of male\nsexual predators entering women’s restrooms, to sweep aside anti-\ndiscrimination laws that include us and to turn public sentiment against\nus.They _will _lose in the end — whether that’s 10, 20 or 30 years from now.\nMeanwhile they’ll do undeniable harm to the Republican Party nationally and\nforce tough, coalition-straining choices upon it.They’ll also steal oxygen\nfrom matters more central to this country’s continued vitality and\nprosperity.Look, I used to be a restaurant critic. I know dessert is\nimportant. But if you want to make America great again, you can’t waste time\nworrying about who’s cutting the wedding cake.\n\n","title":"The Republicans’ Gay Freakout - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"In North Carolina and elsewhere, @FrankBruni writes, the GOP is playing an ugly, shortsighted and losing game https://t.co/4jWqpnmoQA","date":"Sat Apr 02 20:55:04 +0000 2016","favs":239,"id":{"$numberLong":"716368372091514880"},"retweets":167},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1W1l9aC"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013d4"},"content":"HOUSTON — Westtown School’s basketball team had an oddity a few years ago: a\nhigh school player nearly 7 feet tall who sometimes played point guard. His\nname was Daniel Ochefu, and his coach described him as a playmaker in a\ncenter’s body, so he granted Ochefu a bit more freedom than might have been\nexpected for the tallest player on just about any court he crossed.“Daniel had\na superhigh basketball I.Q. and also fantastic hands,” said Seth Berger,\nOchefu’s coach at the time.Fast-forward four years to now, to another\nPhiladelphia-area basketball team: Villanova. What stands out most about the\nNo. 2-seeded Wildcats’ style is their lack of obvious size. Coach Jay Wright,\nknown for four-guard lineups, was one of the earliest college adopters of the\n“small ball” strategy that has seduced many teams, including Villanova’s\nopponent Saturday night in the N.C.A.A. semifinals, Oklahoma (29-7), also a\nNo. 2 seed.But this season, with Villanova (33-5) in its first Final Four\nsince 2009 and two wins from its first national championship since 1985, the\nhinge on both offense and defense has been the fifth man in those “four out”\nlooks: Ochefu, who is listed at 6 feet 11 inches and 245 pounds.When Villanova\nguard Phil Booth called Ochefu “the biggest piece there is,” he meant it more\nthan literally.“I know big guys are quote-unquote obsolete; everybody wants to\nbe the Warriors nowadays,” said Darryl Reynolds, the 6-foot-8 junior who\neffectively backs up Ochefu but sometimes plays critical minutes with him, as\nhe did in the Wildcats’ round-of-8 upset of No. 1-seeded Kansas. “But I\nhonestly think with us playing inside-out, with Daniel being able to score the\nway he does and our decision-making inside, it makes it easier for the\nguards.”As the associate head coach Baker Dunleavy explained, Villanova’s\nsmall offense relies on a big man with the skills of a point guard. Ochefu can\nscore when defenders stay home against Villanova’s phalanx of shooters, and he\ncan pass to those shooters when he is double-teamed. He can even pop out to\nthe arc himself — opening up the floor by drawing a defense’s best rim\nprotector away from the basket — and can be trusted to make the correct pass\nfrom there.“With teams focusing on taking away the 3 so much,” Dunleavy said,\n“he’s a pressure release for us.”The versatility Ochefu brings was on full\ndisplay in the round of 16, when Villanova demolished third-seeded Miami,\n92-69, by making 10 of 15 of its 3-point attempts — in part, the freshman\nJalen Brunson explained, because Ochefu was able to make 7 of 11 shots from\ncloser to the hoop.“They don’t want to leave 3-point shooters, so D. O. is\ndefinitely effective inside,” Brunson said. “And when D. O.’s really cooking\nin there, he has the ability to kick it out — he’s a really good passer and a\nwilling passer.”Ochefu is content with the arrangement.“I think it’s a big\nman’s dream,” he said of the opportunity to share the court with Villanova’s\nmostly smaller, sharpshooting lineup.“If you’re playing with great guards, it\ngets you easy shots,” he added. “They pass me the ball great. They come off\nball screens great, and they’re great defensively as well.”Berger, Ochefu’s\nhigh school coach, first saw him play at a Philadelphia 76ers camp in the\nPocono Mountains before Ochefu was in eighth grade. Berger recalled that\nOchefu blocked a shot, kept the ball on a fast break up the court and, though\nhe missed a layup, sprinted back on defense.“Big kids don’t run back down the\nfloor like that,” Berger said.Ochefu, though already about 6-7, was obviously\nnot finished growing.Villanova’s staff got to know him and his family early\nthrough summer camp and was smart enough, Ochefu said, to have a priest use\nhis persuasive powers on his fervently Catholic mother during a visit.But\nVillanova was ordinarily a tough sell to players as big and talented as\nOchefu, a top-50 recruit nationally, precisely because of its small style.“We\ncouldn’t get any big guys to come,” Wright said.In Wright’s telling, small\nball came to his program by accident. In the 2005 N.C.A.A. tournament, power\nforward Curtis Sumpter was injured in the round of 32, forcing Wright to play\nfour guards in the next round against North Carolina. The Tar Heels, the\neventual champions, beat the Wildcats by a point.“It was kind of out of\ndesperation,” Wright said. “But it worked, and then we said, ‘Ooh, this is\nsomething good here.’ ”Recruiting Ochefu meant convincing him Villanova’s\nsystem had a place — a specific but all-important place — for a player of his\nstature.“I remember going to Daniel Ochefu,” Wright said, “and saying: ‘Some\nbig guy is going to benefit from playing with these guards. Because they can’t\ndouble you. You’ve got these guards around you. Come play with them.’ ”Ochefu\nhas played significant minutes in all four of his years at Villanova, which in\nthat time has gone 115-25, with three Big East regular-season titles and one\nconference tournament championship. This season, Ochefu was Villanova’s\nleading rebounder and shot blocker but also averaged more than 10 points and\nnearly 2 assists per game.Teammates and Dunleavy describe Ochefu as a\nrelentless perfectionist, but perhaps only perfectionists can acknowledge\nperfection. Ochefu insisted that Villanova’s performance in the N.C.A.A.\ntournament — at that point, before facing Kansas, Villanova had hit 53 percent\nof its 3-point attempts in the tournament — did not surprise him.“I’ve been\nexpecting this since the beginning of the year,” he said.When a reporter\nsuggested that Villanova’s long-range accuracy, contrary to Ochefu’s\nassertion, would not be sustainable over the course of an entire season,\nOchefu interrupted with the rejoinder on everyone’s lips these days: “Steph\nCurry.”Everyone, it seems, does want to be the Warriors — including the team\nthat might be their college equivalent.\n\n","title":"In Villanova’s Small-Ball Attack, a Key Weapon Is Nearly 7 Feet Tall - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @marcatracy: Preview: @zschonbrun on Cuse assistant who took over for Boeheim https://t.co/kCle3TS1SX; me on who makes Nova go https://t…","date":"Sat Apr 02 20:44:18 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716365666144686081"},"retweets":23},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/02/sports/ncaabasketball/in-villanovas-small-ball-attack-a-key-weapon-is-nearly-7-feet-tall.html?ref=sports"}

But those tests revealed “no nexus” to the infamous\ndouble-homicide case, the police said.Ms. Simpson and Mr. Goldman were slashed\nto death on the evening of June 12, 1994, outside her townhouse in the\nBrentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles.

Trump.**THE MESSAGE**Divisive ideas like building walls and barring people based on religion, Mrs. Clinton says in the ad, won’t work in her adopted state.A panoply of New Yorkers “20 million strong,” with varied skin tones and expressions, flash by like a whizzing subway car. “No, we don’t all look the same; we don’t all sound the same, either,” Mrs. Clinton says as a customer and bodega worker exchange pleasantries in Spanish.She admonishes “some” who say “we can fix America’s problems by building walls,” as a large black wall looms, women with American-flag hijabs smile, and the infamous footage appears of a Trump supporter sucker-punching a black protester.**THE IMPACT**While Mrs. Clinton is planting a flag for herself in the New York primary, using “we” to remind people that she lives in the state, the ad is more notable for her first direct contrast with Mr. Trump, the Republican front-runner. While he is not mentioned directly, a “Trump” sign outside a hotel his company is developing flickers in the ad for a few seconds.**THE TAKEAWAY**That Mrs. Clinton would focus her advertising in the state on Mr. Trump instead of Senator Bernie Sanders, whom she is still battling in the Democratic race, shows the confidence the campaign has in its ability to win in New York. A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday shows her leading by 12 percentage points in the state, with a two-point margin of error. But the Sanders campaign has pledged an aggressive push, including repeated calls for a debate before the April 19 primary.Changing channels ...**Sight Gag**The “super PAC” supporting Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, in a new ad titled “Nose,” adopts the “Lyin’ Ted” moniker created by Mr. Trump. A Pinocchio nose extends from a portrait photograph of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas as a narrator recalls his alleged untruths. But rather than slowly extend to a final point, the extending nose makes a sharp, hooking turn, slowly coiling around Mr. Cruz’s neck three times, suggesting a noose Mr. Cruz has made with his supposed falsehoods.Mr. Kasich, who has tried to maintain a positive tone in his campaign, asked that the super PAC stop running the ad. But the group, which does not directly coordinate activities with the candidate, had not agreed to do so as of Friday afternoon.**Madness**With memories of Wisconsin’s buzzer-beating upset of Xavier in the N.C.A.A. tournament less than two weeks old, Trusted Leadership PAC, a super PAC supporting Mr. Cruz, has produced a basketball-themed ad aimed at Mr. Kasich. But unlike Bronson Koenig’s back-to-back 3-pointers that sent the Badgers to the Sweet 16 (they lost to Notre Dame), the shots at the end rim out as the ad proclaims Mr. Kasich’s “campaign isn’t rebounding” and “won’t play in Wisconsin.”**Numbers****$5.6 MILLION** The amount spent on advertising in Wisconsin for the Democratic primary.**$2.7 MILLION** The amount spent on advertising in Wisconsin for the Republican primary.**NICK CORASANITI**\n\n","title":"Hillary Clinton Appeals to New Yorkers by Going After One: Donald Trump - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Hillary Clinton appeals to New Yorkers by going after one: Donald Trump https://t.co/ji3AY7hIyK","date":"Sat Apr 02 20:24:24 +0000 2016","favs":169,"id":{"$numberLong":"716360656463724544"},"retweets":97},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SJbkew"}

But they can’t and they don’t.The women’s game is good but\nso far beneath the men’s game, men’s skills (I’m a big fan of the 40-yard\nscreamer) there’s no reason they should be paid the same. Even putting the\nball in the box, which is all about skill, they pale — like men putting (golf)\nvs. women putting.And interesting that the other women’s sport screaming for\nmore money, and getting it, is tennis — good as Serena is, she wouldn’t win a\ngame off the 500th ranked male.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013d8"},"content":"LET’S start with a quiz. When researchers sent young whites and blacks out to\ninterview for low-wage jobs in New York City armed with equivalent résumés,\nthe result was:A) Whites and blacks were hired at similar rates.B) Blacks had\na modest edge because of affirmative action.C) Whites were twice as likely to\nget callbacks.The answer is C, and a black applicant with a clean criminal\nrecord did no better than a white applicant who was said to have just been\nreleased from 18 months in prison.A majority of whites believe that job\nopportunities are equal for whites and blacks, according to a PBS poll, but\nrigorous studies show that just isn’t so.Back in 2014, I did a series of\ncolumns called “When Whites Just Don’t Get It” to draw attention to\ninequities, and I’m revisiting it because public attention to racial\ndisparities seems to be flagging even as the issues are as grave as ever.But\nlet me first address some reproaches I’ve received from indignant whites,\nincluding the very common: _You would never write a column about blacks not\ngetting it, and it’s racist to pick on whites._ It’s true that I would be wary\nas a white person of lecturing to blacks about race, but plenty of black\nleaders (including President Obama) have bluntly spoken about shortcomings in\nthe black community.Toni Morrison in her novels writes searingly about a black\nworld pummeled by discrimination but also by violence, drunkenness and broken\nfamilies. In a CNN poll, 86 percent of blacks said family breakdown was a\nreason for difficulties of African-Americans today, and 77 percent cited “lack\nof motivation and unwillingness to work hard.”Frankly, the conversation within\nthe black community seems to me to be more mature and honest than the one\namong whites, and considering how much of the white conversation about race\ninvokes “personal responsibility,” maybe it’s time for whites to show\nmore.Obama’s election reinforced a narrative that we’re making progress. We\nare in some ways, but the median black household in America still has only 8\npercent of the wealth of the median white household. And even for blacks who\nhave “made it” — whose incomes are in the upper half of American incomes — 60\npercent of their children tumble back into the lower half in the next\ngeneration, according to a Federal Reserve study. If these trends continue,\nthe Fed study noted, “black Americans would make no further relative\nprogress.”Most of the public debate about race focuses on law enforcement.\nThat’s understandable after the shootings of unarmed blacks and after the U.S.\nSentencing Commission found that black men received sentences about 20 percent\nlonger than white men for similar crimes. But that’s just the tip of the\niceberg. Lead poisoning, for example, is more than twice as common among black\nchildren as among white children, and in much of the country, it’s even worse\nthan in Flint, Mich.Three generations after Brown v. Board of Education,\nAmerican schools are still often separate and unequal. The average white or\nAsian-American student attends a school in at least the 60th percentile in\ntest performance; the average black student is at a school at the 37th\npercentile. One reason is an unjust school funding system that often directs\nthe most resources to privileged students.So if we’re going to address\nsystemic disadvantage of black children, we have to broaden the conversation\nto unequal education. There’s a lot of loose talk among whites about black\nboys making bad decisions, but we fail these kids before they fail us. That’s\nunconscionable when increasingly we have robust evidence about the kinds of\ninitiatives (like home visitation, prekindergarten and “career academies”)\nthat reduce disparities.Reasons for inequality involve not just institutions\nbut also personal behaviors. These don’t all directly involve discrimination.\nFor instance, black babies are less likely to be breast-fed than white babies,\nare more likely to grow up with a single parent and may be spoken to or read\nto less by their parents. But racial discrimination remains ubiquitous even in\ncrucial spheres like jobs and housing.In one study, researchers sent thousands\nof résumés to employers with openings, randomly using some stereotypically\nblack names (like Jamal) and others that were more likely to belong to whites\n(like Brendan). A white name increased the likelihood of a callback by 50\npercent.Likewise, in Canada researchers found that emails from stereotypically\nblack names seeking apartments are less likely to get responses from\nlandlords. And in U.S. experiments, when blacks and whites go in person to\nrent or buy properties, blacks are shown fewer options.Something similar\nhappens even with sales. Researchers offered iPods for sale online and found\nthat when the photo showed the iPod held by a white hand, it received 21\npercent more offers than when held by a black hand.Discrimination is also\npervasive in the white-collar world. Researchers found that white state\nlegislators, Democrats and Republicans alike, were less likely to respond to a\nconstituent letter signed with a stereotypically black name. Even at\nuniversities, emails sent to professors from stereotypically black names\nasking for a chance to discuss research possibilities received fewer\nresponses.Why do we discriminate? The big factor isn’t overt racism. Rather,\nit seems to be unconscious bias among whites who believe in equality but act\nin ways that perpetuate inequality.Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, an eminent\nsociologist, calls this unconscious bias “racism without racists,” and we\nwhites should be less defensive about it. This bias affects blacks as well as\nwhites, and we also have unconscious biases about gender, disability, body\nsize and age. You can explore your own unconscious biases in a free online\ntest, called the implicit association test.One indication of how deeply rooted\nbiases are: A rigorous study by economists found that even N.B.A. referees\nwere more likely to call fouls on players of another race. Something similar\nhappens in baseball, with researchers finding that umpires calling strikes are\nbiased against black pitchers.If even professional referees and umpires are\nbiased, can there be any hope for you and me as we navigate our daily lives?\nActually, there is.The N.B.A. study caused a furor (the league denied the\nbias), and a few years later there was a follow-up by the same economists, and\nthe bias had disappeared. It seems that when we humans realize our biases, we\ncan adjust and act in ways that are more fair. As the study’s authors put it,\n“Awareness reduces racial bias.”That’s why it’s so important for whites to\nengage in these uncomfortable discussions of race, because we are\n(unintentionally) so much a part of the problem. It’s not that we’re evil, but\nthat we’re human. The challenge is to recognize that unconscious bias afflicts\nus all — but that we just may be able to overcome it if we face it.\n\n","title":"When Whites Just Don’t Get It, Part 6 - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"\"Most of the public debate about race focuses on law enforcement … That’s just the tip of the iceberg\" —@NickKristof https://t.co/PzBMNYWFEE","date":"Sat Apr 02 19:55:03 +0000 2016","favs":212,"id":{"$numberLong":"716353271783415811"},"retweets":143},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1MK2ZIr"}

It\nis taking a different route, though, than those charted in San Francisco,\nSeattle and, earlier this week, the entire state of California.Last year, New\nYork had one minimum wage ($8.75 an hour) for all workers in the state, except\nwaiters and others who depended on tips. Under the plan approved by\nlegislators, Mr. Cuomo hopes that the state will again have a unified minimum\nwage — $15 — by 2022.But between here and there, things will get complicated\nfor workers and their employers. Nine months from now, there will be six\ndifferent hourly minimum wages in the state: one for fast-food workers in New\nYork City ($12), and one for fast-food workers in the rest of the state\n($10.75); one for other workers in the city who have at least 10 co-workers\n($11), and one for those in smaller workplaces ($10.50); one for non-fast-food\nworkers in Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester Counties ($10), and one for that\ngroup in the rest of the state ($9.70).“It will be a little confusing,” said\nMichael Reich, a professor of economics at the University of California,\nBerkeley. “When you have one minimum wage, it’s sort of simple because\neveryone knows the number. When you have many, it’s more complex.”Mr. Reich\nwas a co-author of a recent brief on a $15 minimum wage in New York that\nsupporters of Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, used to bolster their argument for the\nidea. The brief concluded that raising the minimum wage by $6 an hour over six\nyears would have only a “small effect” on employment, and that the\nimprovements in living standards for millions of workers would “greatly\noutweigh” any job losses.The conservative view of the likely effects of such a\nrapid increase in wages is starkly different. Citing a different study, the\nEmpire Center for Public Policy said the increase to $15 would eliminate\n200,000 jobs in the state.Business leaders were relieved that Republicans\nlawmakers were able to set a different pace for wage increases upstate than in\nNew York City and its suburbs. While the minimum wage will rise in $2\nincrements over the next three years for employers in the city with more than\n10 workers, it will rise much slower in the rest of the state.It was not clear\nwhen the minimum wage would reach $15 an hour for workers in the rest of the\nstate outside of the fast-food industry. Their minimum is scheduled to rise in\nannual increments of 70 cents until it reaches $12.50 at the end of 2020.\nAfter that, state officials will analyze the economic effects of the increases\nbefore scheduling any more.The agreement in Albany came just days after Gov.\nJerry Brown of California, a Democrat, announced a plan to raise that state’s\nminimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022. That plan, like New York’s, contains a\nprovision for slowing the pace of the increases in the event of an economic\ndownturn.The two states are racing well ahead of the rest of the country,\nleaving many economists uncertain as to how employers will react. Some note\nthat the neighboring states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania have lower minimum\nwages, which could draw businesses to move across borders. New Jersey’s\nminimum wage, which is linked to inflation, did not rise this year, remaining\nat $8.38 an hour.“You can’t study what hasn’t happened yet,” said Ken\nPokalsky, an executive with the Business Council of New York State, which\nlobbied against the increase to $15. “All you can do is guess.”Mr. Reich said\nhe believed some workers could move or change jobs to take advantage of higher\nwages in other parts of the state, but he doubted that many companies would\nrelocate. More likely, he said, they would introduce more automation, press\nworkers to be more efficient and raise prices to cover their increased labor\ncosts. He estimated that businesses would have to raise prices about 1\npercent, on average, over five years.But Patrick Pipino, who owns a Ben \u0026amp;\nJerry’s ice cream shop in Saratoga Springs, said he was under more pressure\nthan that.Although he owns a single shop that he runs with a staff of young,\nmostly part-time workers, his is considered a fast-food business under the\nminimum wage change Mr. Cuomo engineered last year. The governor convened a\nwage board that set a schedule for restaurants that are part of a chain with\nat least 30 outlets nationwide to raise minimum wages to $15 an hour by the\nend of 2020.Mr. Pipino, who lobbied against the increases, said he responded\nby raising the wages of all of his employees by $1 an hour on Dec. 31. He has\nbegun the process of hiring an additional 30 workers for the summer season,\nbut he said he would cut back the average weekly hours they work, to about 17\nfrom about 23.He said he would have to raise prices too, but was unsure how\nmuch more than $3.95 people would pay for an ice cream cone. Furthermore, he\nsaid, he now bears the burden of having to pay higher wages than a competitor\nthat is not affiliated with a chain, leaving him at a competitive\ndisadvantage.Increasing fast-food wages was Mr. Cuomo’s first push for the\nmomentum he needed to pave the way in Albany toward a broader minimum wage of\n$15 an hour. “At this point I should be rooting for it to go to $15 an hour,\nthen it levels the playing field for me,” Mr. Pipino said.\n\n","title":"New York’s Path to $15 Minimum Wage: Uneven, and Bumpy - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Last year, the state of New York had one minimum wage.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013da"},"content":"WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is considering whether North Carolina’s\nnew law on gay and transgender rights makes the state ineligible for billions\nof dollars in federal aid for schools, highways and housing, officials said\nFriday.Cutting off any federal money — or even simply threatening to do so —\nwould put major new pressure on North Carolina to repeal the law, which\neliminated local protections for gay and transgender people and restricted\nwhich bathrooms transgender people can use. A loss of federal money could send\nthe state into a budget crisis and jeopardize services that are central to\ndaily life.Although experts said such a drastic step was unlikely, at least\nimmediately, the administration’s review puts North Carolina on notice that\nthe new law could have financial consequences. Gov. Pat McCrory of North\nCarolina had assured residents that the law would not jeopardize federal money\nfor education.But the law also represents a test for the Obama administration,\nwhich has declared that the fight for gay and transgender rights is a\ncontinuation of the civil rights era. The North Carolina dispute forces the\nadministration to decide how aggressively to fight on that principle.The North\nCarolina law created a mandatory statewide anti-discrimination policy, but it\ndid not include specific protections based on sexual orientation or gender\nidentity. The law prohibits transgender people from using public bathrooms\nthat do not match the sexes on their birth certificates.Anthony Foxx, the\nsecretary of transportation, first raised the prospect of a review of federal\nfunding in public remarks on Tuesday in North Carolina. The Department of\nTransportation provides roughly $1 billion a year to North Carolina. The New\nYork Times then asked other federal agencies whether they were conducting\nsimilar reviews.A Department of Education spokeswoman, Dorie Nolt, said on\nFriday that her agency was also reviewing the North Carolina law “to determine\nany potential impact on the state’s federal education funding.” She added, “We\nwill not hesitate to act if students’ civil rights are being violated.”The\nagency said it provided $4.3 billion to North Carolina last year for\nkindergarten through 12th grade as well as colleges.The Department of Housing\nand Urban Development said it was doing a similar evaluation. “We’re reviewing\nthe effects of the law on HUD funding allocated for North Carolina,” said\nCameron French, a department spokesman.White House officials had no\ncomment.Any decision on federal aid would take time, experts said. Federal\nagencies have used the threat of lost money to pressure a handful of municipal\ngovernments in California and Illinois to change their policies and allow\ntransgender students to use the restrooms of the gender they identify with.\nThere is no recent precedent for the federal government’s applying similar\npressure to address a state law that it sees as discriminatory.“It would be a\nlong process of negotiation,” said Jane R. Wettach, an education law\nspecialist at the Duke University School of Law in Durham, N.C. “I think the\nfederal government would be loath to do it and would give North Carolina every\npossibility, every chance to change their position, to change the law, to\nnegotiate, to make some exceptions. I think they’d go back and forth for a\nwhile and try to come to a negotiated settlement.”Mr. McCrory, a Republican\nwho is seeking re-election, and other supporters of the law have been aware,\nbut dismissive, of suggestions that the measure might endanger the state’s\nfederal largess. Mr. McCrory’s office did not respond to messages on\nFriday.Dan Forest, the Republican lieutenant governor and the president of the\nState Senate, said he expected that federal aid would continue. He noted that\nmany states did not explicitly provide gay and transgender people with anti-\ndiscrimination protection. Neither does federal law.“It would be wrong — even\nillegal — to single out North Carolina for unfavorable treatment,” Mr. Forest\nsaid in an emailed statement. He said the state complied with the Constitution\nand federal laws. “I’m confident that we will continue to receive this federal\nmoney despite the threats from a few in Washington, D.C.”Mr. Forest is correct\nthat federal anti-discrimination laws do not explicitly mention gay and\ntransgender people: the Obama administration has repeatedly called on Congress\nto pass a law banning discrimination against them in employment decisions. On\nseveral occasions, however, the administration has also said that gay, lesbian\nand transgender people are already covered by laws banning sex\ndiscrimination.Last year, a federal judge in Virginia rejected that notion,\nruling that restricting the bathroom choices for transgender students did not\nviolate federal law. The Obama administration had argued otherwise and the\ncase is on appeal.The Obama administration would not need to go to court to\nwithhold grant money, but doing so would surely lead to a court fight,\nespecially since the law is unsettled.Advocacy groups have praised the Obama\nadministration for its broad view of civil rights laws. During the past seven\nyears, “the fight for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality has\nreached an incredible crescendo,” Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch said last\nyear.James D. Esseks, who works on gender and sexual orientation issues for\nthe American Civil Liberties Union, said the North Carolina law represented a\nchance for the Obama administration to stand behind those views. He called on\nthe federal government to say: “Hey folks, we’re serious here. We’re not going\nto give you all this federal money if you’re requiring discrimination in every\ncorner of the state.”North Carolina has faced criticism from businesses\nincluding Bank of America, which has its headquarters in Charlotte, N.C.;\nApple; and Facebook. The National Basketball Association suggested that it\nmight move the 2017 All-Star Game from Charlotte. The White House called the\nlaw “meanspirited.”In a video message on Tuesday, Mr. McCrory complained about\n“a vicious, nationwide smear campaign,” and he lashed out at critics in his\nstate, including Attorney General Roy Cooper, and beyond North Carolina.\nLawmakers had said that they were trying to prevent men from dressing as women\nto enter bathrooms and commit assaults. Critics said there was no evidence\nthat had happened.“Disregarding the facts, other politicians — from the White\nHouse to mayors to state capitals and City Council members and even our\nattorney general — have initiated and promoted conflict to advance their\npolitical agenda and tear down our state, even if it means defying the\nConstitution and their oath of office,” Mr. McCrory said.\n\n","title":"North Carolina Law May Risk Federal Aid - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"North Carolina may lose billions in U.S. funding over gay rights law https://t.co/b4wjNfhBoj https://t.co/D5vjfP04tn","date":"Sat Apr 02 19:25:05 +0000 2016","favs":414,"id":{"$numberLong":"716345728147304449"},"retweets":254},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21ZAyI0"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013db"},"content":"Eric Greitens’s bid for governor of Missouri hinges on his experience as a\nNavy SEALs member, which he has chronicled in three books and promotes on his\ncampaign web site, where he is pictured wearing his combat uniform, holding a\nrifle. “In the SEALs we learned, ‘there is no prize for second place in a\ngunfight,’ ” he said recently on Twitter.Now Mr. Greitens, seeking the\nRepublican nomination, finds himself in a battle with some former comrades,\nwho charged in a slickly produced YouTube video that he exaggerated his record\nand was unduly benefiting from his time in the SEALs. The dispute lays bare a\nwidening rift among Navy SEALs, provoked by what leaders and many in the ranks\ndescribe as rampant commercial and personal exploitation of a brotherhood that\nonce prized discretion.In recent months, the Naval Special Warfare Command in\nCoronado, Calif., which oversees the elite force, has told its men to lower\ntheir profile and tried to rein in public appearances by active-duty members.\nThe Pentagon imposed a rule last September restricting the appearance of\nservice members in video games, movies and television shows. Current and\nformer members have widely circulated a pointed critique — titled “Navy SEALs\nGone Wild: Publicity, Fame, and the Loss of the Quiet Professional” — that\nlaments the commercialization and warns that it is doing harm.“The raising of\nNavy SEALs to celebrity status through media exploitation and publicity stunts\nhas corrupted the culture of the SEAL community by incentivizing narcissistic\nand profit-oriented behavior,” Lt. Forrest S. Crowell, a SEAL, wrote in the\ncritique, his master’s thesis for the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey,\nCalif. Partisan politicking and public disclosure of tactics, he added,\n“erodes military effectiveness, damages national security, and undermines\nhealthy civil-military relations.”But the pushback has had little sway over\nformer members who are increasingly giving paid speeches, sounding off on\npolitics on Fox News and stamping the force’s name on hats, backpacks,\nvitamins and even a campaign bus. A television show by the Weinstein Company,\nworking with a former SEALs consultant, is set to air on the History channel\nlater this year, and a half-dozen books are scheduled to roll off the presses\nin coming months, adding to the 100-plus published by former SEALs since\n2001.“It’s on a pendulum swing, and that pendulum went past where anybody felt\nit was necessary and it went past where people probably would want it to be,”\nsaid Greg Geisen, a retired Navy commander and former SEALs spokesman.Ever\nsince SEAL Team 6 killed Osama bin Laden, the SEALs — who make up less than 5\npercent of the nation’s active-duty Special Operations forces — have been\ncatapulted into the spotlight, becoming the closest thing the nation has to\nliving action figures, featured in numerous video games and movies. Far more\nSEALs have gone public than their more reticent Army counterparts in Delta\nForce and the Rangers. (The Onion even joked that the Navy formed an elite\nSEAL book-writing unit to churn out accounts of secret missions.)Former SEALs\nhave offered accounts of derring-do, being transgender, SEAL-style yoga, dog-\ntraining techniques and even SEAL humor. One author, Matt Bissonnette, earned\nmillions for “No Easy Day,” a firsthand narrative of the Bin Laden raid, but\nhad to forfeit the profits for failing to submit it for Pentagon review of\nclassified information.Some SEALs, contending that they have every right to\nbenefit from their experiences in the military, say the publicity has done no\nharm and divulged few if any classified tactics or techniques. Kevin Lacz, a\nformer SEALs member whose book “The Last Punisher” is due this summer, said in\nan interview that readers are captivated by “the mystique and aura of the\nteams,” and want to hear “stories about SEALs written by SEALs.”Brandon Webb,\nwho founded a veteran-run news website, Sofrep, that focuses on the Special\nOperations community and is an author of several SEAL-themed books, was cited\nin the thesis as someone who has exploited the SEAL brand.“Ever since wars\nhave been fought guys have been writing their stories,” Mr. Webb said. “It’s\nimportant for Americans to know what the guys fighting the wars have been\nexperiencing, not just from the perspective of a talking-head politician or a\nfour-star general.”The elevation of SEALs in the public eye has plenty of\nprecedent; there have been countless books and movies about heroics or\nsacrifice by organizations like the Marines and the Green Berets in other\neras. The United States military has often assisted Hollywood, figuring that\ninspiring narratives helped win recruits and support.In fact, the Naval\nSpecial Warfare Command helped create the clamor for tales of SEAL daring.\nAfter 19 SEALs and helicopter crewmen were killed during a 2005 mission in\nAfghanistan, Marcus Luttrell, who lived through it, was given time off to work\nwith a writer on what became the best-seller “Lone Survivor _.”_ It was\npublished in 2007 and released as a feature film in 2013.“They decided I\nshould write a book about the mission,” Mr. Luttrell wrote in his second book,\n“Service_.”_ It felt “strange”, he wrote, adding that “as SEALs, we’d been\ntaught to hold our stories close, to say nothing to outsiders, especially the\npress.”“But we also knew how to get something done when the chain of command\nspoke,” he wrote.In 2005, the Department of Defense told the SEAL command to\nincrease the number of enlisted SEALs by 500 within five years, according to\nan internal memo. The average increase in the force over the previous decade\nwas just five annually. The United States was fighting simultaneous wars in\nIraq and Afghanistan, and SEALs were getting killed, wounded or just burned\nout and leaving the service.The command decided that a movie aimed at high-\nschool athletes would be the best way to draw more recruits. The film project,\nthough, took years. “Act of Valor” was released in 2012, grossing $81 million\nat theaters around the world.The film sent “a confusing message” to SEALs, who\nquestioned why the command “could take advantage of the public interest and\nadulation but individual SEALs could not,” Lieutenant Crowell wrote in his\npaper.Perhaps most damaging to the command’s credibility, many members of the\nforce argue, was that the leadership used active-duty SEALs as actors. Rorke\nT. Denver, one of the stars of “Act of Valor,” left the Navy and went on to\nwrite his own best-seller, “Damn Few,” and has another book coming this month\nas well as a  television show premiering on Fox.He is one of 10 SEALs\nrepresented by the speakers’ bureau Leading Authorities; others include Robert\nO’Neill, who claims credit for killing Osama bin Laden and gave dozens of\nspeeches last year, and Mr. Greitens, the Missouri candidate for governor. Mr.\nGreitens’s fee for a speech in Asia was as much as $75,000, according to the\nbureau’s website.Public interest intensified after Team 6’s 2009 rescue of\nCapt. Richard Phillips from Somali pirates and peaked with the Bin Laden\nkilling in May 2011. The timing was propitious for Mr. Greitens, 41, who had\npublished his memoir, “The Heart and the Fist,” just weeks before. A telegenic\nformer Rhodes scholar and White House Fellow, he became a sought-after\ntelevision guest and his book a best-seller.He went on to write two more\nbooks, both displaying the SEAL insignia — an eagle clutching a gun, an anchor\nand a trident — on the cover. The foundation he started to help veterans, The\nMission Continues, brought in $1.6 million in 2010 and more than $7 million in\n2011. Mr. Greitens was paid $200,000 that year, according to the foundation’s\npublic filing. (Mr. Greitens stepped down as chief executive in 2014 and left\nthe board last year because of his campaign for governor.)The anonymous group\nbehind the recent video attacking him said that Mr. Greitens exaggerated his\nservice as a SEALs member in his books and TV appearances. He answered by\nreleasing his military records and publishing testimonials by SEALs and\nMarines who had served with him. In an interview, Mr. Greitens said that he\nsuspected a decision he made as a young officer to push for disciplinary\naction against members of his unit over drug use in Thailand might have\nprompted the recriminations.“I believe that what I did there was the right\nthing,” Mr. Greitens said. “I believed it then, I believe it now but there are\nsome people that are upset about it.” He added that he saw greater visibility\nof SEALs as a positive. “The more successful Navy SEALs there are, the more\nglory it reflects on the community and the better it is for our country,” he\nsaid.Other SEALs have also become involved in politics. Kristin Beck, a\ntransgender SEAL formerly known as Christopher Beck, is running for Congress\nin Maryland, campaigning on her military record. Representative Ryan Zinke, a\nMontana Republican and former Team 6 officer whose campaign bus is emblazoned\nwith the SEAL Trident and six stars, is seeking re-election this year and has\na political action committee called SEAL PAC supporting him.Lieutenant Crowell\ncomplained that Mr. O’Neill, the self-professed Bin Laden shooter, had been\nsending “signed Navy SEAL flags” to SEAL PAC donors. “How can the symbol of an\napolitical military unit be used in such a partisan way without any protest\nfrom society or the military?” he wrote.In a statement, Mr. O’Neill said he\nsupported Mr. Zinke, “because he believes as I do that having more of these\nquiet professionals in Congress would be a very good thing.”Lieutenant Crowell\nalso cited two former SEALs officers, Jocko Willink and Leif Babin, who\npublished a book about leadership aimed at business managers. When they\nappeared on Fox News, they also used the platform to attack President Obama’s\ndefense policies. Mr. Babin recently  said on Twitter that any conservative\nwho would accept Hillary Clinton as president was “either a fool or a\nliar.”Mr. Willink declined to comment for this article; Mr. Babin did not\nrespond to requests for comment.But Lieutenant Crowell lamented how “the\nprogression from publishing a benign book on leadership to becoming immediate\npawns in a political debate shows the slippery slope that awaits SEALs who\nmarket their identities and pursue public personas in the wake of SEAL fame.”\n\n","title":"Rift Among Navy SEALs Over Members Who Cash In on Brand - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Former Navy SEALs are appearing on red carpets, cable news shows and bookshelves.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013dc"},"content":"DONALD J. TRUMP gave his primary opponents a gift when he said this week that\nif abortion is outlawed, “there has to be some form of punishment” for the\nwoman. He let them look as if they cared about women.Gov. John Kasich of Ohio\nresponded to Mr. Trump’s comments by saying, “Of course women shouldn’t be\npunished.” Like his fellow Republican presidential candidate Mr. Trump, Mr.\nKasich opposes legal abortion except in cases of rape and incest and to save\nthe woman’s life. Mr. Kasich has signed 17 anti-abortion measures into law\nsince he took office in 2011. Half the clinics in Ohio in operation at the\nbeginning of his tenure have closed or stopped performing abortions.In a\nstatement, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said, “Being pro-life is not simply about\nthe unborn child, it’s also about the mother.” He would permit legal abortion\nonly to save the woman’s life — no exception for rape and incest victims — and\ntried to shut down the government in his effort to defund Planned Parenthood.\nVirtually every anti-abortion group in the country quickly disavowed the\nnotion of punishing women, many using words like compassion, love and healing.\nThe movement’s hashtag is #lovethemboth.Within hours, Mr. Trump retracted his\n“punishment” statement, saying that only the doctor or person who performed\nthe abortion would be held legally responsible. That is the standard anti-\nabortion line, but face it, punishing the woman is logical.If abortion is\nmurder, as abortion opponents are always claiming it is, how can society let\nthe woman off the hook? We take murder pretty seriously in this country,\nespecially the murder of children, which is what the anti-abortion movement\ndeems fertilized eggs, embryos and fetuses to be. True, punishing women sounds\ncruel and misogynist. But if ending a pregnancy is murder, how can we not\ntreat it as such?Abortion opponents answer this question by insisting that the\nwoman is a victim, too — “broken and wounded,” in the words of Penny Nance,\nthe president of Concerned Women for America. The woman is desperate, confused\nand alone. Someone pushed her into it — her parents, her boyfriend or husband,\nthe “culture of death” that tells her an embryo is just a clump of cells,\nPlanned Parenthood. Yes, somehow, the mere existence of a clinic forces her to\nenter its doors, even if she has to drive all day to get there, sleep in her\ncar to fulfill a 24-, 48- or 72-hour waiting period, listen to a script full\nof anti-abortion propaganda and pay a month’s wages for the procedure.If you\nconsider how determined a woman has to be to get an abortion in much of the\ncountry these days and how much energy states expend trying to dissuade her,\nit’s hard to see her as a frail flower. If abortion is murder, the woman is\nless like a victim and more like someone who hires a hit man. In law, both\nparties are culpable.Abortion opponents know full well that the public would\nnot abide putting women in prison en masse. Politically, it’s more palatable\nto portray them as irrational, ignorant and childlike, perhaps even\ntemporarily insane. They are, in any case, incompetent to make their own\ndecisions. If a woman thinks having a baby as a college freshman or a mother\nof five is a terrible idea, if she has health problems or is trying to escape\na bad relationship or feels unready for motherhood, well, she just doesn’t\nknow what’s good for her.Emotional distress, immaturity or pressure from\nothers don’t work well as defenses in ordinary murder cases, though. We put\nactual children in prison for killing, and many people who kill are under the\nsway of others. We rarely count that as an excuse.Abortion opponents claim\nthat, before Roe v. Wade, anti-abortion laws never went after women. This is\nnot entirely accurate: Oklahoma criminalized the woman as well as the\nprovider. Women didn’t go to prison before Roe, but they were punished. They\nwere forced to remain pregnant under even the direst circumstances. If they\nrejected that fate, they were forced to self-abort or seek illegal providers,\nrisking death and injury. They were interrogated by the police, subpoenaed and\nforced to testify in court against their provider.Today, the law is still\ngoing after women for abortion. In Indiana last year, Purvi Patel was\nsentenced to 20 years in prison for what the prosecutor charged was an illegal\nself-abortion. In Tennessee, Anna Yocca was charged with attempted murder for\ntrying to end her pregnancy with a coat hanger. In Pennsylvania, Jennifer\nWhalen went to jail for giving her daughter abortion pills. Have our kinder,\ngentler abortion opponents spoken up for any of these women?Around the world,\ncountries — El Salvador, Mexico and the Philippines among them — sometimes\njail women who obtain illegal abortions. In 2013, Ireland approved a law with\na very narrow exception for the life of the mother. That is paired with up to\na 14-year prison sentence for women and providers for abortions that don’t\npass the test.Forgive me if I am skeptical that a movement strong enough to\npush for laws that severely limit abortion in the United States would be much\ndifferent from anti-abortion movements in other countries where abortion is\nbanned and women are punished. Forty-plus years of hurling insults like “baby\nkiller” and “murderess” at women on their way into clinics have got to mean\nsomething.Perhaps Mr. Trump “misspoke,” as he described it, because he’s a\nrelatively recent convert to the cause, unfamiliar with the doublespeak in\nwhich forcing women to give birth is a form of love, and punishment is the\nlast thing on the anti-abortion movement’s mind. In his blundering way, he\nrevealed the true logic of the case against legal abortion: If it’s murder,\nthen murder has consequences. Too bad the moment of clarity couldn’t last.\n\n","title":"Abortion and Punishment - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The logic of the case against legal abortion https://t.co/TdD71uaZ7z via @nytopinion https://t.co/T2prkpNptT","date":"Sat Apr 02 18:55:05 +0000 2016","favs":306,"id":{"$numberLong":"716338179419336704"},"retweets":174},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SJ05CW"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013dd"},"content":"R. Martin Chavez possesses the light-filled office of a Goldman Sachs partner,\nwith a sweeping view of the Statue of Liberty. But what sets his office apart\nis the gallery of objects and books arrayed behind the desk.There is the rose-\npetal birthday present from his husband — a framed card that says “I love you”\nin Braille. Below that stands a picture of a wiry terrier named Galahad,\nacquired as a “sobriety dog” when Mr. Chavez stopped drinking in the 1990s. A\nfew feet down, a basketball perches on a shelf.“Basketball is so not me that I\ndecided to put it up there so people could say, ‘What is Marty doing with a\nbasketball in his office?’” he said, bursting into a peal of laughter.Mr.\nChavez, who is 52 and has a thick beard, represents a departure from the\nbutton-down partners of Goldman lore — plutocrats who wore their power on\ntheir sleeves and turned the bank into the most vaunted, feared and secretive\ncompany on Wall Street.Goldman’s reputation took a beating after the 2008\nfinancial crisis, when Rolling Stone called the company a “great vampire squid\nwrapped around the face of humanity.” The current presidential race, echoing\nwith populist, anti-Wall Street messages, is putting the company’s ruthless\nreputation in the spotlight again.Today Goldman is trying to change not only\nthat public image, but also some of the central tenets of its culture, like\nthe secrecy and reliance on back-room dealings. The company’s chief executive,\nLloyd C. Blankfein, has said he wants Goldman to be thought of as a tech\ncompany — putting it in direct competition for talent with the Googles and\nFacebooks of the world. No one is more central to these efforts than Mr.\nChavez.Mr. Chavez, who was promoted just over two years ago to oversee the\ncompany’s 9,000 or so computer engineers — nearly a third of the staff — is\npushing the 147-year-old company to, among other things, share more of its\ndata and software with clients. His centerpiece project, Marquee, gives\nclients access to sophisticated trading data previously available only by\nphoning a Goldman employee.Marquee is so closely associated with Mr. Chavez,\nin fact, that it was initially called “Martee,” a play on his first name. But\nit has faced internal resistance. Some colleagues complain that the company is\nhanding out valuable information while paving the way for job cuts.Mr. Chavez\nhas responded forcefully, according to people who witnessed some of these\nconversations. “He basically said something to the effect of: ‘If your job is\na purely manual job and you are just clicking buttons, you should look to\nupgrade your skills set now,’” said Adam Korn, a trading executive. “He was\npretty direct.”Some of Mr. Chavez’s ideas about openness date to his early\nyears in Silicon Valley, where sharing is a religion. They haven’t always\nworked out: At one start-up, he proposed publicly posting everyone’s salaries,\nan unpopular idea.For Mr. Chavez, transparency is a kind of personal credo. He\ndisplays his gay and Latino identities proudly, as well as the Japanese\ntattoos on his arms. Conversations with him routinely turn to the intricacies\nof marrying his husband, a Briton, and raising their baby son, who was born to\na surrogate in California. He urges his colleagues to open up more as well,\narguing that it can serve as an antidote to the negative public image of\nGoldman.Mr. Chavez represents broad pressures across the financial industry.\nThe 2008 economic crisis and the regulations that followed it are forcing\nbanks to become less opaque and more technologically savvy and efficient. This\nhas shifted the center of power in the business away from the trading desks,\nwhere it was before the crisis, and toward the programmers and engineers —\nuntil recently dismissed as the geeks in the back office.Particularly at a\nplace like Goldman, the changes can be an uncomfortable fit with business\npractices and a culture that have been built up over decades. Charles M.\nElson, an expert on corporate governance at the University of Delaware, said\nthat Goldman, born as an adviser to corporations, is not used to operating out\nin the open.“Fundamentally, it’s trying to refit an old car,” said Mr. Elson,\nwho is the director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance,\nnamed for the man who ran Goldman in the 1980s. “It’s not buffing that’s going\nto do it,” Mr. Elson said. “In this new environment you have to rethink the\nwhole chassis.”Mr. Elson said that Goldman went through a similar change when\nit converted from a partnership to a publicly traded company. That led to mass\ndepartures and internal battles, though Goldman emerged more profitable. It’s\nnot clear that the current slimming-down and opening-up will lead to the same\nresults.Mr. Chavez says that if efforts like his are successful, clients will\nsee “a very different configuration of the financial services industry than\nthe one we have now.” Goldman will still have the chief product of a bank —\nmoney to lend and invest — but he thinks that the ways in which customers get\naccess to that money will rely more on software and less on the bankers who\ntraditionally delivered Goldman’s services.Mr. Chavez grew up in Albuquerque\nwith two parents who had not graduated from college and four siblings. All\nfive of the children went to Harvard. His mother, a court stenographer whose\nparents had come from Mexico and Spain to the United States as immigrants,\ntold Mr. Chavez that, because he was Hispanic, “To get half as far, you have\nto work twice as hard.”He was the statistician for the basketball team and\nread the Encyclopaedia Britannica front to back. “I have no idea how he did\nit,” his mother, Rose Chavez, said recently. He earned the nickname\n“motormouth” from an uncle.There was, though, at least one thing he didn’t\ntalk about: his sexuality. He only came out the day after he defended his\ndoctoral dissertation, in medical information sciences, at Stanford.The\ndifficulty of being in the closet is part of what convinced Mr. Chavez of the\nimportance of transparency. “It can be hard to be out — or one can imagine\nthat it might be hard, which is more often the case,” he wrote in a memo to\ncolleagues in 2011. “But if that imagination leads to holding back,\nmanufacturing alternative stories of how you spent your weekend or where you\nspent your time off, that not only impacts your peace of mind, it also has\nnegative consequences for your career.”When a recruiter from Goldman contacted\nhim in the early 1990s, he worried that Wall Street wouldn’t take to his\nsexuality as kindly as Silicon Valley had. At the time he worked for a\nsoftware start-up and had little notion of what Goldman even did.“I didn’t\nthink much about Wall Street,” he said recently. “I thought I was being clever\nin getting a free trip to New York City.”During interviews at the bank, he\nsaid, he was impressed by his interviewers’ quick wits. And his future boss\ntook it in stride when Mr. Chavez said he was gay.Soon Mr. Chavez was plunged\ninto Goldman’s early efforts to automate its trading business with a computer\nsystem, SecDB, which is still the spine of its operations. Within the elite\ntrading division where Mr. Chavez was placed, the J. Aron \u0026amp; Company\noperation — a shop that groomed many of the company’s leaders — he worked with\nMr. Blankfein, now the chief executive, and Gary D. Cohn, now Goldman’s\npresident.Mr. Chavez struggled, though, with drinking, a vice he attributes to\nan overindulgence in New York’s gay night life. While going through Alcoholics\nAnonymous in 1997, Mr. Chavez got Galahad, the dog, to try to help him stay\nsober.He also decided he wanted a change of scene — pulling a “geographic” in\nthe parlance of A.A. Over the protests of Mr. Cohn, he briefly took a job at\nanother Wall Street company, Credit Suisse, then jumped back into the start-up\nworld, building a company, Kiodex, that wrote software to evaluate energy-\ntrading risks.Kiodex had a rough ride. First, the tech bubble burst. Then, Mr.\nChavez decided to collaborate with Enron right before the energy company went\nbust.Sean Patrick Maloney, one of Mr. Chavez’s deputies at Kiodex, said Mr.\nChavez’s outsider status gave him an unusual problem-solving creativity. “When\nyou cross lines of difference in life — and you embrace things that to others\nseem taboo — it absolutely changes the way your brain works,” said Mr.\nMaloney, who is now a Democratic congressman from upstate New York. “He sees\nthings that others miss.”Still, his approach would occasionally go astray. It\nwas at Kiodex where Mr. Chavez proposed making everyone’s salary public. Tom\nFarley, then Kiodex’s chief financial officer, says he talked Mr. Chavez out\nof that. “The type of transparency that Marty espouses isn’t for everyone,”\nsaid Mr. Farley, who is now in charge of the New York Stock Exchange.Mr.\nChavez, for his part, says the episode helped teach him not to prize “radical\ntransparency for its own sake.”Kiodex eventually recovered. Mr. Chavez sold it\nand retired to his house on Fire Island. He was 40 years old.In the first\nweeks of his early retirement, Mr. Cohn phoned Mr. Chavez and asked him to\nreturn to Goldman. To consider the offer, Mr. Chavez traveled to a Catholic\nmonastery in New Mexico for contemplation. At a Recode event last fall, he\nrecounted how, while he was on toilet duty, God spoke to him and told him to\ngo back to Goldman.This is dicey territory for a Goldman partner. Mr.\nBlankfein was pilloried when he said, in 2009, that Goldman was “doing God’s\nwork.” Mr. Chavez said recently that he regrets his reference to God at the\nevent, but the incident conveys the earnest passion with which he speaks about\nGoldman.Mr. Chavez was back at Goldman when the financial crisis hit — at the\ncenter of the bank’s efforts to calculate and track its health during those\nstressful times. Goldman made it through with better results than most rivals.\nBut that success itself caused problems when government investigations\nuncovered instances in which Goldman profited from the country’s economic\npain.Mr. Chavez recalls friends and family asking: How can you work there? It\nwas a message echoing across the world, with Wall Street under fire for\ndriving the nation to the brink of disaster. Goldman began a charm\noffensive.The company hired a new public relations chief, Jake Siewert, who\npreviously worked as a chief White House spokesman under Bill Clinton. Goldman\nalso began advertising campaigns stressing its philanthropic work and the\nfinancing it provides for projects like a new basketball arena in Kentucky.The\ncrisis gave Mr. Chavez an opening to adopt a more aggressive strategy in his\nday-to-day work. With Wall Street facing the prospect of declining revenue and\nrising costs, the company was receptive to his proposals to standardize and\nautomate more of its trading operations. Part of the savings to Goldman came\nfrom job cuts, though the bank does not provide detailed numbers.He also\npitched automation as a way to help Goldman comply with the Dodd-Frank\nfinancial reform, which aimed, in part, to make trading more transparent and\neasier for regulators to track.In the summer of 2013, an incident illustrated\nthe perils of the old ways of doing business and paved the way for Mr.\nChavez’s elevation to chief information officer. Goldman’s options-trading\ndesks had installed faulty software that caused sharp swings in the market and\nresulted in tens of millions of dollars of losses. An internal investigation\nfound that the group installing the software had not been in touch with other\nparts of the trading business.In the past, the elite trading-desk programmers\n— strategists, or “strats” in Goldman lingo — had been in a different division\nfrom the traditional I.T. department. Mr. Chavez gained control of both units\nand unified them, causing some consternation on both sides. The strats worried\nabout being dumbed down, employees say, while the I.T. engineers worried about\nbeing marginalized.Mr. Chavez also began aggressively pushing projects like\nSymphony, a program begun as a way to allow Goldman employees to communicate.\nUnder Mr. Chavez, however, it was spun off into an independent company that\nthe broader banking industry is now collaborating on. One draw of the system\nis that it may provide at least a partial alternative to expensive Bloomberg\nterminals.Symphony is representative of Mr. Chavez’s larger strategy. He gave\nup the opportunity to develop the software internally and turn it into a\nsource of revenue in order to create something that everyone in the industry\nmight use, and that might allow Goldman to communicate with all of its clients\nbetter, even if it is not making money off Symphony itself.But the software,\nlike other programs Mr. Chavez is pushing, faces major hurdles to its success.\nIt still needs to win over investment firms — the biggest clients of the banks\n— and many of them are hesitant to use software that, they worry, might give\nthe banks a way to snoop on their communications.Mr. Chavez’s efforts have\nalso faced skepticism in the technology community, in no small part because of\na prominent case in which the company accused a former employee and\nprogrammer, Sergey Aleynikov, of stealing Goldman’s software upon leaving the\ncompany.Mr. Aleynikov prevailed in court. And the case left the impression in\nthe tech world — among some of the very programmers Goldman is now trying to\nrecruit — that the bank would always value its bottom line over the ideals of\nSilicon Valley.Mr. Chavez was not involved in Mr. Aleynikov’s case. And he has\nbeen trying to confront Wall Street’s mixed reputation among programmers. He\nhas gone to lead recruiting events at elite institutions like the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, where the number of students applying\nto Wall Street has fallen sharply, in part because of the perception of the\nindustry as stuffy and slow-moving.Mr. Chavez has not been shy about pushing\nthe company to embrace social issues as a selling point. He urged its human\nresources department to expand benefits to gay partners before the Supreme\nCourt legalized gay marriage. He then encouraged Mr. Blankfein to speak out in\nsupport of gay marriage.Still, he acknowledges, there is much to do. At the\nRecode event last fall, he joked about Goldman’s lack of diversity.He was in\nan office, he said, with a fellow Hispanic executive, when another executive\nstopped by. “He opens the door, he sticks his head in, and he says, ‘50\npercent of the Hispanic partners of Goldman Sachs, right here, right now.’”\nThe task now, he said, was to take Goldman “to a different place.”\n\n","title":"A Gay, Latino Partner Tests Goldman’s Button-Down Culture - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @deanemurphy: Marty Chavez of Goldman - gay, Latino \u0026amp; transparent - is bent on refitting an old Wall Street car.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013de"},"content":"OTTAWA — Canada, where hockey passion is so intense that weddings on rinks are\na thing, will not have a single team in the N.H.L.’s Stanley Cup playoffs.\nIt’s as if Argentina were shut out of the world’s premier tango competition,\nor France had no representation in the Michelin Guide.To call it a national\ncrisis would be unfair. It’s worse than that — at least according to many\nhockey die-hards here whose lives revolve around the playoffs each spring.\nWhat has happened to us, they wonder. And what do we do now?“I told my wife\nrecently that I’ll have a lot of free time this spring,” said Geoff Cantello,\na lawyer and hockey fan in Ottawa.Sixteen of the league’s 30 teams make the\nplayoffs, which begin April 13. By last week, all seven of the teams based in\nCanada had been eliminated from contention. Entering the weekend, of the six\nN.H.L. teams with 70 or fewer points, five were Canadian.Playoffs without a\nCanadian team had not happened in 46 years, when there were only two Canadian\nteams in a 12-team league, and when the current N.H.L. players, and possibly\nsome of their parents, had not been born.But the plight of Canada’s\nprofessional hockey teams is not entirely new. No Canadian team has won the\nStanley Cup since 1993.“No Canadian teams, that’s huge,” said Adam Godard, a\nlong-suffering fan of the Toronto Maple Leafs. “Things definitely have got to\nbe blown up. Things have got to change.”Hockey is not dying in Canada. (See\nOlympic gold, 2014, 2010.) But a confluence of factors is giving American\nteams an edge in the professional league (and “American” is a loose term here,\ngiven that Canadian players populate every roster).Sixteen of the 21 finals\nsince the Montreal Canadiens became the last Canadian team to win the Stanley\nCup have been all-American affairs. This allows for some gloating, a rarity\nfor Americans on the rink. (See Olympics, 2014, 2010.)Last month, even\nPresident Obama joined in, ribbing the prime minister of Canada, Justin\nTrudeau, whose father held the job the last time Canada was shut out of the\nplayoffs.When Obama was asked at a news conference with Trudeau which country\nplayed better hockey, he said: “Where’s the Stanley Cup right now? I’m sorry,\nis it in my hometown?” (Yes, Mr. President, it is, with the Chicago\nBlackhawks.)Canadians offer many explanations for the drought, from serious to\nconspiratorial. The current favorite theory is that the now-low value of the\nCanadian dollar makes it difficult for Canadian teams to attract top talent\npaid in American currency.But whatever the cause, the league and its Canadian\nbroadcast rights holder, Rogers Communications, are waiting to see if an\nabsence of patriotic favorites will prompt Canadians to find new rituals this\nspring.“I think a lot of people will be like the hockey players: getting their\ngolf clubs out and hoping for the weather to improve,” Cantello said.As if the\ndrought were not bad enough, consider that some ice-challenged places south of\nthe border are doing better: Three teams from California, two from Florida and\nteams from Texas and Tennessee will very likely make the playoffs.On Tuesday\nnight, four days after the Vancouver Canucks were mathematically eliminated\nfrom the postseason, disengaged fans watched the Canucks fall to the playoff-\nbound San Jose Sharks, 4-1, dropping Vancouver at the time to a three-way tie\nfor the league’s worst record. Five seasons ago, the Canucks enjoyed a magical\nrun to the Stanley Cup finals, making them the last Canadian team to\nqualify.Last week, in what was once considered among the loudest arenas in the\nN.H.L., there were clusters of empty seats.“This season has been a little\nboring, to be honest with you,” said Jessica Bedi, 29. “We’re season-ticket\nholders and we go to the games only because we have to. We try to sell tickets\nsometimes, but people just don’t want them.”Of course, not all Canadian hockey\nfans support Canadian hockey teams, even in good times.Sometimes their reasons\nare geographical. Windsor, Ontario, tends to root for the Detroit Red Wings,\njust across a river, rather than the Maple Leafs, a four-hour drive away in\nToronto.Some fans pick teams based on favorite players. Jack Jedwab, the\npresident of the Association for Canadian Studies, said he believed that was\nincreasingly true among younger fans, like his 19-year-old son, who lives in\nMontreal but is a Tampa Bay Lightning supporter because he likes a star\nplayer, Steven Stamkos, who is from suburban Toronto.To Jedwab, the eclipse of\nCanadian teams is an inevitable consequence of the sport’s growth through\nAmerican expansion.“We’re a bit of a victim of our success,” Jedwab said.The\nresult has been particularly traumatic in Montreal.“We’re adjusting easily to\nthe Montreal Canadiens not being the legends of old,” Jedwab said. “We think\nof them as a team in a separate universe. Things have changed; those days are\nlong gone. I hate to say this as a Montrealer: They’ve become like all the\nother teams.”Jedwab said he was struggling over the question of whether to\nwatch the playoffs. Professional basketball seems more interesting lately, and\nhe finds himself “really caught up in the Raptors thing.”“It’s a more\ncompelling story,” he said.Godard, who lives about 90 minutes from Toronto\nwhen traffic is light, also finds his attention drawn to the N.B.A.’s Raptors,\nand was in their arena, Air Canada Centre, on Wednesday when they defeated the\nAtlanta Hawks, 119-100. The Raptors lead the N.B.A.’s Atlantic Division, and\nthey have clinched a berth in the N.B.A. playoffs.Inevitably, the Canadian\nN.H.L. teams’ woes have fed a broader debate about hockey’s future in Canada.\nPessimists add the teams’ shutout to a list that also includes growing\nconcerns among parents about concussions in hockey as well as children’s\nincreasing participation in soccer and basketball.Still, despite his newfound\nenthusiasm for the Raptors, Jedwab is not among those forecasting a decline in\nhockey’s prominence in Canada.After all, last year, five Canadian teams were\nin the playoffs (and the year before that, only one, but we won’t mention\nthat.)A nation that powers through harsh winters won’t be checked so easily by\na particularly bad sports one.“It’s not going to effect a big identity deficit\nfor Canada,” Jedwab said.\n\n","title":"A Spring of Discontent for Canadian Hockey - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Canada, where hockey passion is oh-so-intense, won't have a single team in the Stanley Cup playoffs https://t.co/Gu6jtZBIgw","date":"Sat Apr 02 18:25:05 +0000 2016","favs":154,"id":{"$numberLong":"716330629189734400"},"retweets":116},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PNTK4u"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013df"},"content":"Houston — MARCH was not a good month for a certain kind of Texas loyalist.\nThere was the State Board of Education candidate, Mary Lou Bruner of Mineola,\nwho insisted that President Obama had been a male prostitute in his\nyouth.There was the head of the Travis County Republican Party, Robert Morrow,\nwho recently mused on Twitter about who “has a bigger penis: Donald Trump or\nHillary Clinton.”There was the suggestion from a conservative talk-radio host\nthat the former governor Rick Perry might be a viable candidate for an anti-\nTrump third-party run, despite having run against Mr. Trump already in the\nRepublican nomination contest and been eliminated early.And — I would never\nsay finally — there was Sid Miller, the agricultural commissioner whose latest\ncontroversial expenditure of taxpayer dollars involved a $1,200 trip to\nOklahoma for something called a “Jesus shot,” a dubious medical procedure that\nis claimed to take away pain for life.In fairness, Mr. Miller did get banged\nup as a rodeo cowboy before entering state government.Still, these are the\nkinds of events that cause people from places like Massachusetts, Manhattan\nand California, not to mention England, France and Sweden, to ask us: “How can\nyou stand to live in Texas?” Their tone usually suggests that any explanation\nthat doesn’t involve our incarceration here is indefensible.I admit that a\nmore positive response to this inquiry has become more difficult over time,\nespecially since 2000, when Mr. Perry ushered in an era of government by\npeople who, well, hate government. And it’s true that occasionally my husband\nand I scan the local headlines — coverage of the relentless assault on Planned\nParenthood comes to mind — and ask ourselves whether we should be packing\nup.“Are we crazy?” is the way my husband, who is from Virginia, puts it.There\nare stock responses to the criticism. Texas P.R. firms have tried them all:\nour _amazing urban sophistication_, our _amazing urban diversity_ and let’s\nnot forget our _amazing economy —_ at least when the oil price is high. And\nthough we can say that we introduced America to Ted Cruz, we’re not\nresponsible for Mr. Trump.Sticking around here was never even my plan. Growing\nup, I suffered with the other kids who were incapable of following a football\ngame but had mastered “Oliver Twist” (the book, not the movie). My best friend\nin middle school despaired at my incompetence with hair and makeup. (“You\ncould be so pretty if you tried.”)So when I headed for college on the East\nCoast in 1972, I never intended to return. I would move to Greenwich Village\nafter graduation, and grow red geraniums in window boxes.Instead, in a few\nyears, I was back. There were sensible reasons: I had a job offer in Houston,\na newly booming city that, even in the ’70s, featured some of the amenities of\nNew York and Los Angeles without the cost-of-living sticker shock. Back here,\nno one asked me why I didn’t have a Texas accent. I had learned the dirty\nlittle secret that there was provincialism on the East Coast as well as in\nTexas.I was homesick, too. From Houston, my parents and younger brothers were\njust a three-hour drive away, down a highway beside which grows in spring a\ncarpet of bluebonnets.I had missed the sounds of Spanish-language radio and\nbarbecue on demand. I had missed people who were glad to see me, even if they\nbarely knew me. And yes, I had missed a certain habit of being — witnessing a\nhilarious parade of people who had more money than sense, and legislators who\ncame to work with five-star hangovers but who, back then, still saw the value\nof funding public education.These may sound like the sentimental\nrationalizations of someone who couldn’t make it elsewhere, and maybe they\nare. Yet, there’s something to be said for finding one’s place in the world,\nespecially when the world is such an irascible place, so in need of\nimprovement.Today, I find myself making a lot of defensive distinctions\nbetween the people in state government and the people who actually live here.\nThat said, the United States Congress itself isn’t so different from the Texas\nLegislature nowadays, and neither is very funny anymore.The azaleas have begun\nto bloom, turning Houston into a gaudy fuchsia sea. Yet, it’s still cool\nenough at night to sleep with the windows open, instead of running the air-\nconditioning. At the rodeo, they serve candied apples dipped in tajin, a\nMexican blend of chile peppers, salt and lime.A few weeks ago, Houston’s\nhoity-toitiest ladies showed off their ocean liner-size chapeaux at a spring\nfund-raiser that was interrupted by a tulle-wilting thunderstorm. I took off\nmy heels and walked barefoot to my car, hopeful that the storm had blown over.\n\n","title":"Why Texas Is Deep in My Heart - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytopinion: There’s something to be said for finding one’s place in the world, writes Mimi Swartz.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013e0"},"content":"HOUSTON — It is the best of times, it is the worst of times. It is the spring\nof hope, it is the winter of despair. They may have the best basketball team\nin the country, and they definitely have the worst basketball team in the\ncountry.But this is a tale of only one city.With Villanova (33-5) routing\nOklahoma, 95-51, Saturday night, the Wildcats are one victory from their first\nnational championship since 1985. They have given residents of Philadelphia,\njust a few miles from their suburban campus, much to cheer about. At the same\ntime, Philadelphia’s N.B.A. team, the 76ers, were 9-67 through Friday, which\nmeans that if they lose their final six games, they will achieve a share of\nthe worst record in league history (along with the 1972-73 version of, yes,\nthe 76ers).“I was talking to my bookies in Vegas,” joked Charles Barkley, the\nTurner Sports analyst and former Sixer. “Villanova’s like a 2-point favorite\nover the Sixers.”Villanova Coach Jay Wright, a native of nearby Bucks County,\nsaid Friday, a day before Villanova defeated Oklahoma in the national\nsemifinals, that he thought the Sixers’ travails had helped rally the city\naround his team.“Because of the recent last couple years,” he said, “they’ve\nbeen saying it all year; everybody’s been putting pressure on us, saying:\n‘Hey, you guys are Philly’s hope. Do you feel the pressure?’ ”Wright added:\n“There’s buildings in Philadelphia that have the lights going across the top:\n‘Nova Final Four.’ It’s pretty cool. We would love to do it. We would love to\ndo it for Philly.”Villanova and the Sixers have been hardcourt opposites for a\nwhile. Over the last three seasons, including this one, Villanova had gone\n95-13 heading into Saturday, winning roughly nine in 10 games, while the\nSixers have lost about four of every five.Since Wright took over at Villanova\nin 2001, the Sixers, now with three straight seasons of at least 63 losses,\nhave had nine head coaches (including interims). Villanova’s roster is led by\ntwo four-year seniors, while the Sixers — using a strategy called the Process,\nwhich essentially involves tanking in order to accrue high draft picks —\nfeature many younger players and several promising prospects, though as a\nresult of injury, some of them have barely played.As a result, an N.C.A.A.\ntitle by Villanova now would merit nothing less than a parade, argued Ed\nRendell, a columnist for The Philadelphia Daily News who used to be\nPennsylvania’s governor and, before that, the mayor of Philadelphia.“People\nhere love a parade; we were starved for a parade between ’83 and 2008,” he\nsaid Friday in an interview, referring to the Sixers’ last N.B.A. championship\nand the Phillies’ last World Series victory.So much do Philadelphians love a\nparade, Rendell recalled, that there had been some discussion in 2004 about\nholding a Triple Crown parade for Smarty Jones, a thoroughbred horse born in\nnearby Chester County who had won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes\nbefore placing second in the Belmont Stakes.The plan was ultimately nixed.\n“We’re going to put a horse on a flatbed truck?” Rendell said.Two features of\nPhiladelphia basketball life complicate Villanova’s hold over the city. Both\nrelate to Philadelphia’s proud history as a basketball bastion, dating to the\npre-N.B.A. team the SPHAs (which stood for South Philadelphia Hebrew\nAssociation), the Big 5 (Division I men’s teams that all played home games at\nthe historic Palestra) and the original Philadelphia N.B.A. franchise, the\nWarriors (since moved to California, where they are the reigning N.B.A. champs\nand this year could set a record for victories in a season).According to\nseveral observers, Philadelphia basketball fans are sophisticated and\ntherefore not all quite as down on the Sixers as one might expect, given the\nteam’s recent struggles.“There are certainly a number of people that believe\nin what they’re doing,” said Dick Jerardi, a Philadelphia Daily News\nsportswriter since 1985. He added, “I don’t happen to be one of those\npeople.”Among the people who do is Ryan Arcidiacono, Villanova’s senior guard,\nwho grew up near the city.“Trust the Process. Trust the Process,” he said,\nrepeating what has become a mantra (albeit a sometimes satirical\none).Arcidiacono expressed hope that two top injured Sixers prospects, Nerlens\nNoel and Joel Embiid, would return soon, and added of Providence’s graduating\npoint guard who could go high in June’s draft, “Get Kris Dunn there, too.”The\nother complication is that college basketball fans in the City of Brotherly\nLove do not always love their college basketball brothers. There are six\nDivision I programs in the city, and while Jerardi averred that Villanova had\nthe largest fan base — one capable of selling out the Sixers’ large Wells\nFargo Center for regular-season games — that did not mean that fans of Temple\nand LaSalle would just roll over for the Final Four squad.“My hope is that\nthey appreciate what Villanova is accomplishing,” Phil Martelli, the coach of\nanother Philadelphia team, St. Joseph’s, said of the rival fan bases. “I don’t\nthink it’s necessary for them to cheer for Villanova.”He added:\n“Philadelphia’s a basketball town. The other thing Philadelphia is is very\nparochial. So if your team is St. Joseph’s, you root for St. Joseph’s.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013e1"},"content":"LOTE OCHO, Guatemala — Her husband was away in the fields, she said, when the\ntruckloads of soldiers, police officers and mining security officials arrived.\nA half-dozen armed men swarmed into her one-room house, blocking her exit and\nhelping themselves to the meal she had made for her children.For a long time,\nthe woman, Margarita Caal Caal, did not talk about what happened next that\nafternoon. None of the women in this tiny village high in the hills of eastern\nGuatemala did, not even to each other. But that day, Mrs. Caal said, the men\nwho had come to evict her from land they said belonged to a Canadian mining\ncompany also took turns raping her. After that, they dragged her from her home\nand set it ablaze.“The fear is not over,” she said recently, staring down at\nher hands while her daughter served coffee to visitors. “I still fear, all the\ntime.”Mrs. Caal has taken her case to the courts, but not in Guatemala, where\nMayan villagers like her, illiterate and living in isolated areas, have had\nlittle legal success. She has filed in Canada, where her negligence suit, Caal\nv. Hudbay Mineral Inc., has sent shivers through the vast Canadian mining, oil\nand gas industry. More than 50 percent of the world’s publicly listed\nexploration and mining companies had headquarters in Canada in 2013, according\nto government statistics. Those 1,500 companies had an interest in some 8,000\nproperties in more than 100 countries around the world.For decades, overseas\nsubsidiaries have acted as a shield for extractive companies even while human\nrights advocates say they have chronicled a long history of misbehavior,\nincluding environmental damage, the violent submission of protesters and the\nforced evictions of indigenous people.But Mrs. Caal’s negligence claim and\nthose of 10 other women from this village who say they were gang-raped that\nday in 2007, as well as two other negligence claims against Hudbay, have\nalready passed several significant legal hurdles — suggesting that companies\nbased in Canada could face new scrutiny about their overseas operations in the\nfuture. In June, a ruling ordered Hudbay to turn over what Mrs. Caal’s lawyers\nexpect will be thousands of pages of internal documents. Hudbay, which was not\nthe owner of the mine at the time of the evictions, denies any\nwrongdoing.Canadian law does not provide for huge American-style payoffs, even\nif the court rules in the plaintiff’s favor. But the Hudbay case is being\nwatched carefully because it appears to offer a new legal pathway for those\nwho say they have suffered at the hands of Canadian subsidiaries. A ruling in\nthis case, experts say, could also help establish powerful guidelines for what\nconstitutes acceptable corporate behavior.“Up until now, we just have not had\njudicial decisions that help us consider these sorts of relationships,” said\nSara Seck, an expert on corporate social responsibility at the Faculty of Law,\nWestern University, in London, Ontario. “For once, the court is going to look\nat what really happened here, and that is important.”The behavior of\nmultinational companies working in poor countries has come under increasing\nfire in recent years. Social expectations have changed, experts say, with many\ncitizens of rich countries demanding that corporations be more responsible in\nthe countries where they operate.In Canada, efforts to define a code of good\nbehavior for extractive corporations are longstanding, if so far unsuccessful.\nMany mining companies are based there because Canada offers a concentration of\nexpertise in mining finance and law, and the government offers incentives\nincluding tax breaks.A bill that would have created an ombudsman to\ninvestigate complaints and deny access to government loans — and even consular\nservices — to companies accused of behaving poorly failed by a narrow margin\nin 2010 after facing fierce opposition from the extractive industry. John\nMcKay, a member of Parliament from the Liberal Party who sponsored that bill,\nsaid he expected Canada’s new government to try again soon.“There are\ncompanies out there doing things that they would never do in their own\ncountries,” he said.In a 2014 report, the Council on Hemispheric Affairs, a\npolicy group in Washington, concluded that Canadian companies, accounting for\n50 percent to 70 percent of the mining in Latin America, were often associated\nwith extensive damage to the environment, from erosion and sedimentation to\ngroundwater and river contamination. Of particular note, it said, was that the\nindustry “demonstrated a disregard for registered nature reserves and\nprotected zones.”At the same time, the report said, local people were being\ninjured, arrested or, in some cases, killed for protesting.Victims, however,\nhave had little success gaining access to Canadian courts. Their lawyers have\noften tried to get cases heard on the basis of violations of human rights or\ninternational criminal law. But most were told that Canada had no\njurisdiction, and that their claims would be more appropriately heard in the\ncountry where the events took place, even if that country’s courts were\nnotoriously corrupt or otherwise dysfunctional.The lawyers for the plaintiffs\nin the Hudbay case, Murray Klippenstein and Cory Wanless, took a novel\napproach, however, making a simpler claim. They said the Canadian parent\ncompany was negligent for failing to put an effective monitoring system in\nplace to understand what its Guatemalan subsidiary was doing. Framing the\nclaim in this way allowed the plaintiffs to draw a clear connection between\nthe negligence and Canada.In addition to the claims brought by Mrs. Caal and\nthe other women who say they were raped in Lote Ocho, Hudbay, based in\nToronto, is facing claims over the death of a prominent local leader, Adolfo\nIch Chamán, 50, and the shooting and paralysis of a bystander, German Chub,\n28, during demonstrations against mining in the nearby town of El Estor in\n2009.Hudbay lawyers moved to have the case dismissed both because of\njurisdictional grounds and because it was “plain and obvious” that the claims\nwould fail. Before the ruling on jurisdiction, they dropped that claim and\nwent forward with the other one. In July 2013, however, the judge ruled it was\nnot obvious that the claims were without merit.Turning to the courts has not\nbeen easy for the plaintiffs, most of whom speak only Q’eqchi’, a Mayan\nlanguage, have had little or no schooling, and find the prospect of going to\nCanada terrifying. In addition, they face animosity from a sizable portion of\nthe local population, particularly in El Estor, where there is a giant nickel\nprocessing plant.Hudbay officials dispute most of the plaintiffs’ claims. They\nsay that no mining security officials were present during the Lote Ocho\nevictions and that no rapes took place. The company’s website also points out\nthat at the time, Hudbay had nothing to do with the mine. It was owned by\nCompañía Guatemalteca de Níquel, a subsidiary of another Canadian company,\nSkye Resources Inc., which Hudbay bought in 2008, assuming its liabilities.\nHudbay has since sold the mine.Hudbay officials also maintain that there was\nno negligence in 2009 when it did own the mine. Officials say the killing of\nMr. Ich, a teacher, and the shooting of Mr. Chub, a farmer, took place as the\nmine’s security guards were defending themselves from armed protesters.But\nsome recent events appear to lend credence to the plaintiffs’ claims. The head\nof the mine’s security during the 2007 evictions and the 2009 shootings, a\nformer army colonel named Mynor Padilla, is now on trial in Guatemala over the\nshooting of Mr. Ich and Mr. Chub.Moreover, an army officer and a paramilitary\nofficer were convicted in February of raping and enslaving indigenous women in\nthe 1980s, during Guatemala’s long civil war, suggesting, some advocates say,\nthat such behavior has long been entrenched in this country. During the war\nbetween the United States-backed government and leftist rebels, the indigenous\npopulation in this region was repeatedly attacked for trying to make land\nclaims.Even now, the local Q’eqchi’ population believes much of the land in\nthe area belongs to it, and not to the mining company.At the time of Mrs.\nCaal’s eviction, there was no mining anywhere near Lote Ocho, but mining\nofficials moved to evict the villagers anyway. The community is made up of\nabout a dozen scattered, flimsy wooden houses, home to about 100 people, most\nof them children.There is no electricity here or a school for the children.\nThe village is a bumpy 45-minute ride in a pickup truck uphill from the\nnearest town. But that costs money, so most of the villagers walk there using\na footpath, which takes about two hours.Mrs. Caal said the armed men who\nattacked her during the eviction were so brutal with her that she could not\nget up from the spot where they had left her. But when her husband asked what\nhad happened to her, she told him only that she had fallen, afraid of how he\nmight react.It is still a subject she turns to reluctantly.“Remembering is\nreliving,” Mrs. Caal said. “It hurts. It hurts as a woman.”\n\n","title":"Guatemalan Women’s Claims Put Focus on Canadian Firms’ Conduct Abroad - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"They came to evict her from land they said belonged to a Canadian company.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013e3"},"content":"MIAMI — One recent sunny morning, Chalmers Vasquez, Miami-Dade County’s\nmosquito control manager, peered into a rain-filled Miller High Life bottle in\na weedy backyard.“This is very dangerous, this situation here,” he said,\nsurveying a glistening pile of dozens more bottles at his feet.A few steps\naway, his fears were confirmed. There, in a junked toilet lying on its side,\nhe found the squiggling larvae of an Aedes aegypti mosquito — the type that is\nspreading the Zika virus and fear of grave birth defects throughout Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean — in a small pool of rainwater.Summer is coming, and\nthe Aedes aegypti will soon be buzzing around its usual haunts in the United\nStates — mostly in the South and Southwest. But it is already here in South\nFlorida, hatching from kiddie pools and rain-catching flowerpots, recycling\ncontainers and bottle caps. Scientists do not believe that the United States\nwill have a runaway Zika epidemic, but most agree that mosquitoes here will\neventually acquire it and that they could start infecting people, leading to\nlocal flare-ups.“A woman could get bitten by a mosquito and have a child with\na terrible malformation — and that could happen in Florida or Texas or\nArizona, or anywhere this mosquito is,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director\nof the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “We don’t think the numbers\nwill be large,” he said, “but the impact could be very large.”Stopping Zika’s\nspread, he and other public health experts say, will require muscular mosquito\ncontrol across a broad swath of the United States. But the quality of services\nvaries wildly.Some of the weakest spots for mosquito control are in places\nwhere the Zika mosquito regularly appears — in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia\nand the Carolinas, and along the Texas coast — largely because they lack the\ntax base to pay for it, said Joseph Conlon, a retired Navy entomologist who is\na technical adviser to the American Mosquito Control Association.If there were\never a place most at risk for homegrown Zika, it is Florida, the state with\nthe largest number of imported Zika cases in the continental United States —\n74 reported at last count. And Miami-Dade — the largest port of entry into the\nUnited States from the biggest countries in Latin America, according to\nfederal statistics — is the county in Florida with the most reported cases,\n32.But despite its importance, Miami-Dade County, population 2.8 million,\nspends just $1.8 million on mosquito control, enough for a staff of 17, of\nwhom 12 are inspectors. In contrast, Lee County, home to Fort Myers and\n660,000 people, spends $16 million a year and has a staff of 88.“It is odd\nthat there’s not more money, considering we are such a global entry point,”\nsaid Whitney A. Qualls, a vector biologist at the University of Miami.Mosquito\ncontrol in the United States is a crazy quilt of jurisdictions that includes\npowerful independent districts with their own taxing authority and threadbare\ncounty health, environment or public works departments.Scrambling to gauge\nmosquito control preparedness, the C.D.C. recently produced a map of mosquito\ndistricts known to exist with troubling blank spots. And some places that were\ncolored in as having districts said district was too grand a word.“I had to\nkind of laugh,” said Paul Ettestad, of the New Mexico Department of Health,\nremarking on the fact that his state appeared to be completely covered. Most\nof what was colored in, he said, “was a guy in the county who drives a snow\nplow in the winter and a sprayer in the summer.”And with local public health\nbudgets still shrunken since the recession of 2008 and President Obama’s $1.8\nbillion Zika funding request stalled in Congress, health officials are\nstarting to worry.That concern pervaded a Zika Action Plan Summit meeting of\nseveral hundred local health officials organized by the C.D.C. on Friday in\nAtlanta. Their problems were different, but all had one in common: too little\nmoney.“There is a broad pattern of decline, and that kind of places us in a\nhandicapped position to start this race,” said E. Oscar Alleyne, the senior\nadviser for public health programs at the National Association of County and\nCity Health Officials, which has calculated that local health departments —\nwhere some mosquito control departments reside — have lost about 12 percent of\ntheir staffs since 2008.Traditional spraying — from trucks and planes — is\nmostly useless against this mosquito, a stealthy urban dweller. Instead,\nbeating it back will require a lot of mosquito workers like Mr. Vasquez\ndumping over a lot of water containers in a lot of backyards.Mr. Vasquez, a\nsoft-spoken man with closely cropped hair and a fondness for bugs, set out\nwith his small team of mosquito inspectors one recent morning, armed with\nchemical larvae killer and turkey basters to suck up larvae-infested water.The\nAedes aegypti mosquito rarely flies more than a few blocks, so their mission\nwas to destroy breeding grounds near the houses of people suspected to have\nbeen infected with the Zika virus. The team knows that as more Zika-infected\ntravelers come to South Florida, the risk rises that a healthy mosquito will\nbite a sick person, pick up the virus and infect healthy people.The first\nhouse with a suspected Zika case was in a scruffy neighborhood in North Miami,\ncanary yellow with a for-sale sign out front. Next door, a young man dressed\nin blue shorts and a striped T-shirt was arguing in Spanish with Pedro\nCastellanos, one of the inspectors. A white cat shot out the front door. Mr.\nCastellanos marched over to a water-filled cat litter box in the front yard\nand poured it out.He handed the man a warning that said he had to clean up his\nyard or pay a fine. The department rarely enforces the fines, but Mr.\nCastellanos said he handed out warnings anyway, “to scare them” and improve\nthe chances they will comply.At the next house, a Haitian immigrant was raking\npalm tree trimmings, and Mr. Castellanos, who has a sixth sense for the\nunlikely places mosquitoes breed, was immediately on alert.“Sir, do you\ncollect rainwater?” Mr. Castellanos asked politely. The man nodded yes and\nwalked him around to his backyard, where a tall blue plastic container stood\nin the shade.“I don’t mind if you do this,” Mr. Castellanos said, “but put a\nscreen on top.”Risk lurks in rich neighborhoods, too, for example in bromeliad\nplants favored by landscapers. Their stiff fronds are perfect receptacles for\nrainwater.“Look at that!” Mr. Vasquez said, pointing to a cluster of the\nplants, their spiky stalks sticking up like rock-star hair in front of a\ncream-colored ranch house. “Perfect Aedes aegypti habitat.”When pressed, Mr.\nVasquez acknowledged that handling a serious flare-up would require asking for\nadditional funding.Dr. Qualls, of the University of Miami, put it more\nbluntly: “Miami-Dade has great people, but their budget is not enough to\nhandle a Zika crisis.”If that happens, Mr. Conlon, the adviser to the American\nMosquito Control Association, said the county, and others like it, would\nprobably have to hire private contractors. (Mr. Vasquez said he was making\nsuch arrangements.) Dr. Frieden of the C.D.C. said the budget request to\nCongress included money for that.So far in Miami, resources have been enough.\nBut summer is coming and Mr. Vasquez is on high alert. He stopped at one house\nthat looked abandoned only to have the homeowner, Robert Hoak, emerge,\nblinking into the sun. Mr. Hoak said he was so preoccupied tending his\nterminally ill wife that his mostly empty swimming pool had turned into a\nmosquito breeding ground.“Do whatever you’ve got to do, guys,” he shouted as\nMr. Vasquez climbed down into the pool to sprinkle some larvae killer in the\ngreen water.\n\n","title":"In Miami, Facing Risk of Zika With Resolve but Limited Resources - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"If there were ever a place most at risk for homegrown Zika, it's Florida https://t.co/NGoTSinWuS https://t.co/tj3ocOMEUS","date":"Sat Apr 02 16:55:06 +0000 2016","favs":136,"id":{"$numberLong":"716307982670278657"},"retweets":134},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SuHLuM"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013e4"},"content":"All was quiet in the reptile room of Ron Peteroy’s Staten Island home one\nrecent Wednesday morning, save the soft chirp of a few doomed crickets. But in\nand around the hundreds of glass tanks and plastic tubs that lined the walls,\nbulgy-eyed creatures were stirring.A fan-footed gecko darted down the wall\nafter a bug. A baby mourning gecko, 2 days old and inchworm-size, scampered\nacross Mr. Peteroy’s finger. A gargoyle gecko, chunky with mottled red and\nblack stripes, gargoyled atop her cage.Some people think furry mammals make\nnice pets. Mr. Peteroy recommends a reptile.“A cat is a cat is a cat is a\ncat,” he said. “They may be different sizes, different fur patterns, different\nsize ears. But you’ve got lizards with no legs, you’ve got lizards with two\nlegs, you’ve got lizards with four legs, you’ve got snakes that have remnants\nof legs. You find me a blue, green and yellow cat or a blue, green and yellow\ndog.”Blue, green, yellow, pink. Teal to tawny from one minute to the next.\nStripes and spots and swirling scales. Eyeballs patterned like galaxies. There\nis no end to the marvels of the lizard, particularly, in Mr. Peteroy’s\nopinion, the gecko.They lick their lidless eyeballs to keep them clean and\nmoist. The tiny hairs on their feet bond at the molecular level with the\nsurfaces they climb and have inspired an entire branch of robotics.The neon\nday gecko is as wondrously garish as a Las Vegas night. The Australian rough\nknob-tailed gecko, helmet-headed and pebble-skinned, uncannily resembles an\nalien humanoid baby.“Here’s where I’m going to blow your mind,” Mr. Peteroy\nsaid, pulling out a tank containing a self-sustaining colony of mourning\ngeckos.“There’s just females. There’s no such thing as a male. They are self-\nreproducing and self-cloning. This is a parthenogenetic gecko.”This being\nspringtime, the mourning gecko tank was filling up with eggs. In fact, there\nwere gecko eggs everywhere. Little hard round ones and green, spotted, soft-\nshell ones that resembled miniature half-inflated rugby balls. Fan-footed\ngecko eggs were stuck to the wall, thanks to an epoxy-like substance in the\nshells. The eggs were tinted pink with the embryo inside.“I will literally\nhave 100 times this amount of babies in five months,” Mr. Peteroy said.Mr.\nPeteroy, a 40-year-old stay-at-home dad and former marine carpenter, breeds\ngeckos and sells them at reptile shows to support his hobby, which is to breed\nmore geckos. (Geckos hail from warm countries all over the world, but most of\nthe ones sold in this country are captive-bred.) He spends eight to 10 hours a\nday in a small, fluorescent-lit room on a side street in the neighborhood\ncalled Castleton Corners, living and breathing gecko essence and chatting with\nfellow reptile enthusiasts.“Twenty years ago,” Mr. Peteroy said, “nobody but\nthe obscure kept reptiles — you had to be a nerd. You had to be a biker. You\nhad to be unwanted.” Nowadays, he said, the appeal of the lizard is\nbroadening. He offered no proof but plenty of reasons. Geckos are\nnonallergenic. They are decidedly low maintenance.“My cat screams three times\na day for its can of food, chasing you around going RAAAAAAOOOO, and then you\ngive it a can of food and it takes two bites and then it’s scratching at the\ndoor to be let out after it stinks up the litter box that smells up the entire\nhouse,” Mr. Peteroy said. “This? I change the cage once a year. I feed it\nthree times a week.”He pulled out a shallow plastic tub. There were two\nsmaller tubs inside, filled with dirt, some fake ivy branches and a couple of\nlids from food-storage containers, under one of which lurked a velvet\ngecko.“You would think ‘Whoa, the guy just throws it in a box,’” he said. But\ngeckos’ needs are very basic — temperature, a moist living environment, hiding\nspots and food. “Everything this little guy is looking for, I have provided\nit.”And notwithstanding their coldbloodedness, lizards can be affectionate\nwith their keepers. “We fall just short on the snuggle and cuddle,” Mr.\nPeteroy said, “but we have reptiles that will interact, and will love you.”Mr.\nPeteroy has harbored a passion for reptiles most of his life. He got in\ntrouble in 2009 when he was caught trafficking protected snakes and turtles,\nbut he paid his debt to society (a $5,000 fine, he said). He swears he\npossesses only legal animals now — how many, he is not sure. “I don’t know,”\nhe said. “Around a thousand.”A few days later, Mr. Peteroy was fattening up\nsome geckos for a  reptile show in White Plains. The FedEx man had just\ndelivered a box of 3,000 juvenile crickets. Mr. Peteroy dusted crickets with\ncalcium powder and sprinkled them liberally into gecko tanks. He squeezed\npurple goo made from dried fruit and ground-up bugs into miniature dishes.He\nwas talking about how geckos can bring a man peace, and even a measure of\nenlightenment.“Instead of getting angry with the guy that cuts you off,\ninstead of, ‘Hey, you, you bumped into my bumper,’ it’s like: ‘Oh, those eggs\nare going to hatch today. I can’t wait to get home and see that.’”\n\n","title":"Lots to Love About a Gecko - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"In a small room on Staten Island, one man and a thousand-odd lizards https://t.co/dlFC67wdpb https://t.co/iCtVRk9vFV","date":"Sat Apr 02 16:28:06 +0000 2016","favs":202,"id":{"$numberLong":"716301187851661312"},"retweets":93},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PNF45B"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013e5"},"content":"EL-BIREH, West Bank — The noise signaled that Hanan Hroub’s second-grade\nstudents were not focusing on their assigned task of scrawling math problems\non balloons. Instead, they were staring at the latest interloper, a tall\nGerman journalist, treading through their classroom to meet their “Miss,” as\nPalestinians call teachers, who recently won a $1 million global education\nprize.And they were popping those balloons.Since the prize was announced March\n13, Palestinian officials have honored Ms. Hroub with festivals and honorary\ndegrees. International reporters have raced to her house and classroom. Some\nIsraelis have denounced her as part of a Palestinian education system they see\nas inciting violence, and noted with dismay that her husband assisted in the\nkilling of six Jewish settlers in the West Bank city of Hebron in 1980.Amid\nall that hubbub, Ms. Hroub, 43, still faced the essential challenge of every\nelementary-school teacher: keeping children on task. On the morning of the\nballoon exercise, she had put four marks underneath a frowning yellow face\npasted to the whiteboard. The smiling face next to it had only a single\nmark.“No, Miss! No! We will concentrate, we promise!” piped up a girl named\nShurouq. Ms. Hroub and her charges discussed why they felt distracted, and\npromised to do better.Ms. Hroub had just returned to school from Dubai, in the\nUnited Arab Emirates, where she received the prize from the Varkey Foundation\nin a ceremony involving Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Prince William,\nas well as Pope Francis by video.The foundation said she had been selected\nfrom the original 8,000 nominees for teaching methods built around educational\ngames that she created for children traumatized by violence. The award came at\nan awkward time: Palestinian teachers, including Ms. Hroub, had been on strike\nfor weeks, demanding better pay. (The Palestinian Authority acceded to a 10\npercent salary increase hours after the prize was announced.)A mother of five\nchildren, now age 18 to 23, Ms. Hroub said she developed her play-therapy\napproach to education for her own children, after Israeli soldiers shot at\ntheir family vehicle at a military checkpoint near Bethlehem in 2000. Ms.\nHroub said she was not in the car and did not know why the soldiers opened\nfire, but that her husband, Omar, who had spent a decade in Israeli prisons,\nwas wounded.After the episode, she said, her children often woke up screaming\nat night, and became aggressive. “The teachers at their schools weren’t\ntrained to deal with that, and I feared that I was losing my children,” she\nrecalled.Over time she realized that her children were at their calmest and\nhappiest while playing. She began scrambling to think of games they could play\ntogether. She built a games section in a corner of the house and told the\nchildren that was their safe place.During that time, the violent years of the\nsecond intifada, the Israeli authorities imposed curfews on the Bethlehem area\nwhere she then lived. When the curfews were lifted, sometimes briefly, “other\nwomen raced to buy food,” she said. “I raced to the news agency to buy papers,\ncrayons, markers, whatever I could to make games for my children.”Having seen\nhow much the games helped her children to cope, Ms. Hroub, who grew up in\nDheisheh, a cinder-block refugee camp in Bethlehem, decided to become a\nteacher to expand their reach. She enrolled in college, fulfilling a dream\ndelayed in part by West Bank campuses having been closed when she finished\nhigh school because of the first Palestinian intifada, and has been at the\nfront of a classroom since 2005. She has refined her methods, frequently\ntaking games from educational websites and tailoring them to the Palestinian\nexperience.“Everything begins with an idea,” she said. “Then I tried it on my\nchildren, then in a classroom. Now, the world knows.”Ms. Hroub said she\nplanned to use the $1 million prize money to create a foundation promoting the\ngames. While the Palestinian Education Ministry has sent dozens of teachers to\nobserve her classroom, she said the method has not really caught on, something\nshe attributed to a cultural resistance by people who think play is\nfrivolous.“Every year it’s the same,” she said. “The parents are in shock: Are\nour kids playing at school? And then they start seeing results.”Not test score\nresults, emotional results.She pointed to a big-boned boy who was on the brink\nof being expelled for bullying. The boy’s father begged Ms. Hroub to work with\nhim and she agreed, on the condition that the parents promise never to hit\nhim. The day of the balloon exercise, Ms. Hroub reprimanded the boy twice but\nalso showered him with praise when he completed his work. After he snatched a\npencil and pushed a girl, she gently sat him next to one of the better-behaved\nstudents.“This boy that you see today is a different child from the one who\nentered my classroom,” she said.That brightly painted classroom on the second\nfloor of the tidy Samiha Khalil School is a stark departure from the typical\nPalestinian classroom of desks in neat rows. For math, the students ran around\nholding numbers from 1 to 9, getting together in pairs that added to 10, then\nknocked odd-numbered balls into a rabbit’s mouth to review odds and evens.At\nstory time, Ms. Hroub donned a rainbow-colored wig over her Islamic head scarf\nand pinched on a red clown nose, reading about a naughty spider named “Sha-\nsha-sha-sha-ban.”She prodded the children toward what she called “peaceful”\nways of disagreeing, including with her. One child dissented from her decision\nto move him after hitting a classmate. “You oppressed me, Miss,” said Laith,\n8. They talked it out.Ms. Hroub said she was not political and would welcome\nher practices being instituted in Israeli classrooms. Yet, one wall of her\nclassroom has an enormous map of the region that does not acknowledge Israel’s\nexistence. As Ms. Hroub took the children on an imagined drive through\nJerusalem, they “toured” Muslim and Christian sites, but she made no mention\nof Jewish ones.Since the prize was announced, some pro-Israel groups have\ncriticized the foundation online because Ms. Hroub’s husband — now a legal\nadviser to the Palestinian Authority — was involved in the 1980 ambush of a\ngroup of Israelis trying to revive a Jewish settlement in Hebron. (Some\nPalestinian news sites have praised him as the “mastermind” of the attack,\nthough a New York Times article at the time described him as having\nassisted.)Others complained that any Palestinian teacher was honored. Itamar\nMarcus, whose Palestinian Media Watch chronicles anti-Israel and anti-Semitic\nstatements in the Arab news media and who has long complained that Palestinian\nschools educate students to hate, said that even if Ms. Hroub was an excellent\nteacher, the award would be seen by the Palestinian Education Ministry “as a\nconfirmation that what they are doing is O.K.”Mr. Marcus complained that 25\nPalestinian schools were named after militants who had killed Israelis or\nJews, and that youth sporting tournaments similarly honored so-called martyrs.\nHe said that videos broadcast on Palestinian television showing schoolchildren\npraising such attacks suggested what they were being taught to do so.Jamal\nDajani, a spokesman for the Palestinian government, dismissed that suggestion.\n“Palestinian children are constantly subjected to Israeli soldiers and armed\nsettlers waving guns in their faces,” he said. “This is enough cause for\nincitement.”Ms. Hroub waved away questions on politics. “I’m a teacher. That’s\nme,” she said. “I can’t change history, what happened before 10 or 20\nyears.”Back in class, Ms. Hroub ended the balloon-math challenge because it\nwas not going anywhere. To change the mood, she played a YouTube video of a\nbaby laughing, and the students collapsed into giggles. They threw their\nballoons in the air, stomped on them and danced. They sang about a Palestinian\ngrandmother, and discussed dental hygiene. They quietly settled into some\nlanguage exercises.With a grin, Ms. Hroub drew a mark under her smiling\nemoticon on the whiteboard.“Another, Miss! We deserve another!” a girl called\nout.She drew another two strokes, prompting cheers from the children: The\nhappy and sad faces now had the same number.\n\n","title":"A Palestinian Teacher’s Methods Earn the Attention of More Than Her Class - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesworld: Meet Palestinian teacher, winner of $1M education prize, who uses classroom play as therapy: https://t.co/SVtEPl9ggb http…","date":"Sat Apr 02 15:46:39 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716290756403728384"},"retweets":195},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PM1LHg"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013e6"},"content":"Americans are angry. That’s the sentiment that many believe is driving the\n2016 election. They are angry because the rich are getting richer, the average\nguy is struggling and the government in Washington hasn’t done anything to\nstop the trend.But it may not be that simple.Data on the nation’s economic\nrecovery, people’s reactions to current economic conditions and their overall\nsense of satisfaction with life doesn’t suggest Americans are angry. In fact,\nhistorical measures indicate people are about as happy and satisfied with the\neconomy and with their lives as they were in 1983 when Ronald Reagan told us\nit was “morning again in America.”If that’s the case, why does it feel more\nlike a 1 a.m. bar brawl?The answer may have more to do with political parties\nthan economics, or at least with the interaction of the two. Today’s voters\nhave sorted themselves and polarized into partisan groups that look very\ndifferent than they did in the late 1980s. To make matters worse, members of\neach side like the other side less than they did before. Americans aren’t\nannoyed only by the economy; they’re also annoyed with each other.Objective\neconomic conditions measured by the Federal Reserve suggest that the nation’s\nrecovery from the Great Recession began in 2010, when gross domestic product\nbegan to expand, unemployment began to fall and real disposable income began\nto increase. By 2015, the misery index — a combined measure of unemployment\nand inflation — was about as low as it had been since the 1950s, which means\nthere was an active demand for goods and services along with low unemployment\nand inflation.Most Americans seemed to appreciate this growth. Data on the\nIndex of Consumer Sentiment, one of the longest-running measures of Americans’\nviews of the economy, show that by the end of 2015, consumer sentiment was as\npositive as it had been in the mid-2000s and mid-1980s. It was nearly\nidentical to where it was at the end of 1983, when Mr. Reagan’s re-election\nromp — based almost entirely on the victory over stagflation — began to take\nshape.Even breaking the consumer sentiment data down by income levels does\nlittle to buoy the argument that Americans were pessimistic. From 2009-2015,\nthe average gap in economic satisfaction between the upper and lower thirds of\nthe income distribution was 13.7 points, much lower than it was during the\nReagan years (21.3) and lower than the gap during the administrations of\nGeorge H.W. Bush (14.7), Bill Clinton (16.7) and George W. Bush (18.4).As we\nentered 2016, Americans — of all income levels — felt positively about the\neconomy even though by some indicators many people had not recovered their\nlosses. The employment-population ratio and median household income, for\nexample, had only begun to recover in 2015.To get a sense of whether these\neconomic factors were affecting the general mood of the nation in a way not\ncaptured by consumer sentiment, I examined one of the longest-standing\nmeasures of general happiness. Since 1972, the General Social Survey has asked\npeople to “take things all together” and rate their level of happiness. The\n40-year trend shows only modest changes — and may actually suggest a small\nincrease in happiness in recent years.Describing Americans’ mood as\ndistinctively angry in 2015 elides this evidence. Americans were optimistic\nabout the nation’s economy and generally happy — in fact, no less optimistic\nor happy than they had been historically.But there was an increasing sense in\nthe fall and winter of 2015 that many Americans were filled with contempt.\nUsing analytic tools provided by Crimson Hexagon, I calculated the average\nmonthly increase in the share of news articles about the 2016 election that\ncontained the word “angry.” Between November 2015 and March 2016, the share of\nstories about angry voters increased by 200 percent. Where was the sense of\ngloom coming from?Some evidence suggests that the ire was derived directly\nfrom politics. When asked by various pollsters about trusting the government,\nthe direction of the country, American progress or the president, Americans\nwere gloomy — gloomier than their economic assessments might have predicted.\nWhen broken out by party, these pessimistic views reveal a growing partisan\ndivide, one that has been distilling around racial attitudes for nearly two\ndecades.The increasing alignment between party and racial attitudes goes back\nto the early 1990s. The Pew Values Survey asks people whether they agree that\n“we should make every effort to improve the position of minorities, even if it\nmeans giving them preferential treatment.”Over time, Americans’ party\nidentification has become more closely aligned with answers to this question\nand others like it. Pew reports that, “since 1987, the gap on this question\nbetween the two parties has doubled — from 18 points to 40 points.” Democrats\nare now much more supportive (52 percent) of efforts to improve racial\nequality than they were a few decades ago, while the views of Republicans have\nbeen largely unchanged (12 percent agree).That Democrats and Republicans have\ndifferent views on issues — even issues about race and rights — is not\nsurprising. But recent work by Stanford University’s Shanto Iyengar and his\nco-authors shows something else has been brewing in the electorate: a growing\nhostility toward members of the opposite party. This enmity, they argue,\npercolates into opinions about everyday life.Partisans, for example, are now\nmore concerned that their son or daughter might marry someone of the opposite\nparty (compared with Britain today and the United States in 1960). They also\nfound that partisans are surprisingly willing to discriminate against people\nwho are not members of their political party.We’ve entered an age of party-\nism.Writing in The Washington Post, Michael Tesler, a University of\nCalifornia, Irvine, political scientist, explained that because the growing\npartisan divide is partly fueled by racial attitudes, partisans (in Washington\nand in the electorate) also take increasingly opposite positions on many\nracially inflected controversies.Some are squarely political like police\nmisconduct. But others spill over into areas like sports, music and movies,\nwhich we often think of as more social than political. Disagreements between\npeople about nominations for the Academy Awards, for example, may now become\nemotional as well as political if they involve racial attitudes because of the\nsorting of these attitudes by party and the contempt people feel for the other\nside.Democrats and Republicans like each other a lot less now than they did 60\nyears ago in part because they have sorted into parties based on attitudes on\nrace, religion and ethnicity. These attitudes and emotions have been activated\nin the lead-up to the 2016 election, sometimes by terrorist violence and other\ntimes by candidate language itself. Add to this mix the fact that the country\nis becoming less white and that nonwhites are disproportionately more likely\nto be Democrats, and an explanation for the anger that filled the air in 2015\nemerges.\n\n","title":"American Anger: It’s Not the Economy.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013e7"},"content":"Picture a mood-lit Las Vegas casino, at first glance indistinguishable from\nany other pleasure palace on the Strip: salarymen hunch over $20 blackjack\ntables as waitresses with plunging necklines circle the floor.Instead of\nbourbon-and-sodas, however, these waitresses are carrying trays full of\nvaporizers and water pipes. The games themselves have names that sound more\nlike Cypress Hill songs: “Craps and Blunts,” “Roll and Roulette.”High rollers,\nindeed.A casino doubling as a smoker’s paradise may seem like a tired Cheech\n\u0026amp; Chong skit from the ’70s. But this vision is one of many ambitious\nconcepts being hatched at High Times, the scruffy monthly magazine that, for\n42 years, has served as the barely legal bible of dorm room stoners and closet\ncannabis growers.Just as Playboy transformed from a skin magazine to a\nbranding behemoth during the sexual revolution, a new management team at High\nTimes is looking to pare back its outlaw image to become a lifestyle brand.\nIts big plans to capitalize on the era of legalized marijuana include a\nrevamped website, apparel, furniture, nightclubs and eventually ganja-themed\ncruises, hotels and casinos.“High Times isn’t just for historically self-\nidentified stoners anymore,” said Larry Linietsky, a former executive at\nUniversal Music Group, whom High Times hired in January as its chief operating\nofficer. “We are appealing to everyone who likes cannabis, or is at least\ncurious about it, both recreationally and for medicinal use. That could be\nyour boss, your neighbor or even your grandmother.”High Times, to put it\nmildly, is no ordinary media property. This is, after all, a magazine where\nthe staff once smoked the founding editor (more on that later).Started in 1974\nby Tom Forcade, an underground journalist, drug smuggler and Yippie, the\nmagazine was originally conceived as a parody of Playboy, but with lurid\ncenterfolds of cannabis buds the size of bonsai trees instead of nude\nwomen.Most underground publications of that era did not last much longer than\nthe average Jerry Garcia solo. But Mr. Forcade, flush with cash from\ntrafficking (talk about “seed money”), was able to keep High Times afloat long\nenough to find an audience.It helped that Mr. Forcade, with his anarchist\nleanings, found a savvy partner who knew how to navigate the establishment:\nMichael J. Kennedy, a crusading New Left lawyer for the likes of Timothy Leary\nand Huey P. Newton (and later, uncharacteristically, Ivana Trump). Mr. Kennedy\nserved as High Times’s general counsel and chairman before he died of\npneumonia while being treated for cancer in January at 78.While High Times was\nall but invisible to martini-sipping straights, it had an avid cult\nreadership. It featured paeans to pot by William S. Burroughs and Hunter S.\nThompson, interviews with Mick Jagger and Bob Marley, reviews of the latest\nstrains, tips for cultivators and smuggler’s tales from far-flung jungles.\nAmong late-night doughnut scarfers, it was Vanity Fair, Consumer Reports and\nNational Geographic, all rolled (oh, the puns) into one.Even so, it was a\ncurious media property. While there have been plenty of magazines that are\noutlaw in spirit (like, say, Thrasher, for skateboarders), High Times was the\nrare glossy devoted to a pursuit that violated federal law. As recently as a\ndecade ago, High Times was sealed in plastic bags (as if it were Hustler) at\nBarnes \u0026amp; Noble. “High Times was pot pornography,” said its longtime\npublisher, Mary McEvoy.Indeed, High Times lore is filled with stories that\nsound like old “Miami Vice” episodes.In the 1970s, Mr. Forcade supposedly\nsteered a recreational vehicle carrying nine tons of marijuana and $1 million\nin cash into the muck of the Everglades to avoid law enforcement.When Mr.\nForcade committed suicide in 1978, the staff gathered atop the World Trade\nCenter (“so we could have the highest tribute possible,” one editor said),\nrolled his ashes into joints and smoked them.In 2012, Matt Stang, an\nadvertising executive, was charged with trafficking marijuana in a case\ninvolving the rap mogul Kareem Burke, a founder of Roc-A-Fella records. Mr.\nStang, now 36, who paid a fine and received probation but no prison time after\naccepting a plea bargain, was recently promoted to chief revenue officer.But\nin the current climate of legalized marijuana, those Wild West stories\nsuddenly seem as dated as prog rock. America, you might say, has caught up to\nHigh Times.Medical marijuana is now legal in 23 states, plus the District of\nColumbia, according to the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana\nLaws, known as Norml. Adult use, commercial cultivation and retail sale is\nlegal in four states, with several more, including California, likely to be\nvoting on similar laws in November.Along the way, pot has become big business.\nArcView Group, a cannabis research and investment firm, recently called legal\nmarijuana “the fastest growing industry in America,” having rocketed 74\npercent, to $2.7 billion, from 2013 to 2014.Attitudes seem to be changing just\nas quickly. In popular culture, potheads are no longer portrayed only as\nglazed-eyed dolts, but everyday professionals with children and mortgages.\nThis week, Whoopi Goldberg announced that she was starting a line of female-\nfocused cannabis products aimed at relieving menstrual pain.In that light, the\ntiming seems right for an underground publication once devoted to guerrilla-\nstyle cannabis advocacy to meet mainstream America head-on.“We played defense\nfor 40 years,” said Eleanora Kennedy, the widow of High Times’s former\nchairman, who maintains a significant interest in the company. “Now it’s time\nfor offense.”High Times subscribers who imagine the magazine being published\nout of a yurt in Humboldt County, Calif., may be surprised to see its actual\nnerve center.The Midtown Manhattan headquarters of its parent company, Trans-\nHigh Corporation (T.H.C., get it?) is a warren of gray cubicles in a faceless\noffice tower that could pass for a telemarketing firm.The company’s new\nleadership seems equally corporate.On a recent Monday, Mr. Linietsky was\nnestled into a white leather sofa along with the rest of the management team,\nwearing a white oxford shirt and brown blazer. A Wharton graduate, Cub Scout\nleader and former music industry executive who lives in Montclair, N.J., he\nmay seem like a rebuke to High Times’s rebel heritage, but is an embodiment of\nthe “canna-curious” consumer that the company is trying to court.“I’m 44, and\nI can tell you, there are a lot of people my age who are going to a party\nSaturday night, and they’re bringing chocolates, vape pens,” Mr. Linietsky\nsaid.What is clear to High Times executives is that there is money in the air,\nalong with the blue smoke.Take the High Times Cannabis Cups, weekend festivals\nwith music, seminars, a trade show and celebrity appearances by the likes of\nIce Cube and David Arquette. The festivals, which represented 80 percent of\nthe company’s revenues last year, have grown to eight events a year, from one,\nand to more than 500 vendors, from 50. One event in Denver last year drew more\nthan 50,000, who paid $50 to $420 (of course) for tickets.The magazine itself\nis doing well. Despite a wobbly climate for print, advertising revenues have\ngrown by double digits in recent years, management said, thanks to cannabis-\ncentric brands like Kandypens vaporizers and Green House Seed Co. Issues have\nfattened to 160 pages, from about 130.The editorial team recently brought in\nWill Dana, a former Rolling Stone editor, as a consultant to bolster its\ncoverage of the booming industry.“Twenty years ago, the magazine was relegated\nto covering small, secret grow rooms,” said Malcolm MacKinnon, the magazine’s\neditor in chief, who works under the pen name Dan Skye. “Nowadays, we see\nmassive indoor and outdoor gardens, and people are begging us for coverage. We\nget multiple queries per day from companies seeking profiles in our pages.”Its\nwebsite has also seen a traffic surge; on a good month, it attracts more than\nfour million unique visitors. The problem is that the site is blocked by many\nInternet filters, even on Amtrak. To rectify that, the magazine will soon\nunveil a safe-for-work spinoff that will swap out the bud porn for pot-themed\nlifestyle articles, including recipes.Last month, High Times announced a\npartnership with Mashable to produce and share content on the politics and\nbusiness of pot .The next step in brand-extension is merchandising, moving\nbeyond a few knit hats and T-shirts, to a wide array of clothing, accessories\nand even furniture. Flash a pair of High Times socks at the suburban cocktail\nmixer, and “it’s a little wink,” Mr. Linietsky said. “Now you’re in the\nclub.”Even so, a new line of High Times hosiery does not a revolution make.Far\nbolder and riskier is its planned move into night life. While deals have not\nbeen completed, the company is deep in talks with partners to open a series of\nhigh-end cannabis-consumption lounges in Colorado, where adult use of\nmarijuana is legal, and in Las Vegas, where medical marijuana is legal under\nNevada state law.In Las Vegas, the company’s partners have also secured a\ncabaret license and a gambling license as well as approval for an off-site\ndispensary at an undisclosed location 150 feet off the Strip, said Mr. Stang,\nthe chief revenue officer. While the red tape is endless, this cannabis\ngambling lounge would provide a springboard for a potential High Times hotel\nand casino, following the model of the Hard Rock Cafe.“We’ve seen brands\ntransition from an outlaw brand to a mainstream brand — Harley Davidson comes\nto mind,” said Andrew Davis, a brand consultant in Boston who has worked with\nbrands like the Jim Henson Company and Rodale, which straddle the media and\nconsumer sectors.But, he added, “a brand like High Times comes with a whole\nhost of connotations that are sure to create challenges with zoning boards,\nCity Councils, neighboring residents and local politicians.” To some civic\nleaders, High Times is “a magazine to be read in the shadows, like Hustler or\nPenthouse.”Indeed, High Times had to withdraw its bid to hold a Cannabis Cup\nin Portland, Ore., last year, even after the state legalized marijuana for\nadult use, because the state liquor commission would not allow cannabis\nconsumption in any place that served alcohol.In addition, High Times 2.0 has\ngotten off to a rocky start. Two months after Mr. Kennedy died, David Kohl, a\nveteran media executive who was hired as chief executive in September,\nabruptly departed in a staff shake-up. (Neither High Times nor Mr. Kohl would\ncomment on the move.)Regardless, the upside is considerable.“These are\nuncharted waters, but we’re talking about an industry that is going to be a\nmultibillion-dollar industry,” said Dean Crutchfield, a New York consultant\nwho advises corporations on brand-building strategy. “Who’s going to lead the\ncategory?”Mr. Stang offered an answer to that question: High Times. “It’s the\nonly real brand in cannabis,” he said.\n\n","title":"High Times Wants to Be the Playboy of Pot - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"High Times, the barely legal bible of dorm room stoners, now wants to be the Playboy of pot https://t.co/4UfrxZXkwB https://t.co/a5RL7tYXnn","date":"Sat Apr 02 15:02:06 +0000 2016","favs":214,"id":{"$numberLong":"716279546232905728"},"retweets":101},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21Z6hsS"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013e8"},"content":"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — A top Saudi prince has announced new elements of a plan\nto reduce the kingdom’s heavy dependence on oil, amid a drop in world prices\nthat has sent shock waves through the Saudi economy.The plans include publicly\nselling shares of the state oil giant, Saudi Aramco, and routing much of its\nworth into a public investment fund, said the prince, Mohammed bin Salman, in\nan interview with Bloomberg published Friday.The fund could become the world’s\nlargest, he said, with more than $2 trillion in assets.“Undoubtedly, it will\nbe the largest fund on earth,” said Prince Mohammed, who is second in line to\nthe Saudi throne and has emerged as the country’s most powerful and dynamic\nofficial. “This will happen as soon as Aramco goes public.”Although less than\n5 percent of Saudi Aramco would be sold, the prince said the national oil\ncompany would be transferred to a government fund, now relatively small,\ncalled the Public Investment Fund, giving it instant heft and potential\nfinancial firepower.Saudi Aramco is the world’s leading oil producing company.\nIt has about 10 million barrels per day of output, or about 10 percent of\nglobal production, and reserves of about 160 billion barrels. The company also\nhas large refining and petrochemical interests inside Saudi Arabia and\ninternationally, including in the United States.At present, Norway’s fund,\ncalled the Government Pension Fund Global, is believed to be the world’s\nlargest so-called sovereign wealth fund. It has about $850 billion in\ninvestments.The announcements came as Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil\nexporter, struggles to reformat its economy.A decade-long boom left the\nkingdom’s economy heavily dependent on oil, which provides most of the\ngovernment’s income, and made the state far and away the country’s biggest\nemployer. The drop in oil prices — to about $39 a barrel from more than $100 a\nbarrel in June 2014 — undermined that model, leading to huge budget deficits\nand vast cuts in public spending.Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at Roubini Global\nEconomics in New York, estimates that Saudi Arabia is burning up its financial\nreserves at the rate of $10 billion to $15 billion per month. She estimates\nthat the kingdom has about $600 billion left.There are longer-term worries as\nwell. A recent study by the consultants McKinsey warned that with more than\nhalf of Saudi Arabia’s population under 25, a surge of young people was likely\nto enter the work force in the coming years. This will require the creation of\nalmost three times as many jobs for Saudis as the kingdom created during the\n2003-13 oil boom.Prince Mohammed, a son of the monarch, King Salman, is\nleading the effort to find solutions as the head of council that oversees\neconomic policy. Although only about 30 years old and relatively unknown\nbefore his father became king last year, he is also the country’s defense\nminister, at a time of great regional instability and with Saudi forces at war\nin neighboring Yemen.The prince’s intention, analysts say, appears to be to\ncreate a vehicle that would make direct investments in companies outside of\nSaudi Arabia as well as inside. The idea would be to use these holdings to\ngenerate income at a time when oil prices are low and to develop business\nrelationships that would lead to investments in Saudi Arabia.In initiating the\nchanges, Saudi Arabia trails behind some other countries. The Public\nInvestment Fund, for instance, has about $5 billion in assets, according to\nthe Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, a research organization.The full plan to\nrestructure the Saudi economy has yet to be released, but the announcements\ntouched on central aspects of it.Shares of the parent company of Saudi Aramco,\nwidely believed to be the world’s most valuable company, as well as shares of\nits subsidiaries, could be sold to the public on the Saudi stock exchange as\nearly as next year, Prince Mohammed said. But the shares would be for “less\nthan 5 percent” of the company, he said.Assets raised from the stock sales\nwould be routed into the Public Investment Fund, which could grow to hold more\nthan $2 trillion, the prince said. The fund currently has $5 billion in assets\nand includes shares in a large Saudi chemical manufacturer and the kingdom’s\nlargest lender.The fund is considering foreign opportunities and will seek a\nvariety of investments to move the kingdom away from its dependence on oil.\n“So within 20 years, we will be an economy or state that doesn’t depend mainly\non oil,” the prince said.Western diplomats and analysts say it is hard to\ngauge the Saudi plans because much about the kingdom’s economy remains opaque\nand the deadlines for implementation remain unclear.“The strategy makes\nsense,” Ms. Ziemba said, “but it is not a silver bullet.”She said it would\nhave been easier to try such reforms when oil prices were higher and Saudi\nArabia’s assets were worth far more than they are now.Some have questioned how\nmany private investors will want to put their money in a company like Saudi\nAramco that releases very little financial information and is seen by many as\nthe piggy bank of the Saudi royal family.Jean-Francois Seznec, a senior fellow\nin the Global Energy Institute at the Atlantic Council, said an initial public\noffering of less than 5 percent made sense because the amount of cash involved\nin a larger offering could flood the market.The bigger challenge, he said,\nwill be bringing transparency to a company that has long avoided it. “All of a\nsudden, everyone could see how much money is being taken off the top by the\nroyal family, and everyone wants to avoid that,” he said.Still, the prince\nreceives some credit at home for trying. “A lot of young people at home are\nfeeling excited that there is a clear direction and leadership,” said Sadad\nHusseini, a former executive vice president of Saudi Aramco. “It makes you\nwonder why no one else did it before.”\n\n","title":"Saudis Moving to Reduce Dependence on Oil Money - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesworld: Saudi prince's plan would create $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, \"largest fund on Earth\" https://t.co/Wv6ErrwYun https…","date":"Sat Apr 02 14:51:14 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716276811164946432"},"retweets":227},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21XZUWM"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013e9"},"content":"The skies opened up as I watched the tow truck winch my teal Alfa Romeo onto\nthe flatbed. The 30-year-old convertible again refused to run, and as I dried\nthe rain off my arms, I thought it was probably time to get rid of it.My\nhusband loved this Spider, which our kids named the happy car. But before he\nsuccumbed to melanoma at 48, he specifically instructed us not to make the car\na shrine. I held onto it anyway. I rarely drive it. I had intended to use it\nto teach our kids to drive a stick shift, but that never happened. I couldn’t\nbear them grinding those gears.The downpour ended the moment the tow truck\nleft. Steam rose from the driveway and refracted the sudden sunshine. It was a\nsign, I told myself. Time to let go. I tried to ignore the immediate heaviness\nagainst my breastbone.The Alfa had to be towed 25 miles to a specialist’s\nshop. Years earlier, I upgraded my AAA membership to cover this recurring\nexpense. I called the shop to describe the car’s current symptoms. The\nmechanic, who knows both the car and me, said: “You can’t just let it sit. A\ncar like that, you need to either drive it or sell it.”You’d think I’d be an\nexpert in letting go by now.I let go of the notion that my family could be\nhappy only if it included my husband, with whom I had shared every thought and\nfeeling and plan for 20 years. I let go of a different happy-family\nconfiguration when our daughter, then our son, left for college. Though I\ndreaded the moment when both children would leave, I also saw how ready they\nwere. For them, letting go of one thing meant making room to grab hold of an\nentire universe. And even apart, we remain close. We didn’t just survive but\nfound ways to thrive.I let go of many other preconceived notions about how my\nlife would play out when I forced myself to start dating again, a few years\nafter my husband’s death. When I sat through meals with strangers whose tales\nof misery in love snuffed my appetite.Each week in yoga, I obediently let my\nlimbs go heavy when the teacher says, “Begin to practice the art of letting\ngo.”Why, then, is it so difficult for me to let go of this car?Part of the\nanswer came a few weeks later, when, on a cloudless September afternoon, I\nretrieved the Alfa from the shop. I was appalled at the bill and began\ncomposing for-sale ads in my head. But as I drove, the breeze warmed my\ncheeks. The swamp sunflowers popped in yellow clusters that I’d failed to\nnotice from the confines of my sensible sedan. There was still a hint of\nhoneysuckle in the air.I downshifted, and the car hugged the cloverleaf coming\noff the highway. The motor hummed; the seat embraced me. Both hands, both\nfeet, my entire body: all engaged. No fiddling with cellphone or radio. Just\nme and the car and the road.I was transported to the fall day in Vermont when\nmy husband taught me to clutch and shift in a different convertible on another\nserpentine road. I was studying for medical school exams. We had no money, but\nwe splurged on a bed-and-breakfast. That was how he was: Hardship didn’t stop\nhim from plunging into things he loved.In the early days, an unreliable car\nwas our only means of transportation. We eventually added a safer car, but how\nour daughter beamed when her dad drove her to school in the Spider! How the\nsecond-grade boys mobbed the convertible in the pickup lane! No airbags, no\nroll bar, metal bumpers, an open top — a bad idea to send a child off like\nthat.I was the kind of mom who put helmets on our kids when they learned to\nice-skate. But my daughter wrote a poem about the light filtering through the\ntrees as she and her dad flew through those moments in time. My daughter and\nson have grown into people who immerse themselves in the world via all their\nsenses.The Alfa is impractical, costly and inconvenient. My hair becomes a\nbird’s nest when I drive with the top down. When it rains, the fabric roof\npings cold drops onto my head. It has left me stranded more than once.And I\nlove it.I was raised to set aside my aspirations to be a writer because the\nwinding path of a creative career seemed lined with risk and destitution, and\nmy immigrant family had had enough of that. Better to cut loose the\nimpractical and hold tight to tangible certainties, my parents advised.My\nhusband, raised in similar circumstances, with similar expectations, somehow\nflouted conventional notions of what was worth holding onto or jettisoning. He\nbecame a scientist instead of a doctor and found not only creative fulfillment\nbut financial success in that less predictable career path. His grad school\nstudent loans partly subsidized flying lessons, and he later flew me to\nOcracoke, N.C., in a twin-engine Cherokee Warrior, landing on the grass strip\nbeside the shimmering beach, extinguishing the fear of flying I’d developed\naboard much safer commercial jets.He took safety seriously. We delayed flying\nback if the weather turned. He didn’t take foolish risks. But he inspired\nreasonable risks.He encouraged me to keep writing and working part time as a\nphysician, even if it meant it would take us longer to repay student debt. He\nadvised students to ask meaningful questions, not just those considered most\nlikely to get funded. He left letters for our kids urging them to refrain from\nbitterness or fear because of his fate. Remain open to the vast beauty around\nyou, he told them. Engage. And when your mom meets someone new, as I hope she\nwill, try to be open to him.I did meet someone new a few years ago and had to\nlet go in a host of unexpected ways. My partner has four children, two younger\nthan mine, and two former wives. His children have lost not a parent but\nsomething potentially more destabilizing: their faith in the possibility of\ndeep love.The oldest is cynical about the odds of any relationship lasting.\nHis 9-year-old half brother keeps his parents’ wedding photo on his desk and\nrefers to his mother’s live-in partner as his aunt, even though the\nrelationship has been explained to him. Some children carry into adulthood the\nfervent wish that their divorced parents will somehow reunite, poisoning their\nability to find joy in the actual relationships that surround them.My partner\nrecognizes the difficulties. Early in our relationship, he questioned why I\nwould take on the baggage of his past life, baggage he has often wished he\ncould jettison. Not the children, of course, but the painful dynamics of the\nadults around them.My husband used to say, “If it was easy, it would be\ndone.”Driving my Alfa Romeo reminds me that difficulty, per se, has never\nstopped me from pursuing something I think has true worth. Driving, I’m\nreminded that I, too, can shift gears, face risk, handle inconvenience — and\nsurvive tragedy. I re-experience the joy in all my senses: touch, smell,\ntaste, hearing and not exclusively vision, as dictated by our increasingly\nvirtual world.I am forced to disengage: I can’t return calls, eat lunch and\ndrive to the office all at once. Without anti-lock brakes, I scan the road\nahead more mindfully. The car may look zippy, but any soccer mom in a sealed,\nair-conditioned six-cylinder Land Rover can easily overtake me.It’s not the\nspeed but the journey, I tell myself. I continue to write, even if my day job\nmeans it takes me half a decade to finish a book. And my partner and I press\nonward, doing our work individually and together to address the losses we’ve\nhad, to build something together that is strong enough to withstand both\nnostalgia and anger.As I consult various people on whether to sell the car, it\nbecomes a litmus test. My in-laws say simplify: “You have so much to manage!”\nMy kids are sad but accepting: They’re moving around the country now with\ncollege, internships and jobs, and although they love the car, they are a\nlittle afraid to sit in the driver’s seat. To be reminded of too much, and\nperhaps, to be compared.My partner, eyes misting, says: “You love that car.\nAnd your husband was an extraordinary man.”He says, “I feel so lucky that\nwe’re together, and so sad that you two couldn’t be.”He says: “Keep fixing it.\nI’ll drive it with you anytime.”Maybe the trick is knowing when to let go, and\nwhen to hang on.\n\n","title":"On a Serpentine Road, With the Top Down - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Modern Love: \"Maybe the trick is knowing when to let go, and when to hang on\" https://t.co/3Z0IRmiqJg","date":"Sat Apr 02 13:21:02 +0000 2016","favs":231,"id":{"$numberLong":"716254111935627264"},"retweets":137},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PM7IE4"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013ea"},"content":"Sometimes Anderson Cooper imagines himself as the Thomas Cromwell to his\nmother’s Henry VIII, the voice of reason — the tether — to her buoyant\nimpulsiveness. And sometimes he pictures Gloria Vanderbilt, who has been in\nthe public eye since her birth 92 years ago, as an emissary from a distant\nstar, marooned on this planet and trying to make sense of it all.“I always\nviewed my role as helping her navigate this time and place,” Mr. Cooper said\nrecently. But in the documentary of her life, “Nothing Left Unsaid,” airing on\nHBO on April 9, with Mr. Cooper as his mother’s interlocutor, and in the\nepistolary memoir the two have made together, “The Rainbow Comes and Goes: A\nMother and Son on Life, Love, and Loss,” out Tuesday from Harper, what instead\nunfurls is the ways in which this family of two has survived unthinkable\nlosses. There was the death of his father when Mr. Cooper was just 10, and the\nsuicide of his brother, Carter, at 23, a decade later, as Ms. Vanderbilt\nwatched her son’s hands slip from the terrace of their apartment on Gracie\nSquare.In that same decade, Ms. Vanderbilt would make a fortune to rival that\nof her forebear, Cornelius Vanderbilt, from bluejeans emblazoned with her\nname, and then lose it all when her psychiatrist and lawyer colluded to\ndefraud her of her many lucrative licenses. (It was Bill Blass who came to the\nrescue, writing her a check for a quarter of a million dollars.) And yet, Mr.\nCooper said, “She has this enduring optimism and this sense that the next\ngreat love or the next great adventure is just around the corner, and she’s\nabout to embark on it.”The other day, Ms. Vanderbilt brandished her familiar\nu-shaped grin and her Old World accent, padding about her jewel-box Beekman\nPlace apartment in bare feet. (Later, she would slip on a pair of gold\nsneakers to give a tour of her artist’s studio one floor below.) “The phone\ncan ring, and your life can change in a blink,” she said, emphasizing that\nlast word and concurring with her son’s assessment of her nature.“I also\nbelieve you sort of attract what you want, what you’re looking for, and I\nthink that one must always be in love. To be in love with a person is of\ncourse ideal, but you can be in love with a flower, a tree, an idea. Just\nwaking up in the morning, you know. It’s an attitude, an attitude of romantic\nreadiness,” she concluded firmly, quoting F. Scott Fitzgerald. “We have to\nhave that.”Ms. Vanderbilt, whose father died when she was 15 months old, has\nbeen making headlines since her birth. In 1934, the tabloids called her “The\nPoor Little Rich Girl.” That was the year of the bitter custody battle between\nher aunt, Gertrude Whitney, and her beautiful, too young, hapless mother,\nGloria Morgan Vanderbilt, who loved parties and the allowance that accrued to\nher from her daughter’s trust fund. She made headlines, too, for her storied\nromances — to Howard Hughes and Frank Sinatra, among many others — and her\nfour marriages, the first, when she was just 17, to an abusive Hollywood agent\nrumored to have murdered his first wife.Ms. Vanderbilt largely raised herself,\na kind of emotional orphan careening from marriage to marriage before finding\nhappiness with Wyatt Cooper, Mr. Cooper’s father, a screenwriter and actor\nfrom Mississippi.“Wait a minute,” Mr. Cooper writes in “The Rainbow Comes and\nGoes” of his mother’s first marriage. “You started dating a guy who was a\ngambler and rumored to have killed someone? That’s not usually the kind of\ninformation put in their Tinder bio to attract dates. Didn’t you think that\nwas somebody you should probably stay away from?”Recalling that exchange, Ms.\nVanderbilt said: “Of course, you always think you can fix things. You always\nthink you’re the one who can.”Ms. Vanderbilt has been hashing out her story in\nall mediums for most of her life. In her glittering collages, faux naïf\npaintings and her signature “dream boxes,” there are fatherless figures,\ndistant mothers and recurring images of Ms. Vanderbilt’s beloved nanny, Dodo,\nwho gave her the love and constancy she craved. In many of her eight books, a\nbody of work that includes four memoirs, a book of poetry and an erotic novel,\npublished when she was 85 (and which Mr. Cooper, stretching the limits of\nfilial devotion, read in galleys), she continued that interrogation.Of the\nerotic novel, “Obsession,” she said: “That was so much fun. It was almost as\nif somebody else wrote it and it just sort of fell on the page. When I\nrecorded the audiobook, though, I thought: ‘What have I done? Poor\nAnderson!’”Clearly, Mr. Cooper’s inheritance from his mother isn’t tragedy and\nit isn’t money, as he and his brother were taught at a young age there was no\npot of gold for them — though he and she share the same steely work ethic —\nit’s resilience, made springier by a sense of humor.Both the documentary,\ndirected by Liz Garbus, and the memoir, which is a series of emails between\nmother and son, have Mr. Cooper investigating the emotional landscape of his\nmother’s life, and in so doing examining his own.They were a year into the\ndocumentary when Ms. Vanderbilt fell ill with a serious respiratory infection.\nShe didn’t tell her son just how serious it was, and he left town on an\nassignment, never learning until his return that she’d been hospitalized. He\nwas deeply rattled, and rued his reflexive impulse to put his work first and\nview any intrusion as an inconvenience.On her 91st birthday, they began “a new\nkind of conversation,” as he writes, by email, which Ms. Vanderbilt takes up\nwith characteristic enthusiasm. It is a remarkably frank and tender\nundertaking. In one exchange, Ms. Vanderbilt recalled her son coming out to\nher when he was 21, and being stricken with guilt about a derogatory comment\nshe’d once made, that she would feel she had failed as a parent if her child\nwas gay. As it happened, Mr. Cooper had no memory of the incident; instead, he\nrecalled only the positive way she’d described a gay couple when he was\ngrowing up. “I rejoice that you’re gay,” she writes her son.“She rejoices in\neverything I do,” Mr. Cooper said. “I was talking to Andy Cohen” — the TV and\nradio host — “and his mother is a tougher critic. She’ll say to him, ‘Hmm, not\nyour best show.’ But my mom is very much a cheering section. I can do no\nwrong. It’s always been that way. If I told her I wanted to dye my hair blue,\nshe’d be happy. You couldn’t rebel against her. There is nothing you could do\nthat a) she hadn’t already done, and b) she wouldn’t be fine with.”Both Mr.\nCooper and Ms. Vanderbilt impose order on their lives through their work. Ms.\nVanderbilt’s environments have long been as much a canvas as her actual\npaintings. “It was interesting to hear her talk about it,” Mr. Cooper said.\n“To hear her cop to it. If only you can change the color of the walls,\neverything will be O.K. But once that’s done, it feels O.K. for a day or a\nweek, and then she realizes the carpet needs to be redone or she has to\nmove.”Decorating is autobiography, Ms. Vanderbilt likes to say. “Of course,\neverything is autobiography,” she added. Throughout the decades, Ms.\nVanderbilt’s fantastical interiors — rooms layered from floor to ceiling in\ngingham or antique quilts — settings as intricate as her artwork, have showed\nup in Vogue, House \u0026amp; Garden, W, Life and Vanity Fair.The Beekman Place\napartment is like something out of “The Arabian Nights.” Its walls are painted\nin shades of pink, trimmed with glossy black. There are Russian icons, swoops\nof fabric, Ms. Vanderbilt’s idiosyncratic and lovely artwork and many\nportraits of Ms. Vanderbilt and her family.You can count the Ninas in cartoons\nof Ms. Vanderbilt by Al Hirschfeld. There’s a full-length Sargent-style\npainting of Ms. Vanderbilt by Aaron Shikler, and another of her mother painted\nthe year before Ms. Vanderbilt’s birth, looking pensive and sad. There are\nphotographs of Carter and Anderson by Diane Arbus. “I’ve been told by critics\nthat my photograph resembles a Roman death mask,” Mr. Cooper said of his baby\nphoto. It does.The innards of an antique desk are painted in red and white\nstripes, a backdrop for a dancing antique figure and a glittery peacock. In\nher bedroom, an enormous quartz crystal sits like a baby meteor in the\nfireplace, the mantel of which Ms. Vanderbilt has painted with stars and\nemblems and mottos, like one paraphrasing Albert Einstein: “The distance\nbetween past, present and future is only an illusion, however\npersistent.”“It’s one of the great wonderlands,” Wendy Goodman, design editor\nof New York magazine, said of the apartment. Ms. Goodman collected many of Ms.\nVanderbilt’s interiors in her 2010 book, “The World of Gloria Vanderbilt.”\n“It’s a constant laboratory for her. She’s always repainting and redecorating.\nIt’s like a tonic for her.”Ms. Vanderbilt’s enthusiasms can sometimes run\namok, said her son, recalling dinner parties that grew from a few guests to\nmore than 30, and shifting from her apartment to his at the last minute.\n“Things can snowball,” he said. “Or she won’t show up.” There was the year he\nand a partner were spending Thanksgiving on Long Island, and his mother\npromised to come and bring the bird. On the day, her car arrived without her,\nthough she had a sent the turkey. “It was precooked,” Mr. Cooper said, “which\nI appreciated.”Mr. Cooper’s own nature is signified by a profound wariness and\na strong belief that disaster is always around the corner. He sees himself not\njust as a realist, but as a catastrophist. “I always wanted there to be a\nplan,” he said. “And with my mother, there wasn’t one. It’s why I needed to\nget a job as soon as possible.” (Mr. Cooper has been working since his\nfather’s death, when he became a child model, not because he yearned to be in\nfront of a camera, but because modeling was a profession that offered a\nsubstantial paycheck to underage laborers.)Mr. Cooper described a trip to\nStudio 54 when Ms. Vanderbilt was again dating Sidney Lumet (who had also been\n— stay with me here — husband No. 3) after Mr. Cooper’s father’s death. The\nevent was a premiere for Mr. Lumet’s movie “The Wiz,” and Mr. Cooper, who was\n10 at the time, recalled riding in a limousine with Michael Jackson. “I\nremember people chasing the car, which I thought was kind of funny,” he said.\n“I remember watching him dance, and I actually remember turning to someone —\nthis is going to sound insane — and saying: ‘He’s really good at this. He\nshould pursue it.’ I was always concerned about people’s financial viability\nand career choices. I would always ask people how they could support\nthemselves.”Mother and son concluded their emails to each other just before\nMs. Vanderbilt’s 92nd birthday in February. Mr. Cooper asks how she’s feeling\nabout death, while noting that her funeral plans have always been very\ndetailed. Ms. Vanderbilt does share a few of her instructions: If in a church,\nhow about St. James’? If an open coffin, she’d like to be dressed in a Fortuny\ngown; Mr. Cooper can pick the color, and they are in the cedar closet in her\napartment. Do not have the funeral cosmeticians do her face. Please ask Judy\nCollins to sing “Amazing Grace.”And as is her way, she cheers for her son,\nexhorting him to put aside his pessimism. “Excelsior!” she writes. For her\npart, Ms. Vanderbilt is sanguine about her own mortality. She quotes Woody\nAllen, who was once asked whether he’d like to live on in the hearts of people\nafter his death and replied, “I would prefer to live on in my apartment.”\n\n","title":"Gloria Vanderbilt’s Story (Reprised) - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"At Home With Gloria Vanderbilt: Gloria Vanderbilt’s Story (Reprised) https://t.co/9MV32qsQBD","date":"Sat Apr 02 12:35:57 +0000 2016","favs":147,"id":{"$numberLong":"716242768838991872"},"retweets":62},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SurVAd"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013eb"},"content":"**Actually:** Neglecting baby teeth can set a child up for lifelong dental trouble.Nearly a quarter of all children between the ages of 2 and 5 have cavities, a study at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found. What’s the big deal? some parents ask. Those teeth are going to fall out anyway.It may be tempting to skip brushing if a toddler puts up a fuss, or allow a picky eater to snack nonstop on their favorite carbohydrates — a recipe for cavities. But once the damage is done, it’s not as easy as pulling them out and waiting for the permanent lineup.Preschoolers who have cavities in their baby teeth are three times as likely as other preschool children to develop cavities in their permanent teeth, according to an often-quoted study published in the Journal of Dental Research in 2002. A 5-year-old’s oral health can even predict greater decay and disease at 26, especially for poor children, another study found.This may be caused partly by not brushing with flouride twice daily and sipping sugary drinks over long periods. But it’s also because the bacteria that causes cavities, called caries, signify an infectious disease. So even if one decayed, brown-mottled tooth falls out, an infection may continue ravaging that child’s mouth.Another reason for restoring a decayed baby tooth is that, left untreated, it can become abscessed, at which point it lead to an emergency situation. At least 67 people in the United States died after being hospitalized with oral infections between 2000 to 2008.However, just pulling a decayed tooth can cause problems, because primary teeth are place holders for adult ones. In the absence of a place holder, adjacent teeth may drift into the space, blocking the growth of the permanent tooth.Beyond brushing twice a day with fluoride toothpaste, one way to reduce the risk of cavities may be to limit snacks and juice boxes to a 15-minute period so a child’s teeth are not constantly taking an acidic bath. Another is to make sure an adult does the brushing until a child has the dexterity to do it well, which some dentists say is roughly when they can tie their own shoes.\n\n","title":"Baby Teeth Deserve Care While They’re There - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Neglecting baby teeth can set a child up for lifelong dental trouble https://t.co/iIfpAbaxtw https://t.co/1L7Mq7dXpb","date":"Sat Apr 02 12:21:04 +0000 2016","favs":416,"id":{"$numberLong":"716239020880236544"},"retweets":347},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PM7Jb7"}

He was\npreliminarily charged with participation in the activities of a terrorist\ngroup. A judge ordered that he be detained.Officials also announced that the\nairport will reopen Sunday with limited service.Arnaud Feist, the chief\nexecutive of Brussels Airport, said Saturday that the country had been through\n“the darkest days in the history of aviation in Belgium” and that the\nairport’s reopening was a “sign of hope.”“As of tomorrow, Sunday, Brussels\nAirport should be partially operational,” Mr. Feist said at a news conference\nin a hotel near the airport, which is several miles northwest of Brussels. The\nairport had been closed since the attacks, in which two suicide bombers\ndetonated explosives in the departures hall.A police spokesman, Michaël\nJonniaux, said there would be new security measures at the airport, including\nspot checks of vehicles and checks of people and baggage entering the airport\nterminal — which will be open only to those with travel documents and\nidentification. The airport police had previously complained about a lack of\nsecurity, delaying the reopening. Mr. Feist said that there will be three\nflights on Sunday — to Faro, Portugal; Turin, Italy; and Athens — and that\npassengers would be processed in temporary constructions. He added that for\nthe time being, the airport would be accessible only by taxi or car. Y.A. is\nthe third person in Belgium to be charged as an accomplice of Reda Kriket, 34,\na Frenchman who was arrested outside Paris on March 24.French officials say\nMr. Kriket had amassed an arsenal of weapons and bomb-making equipment —\nincluding the type of explosive material that was used by suicide bombers who\nattacked Paris on Nov. 13 and Brussels on March 22. He was charged on numerous\ncounts, including terrorist conspiracy and possession of weapons.Mr. Kriket’s\narrest prevented an “imminent” attack on France, according to the country’s\ninterior minister and the public prosecutor in Paris.Two other people have\nbeen arrested and charged in Belgium with helping Mr. Kriket: Abderahmane\nAmeroud, 38, and a man identified only as Rabah M., 34, both Algerian\ncitizens. They were arrested in Brussels on March 25. Another man accused of\nbeing an accomplice, Anis Bahri, a 32-year-old French citizen, was arrested by\nthe Dutch police in the port city of Rotterdam last Sunday at the request of\nthe French authorities.Mr. Kriket was convicted in absentia in July alongside\nAbdelhamid Abaaoud, the man believed to be the on-the-ground organizer of the\nParis attacks, in the same Belgian court case involving a jihadist recruitment\nnetwork.But the plot Mr. Kriket was allegedly involved in was not connected to\nthe attacks in Brussels or in Paris, according to French officials.\n\n","title":"Third Man Is Charged in Belgium Over Foiled Plot in France - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Third Man Is Charged in Belgium Over Foiled Plot in France https://t.co/hPULaKGw0I","date":"Sat Apr 02 12:13:25 +0000 2016","favs":105,"id":{"$numberLong":"716237097326231556"},"retweets":79},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22YcGKE"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013ed"},"content":"Rob Austin and his wife, Natalia, have a 10-month-old son, healthy incomes and\nplenty of cash in the bank for a down payment on a house. But they are happily\nrenting a townhouse in Pasadena, Calif., with no plans to buy for now, given\nthe frothy prices in their area.“As long as there is such a disconnect, where\na couple like my wife and me have to put down a gargantuan down payment and\nstill have a large monthly payment to get into a decent, and not necessarily\nnice, house, that is a game we don’t wish to play,” said Mr. Austin, a 39\n-year-old business manager at a biotechnology company. “When home price-to-\nincome levels come back to a more normal level, when that happens, then we\nwill be the first to jump in. If that never happens, that is O.K.”More\nAmerican households are renting, across all income levels and generations, for\ndifferent reasons. But when homeownership is the centerpiece of the American\ndream, most of us have internalized certain ideals: Buying a home builds\nequity, putting you on the fast track to building wealth. Renting, by\ncontrast, is essentially throwing money to the wind.But with renters now\naccounting for 37 percent of all households, the highest level since the mid-\n1960s, according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard\nUniversity, more people may be renting for longer. Does that mean people who\nrent for extended periods, perhaps decades — even a lifetime — are forever at\na disadvantage?“Arguing about whether rent versus buy is a better financial\ndecision is like debating active versus passive investment strategies, hedge\nfunds versus mutual funds, Apple versus Google,” said Milo M. Benningfield, a\nfinancial planner in San Francisco. “Somebody’s going to be right in terms of\nhigher returns in the future, but we can’t know in advance who that will be —\nand it will be tough to quantify how much risk was taken along the way.”The\narguments in favor of ownership are persuasive, particularly for people who\nexpect to stay in place for at least five to seven years but probably more. A\nmortgage acts like a forced savings plan, even if you’re paying the bank\nhundreds of thousands of dollars in interest for the privilege of building\nequity. Call it the cost of enforcing a positive behavior.Buying also\ngenerally protects consumers from rising rents, while traditional mortgage\npayments remain constant. Then, there is the fact that buyers are using\nborrowed money to purchase an asset that is likely to appreciate over a long\nperiod, though that can backfire as well (see housing market plunge, millions\nof underwater borrowers, circa 2008). Being able to call a place your own has\na real, albeit intangible, value too.How well any household will fare\nfinancially by buying or renting really depends on factors no one can predict.\nOther studies have found that renters who invest their down payment and any\nsavings from renting as opposed to owning often come out ahead.Either way,\nmost financial professionals would caution against viewing a home purchase as\nan investment, particularly after factoring in the cost of maintenance, taxes,\ninsurance and the high costs of buying and selling, though it’s difficult not\nto.It may be hard for people living in bubbly markets to believe, but, over\nall, home prices in the United States have risen just 0.37 percent annualized,\nafter inflation, for the last 126 years, according to calculations by Robert\nJ. Shiller, an economist who received the Nobel in economic science in 2013\nand wrote the book on speculative bubbles, “Irrational\nExuberance.”“Disregarding the special amenities that many people value in\nhomeownership,” Professor Shiller said, “it would be hugely better invested in\nthe stock market.”And many people do accumulate substantial equity in their\nhomes, which often becomes a cushy safety net in retirement. A study by the\nHarvard Joint Center found that, even after the housing crash, the median\nhousehold who bought a home after 1999 still accrued significant amounts of\nwealth through 2013 (though whites gained more than African-Americans and\nHispanics).Christopher E. Herbert, managing director of Harvard’s Joint\nCenter, said he believed the results could be tied, in large part, to\nbehavioral incentives. “The motivated savings up front and the forced savings\nover time,” he said of accumulating a down payment and making mortgage\npayments.There may also be something about many people who buy. As Mr.\nBenningfield pointed out, they may have other attributes that may contribute\nto their economic success.Renting can still be financially advantageous under\ncertain circumstances. Consider the work in 2012 by the academics Eli Beracha\nof Florida International University and Ken Johnson of Florida Atlantic\nUniversity. They simulated a horse race between buyers and renters, and\nconcluded that in many cases, renters came out ahead, at least during the\neight-year stretches they studied.Theoretical renters put their down payment\nin a portfolio that often consisted of more than 50 percent stocks (the\nprofessors created a portfolio that approximated the risk of owning a home),\nand continued to invest any savings from renting. But this assumes that there\n_are_ savings from renting, which is not always the case, and that the renter\nis disciplined enough to actually set the money aside.The authors’ point,\nhowever, is that people often blindly believe that buying is usually the\nsmarter option. “Most of the public drive to buy is without looking under the\nhood,” Professor Johnson said.Another study, from HelloWallet, a unit of\nMorningstar, came to similar conclusions in 2014 when comparing a\nhypothetical, moderate-income family that bought, with one that rented, in 20\nmajor cities across the country. The study projects that median-income\nfamilies, or those who earn about $50,000, will often end up with more net\nwealth if they rent versus own over the 10 years from 2013 to 2022.But any\nnumber of variables can quickly shift that calculus, including the price of\nthe home relative to the rent, whether the family is affluent enough to\nbenefit from tax savings, and the time spent in the home.“The longer you stay,\nthe stronger the argument is for buying, all else equal,” said Aron Szapiro,\nwho conducted the analysis. But he also contends that the tax advantages of\nhomeownership are often oversold, particularly to moderate-income\nhouseholds.If you’re trying to determine the right option, some guideposts may\nhelp. Mr. Szapiro, for example, found that in households with about $100,000\nin earnings, net wealth typically rose more 10 years after buying a home than\nif they had rented — but only if the annual rent was 6 percent or more of the\npurchase price. So it would pay to buy a $600,000 home when rent in the area\nwas about $3,000 a month or more. (In a couple of places, including New York\nand Washington, he found that it made sense to buy when the cost of renting\nwas a bit lower relative to home prices.)William Bernstein, an investment\nadviser who has written several books for do-it-yourself investors, offered\nanother rule of thumb: Never pay more than 15 years’ fair rental value for any\nhome, or 180 months of rent.Why 15 years? By his calculations, someone paying\nmore than 180 months of rent might potentially do better by investing in the\nmarket, after considering the costs of owning.So if an apartment would rent\nfor $4,000 a month, that means you shouldn’t pay more than $720,000 ($4,000 x\n180) for an equivalent property.Perhaps easier to digest, Zillow advocates\nlooking at how long it would take for buyers to break even, when compared with\nrenters who invested their down payment of 20 percent and any savings in the\nstock market. Not surprisingly, buyers in places like Brooklyn, Washington and\nLos Angeles had to wait longer, at least four years.Then there’s what you feel\nin the pit of your stomach. To Mr. Austin, house prices in the enclave where\nhe lives in Los Angeles feel as if they are in a bubble, the housing downturn\na faded memory. “Many people we know,” he added, “are tripping over themselves\nto buy right now.”\n\n","title":"To Buy or Rent a Home?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013ee"},"content":"Occasionally you get those “aha” travel moments — epiphanic flashes when you\nsee or experience something so enchanting that a thought occurs to you: “Yep,\nthat alone just made the entire trip worth it.” On Maui, the tourist-heavy and\nsecond-largest Hawaiian island, I was lucky enough to experience one of\nthose.Before I got to that moment, though, there were logistics to work out.\nWhen I was reporting in Las Vegas, I told a Hawaiian couple staying at my\nhotel that I was heading to Maui. “Maui is expensive,” the husband responded.\nMost lodging on Maui is concentrated in the resort-heavy southern and western\nparts of the island; a significant amount of searching yielded precious few\noptions for less than $100 a night. One of the more reasonable hostels, Hakuna\nMatata, was still charging $119 a night for a private room. Most of the\ninexpensive Airbnbs that were available were actually just hostel rooms in\ndisguise. It looked as if either my pocketbook or my back would suffer.Then I\nemailed my friend Rachel. “Don’t you have some connection to Maui?” I wrote to\nher. Her reply: “I was born and raised there so, yes, a big connection :).”We\nspoke briefly on the phone, during which she offered that I could stay with\nher parents. I gratefully accepted. “There is one thing you have to\nunderstand, though,” she added. “We didn’t grow up with a lot of money.”It was\nimportant that I understand that, she continued, and that most Maui residents\nlive simply, in contrast to the huge, moneyed tourist resorts. That sounded\nfine to me; as I’ve learned, staying with locals can yield invaluable insight,\nespecially in tourist havens like Maui, where the number of annual visitors\n(more than 2.4 million in 2014) exceeds the population (about 160,000) by\n15-fold.When I met Rachel’s very kind parents, Eleanor and Gary, they asked me\nwhat I felt like doing. I told them I was hungry, per usual. They took me for\na pulled kalua pork sandwich ($13.95) at Kula Bistro before exploring their\nneighborhood a bit: Kula, Makawao and Pukalani, on the slope of Haleakala\nvolcano, are known as “upcountry” by residents. Their house, in Pukalani, was\nwell-appointed and spacious. After removing my shoes (Hawaii, like many Asian\ncountries, is a shoes-off culture), I settled in my friend’s old bedroom\nbefore consulting her emailed list of places she loved in Maui. I zeroed in on\nthe food.I ate fantastically well during my stay on Maui; my favorite spots\nwere the grocery stores and markets that also sold prepared food. Of those,\nthe standout was the Pukalani Superette, a family-owned grocery store in the\ncute town of Makawao, known historically for its paniolo, or Hawaiian\ncowboys.In addition to their dry goods, they prepare batches of chow fun\n(chewy rice noodles) with ground pork and traditional Hawaiian dishes like\nbeef lau lau, chunks of tender meat steamed in taro or ti leaves. I picked up\na huge portion of beef lau lau for $9 and a container of the delicious chow\nfun for $4.90. Pukalani Superette also offers at least 10 kinds (chicken,\nSpam, hot dog and longanisa sausage, among others) of musubi, the popular\nsnack food composed of a block of meat on rice and wrapped in seaweed.There\nare excellent sit-down places, as well: Eleanor recommended Poi by the Pound,\na simple restaurant in a slightly industrial area of Kahului, the heart of the\nisland and the main retail center for Maui residents. One evening I enjoyed a\nhearty meal of kalua pork, rice, and macaroni salad ($11.40); the pork was\nlight, tender and smoky.They also, of course, sell poi — taro stem that’s been\ncooked and pummeled into a viscous fluid. The poi I sampled (a side is $3.45)\nhad been slightly fermented, giving it a yogurt-like tang. It’s potent, and\ndefinitely an acquired taste.But Sam Sato’s was perhaps my favorite meal\nexperience — a fantastically unpretentious Japanese hole-in-the-wall in\nWailuku that took me completely by surprise. When I arrived at the address, I\nwas sure I was at the wrong place. The environs said “office park” more than\n“cozy neighborhood restaurant,” but the food was otherworldly.Their popular\n“dry noodles” ($6.25 for a small bowl) were the standout. The slightly wavy\nwheat-flour noodles are lightly coated in oil and have a satisfying bite;\nthey’re mixed with bean sprouts and green onion, and served with tender,\nreddish char siu (barbecued pork). If the noodles are too dry, a small bowl of\nhot, savory broth comes on the side, which can be drizzled on. A barbecue beef\nstick ($1.95) is a perfect accompaniment: tender, well-seasoned beef with a\nhint of sweetness, grilled on a small wooden skewer. (Sam Sato’s closes at 2\np.m. Monday to Saturday and is closed Sundays, so keep an eye on the time and\nbe prepared to wait awhile.)I don’t want to give the impression that all I did\nwas eat. Natural grandeur is, of course, why many come to Maui, and I was\ngoing to experience my fair share. My first moment of true appreciation for\nMaui’s beauty came several miles into my drive along Route 360, a.k.a. the\nHana Highway.Hana, the primary town on the eastern coast, is about 25 miles\nfrom the Kahului airport as the crow flies. Not too bad. Well, the Hana\nHighway — roughly 50 miles of twists, turns and one-lane bridges — can easily\nturn that into a three- or four-hour trip. It snakes through the jungle,\npassing a few small towns, waterfalls and bamboo forests. Just don’t be in a\nhurry: You are at the mercy of the slowest car on the highway and will move as\nquickly (or slowly) as it does. Relax, drive defensively, and go with the\nflow.Near mile marker 6.5, after passing Bud the Birdman, a 36-year Maui\nresident who works for tips on the side of the highway with his collection of\ncolorful birds, there’s the Nailiilihaele Stream (don’t try to pronounce it;\nyou’ll just pull a muscle). I had read online about a lush bamboo forest\nnearby, as well as some waterfalls. A little farther down the highway, I\npulled over near a gate scrawled with graffiti, behind which some large\nconifers loomed. There was a wall of bamboo to the south; I walked straight in\nthrough a small opening and was immediately surrounded by young bamboo stalks\n.Green-tinged sunlight filtered in; it was cool and serene. I moved toward the\nsound of running water, hiking down a steep, rocky path that came to a stream.\nA shabby wooden board served as a bridge across. Not having any idea where to\ngo, I decided to follow the water upstream. It was a tricky hike, and I almost\nlost my footing a number of times. Whenever I was at risk of falling, I\ngrabbed a handful of the amazingly strong bamboo stalks for leverage. As I\nwalked, the babbling of rushing water gradually grew louder and louder, from\npolite conversation to outright screaming.I was at the waterfall. Water came\ncrashing down from 20 to 25 feet above, feeding the pool that was at my feet\n(now bare, having removed my shoes). I took off the rest of my clothes, too,\nas there was no one around, and jumped in. The waterfall came down with\ntremendous force, so I moved a few feet away and lounged in the cool, limpid\nbasin.This was the aha moment: languidly floating in a pool being fed by a\nwaterfall, blessedly alone, surrounded by a forest of emerald-green bamboo. It\nwas magical and serene, and made the trip entirely worth it.There are other,\nless strenuous ways to enjoy Maui’s natural magnificence. There is a lovely,\nrelaxing hike along Thompson Road, an offshoot of the Kula Highway on the\nsouthern part of the island. When I did the walk, I made a quick stop at\nGrandma’s Coffee House for a cup of hot coffee ($1.50) before heading up\nThompson Road. Bear right at the fork; otherwise you’ll end up at the Kula\nHospital. The 1.5-mile walk, which just happens to neighbor Oprah Winfrey’s\nproperty, almost evokes the English countryside: a bucolic, rolling landscape\nlined with rock walls and wooden fence posts connected with barbed wire.My\nlast day in Maui, we were up before dawn. Rachel’s parents asked me if I\nwanted to watch the sunrise from the top of Haleakala, the huge shield volcano\nthat forms more than 75 percent of Maui. It seemed a fitting activity, given\nHaleakala’s meaning, “house of the sun.” We climbed into their family car and\nbegan the 1.5-hour drive in complete darkness a little after 5 a.m., winding\nup to the entrance of Haleakala National Park. (Haleakala has more endangered\nspecies than any other national park. Some plant species, like the\nsilversword, are found exclusively on the slopes of Haleakala.) Entrance for\nprivate vehicles to the park is $15, and is valid for three days.When we\narrived, the parking lot was jammed. People had begun arriving as early as\n3:30 a.m., the park ranger told us. And it was cold: Groups were bundled up,\nhuddled together and waiting. We hiked farther up the volcano toward the\nsummit for a clearer and less-contested view. Gradually, the sky began to\nlighten, streaks of yellow and bronze stretching across the vista. The\nhundreds of us on the volcano were watching, rapt, shivering and breathless.\nAs the sun slowly rose, I imagined I could hear the strains of traditional\nHawaiian music: a lap slide guitar and the light strumming of a ukulele.I\nwasn’t imagining it. Rachel’s mother had turned on the Pandora station of\nHookena, a popular band, on her phone. “Does this bother you?” she asked\napologetically. I said of course not. “I don’t know … I just love it here,”\nshe beamed. She’s lived for over 50 years on Maui, and is still in love with\nit. A brilliant sunrise on a crisp morning atop a volcano with someone who,\nafter half a century, was still in love with her home — the waterfall may have\nbeen my first aha moment, but this was the second.\n\n","title":"In Tourist-Heavy Maui, Finding Deals and Aha Moments - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimestravel: In tourist-heavy Maui, the @FrugalTraveler has no trouble finding deals. https://t.co/1qkgUYFimF https://t.co/VBlRmXEkKC","date":"Sat Apr 02 11:43:09 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716229478452740096"},"retweets":55},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1MI6eA1"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013ef"},"content":"**Actually:** Exercise has little or no effect on bone strength.It sounded too good to be true, and, unfortunately, it was. Many public health groups, professional societies and health sites on the Internet promote this exercise prescription, promising it will stave off weak bones. But osteoporosis researchers know the advice is not backed up by rigorous studies.The idea may have begun as an extrapolation of a well-known fact: People who are bedridden lose bone mass. So do astronauts who spend time weightless. The pull of gravity seems to be needed for bone strength. But is there a threshold beyond which bones are about as strong as they will be from the force of gravity? Is everyday walking around just as good as running a marathon? Those studies did not say.The answer came a little more than a decade ago when scientists did rigorous studies, asking if weight bearing exercise increased bone density in adults. They used DEXA machines, which measure bone density by hitting bones with X-rays. Those studies failed to find anything more than a minuscule exercise effect — on the order of 1 percent or less, which is too small to be clinically significant. As expected, DEXA found bone loss in people who were bedridden and in astronauts. But there was no evidence that bone was gained when people walked or ran.Scientists have continued to investigate as tests for bone density grow ever more sensitive. More recently, using new and very expensive machines that scan bone and are able to show its structure at a microscopic scale, they reported a tiny exercise effect in one part of the bone’s architecture known as the trabecula, little branches inside bone that link to each other. The cortical shell — the outer layer of bone — also seems to be slightly thicker with weight bearing exercise. But these are minute changes, noted Dr. Clifford Rosen, a bone researcher at the Maine Medical Research Institute. There is no evidence that they make bone stronger or protect it from osteoporosis, he said.All that can be said is that if exercise builds bone, it does not build much bone. Which isn’t to say that exercise cannot protect bones in other ways. Studies have found that older people who did weight bearing exercise decreased their risk of fractures. But this seems to be more likely explained by the fact that exercise leads to stronger muscles that in turn made falling less likely.At this point nothing except injections of parathyroid hormone and, perhaps, a new injectable drug called abaloparatide now being tested in clinical trials, make bone denser and stronger. Popular osteoporosis drugs like Fosamax slow the rate of bone loss, but they do not build bone.There is a glimmer of hope for those who have put their faith in exercise. Perhaps, osteoporosis researchers say, even though bones do not get stronger with exercise, exercise might make bones healthier in terms of a mysterious property called bone quality. No one knows exactly what it is but it may help explain why some people with bones that look strong get fractures while others with bones that look fragile do not. Maybe those microscopic changes in bone make a crucial difference, but it is too soon to say.\n\n","title":"Exercise Is Not the Path to Strong Bones - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Exercise is not the path to strong bones https://t.co/RvQ8owoZwP","date":"Sat Apr 02 11:31:06 +0000 2016","favs":246,"id":{"$numberLong":"716226447023730689"},"retweets":142},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VZTB5F"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013f0"},"content":"The gentlemen at U.S. Soccer are saddened, aggrieved and cut to the\nquick.Members of the women’s national team who have won Olympic gold medals\nand last year’s World Cup insist that in the upstairs/downstairs gender world\nof soccer, they are stuck in the pay subbasement. So they filed a federal\ncomplaint, charging U.S. Soccer, the sport’s governing body here, with wage\ndiscrimination. And when they did that, the men got sad.“We are disappointed,”\nthe men who run U.S. Soccer responded in a news release. “We are the world\nleader in women’s soccer.”In fairness, this business of pay equity is more\ncomplicated than it might appear. But before I get fair, let me note that\nclaiming to be the world leader in women’s soccer is a less grand title than\nit sounds.FIFA, the sometimes crime family that runs global soccer, is a\nvastly male endeavor. Just this once, women might celebrate their exclusion:\nOf the 42 defendants in the ever-expanding FIFA corruption scandal, only one\nis female.Sepp Blatter, the once-eternal president of FIFA, styled himself a\nfierce advocate of women’s soccer. In 2004, he claimed a flash of insight.“Let\nthe women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball,” he told\nreporters. “They could, for example, have tighter shorts.”FIFA, at the urging\nof the United States and Canada, has made halting strides in women’s soccer,\nalthough the money allocated is coin spillage out of the sacks expended on the\nmale side.“Unless you build the market and invest in it, you’ll always make\nless,” said Julie Foudy, a midfielder and star of women’s soccer in the 1990s\nand a winner of two Olympic gold medals. “FIFA doesn’t do any of that.”Pay\nequity is in the air now, and for good reason. Nationally, across occupations,\nwomen in comparable jobs still make 28 cents on each dollar less than men. The\ntrend line arcs upward, but Neanderthal men lurk. Raymond Moore, the chief\nexecutive of the Indian Wells tennis tournament in California, decided to\nunburden himself recently.In his 70th year, he turned his thoughts to his next\nlife.“When I come back, I want to be someone in the WTA, because they ride on\nthe coattails of the men,” he said, referring to the Women’s Tennis\nAssociation. “They don’t make any decisions, and they are lucky. They are\nvery, very lucky. If I were a lady player, I’d go down every night on my\nknees. ...”He gassed on like this long enough to make you hope he would be\nreincarnated as a dung beetle.Serena Williams, the glorious grande dame of\ntennis, noted that last year the United States Open — which offers women the\nsame purse as the men — sold out the women’s final before the men’s.\n“Obviously I don’t think any woman should be down on her knees thanking\nanybody like that,” Williams said.Novak Djokovic, a star of the men’s tour,\nfelt compelled to weigh in, too, alas. He said that the men’s game was more\npopular and that they ought to demand more money. Not that he wasn’t\nsympathetic to women, sort of.“Their bodies are much different to men’s\nbodies,” he said. “They have to go through a lot of different things that we\ndon’t have to go through. You know, the hormones and different stuff. We don’t\nneed to go into details.”Men labor under challenges all their own.U.S. Soccer\ntried to push back on Thursday. Its spokesmen said that revenue, attendance\nand television numbers for men’s soccer usually dwarfed those of women’s\nsoccer. Only in World Cup or Olympic years does the women’s team, which is far\nmore successful than the men’s team, pull in comparable revenue.And, U.S.\nSoccer noted, the women voted years ago — and more than once — to ratify the\ncompensation terms in their current contract.All of which strikes me as\ncarrying not much import. Foudy said she once received a $10 per diem for\nmeals. “Thank God the discussion is a little more nuanced today,” she\nsaid.Today women get $50 per diem. Men get $62.50. Women get $30,000 for\nmaking a World Cup team; men get $68,750. A top female player might make\n$100,000, according to the women’s complaint. A comparable male player, they\nsay, gets about $260,000.U.S. Soccer’s pockets are not endlessly deep, and\nthere is perhaps a reasonable argument for some discrepancy. When social\nchange blows through, however, it rarely suffices to toss up an old windshield\nand argue it worked well last time.In the late 1990s, civil unions were seen\nas a radical step. Just 15 years later, civil unions were seen as an\naccommodation to be discarded in favor of the real thing: gay marriage.Sunil\nGulati, the president of U.S. Soccer, has been an advocate for women’s soccer.\n“Sunil deserves a lot of credit,” Foudy said. “You wouldn’t have a women’s\nleague if not for him.”Yet the American women, in their triumphal post-World\nCup tour, were forced to play on lousy fields of artificial turf.I called\nCathy E. Minehan, a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and\nthe dean of the school of management at Simmons College. She sighed. Gender\npay equity is an abiding passion.“Fair Labor Standards Act was passed in the\n1930s, and it made it illegal to pay people different for the same job,” she\nsaid. “Those women are out there taking risks, enduring concussions, ripped\nknees. Particularly when there are few women in management, there’s often an\nunconscious bias.”The board of U.S. Soccer remains a male preserve, with 14\nmen and two women, a disparity found on its other committees.Foudy has built a\ngood life. Her golden moment in soccer, however, came and went as she made\nbelow-poverty wages. She recalls talking with the tennis great and feminist\nBillie Jean King about a coming labor negotiation.“Billie Jean always said\nit’s not about you; if you had a blank slate, what would you want for the next\ngeneration?” Foudy said. “You’re not just doing it for yourself.”\n\n","title":"Men of Soccer Don’t Get It, as Usual - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTSports: Men of soccer don’t get it, as usual, says @powellnyt  https://t.co/sN6gS2auz9 https://t.co/QjTiT1EFSD","date":"Sat Apr 02 11:14:36 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716222292909547526"},"retweets":89},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SrIYTr"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013f1"},"content":"When New York City needed foster care for vulnerable boys with emotional\nproblems, the answer was often the Long Island home of Cesar Gonzales-\nMugaburu.Over two decades, the city’s child welfare agency sent 95 boys to\nlive with Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu, according to state records. Other child\nwelfare agencies turned to him during that time as well. In all, 106 boys were\nplaced with Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu, as he became a sort of storybook hero to\nchild welfare workers struggling to find suitable homes for troubled\nchildren.Yet some of the boys who had been in his care tried to tell a\ndifferent story to anyone who would listen — a school guidance counselor, or\nsocial workers. Anonymous tipsters called a child-abuse hotline that feeds\nreports into a statewide database.Some of the reports alleged bizarre neglect,\nlike refusing to replace a child’s broken glasses or not letting a child\nshower. Other reports, from as recently as last April and as far back as the\n1990s, accused Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu of sexual abuse. But the investigations\ndid not lead to criminal charges or apparently to any limitations on his role\nas a foster parent.So the four-bedroom house in the hamlet of Ridge, N.Y.,\nwith a backyard pool and water slide, continued to serve as a destination for\nfoster children, placed in Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu’s care by a Long Island\nnonprofit, SCO Family of Services, that is paid tens of millions of dollars a\nyear by New York City. For eight of the children, who were adopted by Mr.\nGonzales-Mugaburu, the house became a permanent home.But the long run of\nsuspicions ultimately caught up with Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu, and last month\nprosecutors in Suffolk County charged him with sexually abusing at least five\nchildren and endangering two others.It is one of the most damning episodes to\nstrike the region’s child welfare system in recent years, and investigators\nbelieve other children may have been abused.Interviews with law enforcement\nand child welfare officials and information from state child-protection\nrecords document a trail of suspicions and a failure of oversight by SCO and\nby the government agencies that shared responsibility for the welfare of the\nchildren placed in Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu’s care. Again and again, agencies in\ndifferent jurisdictions apparently failed to share crucial information that\nmight have kept children out of harm’s way.Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu was the\nsubject of at least 12 complaints over the past decade, according to an\nofficial briefed on entries to the Statewide Central Register, as the database\nof abuse reports is known.SCO was aware of the reports of suspected abuse, but\nunder its contract with the city’s Administration for Children’s Services, the\norganization was not required to tell the city, which this week changed the\nterms of its contract to mandate such reports.Rose Anello, a spokeswoman for\nSCO, said the nonprofit’s policy is to inform the city after notifying the\nState Office of Child and Family Services about each report of abuse, as it is\nrequired to do. “We believe that the policy was followed,” Ms. Anello said,\nbut declined to provide documentation, citing confidentiality laws.Joanne\nWasserman, a spokeswoman for the Administration for Children’s Services, said\nthe agency never received such notifications.The State Office of Child and\nFamily Services catalogs such reports — screening 300,000 calls a year through\nthe hotline — and relays cases to local child welfare agencies to investigate.\nBut the state does not flag individuals based on allegations that local\ninvestigators ultimately deem unfounded, as was the case with those against\nMr. Gonzales-Mugaburu.The Administration for Children’s Services, having\nallowed nearly 100 of its wards to be placed outside the city in Mr. Gonzales-\nMugaburu’s home, did little to track their care. Instead, the city relied on\nSuffolk County, which, as the local jurisdiction where the children were\nliving, bore responsibility for investigating reports of abuse.The police and\nthe child welfare agency in Suffolk did investigate reports involving Mr.\nGonzales-Mugaburu and children from the city, according to the police. But the\ncounty had stopped allowing Suffolk children to be placed with Mr. Gonzales-\nMugaburu more than a decade ago after a sexual-abuse allegation involving a\nfoster child from the county.Justin Meyers, a spokesman for the county\ngovernment, declined to say what information, if any, the child welfare agency\nhad provided to city officials about individual investigations or about the\nearlier decision to stop placing Suffolk children with Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu.\nMs. Wasserman said the city agency was unaware of that decision until after\nthe charges were announced last month.Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu, 59, has pleaded\nnot guilty, and in a jailhouse interview, he told The Daily News the\nallegations were not true. “I don’t know anything about it,” he told The News.\nHis lawyer, Donald A. Mates Jr., said this week that Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu\n“vehemently” denied the allegations.The unsettling nature of the charges, the\nprospect of more former foster children coming forward with allegations and\nthe warning signs cataloged in state records have shaken the region’s child\nwelfare system.Gladys Carrión, the city child welfare commissioner, said there\nwere “gaps” in communication within the entire foster care system, including\nher agency. But Ms. Carrión also said SCO had performed poorly.“I have to\nacknowledge that,” she said. “There were many things that we were unaware of\nand things that they missed that they should have been doing differently that\nthey were required to do.”The city’s child welfare agency has stopped placing\nchildren through SCO, except when they are going to relatives, and this week\nthe state ordered other local child welfare agencies to similarly restrict\ntheir work with SCO.Ms. Carrión said the city would inspect every SCO\nplacement site and a sampling of other providers’ sites over the next two to\nthree months, enlisting retirees and state employees to help.SCO was\nresponsible for licensing and monitoring Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu, and judged him\nto be dependable, even “exemplary,” as one longtime case worker for the\norganization described him in a review, according to the official who\ndiscussed the state register and who was briefed on documents that SCO has\nprovided to child welfare authorities in recent weeks.A former wine\ndistributor who became a full-time foster parent, Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu filed\nfor bankruptcy three years ago. In the court filing, he listed his job as\n“Home Care Provider (Foster Care)” with an income of $6,600 a month and assets\nthat included a couple of classic cars: an MG Roadster and a Plymouth Savoy.\nSCO continued to place children with him throughout his financial difficulties\nand reliance on foster care stipends as his primary source of income.Indeed,\nhis home was always in demand. He was certified as a “therapeutic” foster\nparent, deemed qualified to care for children with complex emotional needs.\nMr. Gonzales-Mugaburu was a single, Latino man with a large house at the\nbottom of a suburban cul-de-sac, and most of the children sent to him were\nalso Latino. For social services agencies struggling to place vulnerable boys,\nMr. Gonzales-Mugaburu’s profile seemed a perfect fit, especially because of\nhis willingness to take in so many boys, most of them with emotional or\ndevelopmental challenges.For many of the children, who may have felt abandoned\nby their biological parents and had moved between homes, Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu\npromised a stability they had never known. But investigators have found that\nhe isolated the boys from the outside world and imposed rigid limits on their\nlives, said Detective Lt. Robert Donohue, commander of the Suffolk County\nPolice Department’s Special Victims Section.The boys, for example, were\nforbidden to join after-school clubs, play team sports or have girlfriends,\nLieutenant Donohue said. “It’s clear to me that he exercised this control over\ntheir lives in order to commit the atrocities which he did,” he said.The\nbiological father of one of the boys whom Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu adopted said\nhe was shocked to learn, after he and his son reunited, that Mr. Gonzales-\nMugaburu had not only adopted his son and changed the boy’s surname, but had\nalso changed his given name. It was, the authorities said, a step he took with\nother children he adopted.The father’s wife recalled how her stepson, who is\nto turn 26 on Saturday, told them that Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu had said “he\nwanted to change his name so his father couldn’t find him because his father\nwas a very bad man.”The couple did not want to be identified in order to\nmaintain the privacy of their son. “He’s not ready to talk about it yet,” said\nthe father, who re-established contact with this son six years ago.The\nbiological father, who described a troubled past, stayed in touch with his son\nduring the boy’s first years in foster care. But he said he had been cut off\nfrom his son once the boy was delivered to Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu. “I hold that\nagency that sent those kids to him responsible,” the man said.  \nThe allegations of sexual abuse go back two decades, prosecutors said.The\nofficial briefed on some of the entries in the Statewide Central Register said\nthat in separate reports several months apart in 2006, Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu\nhad been accused of sexual and physical abuse. The police closed their inquiry\ninto the sexual-abuse accusations for lack of evidence after the four children\nliving with him at the time — all of them foster children he had adopted —\ndenied the abuse when they were interviewed by investigators. Others\nallegations of sexual abuse were reported in 2015 and 2016, the police\nsaid.Ronald Richter, a former commissioner of the Administration for\nChildren’s Services and now chief executive of JCCA, a foster care provider,\nsaid it was essential that the system stay focused on the safety of\nchildren.“There are pedophiles out there,” Mr. Richter said. “They’re smart.\nThey can beat us. They will find the holes. It is up to us to be vigilant\nabout finding the holes to protect the children by getting smarter and more\nstrategic as a system with a vengeance.”Last year, Suffolk detectives followed\nup on a complaint they had received about the possibility that Mr. Gonzales-\nMugaburu had sexually abused two foster children who had once lived with him.\nThe complaint originated with a social worker, who informed the state’s\ncentral registry, which in turn alerted the Suffolk police, Lieutenant Donohue\nsaid.Detectives interviewed the two boys, Lieutenant Donohue said, “but\nbecause of inconsistent statements among the children we were not able to make\na criminal case.” In January, though, two other foster children made multiple\ncomplaints about Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu, including alleging that he had had sex\nwith a dog in the presence of at least one child.Those complaints led to the\narrest of Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu, who urged a detective to speak to one of his\nolder adopted sons, now 28, prosecutors said.Several days later, the man\nhelped detectives build a broader case against his adoptive father, bringing\nforward others who had been cared for in Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu’s home and who\nsaid they too had been sexually abused, the Suffolk County district attorney,\nThomas J. Spota, said.The indictment last month has left child welfare\nofficials searching for explanations. “Now looking back, we say ‘Oh my God’,\nbut this is in hindsight, looking back,” Ms. Carrión said.Neighbors are asking\nsimilar questions. “I knew 60 or 70 by their first name,” said one longtime\nneighbor of the children who came to live with Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu.About two\nyears ago, the neighbor said, he spotted one of Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu’s foster\nchildren, by then an older teenager, shivering in the backyard, apparently\nafter being locked out of the house.“I called him over and brought him into\nthe house and I gave him a sweatshirt,” said the neighbor, who asked that his\nname not be used because he was ashamed that he had not done more.He added\nthat he had learned that Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu suspected the teenager of\nstealing from him and the other children living in the house. As a result, the\nboy was not allowed indoors while Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu was not home.“It was\nmaybe 45 degrees outside,” the neighbor recalled.From time to time, the\nneighbor would tease Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu about women he occasionally saw\nleaving his home. A girlfriend? No, Mr. Gonzales-Mugaburu would tell him; they\nwere social workers.“He would say, ‘They’re just checking up on me — all’s\ngood.’”\n\n","title":"An ‘Exemplary’ Foster Father, a String of Suspicions and Sexual-Abuse Charges - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"A Long Island foster father was allowed to take in dozens of boys, even as suspicion of sexual abuse grew https://t.co/J1UoVUX7fD","date":"Sat Apr 02 11:01:01 +0000 2016","favs":115,"id":{"$numberLong":"716218876367863808"},"retweets":122},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1Tph9A8"}

Since then, mountainous\nNagorno-Karabakh — officially part of Azerbaijan — has been under the control\nof local ethnic Armenian forces and the Armenian military.Armenian forces also\noccupy several areas outside Nagorno-Karabakh proper. The sides are separated\nby a demilitarized buffer zone, but small clashes have broken out\nfrequently.Each side blamed the other for Saturday's escalation.In a\nstatement, Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry said 12 of its soldiers \"became\nshahids\" — Muslim martyrs — and said one of its helicopters was shot down.The\nstatement also claimed that more than 100 Armenian forces were killed or\nwounded and that six tanks and 15 artillery positions were destroyed.Armenian\nPresident Serzh Sargsyan told his national security council that 18 Armenian\nsoldiers were killed and 35 wounded.Armenia earlier claimed to have inflicted\nheavy damage on Azerbaijani forces, but did not immediately give figures. A\nstatement from the Nagorno-Karabakh defense ministry claimed more than 200\nAzerbaijani soldiers were killed, but there was no corroboration for that\nfigure.\"This is the most wide-scale military action that Azerbaijan has tried\nto carry out since the establishment of the 1994 cease-fire regime,\" Sargsyan\nsaid.David Babayan, a spokesman for Nagorno-Karabakh's separatist president,\nsaid a boy of about 12 was killed and two other children were wounded in a\nGrad missile barrage by Azerbaijani forces.Russian President Vladimir Putin\nurged all sides to cease firing and \"show restraint,\" Russian news agencies\nquoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying. Russia's foreign and defense\nministers contacted their Azerbaijani and Armenian counterparts in hopes of\nstabilizing the situation, the ministries said.\"The situation along the entire\nlength of the line of opposition between Karabakhi and Azerbaijani armed\nforces continues to be extremely difficult,\" Armenian defense ministry\nspokesman Artsrun Hovhannisyan told The Associated Press.U.S. Secretary of\nState John Kerry issued a statement saying that the United States \"condemns in\nthe strongest terms the large scale ceasefire violations\" along the Nagorno-\nKarabakh buffer zone.\"We urge the sides to show restraint, avoid further\nescalation, and strictly adhere to the ceasefire,\" Kerry said. He called on\nboth sides to enter into \"immediate negotiations\" on a comprehensive\nsettlement of the conflict under the auspices of the Organization for Security\nand Cooperation in Europe.Years of negotiations under the OSCE have brought\nlittle progress in resolving the territorial dispute.The negotiation efforts\nare led by a troika of envoys from the United States, Russia and France. On\nSaturday, the envoys jointly issued a statement calling on the sides \"to stop\nshooting and take all necessary means to stabilize the situation on the\nground.\"Armenian forces also occupy several areas outside Nagorno-Karabakh.The\nArmenian Defense Ministry said Azerbaijan used aircraft, tanks and artillery\nto try to make inroads into Nagorno-Karabkh and that \"Azerbaijani authorities\nbear all responsibility for the unprecedentedly supercharged situation.\"The\nAzerbaijani Defense Ministry said the fighting began when Armenian forces\nfired mortars and large-caliber artillery shells across the front line.\nMinistry spokesman Vagif Dargyakhly told The Associated Press that more than\n120 shots were fired, some of which hit civilian residential\nareas.___Associated Press writers Avet Demourian in Yerevan, Armenia, and Jim\nHeintz in Moscow contributed to this story.\n\n","title":"Azerbaijan Says 12 of Its Soldiers Killed in Fighting - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Heavy Fighting Erupts Over Separatist Nagorno-Karabakh https://t.co/hM2rl7yNMp","date":"Sat Apr 02 10:29:59 +0000 2016","favs":77,"id":{"$numberLong":"716211066607370240"},"retweets":60},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22XXIUU"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013f3"},"content":"A tribute is not a resurrection. “The Music of David Bowie,” at Carnegie Hall\non Thursday night, manifested Mr. Bowie’s absence as much as his legacy, in a\nconcert featuring Michael Stipe, Laurie Anderson, Cat Power, Perry Farrell,\nthe Pixies, the Flaming Lips and Heart’s lead singer, Ann Wilson.Performing\none song each, they grasped at some strands of Mr. Bowie’s achievements: his\nbounding riffs and encompassing melodies, the aphorisms and enigmas of his\nlyrics, his arty stratagems, his fashion sense. They looked beyond his hits\n(though not to any songs he wrote after the 1980s). Yet Mr. Bowie’s\nquintessential elegance — the seamless way he merged unruly passions and ideas\nwith coolheaded calculation — couldn’t be reproduced.The concert was the 2016\nedition of the annual tribute to a songwriter produced by Michael Dorf of City\nWinery to benefit children’s music education. It had been planned since\nOctober 2015, when Mr. Bowie approved it and his longtime producer, Tony\nVisconti, signed on to lead the house band. The show was announced just before\nMr. Bowie’s death on Jan. 10, and the outpouring of respect and grief for Mr.\nBowie made it an immediate sellout. A second concert, with a slightly\ndifferent lineup, was added on Friday night at Radio City Music Hall.With Mr.\nVisconti as bandleader and bass player, and Woody Woodmansey — who played on\nBowie albums from 1970 to 1973 — on drums, the band was most at home in Mr.\nBowie’s glam-rock era. It got exactly the right frontwoman when Debbie Harry\nof Blondie — in a silvery poncho — sang “Starman” with equal parts of bravado,\nexperience and pop welcome, getting the audience on its feet to sing along\nwith the “la-las” of the chorus. Ms. Wilson had red shoes to match the lyrics\nof Mr. Bowie’s 1983 hit “Let’s Dance,” and she traded his restraint for arena\nswagger as she swooped up to belt some high notes.Cyndi Lauper battled sound\nproblems as she twirled her way through “Suffragette City.” Mr. Farrell,\nsartorially splendid in a brown suit, black cape and floppy hat, mostly smiled\nand posed as he teased at the androgyny of “Rebel Rebel.” The night’s most\nflamboyant costuming arrived with the Flaming Lips, as Wayne Coyne — in gold\nlamé, a silvery ruff and a long cape with its own LED light show — perched on\nthe shoulders of someone dressed as Chewbacca and sang “Life on Mars?” He\nanswered the song’s closing question, “Is there life on Mars?,” with a\ncheerful “Yes!”Other performers tinctured Mr. Bowie’s arrangements with their\nown styles. Ms. Anderson treated the verses of “Always Crashing in the Same\nCar” as a recitation punctuated by her electric violin. Gypsy fiddle replaced\nsynthesizer, and party-hearty spirit took over, as Eugene Hutz and other\nmembers of Gogol Bordello romped through “Breaking Glass.” Rickie Lee Jones\nplayed “All the Young Dudes” alone on acoustic guitar, singing it with\nconversational ease, switching it from a shared anthem to a lone rumination.\nCat Power brought a husky soul intimacy to “Five Years.”Bettye LaVette and Mr.\nBowie both recorded “It Ain’t Easy” in 1972, and she strutted through her\nversion of the song with soul dynamics. The Pixies performed their own\n“Cactus,” which Mr. Bowie recorded on his 2002 album, “Heathen”; David\nLovering, on drums, replaced the “P-I-X-I-E-S” cheer from the original version\nwith “B-O-W-I-E.” J Mascis, joined by Sean Lennon, sang the comically mundane\nrewrite of Mr. Bowie’s “Quicksand” that he recorded with Dinosaur Jr. Joseph\nArthur tried “The Man Who Sold the World” with electric guitar and a looping\ndevice; it was a shambles, though he got a round of applause by unfurling an\nAmerican flag with a blunt anti-Donald Trump message written on it.But the\ndeepest dialogue with Mr. Bowie’s music came from Mr. Stipe, performing “Ashes\nto Ashes.” Paul Cantelon, on piano, gave the arrangement the formality of a\nSchubert lied, and Mr. Stipe sang in a troubled whisper answered by the\nghostly soprano of Karen Elson, newly illuminating the song’s thoughts of\ndruggy oblivion. Speaking about Mr. Bowie, Mr. Stipe said, “Whether or not\nhe’s here in this room, he is most certainly here in this room.” For that\nsong, at least, Mr. Bowie’s spirit of continual transformation endured.\n\n","title":"Review: Remembering David Bowie, With One Artist and One Song at a Time - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesarts: Remembering David Bowie, one artist and one song at a time https://t.co/GS60xyarAZ https://t.co/pMgECORuoN","date":"Sat Apr 02 10:15:05 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716207317017034752"},"retweets":90},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SGevnl"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013f4"},"content":"TOPEKA, Kan. — Washington is locked in partisan warfare over control of the\nSupreme Court. But it is hardly the only place. Look at the states, where\npolitical attacks on judicial decisions are common and well-financed attack\nads are starting to jar the once-sleepy elections for State Supreme Court\nseats.Nowhere is the battle more fiery than here in Kansas. Gov. Sam Brownback\nand other conservative Republicans have expressed outrage over State Supreme\nCourt decisions that overturned death penalty verdicts, blocked anti-abortion\nlaws and hampered Mr. Brownback’s efforts to slash taxes and spending, and\nthey are seeking to reshape a body they call unaccountable to the right-\ntilting public.At one point, the L egislature threatened to suspend all\nfunding for the courts. The Supreme Court, in turn, ruled in February that the\nstate’s public schools must shut down altogether if poorer districts do not\nget more money by June 30.“A political bullying tactic” and “an assault on\nKansas families, taxpayers and elected appropriators” is how the president of\nthe Senate, Susan Wagle, a Republican, responded to that ruling, which was\nbased on requirements in the state Constitution. Mr. Brownback spoke darkly of\nan “activist Kansas Supreme Court.”In March, in the latest salvo, the\nRepublican-controlled Senate passed a bill to authorize impeachment of\njustices if their decisions “usurp” the power of other branches. But the\nclimactic battle is expected in the November elections, when conservatives\nhope to remake the seven-member Supreme Court in a flash, by unseating four\njustices regarded as moderate or liberal.Partisan conflict over courts has\nerupted in many of the 38 states where justices are either directly elected\nor, as in Kansas, face periodic retention elections, without an opposing\ncandidate. As conservatives in Washington try to preserve a majority on the\nfederal Supreme Court, politically ascendant conservatives in several states\nare seeking to reshape courts that they consider to be overly liberal vestiges\nof eras past.“We’ve seen this tug of war between courts and political branches\nall around the country,” said Alicia Bannon, a senior counsel at the Brennan\nCenter for Justice at New York University.Television spending in the election\nof two justices in Arkansas on March 1 reached $1.2 million, and candidates\nattacked as being too cozy with trial lawyers were defeated there, in part\nwith money from outside business interests.In Wisconsin, where a court seat\nwill be filled in an election on April 5, ads sponsored by out-of-state groups\nfrom the left and the right have helped push total campaign spending to more\nthan $2.6 million, according to data gathered by the Brennan Center and\nJustice at Stake, a nonprofit group in Washington that promotes judicial\nintegrity.On the other side, unions and plaintiffs’ trial lawyer groups last\nyear spent about $2.9 million in Pennsylvania on television ads that helped\nelect Democratic candidates to three Supreme Court seats.In Oklahoma, where\nthe court is under attack for ruling that a Ten Commandments monument must be\nremoved from the Capitol, bills are being considered that would give the\ngovernor and legislative leaders more control over the selection of justices.\nIn Georgia, a Republican bill some described as “court-packing,” to increase\nthe number of Supreme Court seats, has passed the General Assembly.Driving the\nconflict in Kansas is the recent dominance of conservative Republicans led by\nMr. Brownback. Many legislators say the courts have overstepped their role by\nruling that cuts in school funding violate the state Constitution’s guarantee\nof a basic level of education.“If you’re going to make political rulings, then\nyou should be politically accountable,” said Senator Dennis Pyle, a sponsor of\nthe bill to broaden the grounds for impeachment.The impeachment bill is not\nlikely to clear the Legislature this year, but Mr. Brownback is also pushing\nfor an amendment that would give the governor more control over choosing new\njustices, who are now winnowed through a merit system.In response to the\nSupreme Court ultimatum, the Legislature last week passed a plan to give more\nmoney to the poorest districts. But the court is also expected to rule in\ncoming months on the more intractable issue of whether the shrunken pool of\nmoney for all K-12 education is enough to meet minimum standards.Since Mr.\nBrownback took office, state aid has declined to $3,800 per pupil, from\n$4,400, according to the Kansas branch of the National Education Association.\nBecause of the cuts, some rural districts have disbanded, some schools have\nclosed and, last spring, six districts ended the school year days early to cut\ncosts.Conservatives have also been angered by court rulings against new\nabortion restrictions and, along with crime-victim advocates,  by rulings in\nmurder cases that  overturned death sentences on procedural grounds.All but\none of the seven sitting Kansas justices were appointed by a Democrat, former\nGov. Kathleen Sebelius, or by her predecessor, a moderate Republican.Mr.\nBrownback has condemned the existing system for choosing justices, in which a\ncommittee of five lawyers (selected by their peers) and four non-lawyers\n(appointed by the governor) provides candidates.In his State of the State\naddress in January, Mr. Brownback said the selection of justices “is\ncontrolled by a handful of lawyers” as he repeated his call for an amendment\nto create “a more democratic selection process.”Chief Justice Lawton R. Nuss,\nwho was appointed by a moderate Republican in 2002 and became chief justice in\n2010, responded by telling reporters, “We believe that our present system that\nhas been in effect for almost 60 years is superior to the other models that\nare being proposed.”“I don’t know how much more democratic you can get,” he\nsaid of the retention elections that justices must face every six years.Chief\nJustice Nuss, who keeps a copy of the oath of office on the wall of his\nchambers and has emerged as a strong defender of judicial independence, sports\nhis signature walrus mustache, which is the subject of a parody Twitter\naccount (@nusstache). He may experience the full fury of that electoral\nprocess this fall, when he will be on the ballot.“This is a full-out power\ngrab by the governor,” Ryan Wright, the executive director of Kansans for Fair\nCourts, said of the efforts to reshape the courts. His group represents\nliberal and moderate groups that plan to muster support for the sitting\njustices.The state’s conservatives “believe that they should be able to change\nthe court when there is disagreement about decisions,” said Callie Jill\nDenton, the executive director of the Kansas Association for Justice, the\ntrial lawyers’ trade association.But Senator Jeff King, the chairman of the\nJudiciary Committee, said, “I think we need to change our judicial selection\nprocess, absolutely.”“You don’t usually have a Supreme Court issuing rulings\nthat affect 53 percent of the budget,” he said of the clash over school\nfunding.Groups that are expected to try to unseat four justices in November\nhave so far been coy about their preparations and fund-raising. “Preliminary\nthings are going on is all I’ll say,” said Mary Kay Culp, the executive\ndirector of Kansans for Life, an anti-abortion group.Charles G. Geyh, a\nprofessor at the Indiana University Maurer School of Law and the author of\n“Courting Peril: The Political Transformation of the American Judiciary,”\nwarned that increasingly bitter, partisan battles threatened to undermine\nfaith in the courts.“We need to get past the fiction that judges are umpires\nthat just call balls and strikes,” he said. “Ideology will affect their\ndecisions,” he acknowledged, “but we need to give them some breathing room.\nThey are not hijacking the law.”\n\n","title":"Outraged by Kansas Justices’ Rulings, Republicans Seek to Reshape Court - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The Kansas State Senate has passed a bill to authorize impeachment of justices based on their decisions https://t.co/SK1NKxTKsJ","date":"Sat Apr 02 10:01:07 +0000 2016","favs":183,"id":{"$numberLong":"716203802274226176"},"retweets":243},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VZTyXo"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013f5"},"content":"I was trying not to slip as I traipsed over the stone pavement in the drizzle\nat the old fort at Port Royal in Kingston, the “wickedest city in\nChristendom,” a warren of iniquity and plunder, a den of pirates and\nbuccaneers and the core of British naval power in the Antilles for 200\nyears.As a retired coast guard captain who was born there and lived nowhere\nelse in his 60 years led me around, conjuring up scenes of mayhem, killers,\nwhores and smugglers, I scanned the remains of the fort, nearly deserted that\nmorning, and saw nothing that remained of the glories past. Ruminating about\nthe eerily quiet grounds, the captain sighed and recalled the historic turning\npoint of the Port Royal story, the midday hour on June 7, 1692, when an\nearthquake toppled most of the city and 2,000 people into the sea, the day\nPort Royal became a ghost town.On some islands, the tale would be a defining\none, but here, it was just a slim chapter in a dramatic history. Jamaica was\nborn out of conflagration. Fire and brimstone, slave rebellions and\ninsurrections, pirates and buccaneers, hurricanes and earthquakes. It was\ninhabited by Taino Indians, who named it Xaymaca, and shaped by European\nconquerors, first the Spanish, then the English.The British turned the island\ninto a huge sugar plantation, its wealthiest colony in the Caribbean and the\nhub of slave trade in the Americas. Planters built magnificent houses high\nabove their sugar cane fields, and lived lives of idleness, gorging on drink\nand wanton sex with slaves.At the center of Jamaica’s ethnic and political\ncomplexity is race. As in Antigua and on other Caribbean islands, the social\nand economic division between mostly white “haves” and mostly black “have-\nnots” runs deep. Like other Caribbean countries, Jamaica is demanding\nreparations for slavery. Old grievances and injustices drive much of the\npolitical violence, gang crime and economic problems that have bedeviled the\nisland.But it seems something is changing. The government is stable after long\nperiods of tumult, and it is pushing to rein in crimes against foreigners,\ngang-and-drugs shootings, and evangelist-reinforced homophobia. The economy is\nstill wobbly but showing some signs of health, and tourism, the island’s No. 1\nindustry, on which many Jamaicans depend for a living, has risen to at least\n1.5 million visitors a year.With such high stakes in tourism, the island has\nbegun looking beyond its traditional market, the sand-and-sun visitors and the\nstable of honeymooners who reliably fill the giant middlebrow Jamaican-owned\nSandals and Couples resorts. Jamaica has been promoting celebrity and\nHollywood, like the seaside villa “GoldenEye,” onetime retreat of the James\nBond creator Ian Fleming and now a resort where one night in the least\nexpensive cottage can set you back $1,400 in the high season.Glossy videos and\nmagazine advertising showcase a paradise island of multiple attractions\nincluding eco-tourism, bohemian tourism, spa and wellness tourism, even small-\nbore niche tourism like Jewish Jamaican Journeys. It’s an all-out campaign to\ndrum up travelers to Jamaica’s alchemy of nature, adventure, night life and\nsensuality.Jamaica has, of course, been a player in the Caribbean tourist\ngame, but competition is stiffer and so are the stakes now that Cuba has\nopened up and inched ahead of Jamaica in the number of visitors in 2015.\nJamaica already lags well behind the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, but\nit hopes that new mega-resorts and other investments will create badly needed\njobs and energize the private sector.With a per-capita income estimated at\n$9,000 (it’s $15,200 in Puerto Rico and $9,700 in the Dominican Republic) and\nan approximate 16 percent unemployment rate, Jamaica is grappling with the\nsteady exodus of thousands of its 2.9 million people to New York, Miami and\nLondon.With few options but to expand tourism, which makes up about 27 percent\nof the nation’s revenues, the government passed development and casino\nlegislation that will bring the first casino-hotel resort to the island,\nCelebration Jamaica Hotel and Resort, a 2,000-room, 90-acre project set to\nopen in a year or two in Montego Bay. The resort has a Canadian company behind\nit, but much of the new tourism investment comes from Spain and Mexico, posing\na challenge to longtime Anglo-American dominance.For all the three centuries\nthat Britain ruled Jamaica, though, the island’s deepest influence is not\nEnglish. It is African. It is folk magic, spiritual and superstitious. It is\nmusical, the poetry of the hills and the streets, the rhythms you hear in the\nway Jamaicans speak, the imploding pulse that runs from east to west, from the\nresort-strewn north coast to the rougher south, through bamboo-shaded\nfoothills and cloud-covered peaks and the wind-driven tides that roll up on\nthis island of old myths and spiritual power.Folk magic out of West Africa,\nnot unlike Haiti’s voodoo and Cuba’s Santeria, feeds the Jamaican belief in\nsuperstition, witches and ghosts. Magic runs through a pervasive\nfundamentalist and evangelical Christian society that breeds revivalist cults\nthat speak in tongues and believe in spirit possession. Rastafarians are\nsomething else. Born out of poor and black Jamaicans, they worship inner\ndivinity, hold ganja smoking as a sacrament, and are as essentially Jamaican\nas reggae.“Reggae is synonymous with social consciousness,” a young Jamaican\nwoman told me. “It means black empowerment. It means Marcus Garvey (the father\nof the black power movement). It means Rastafarianism.”This was the Jamaica\nthat I wanted to get to know better.So after lunch at the historic Devon House\nin Kingston, the former estate of Jamaica’s first black millionaire, I made\nthe rounds of several history museums with the chairman of the Jamaica\nNational Heritage Trust, Ainsley Henriques. As we browsed through rooms of\nancient artifacts, pictures and other paraphernalia, Jamaica’s heroes came to\nlife. There was Paul Bogle, hanged after the Morant Bay rebellion of 1865, and\nNanny of the Maroons, who led slaves to freedom in the Blue Mountains, and Sam\nSharpe, hanged after the Christmas Rebellion of 1831. More recently, there was\nNorman Manley, the Oxford-educated nationalist who helped bring about\nindependence in 1962. His face on wall-size posters in airport corridors\ngreets Jamaica visitors.And there’s Bob Marley. There’s a museum outside\nKingston for the reggae icon. He’s the myth, the mystic, who spoke to God,\nthey say, who conquered the world. But I didn’t have to go look at the museum.\nAll of Jamaica is a Bob Marley museum. A stream of gifted Jamaican musicians\ncycled through mento to calypso, jazz, rhythm and blues, and ska. Then came\nMarley, son of a white British officer named Norval Marley and a black woman,\nCedella Malcolm Booker, and with Bob Marley came reggae, and reggae took\neverything in its path.So that night I avoided the mobbed dance hall parties\nlike Weddy Weddy Wednesdays and went to Redbones Blues Cafe, the highly\nacclaimed venue for Bob Marley’s musical heirs and a beehive of culture, art\nexhibitions, foreign films and poetry nights.I hit it on a poetry night. It\nwas raining off and on. The stage was soaked, and managers were fussing\naround, clipboards in hand. The bar was buzzing. Next to me, a graying\nponytailed foreigner in a white seersucker suit was whispering to his blond\ngirlfriend. Dressy couples held up cocktails and clustered under the bar’s\nroof. Eavesdropping while sipping a Jamaican-style caipirinha, I ran my eyes\nover bar walls papered with photos of jazz and blues greats, while, oddly\nenough, American lounge music played in the background.The next day, after a\nthree-hour, stomach-churning ride through the mountains, Jamaica’s limpid blue\nskies and gorgeous seashore came to view. The resort city of Ocho Rios and the\nsmaller coastal towns were bustling. People mingled on sidewalks and plazas,\nstorefronts and markets, food stalls and at the Juici Patties, the local fast-\nfood joints. I wanted to walk around, have a bite, but time was short. I had\nto get to Montego Bay.MoBay was just 30 or 45 minutes away on the North Coast\nhighway. Its fabled resorts are secluded behind high fortress walls, forests\nof trees and steel gates. Once behind those gates, Jamaica seemed to\ndisappear. Well, not all Jamaica. The sea was there, and the hills, and\nbartenders, housekeepers and porters speaking English salted with patois,\nexclaiming, “Milady, milady, welcome!”I wanted nothing more than sunshine and\nto lie by the sea. On a narrow stretch of the Coyaba hotel beach, Joni from\nthe Netherlands was reading a paperback in German. She and her husband, Jos, a\nprofessor with the graying, thinning hair and serious mien of academia, had\nbeen there a week and had five more days to go. They were running out of\nthings to do, had gone to the Blue Mountains and to Port Antonio’s Blue Lagoon\n(site of the namesake movie starring Brooke Shields) and to Dunn’s River Falls\nand Mystic Mountain near Ocho Rios. Now they were wondering if they should\nmake the long trek to the Appleton Rum estate in the distant inland southwest.\nI had no answers for them. I hadn’t seen half as much as they had.I had\nimagined Montego Bay would glitter with opulent hotels and restaurants, clubs\nand shops — and it did, in the resorts — but the town’s Hip Strip (Gloucester\nAvenue) was a letdown, lined with midrange hotels, bed-and-breakfasts,\nhostels, souvenir shops, jerk food stands, hustlers, and Jimmy Buffett’s\nMargaritaville, maybe MoBay’s most popular club. It was the version of Jamaica\nthat its tourism folks wanted to rethink.I hit the city on the last Friday of\nthe month, when folks get paid and go downtown to spend their money. St. James\nStreet was a clogged artery of cars, trucks and buses, a revolving elbow-to-\nelbow mass of people going through food stalls, bars, clothing stores,\nhaberdasheries, computer depots, supermarkets, carwashes and plazas\nreverberating with the earsplitting sounds of hawking vendors, chattering\nvoices and full-volume music. I wanted to step down and join in, but I also\nwanted to get out of there.After fumes and crowds, I was hoping for a drink\nand fabulous food. Friends had talked up Scotchies, the island’s best known\njerk emporium. I had expected one of those smoky places with picnic tables and\npaper tablecloths. I found a quaint roadside joint with an open-air bar and a\nfew outdoor tables for large groups. A dozen customers, foreigners mostly,\nwere knocking back Red Stripe and digging into servings of jerk pork. I\nordered the same. The beer was ice-cold, but the pork was tough and tasteless.\nI kept pouring a spicy goop over it but it didn’t help.A day later, on my way\nto Negril’s West End — after my debit card was “eaten” by a Scotiabank A.T.M.\nat a Kingston shopping mall and after putting up with unreliable land\ntransport — I wasn’t sure I would ever have a great day in Jamaica, or worse,\nthat I would ever feel that inexplicable connection to the island that I had\nfelt in Antigua and San Juan and Havana.Two hours down the Norman Manley\nHighway south to Negril, flashing by speeding bicyclists and motorcyclists,\nherds of baby goats, bold-paint wood-and-tin homes and the open sea, Jamaica\nbegan to work its charms on me.Then, there was Negril’s West End and the\nRockhouse Hotel. Magic!It was visually fabulous with flowers in bloom,\nbougainvillea vines and almond trees, and shaded winding paths that led to\nhexagonal thatched-roofed villas of timber and stone looking out to the sea.\nAt a glance, Rockhouse lived up to its reputation, one of the loveliest\nboutique hotels in the Caribbean.But extreme contrasts are inevitable in\nJamaica. Across the road from Rockhouse’s fancy gift shop, several ramshackle\nsouvenir shops sold typical tourist wares — T-shirts, flimsy dresses, scarfs,\nhats and trinkets — and a short ride from the eco-centric serenity of\nRockhouse, hundreds of tourists flocked to Rick’s Café, a boisterous bar-\nrestaurant-music hangout with a cliff-diving show, super bars and sensational\nsunsets.I checked out the scene one afternoon, tried to get a bar stool but\ngave up fighting the crowd. A singer was dancing on the stage, and people\nswilling from paper cups clapped to the rhythm. Soon, rather suddenly, as it\ndoes in the tropics, the sun went down, and with that the party broke up. The\ncrowd streamed out, pushing and shoving. Tour buses, vans and taxis packed\nwith riders lumbered out of the parking lot. It was a crazy scene, as crazy as\nNegril’s infamous boat parties and bar shuttles.That evening at the Rockhouse,\nI was having a drink and chatting with an American couple who came back every\nyear, had married and honeymooned there. Even with its high occupancy rate,\nthe hotel opens its restaurants to the public. Expats living in Negril make it\ntheir club, where you might meet old-time hippies in sandals like Janet, a\nblustery San Franciscan who married a local 27 years ago and is building a\nhouse with a swimming pool on a hill.At the bar of the main restaurant, which\ndoubles as a community center with easy chairs and sofas, books and the only\nTV in the resort, a small group of women was cracking jokes about the risqué\nshow at the Jungle nightclub on Ladies Night Out. They’d come from Alberta,\nCanada, and were letting loose and splurging on cocktails, crispy fried\nsnapper and crème brûlée.Early morning, I was on a sleep cloud, tucked in on a\npillowed four-poster bed, a slow ceiling fan ruffling a pinned-up muslin\nmosquito net. Jumping off the bed, I opened the shuttered doors to my private\ndeck. The roiling sea melded with the distant blurry horizon, and I watched as\na small boat with a single passenger, man or woman I couldn’t tell, heaved and\ntossed in the rough sea. Waves leapt, crashed and spat foam maybe 50 feet high\nagainst the Rockhouse cliffs. From somewhere on the nearby road drifted the\nlilting music you hear everywhere you go in Jamaica, the soundtrack of the\nisland.Later, only a 15-minute drive away, I was dipping my feet in the sea,\nstrolling along the popular (and overbuilt) Seven-Mile Beach. The fluffy\nwhite-sand strip was crowded already. Tourists were ensconced in lounge\nchairs, their bodies laid out to toast. A rangy vendor with dreadlocks, hollow\ncheeks and bony legs followed me, dangling a bunch of bananas in one hand and\nclutching a plastic sack containing who knows what. Peddlers and hustlers are\na plague all over Jamaica, but this guy didn’t push it. When I said “no”\npolitely, he backed off.Grateful, I picked up my walk on the lumpy wet sand.\nThe sea sloshed around my feet, splashing my legs. Glass-bottom boats and\nfishing charters swayed in shallow waters, waiting to take divers and\nsnorkelers to the coral reefs and grottoes that make this Jamaica’s dreamiest\ncoast.I had been in Jamaica five days, and finally I was steeping myself in\nthe singsong and blithe spirit of the island.My trip was now winding down, and\nI returned to Montego Bay to the Half Moon resort. Half Moon was a palace,\nelegant, serene, welcoming. Queen Elizabeth II has stayed there and Prince\nPhilip and the Prince of Wales and John and Jackie Kennedy, and countless\nmovie stars and celebrities, honeymooners and lovers on a fling. It is a once-\nin-a-lifetime place.I had a few hours left, so I went out to the sun, ordered\na gin and tonic at the beachside Cedar Bar, and found a lounge chair near a\ngaggle of young Brits, Virgin Atlantic crew members on a two-day layover. That\nevening they had a party and wanted me to go along. I had other plans. I had a\npredawn wake-up call to catch my flight out.After a wonderful dinner outdoors\nat the hotel, I took my time going through Seagrape Terrace, where guests had\ngathered for a musical nightcap with a Jamaican singer. I listened for a while\nand walked down the beach. In the distance I thought I heard the familiar\nwords, “One love, one heart, let’s get together and be all right.”IF YOU\nGODaily rates, shown in U.S. dollars, may change seasonally and do not include\ntaxes and fees.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013f6"},"content":"DETROIT — Despite a steady stream of new models from a number of automakers,\nsales this year of electric and hybrid vehicles have failed to keep pace with\nthe growth in the overall American market.But if the market for electrified\ncars was slumbering, Tesla Motors woke it up with a jolt Thursday with the\nunveiling of its coming Model 3 lineup of affordable, zero-emission\nvehicles.Given that electric and hybrid vehicles account for only about 2\npercent of last year’s record-setting sales in the United States, the\nextraordinary reaction to Tesla’s first mass-market model was a vivid\ndemonstration of the potential demand in the segment.“It shows that the future\nof electric vehicles is not necessarily bleak,” said Alec Gutierrez, an\nanalyst with the research firm Kelley Blue Book. “Maybe we’ve been waiting for\nthe right products that resonate with consumers.”Tesla said on Friday that it\nhad booked reservations — at $1,000 each — from nearly 200,000 people for the\nfirst Model 3 sedans, which will not be available until next year.With a\nstarting price of $35,000 and a battery range of 215 miles, the new Tesla is a\nbig leap in the company’s expansion beyond expensive luxury models.“The final\nstep in the master plan is a mass-market, affordable car,” Elon Musk, Tesla’s\nchief executive, said at the lavish introduction of the Model 3 held at the\ncompany’s design studios in Hawthorne, Calif.Other automakers are also\npressing ahead with important new electric models, including the Chevrolet\nBolt from General Motors, a revamped version of the Nissan Leaf, and new\nentries from Ford Motor and Hyundai.With those and other electrified vehicles\ncoming in the next couple of years, the segment could finally begin to grow\nbeyond the fringes of the market.Last year, automakers sold fewer than 400,000\nelectric and hybrid vehicles in the United States, even as the overall market\nsoared to record sales of 17.5 million, analysts said.On Friday, automakers\nsaid the torrid pace of sales cooled some in March, when overall sales\nincreased about 3 percent, to about 1.6 million vehicles sold. That was lower\nthan Wall Street estimates, and the closely watched seasonally adjusted annual\nsales rate dropped below 17 million for the first time this year.Sales of\ntrucks and sport utility vehicles continued to account for most of the gains,\nwhile passenger cars lagged behind. And despite the introduction of a new\nPrius hybrid from Toyota, there was little improvement in overall sales of\nelectrified models.“The segment has been pretty soft over all, and we expect\nto see that continue this year,” Mr. Gutierrez said.Electric cars and hybrid\nmodels, which are powered by both a gasoline engine and a battery, are\ncritical to nearly every automaker’s efforts to improve their overall\nfleetwide fuel economy to meet a new federal standard of 54.5 miles per gallon\nby 2025. And meeting the goals has become even more important in the wake of\nthe Paris climate accord last year, which mandated significant reductions in\ncarbon emissions.Despite the lukewarm acceptance of electrified vehicles so\nfar by consumers, environmental groups are praising the impact that the\nrelatively small sales have had already.A report released this week by the\nUnion of Concerned Scientists shows, for example, that about 200,000 electric\ncars have been sold in California to date, which has reduced annual gasoline\nconsumption in the state by 56 million gallons.“New models like G.M.’s Bolt,\nTesla’s Model 3 and the new plug-in Prius Prime should keep the number of\nelectric vehicles growing,” said David Reichmuth, a senior engineer with the\nscientists group.Trends in the marketplace, however, are working against\nelectrified models. With fuel prices still hovering at about $2 a gallon, many\nconsumers are choosing larger vehicles that are more affordable to own when\ngas is cheap.And with automakers also improving the mileage of their existing\ncompact cars and small sport utility vehicles, many buyers are meeting their\nfuel-economy needs with conventional, gas-powered models instead of\nelectrified ones.Still, the Tesla’s introduction is a sign that latent demand\nfor electric cars could translate into big sales in the showroom down the\nroad.Mr. Musk said Tesla was preparing for a surge in demand by adding\ndealerships, prepping its California assembly plant to build as many as\n500,000 electric cars a year, and building a new factory in Nevada to produce\nbatteries.As far as the Model 3 is concerned, Mr. Musk was characteristically\nconfident of its ability to compete with any car — electric or not — on the\nmarket. “You will not be able to buy a better car for $35,000,” he said.For\nthe most part, industry executives say that lower prices and greater driving\nrange are the key factors in jump-starting the electric market.Carlos Ghosn,\nthe chief executive of the Japanese automaker Nissan and the French carmaker\nRenault, said recently that the electric segment needed a wider and more\ndiverse array of models to interest a larger audience of potential\nbuyers.Nissan has had limited success with the all-electric Leaf, but growth\nis a “step by step” process, Mr. Ghosn said last month at the New York\nInternational Auto Show.“We’re not in it so much to showcase technology,” he\nsaid. “Our main driver is going to be the mass market for electric cars.”\n\n","title":"Tesla’s New Model 3 Jump-Starts Demand for Electric Cars - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesbusiness: Customers are putting down $1,000 deposits for Tesla’s 2017 electric model https://t.co/iZ54h6obpc https://t.co/wQSrMU…","date":"Sat Apr 02 09:14:18 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716192020625244160"},"retweets":87},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PLukoh"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013f7"},"content":"**Actually**: The Big Bang didn’t happen at a place; it happened at a time.“Where did the Big Bang happen?” I am often asked, as if the expansion of the universe was like a hand grenade going off and the solar system and our Milky Way galaxy were shards sent flying.The universe didn’t start at a place, it started at a time, namely 13.8 billion years ago, according to the best cosmological data. It’s been expanding ever since — not into space because the universe by definition fills all space already, so much as into time, which as far as we know is open-ended.It is true that everything we can see now, out to 13.8 billion years of light-travel time, was once the size of a grapefruit, buzzing with hideous energies, but that grapefruit was already part of an infinite ensemble with no edge, except one made up of time. When we look out, we look into the past, the farther we look, the more deeply into the past we see. At the center is the present. Alas there is no direction in which we can look to see the future — except perhaps into our own hearts and dreams. All we know is right now.So where is the center of the universe? Right here. Yes, you are the center of the universe.When Albert Einstein married space and time in his theory of relativity back in 1905, he taught us that our eyes are time machines. Nothing can go faster than the speed of light, the cosmic speed limit, and so all information comes to us, to the present, from the past.And so Einstein’s relativity teaches us that the center of the universe is everywhere and nowhere. It is the present, surrounded by concentric shells of the past. History racing at you at 186,282 miles per second, the speed of light, the speed of all information. Your eyes are the cockpit of a time machine, filmy wet orbs looking in the only direction any of us can ever look: backward. Everything we see or feel or hear — now that gravitational waves have been discovered — took some time to get here, and so comes to our senses from the past. The moon, hovering over the horizon, is an image of light that left its cratered surface traveling at the speed of light a second and a half ago. The sun that burns your skin is eight minutes and nineteen seconds in the past.The Jupiter we see, glowering orange at the zenith these nights, is about 414 million miles out there as of this writing, or 37 minutes away in the past. The light from the center of the Milky Way, hiding behind the thick star clouds and dust lanes of Sagittarius, takes 26,000 years to get here. While it was on the way the first primitive ice age villages grew into skyscrapered metropolises. Your lover, brushing your lashes with his or her breath, is a nanosecond gone.This is more than poetry. Mathematically, in Einsteinian terms, all the information and history available at any one place in the universe is known as a light cone. Everybody has one and everybody’s is slightly different, which means in effect that everyone’s universe is a little different.There will always be some piece of information that has reached your lover but not yet you, let alone E.T. over in the next galaxy. It gives a new definition to being alone with your thoughts.As T.S. Eliot put it:As a result every spot in the universe is unique. There will always be a piece of it you haven’t seen yet and a piece that you have seen but that nobody else has. There is no place to stand if you want to claim universal knowledge. We all need each other in order to overlap our knowledge. We don’t have to stay in our prisons. Working together and sharing, we can know everything.Or as Bob Dylan once put it, “I’ll let you be in my dreams, if I can be in yours.”\n\n","title":"Don’t Let Them Tell You You’re Not at the Center of the Universe - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTScience: Actually, you are the center of the universe https://t.co/3tWwQGubEj https://t.co/tGo5Jrhby5","date":"Sat Apr 02 08:15:40 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716177264401129472"},"retweets":335},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1ToPbEw"}

Also, what is the significance of the small\nletter after the license number? I have seen A to H.A. Allan Fromberg, the\nspokesman for the Taxi and Limousine Commission, and his colleagues provided\nthis answer:Medallion numbers are assigned by the commission, and there is no\nborough formula. Some numbers, however, were designated for mini-fleet and\ncorporate medallions, and some for individual medallions. The taxi medallion’s\nnumber is also the vehicle’s plate number.“The little letter you see to the\nside and below the medallion number is what we call a subscript,” Mr. Fromberg\nsaid in an email, “and it denotes how many times the medallion has changed\nhands. ‘A’ is the original owner, ‘B’ is the second owner, etc.”It gets\ntrickier. The Department of Motor Vehicles, when it introduced new plate\ncolors a few years ago, decided to push all current plates to the letter ‘H’\nas the first plate, in order to distinguish new plates from old ones. “H” was\nthe first letter no one had reached, so the D.M.V. used it as the new “A.” So\nif an old white plate on a taxi is, say, 1T10A, and if that plate is lost,\nstolen or destroyed and replaced with a new plate, the number would be 1T10H.\nIf that medallion changes owners, the replacement would be 1T10I.\n\n","title":"How Are New York City Taxi Plates Assigned? - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The logic behind NYC taxi license plates https://t.co/EtzSNJeK4H https://t.co/ouYpzlmnKO","date":"Sat Apr 02 07:50:16 +0000 2016","favs":146,"id":{"$numberLong":"716170872776695808"},"retweets":81},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21Xp1sQ"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013f9"},"content":"The chairman of the Republican Party in American Samoa, Utu Abe Malae, began\nfeeling the pressure almost immediately: phone calls, commitment forms,\nanything the presidential campaigns could do, say or send to nail down his\nsupport as a delegate.Ken Callahan, a district chairman for the North Dakota\nRepublican Party, is perpetually fielding calls not just from the campaigns,\nbut also from neighbors and friends who, excited by the process that is\nstarting to unfold, are interested in becoming delegates themselves. “I\nreceive, I would say, 10 to 15 calls a day,” he said, “and it doesn’t stop on\nweekends, either.”And Holland Redfield, a Republican delegate and former\nlawmaker in the Virgin Islands, had a special call-in guest on his radio\nprogram the other day: Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, who promised more than just\nlip service to the islands if he became president. After years of being\ntreated like second-class citizens by mainland politicians, Mr. Redfield said,\n“we are in the catbird seat. There’s going to be some hard\nbargaining.”Suddenly, they matter: For the first time in 40 years, the\ndelegates to the Republican National Convention could be more than just a\nrubber stamp on their party’s nomination process.The out-and-out wooing has\nnot yet begun. But it seems only a matter of time before campaigns start using\nall the trappings of prestige, power and who-knows-what-else they are able to\nmuster.“There are a lot of delegates who’d like to ride on Trump’s plane,”\nsaid Roger Stone, a friend and informal adviser to Donald J. Trump. “There are\na lot of delegates who’d like to have a phone call from Ivanka Trump. We’ll\nget to that phase.”Experts on the nominating rules said that restrictions on\nwhat delegates can accept vary by state but are generally quite permissive.\nFor instance, nothing prevented President Gerald R. Ford from using flights\naboard Air Force One to charm delegates in 1976.The task of herding and\ncajoling 2,472 men and women spread out across two oceans and 10 time zones is\nan immense and intricate undertaking that few in the political world have any\nexperience participating in — let alone managing.It is a process that can seem\nfar removed from the way most Americans think presidential nominees are\nselected: Small gatherings of obscure county and state leaders can overrule\nthe popular will of voters.Few ethical or legal constraints govern how\ndelegates can be courted. And outposts like Guam or the Virgin Islands could\nhave just as much say as Iowa or New Hampshire in picking the nominee because\nof the unusual way in which some states and territories have permitted their\ndelegates to act as roving free agents.So few political operatives know how to\nnavigate the conflicting loyalties, competing interests and arcane procedures\ninvolved, a seller’s market has sprung up for anyone with convention\nexperience.“There aren’t many people who know this stuff,” said Jason Osborne,\nan expert on Republican procedures who has advised several presidential\ncampaigns this year. “You can read up on it. But unless you’ve been through a\nconvention and understand how quickly things can move and change, you’re at a\ndisadvantage.”Mr. Trump, who has been loath to embrace many of the tools of\nmodern political campaigns in his run for the presidency, has brought on a\nparliamentarian to master the intricacies of party rules.Senator Ted Cruz of\nTexas has cultivated ties to individual delegates from Virginia to Guam, aware\nthat every last vote could count.And Mr. Kasich has signed on aides who were\ninvolved in the Republicans’ last contested convention, in 1976, when Mr. Ford\nprevented Ronald Reagan from forcing a second round of voting, which most\nlikely would have ended in Mr. Ford’s defeat.The procedural peculiarities of\nthe nominating process this year are adding a new twist. All 50 states, plus\nthe five territories and the District of Columbia, have a vote, but several\nstates and territories have given themselves outsize influence by allowing\ntheir delegates to act as free agents.The biggest slate yet of totally\nuncommitted delegates will be selected in North Dakota over the weekend at the\nstate’s Republican convention in Fargo.As a sign of North Dakota’s importance,\nBen Carson, the retired neurosurgeon who quit the race last month, will\ncampaign there on behalf of Mr. Trump, whom he has endorsed.Mr. Cruz plans to\nappear himself.Uncommitted delegates are free to decide whom they will\nsupport. They can promise allegiances or switch at will, operating with no\nconstraints binding them to the outcome of a statewide primary.And they can do\nso individually, or as a bloc, if they seek to exert more power: Almost all of\nthem, after all, come from places that have had little or no influence in\npresidential elections, like American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands and\nNorth Dakota.“We want to be able to change our minds,” said Mr. Malae, the\nAmerican Samoa Republican Party chairman.Being uncommitted and unbound, Mr.\nMalae said, was precisely the point for a place like his territory, which has\nno vote in Congress or in the Electoral College. “We joke that this must have\nbeen what it was like being in an outpost of the Roman Empire,” he said.All\ntold, there could be several dozen totally uncommitted delegates on the\nconvention floor in Cleveland, a tiny fraction of the 1,237 needed to clinch\nthe nomination, but enough to swing a close race.At the state conventions in\nColorado and Wyoming, for instance, participants will be able to choose from\namong bound and unbound delegates, potentially adding to the total of free\nagents. And a dispute in the Virgin Islands could lead to some delegates’\nbeing bound to Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump, though all nine of the territory’s\ndelegates were initially uncommitted after a March 10 caucus.“The most\nimportant delegations at a contested Republican National Convention” is how\nJohn Yob, a Republican strategist regarded as a process savant who has worked\nfor several presidential campaigns, has characterized these untethered power\nplayers.Mr. Yob, who also happens to be one of the disputed unbound delegates\nfrom the Virgin Islands, became so fascinated with the machinations involved\nthat he wrote a book that is intended to serve as a primer on the process. The\ntitle, “Chaos: The Outsider’s Guide to a Contested Republican National\nConvention 2016,” looks more prescient every day.The state contest in North\nDakota this weekend, followed by the gatherings in Colorado and Wyoming over\nthe next two weeks, will determine many of these delegates.Demand to be a\ndelegate is as high as it has ever been. Carma Hanson, vice chairwoman of the\nNorth Dakota Republican Party, said she had to get in line for one of her\nstate’s 28 delegate spots: There were four applicants for each opening.Even\nher husband and son wanted in on the action. They applied to be alternates.“It\ncould make for a very interesting convention in July,” she said. “And people\nwant to be a part of that.”It is unclear if the surge of interest will benefit\nany particular candidate. In North Dakota, Republican officials are screening\ndelegate applicants in hopes of elevating those who have a history of\nvolunteering for and donating to the party. That would not seem to benefit Mr.\nTrump, though voters at the convention will have the final say.In Colorado\nthere is no such screening. Steve House, the state Republican chairman, said\nthat in his informal surveys of the dozen or so county assemblies he has\nattended — gatherings where delegates to the state convention were selected —\nabout 40 percent of the people told him it was their first time participating.\n“There’s a fair amount of new people, without question,” Mr. House said.Mr.\nMalae of American Samoa said that in any other year, he would have had a hard\ntime finding delegates. It is a commitment that comes with a price.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013fa"},"content":"PARIS — Violent clashes erupted in Greek refugee camps among panicked migrants\nas Greece and the European Union pressed ahead on Friday with their intention\nto expel them from Europe and deport thousands back to Turkey, despite strong\nobjections from rights groups and United Nations relief officials who say the\nplan is illegal and inhumane.Hundreds of migrants broke out of an overcrowded\ndetention center on the Greek island of Chios and began walking to the port to\nprotest a European Union deal that went into effect in March, authorizing\nGreece to return them to Turkey if their applications for asylum in Europe\nwere not accepted. The deportations officially begin on Monday.Video clips in\nthe Greek media showed migrants streaming away from the camp unhindered by the\npolice, hours after a brawl broke out at the camp’s registration center.\nSeveral refugees were taken to a hospital after the riot police used stun\ngrenades, and a help center run by Doctors Without Borders was destroyed,\nforcing the aid group to abandon its work. More than 1,500 migrants were being\nheld at the center, designed for 1,200. Three people were also reported\nstabbed during a migrant riot on the island of Samos, where another detention\nfacility operates.Major humanitarian groups, including Doctors Without\nBorders, the United Nations refugee agency and the International Rescue\nCommittee, recently suspended some work at detention centers to protest the\nEuropean Union deal, which they say violates international law.The groups\ncited deteriorating conditions at migrant camps, including a makeshift camp in\nthe northern Greek border town of Idomeni, where more than 12,000 migrants\nhave settled in squalor since Europe’s borders closed last month, and in\nPiraeus, the port near Athens, where nearly 6,000 people are now living in\ntents and warehouses.In Geneva, the refugee agency warned Friday that neither\nGreece nor Turkey was ready to handle mass returns of migrants and said both\ncountries needed to provide further protections for asylum seekers before\nundertaking deportations. Citing what it called “continued serious gaps” in\npreparations, the agency released a nine-page document detailing the\nconditions that it said must be satisfied.One the strongest criticisms of the\nagreement came from Amnesty International, the London-based rights group,\nwhich claimed to have proof that Turkey was not safe for refugees. In a new\nreport released 72 hours before the deportations were to begin, Amnesty\naccused the Turkish government of forcing hundreds of Syrian asylum seekers\nback to their war-torn country in recent months, contravening human rights\nprocedures. Amnesty said it had collected witness testimony in Turkey’s\nsouthern Hatay Province and found that the Turkish authorities had been\n“rounding up and expelling groups of around 100 Syrian men, women and children\nto Syria on a near-daily basis since mid-January.”Among the cases the group\nclaimed to have documented was that of three young children forced back to\nSyria without their parents.A Turkish government spokesman did not immediately\nrespond to messages seeking comment. Turkey has previously denied forcibly\nreturning refugees to Syria.Criticism of the impending deportations came\nagainst a backdrop of consternation over the lengths European leaders have\nbeen willing to go to keep migrants away — including offering billions in aid\nto Turkey to conclude the agreement, while ignoring an increasingly harsh\ncrackdown on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s opponents by the Turkish\nauthorities.“E.U. leaders have willfully ignored the simplest of facts: Turkey\nis not a safe country for Syrian refugees and is getting less safe by the\nday,” Amnesty’s director for Europe and Central Asia, John Dalhuisen, said in\nthe report.Greece’s Parliament nonetheless scrambled Friday to get a legal\nframework in place before Monday to carry out its end of the European Union\ndeal. In a hurried session, lawmakers were expected to support draft\nlegislation to allow returns to begin Monday, most likely from the Greek\nisland of Lesbos, where large numbers of Afghan and Pakistani migrants have\nbeen held since the bloc signed the accord with Turkey.More than 50,000 other\nmigrants, stuck on the Greek mainland, remain in limbo about their future, but\nare growing restless ahead of the scheduled deportation. On Wednesday, around\n300 migrants, mostly Afghans and Syrians, engaged in the several violent\nclashes in the Piraeus port, where many have been holed up since Macedonia and\nother northern countries closed their borders, cutting off Europe’s main\ngateway to Germany, the migrants’ preferred destination.In Idomeni, two people\nset themselves on fire earlier this week to protest the border closings after\nbeing stuck in the camp for nearly a month. Hundreds of migrants there have\njoined the protests, chanting “Open the border!” and refusing to take buses to\nofficial military-run camps, fearing deportation to Turkey.\n\n","title":"Amid Clashes, Greece Presses On With Plan to Deport Migrants - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Amid Clashes, Greece Presses On With Plan to Deport Migrants https://t.co/rqT98TLuPy","date":"Sat Apr 02 06:58:20 +0000 2016","favs":80,"id":{"$numberLong":"716157802432086016"},"retweets":65},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1N36HHN"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013fb"},"content":"Like many political junkies, I’ve been spending far too much time looking at\npolls and trying to understand their implications. Can Donald Trump really win\nhis party’s nomination? (Yes.) Can Bernie Sanders? (No.) But the primaries\naren’t the only things being polled; we’re still getting updates on President\nObama’s overall approval. And something striking has happened on that front.At\nthe end of 2015 Mr. Obama was still underwater, with significantly more\nAmericans disapproving than approving. Since then, however, his approval has\nrisen sharply while disapproval has plunged. He’s still only in modestly\npositive territory, but the net movement in polling averages has been about 11\npercentage points, which is a lot.What’s going on?Well, one answer is that\nvoters have lately been given a taste of what really bad leaders look like.\nBut I’d like to think that the public is also starting to realize just how\nsuccessful the Obama administration has been in addressing America’s problems.\nAnd there are lessons from that success for those willing to learn.I know that\nit’s hard for many people on both sides to wrap their minds around the notion\nof Obama-as-success. On the left, those caught up in the enthusiasms of 2008\nfeel let down by the prosaic reality of governing in a deeply polarized\npolitical system. Meanwhile, conservative ideology predicts disaster from any\nattempt to tax the rich, help the less fortunate and rein in the excesses of\nthe market; and what are you going to believe, the ideology or your own lying\neyes?But the successes are there for all to see.Start with the economy. You\nmight argue that presidents don’t have as much effect on economic performance\nas voters seem to imagine — especially presidents facing scorched-earth\nopposition from Congress for most of their time in office. But that misses the\npoint: Republicans have spent the past seven years claiming incessantly that\nMr. Obama’s policies are a “job killing” disaster, destroying business\nincentives, so it’s important news if the economy has performed well.And it\nhas: We’ve gained 10 million private-sector jobs since Mr. Obama took office,\nand unemployment is below 5 percent. True, there are still some areas of\ndisappointment — low labor force participation, weak wage growth. But just\nimagine the boasting we’d be hearing if Mitt Romney occupied the White\nHouse.Then there’s health reform, which has (don’t tell anyone) been meeting\nits goals.Back in 2012, just after the Supreme Court made it possible for\nstates to reject the Medicaid expansion, the Congressional Budget Office\npredicted that by now 89 percent of the nonelderly population would be\ncovered; the actual number is 90 percent.The details have been something of a\nsurprise: fewer people than expected signing up on the exchanges, but fewer\nemployers than expected dropping coverage, and more people signing up for\nMedicaid — which means, incidentally, that Obamacare is looking much more like\na single-payer system than anyone seems to realize. But the point is that\nreform has indeed delivered the big improvements in coverage it promised, and\nhas done so at lower cost than expected.Then there’s financial reform, which\nthe left considers toothless and the right considers destructive. In fact,\nwhile the big banks haven’t been broken up, excessive leverage — the real\nthreat to financial stability — has been greatly reduced. And as for the\neconomic effects, have I mentioned how well we’ve done on job creation?Last\nbut one hopes not least, the Obama administration has used executive authority\nto take steps on the environment that, if not canceled by a Republican\npresident and upheld by future Supreme Courts, will amount to very significant\naction on climate change.All in all, it’s quite a record. Assuming Democrats\nhold the presidency, Mr. Obama will emerge as a hugely consequential president\n— more than Reagan. And I’m sure Republicans will learn a lot from his\nachievements.April fools!Seriously, there is essentially no chance that\nconservatives, whose ideas haven’t changed in decades, will reconsider their\ndogma. But maybe progressives will be more open-minded.The 2008 election\ndidn’t bring the political transformation Obama enthusiasts expected, nor did\nit destroy the power of the vested interests: Wall Street, the medical-\nindustrial complex and the fossil fuel lobby are all still out there, using\ntheir money to buy influence. But they have been pushed back in ways that have\nmade American lives better and more secure.The lesson of the Obama years, in\nother words, is that success doesn’t have to be complete to be very real. You\nsay you want a revolution? Well, you can’t always get what you want — but if\nyou try sometimes, you just might find, you get what you need.\n\n","title":"Learning From Obama - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytopinion: .@PaulKrugman: Mr. Obama will emerge as a hugely consequential president — more than Reagan. https://t.co/RWWLwTiqfS","date":"Sat Apr 02 06:42:22 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716153784955744256"},"retweets":481},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PLOChq"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013fc"},"content":"PARIS — Inside an abandoned seven-floor, 70-room house near the Arc de\nTriomphe, more than 650 revelers in floor-length gowns, curly white wigs and\nfeathered masks gathered on a Friday night in January.A nearly nude woman with\na giant bouffant and flower-adorned underwear performed a sultry dance with\npink wings, while a contortionist spouted French obscenities. At the bottom of\na sweeping grand staircase, a four-piece band performed while couples\nwaltzed.For five years, a renegade group known as We Are the Oracle has been\nhosting such semi-secret parties in elusive sites throughout Paris, including\nthe catacombs, empty railway tracks and abandoned chateaus. And not always\nlegally.What began as a word-of-mouth soirée among the city’s elite\ninfluencers has evolved into seasonal theme parties that combine the mystique\nof “Eyes Wide Shut” with the energy of all-night raves and the theatrics of\n“Sleep No More.”When the invitation for the masquerade ball was unveiled last\nOctober, through a video that promised an epic party called “Venise Sous\nParis” (or “Venice Under Paris”), it created intense intrigue. “OK, get your\nplane ticket!” proclaimed Marina Smith of Nova Scotia, who shared the\ninvitation on Facebook.Over two weekends in January, 2,800 attendees from as\nfar away as Australia and the United States paid 61.50 euros (around $70) to\ndress like Venetian noblesse, sip Champagne and dance like Casanova until 2\na.m.The next event is called “The Soviet Factory,” and it is scheduled to take\nplace April 29 and 30 at a location that will be revealed a day before the\nparty. Some 2,000 guests are expected to adhere to a Communist-chic dress\ncode.The parties were dreamed up by Foulques Jubert, 29, a former business\nstudent who spent a year attending 24 festivals in 13 countries (including\nBurning Man in Nevada and Tomorrowland in Belgium) to learn how to bring\nsimilar spectacles to Paris.In 2011, he started a production agency, We Are\nthe Oracle (a.k.a. WATO), choosing the name for the mystique it connotes. An\nearly event took place in the catacombs of Paris, where Mr. Jubert and his\nteam held a 40-person candlelit dinner party 100 feet below the Place d’Italie\nin the 13th Arrondissement.“We had to walk for 30 minutes with chairs on our\nbacks,” Mr. Jubert said. “It was really commando, and we weren’t discreet at\nall. It was stupid, but it was our first.” (Stupid, because the police came\nand everyone had to hide, which, of course, contributed to the party’s\nhype.)Turns out, Parisians were looking for something beyond sipping Bordeaux\non a terrace or waiting in line at the nightclub Silencio. “You’re diving into\nanother world or another universe,” said Vincent de la Morandière, 40, a\nlawyer in Paris who has attended four of these events. “It’s a smart way to\nparty. A pub or a disco is very boring, and so is going to a show where you\nstay in your seat.”At We Are the Oracle parties, he added, “You are the\nshow.”The next party had a Cosa Nostra theme and took place at an abandoned\nfarmhouse in the 11th Arrondissement. This time, town hall came knocking, but\ninstead of shutting it down, town officials were eager to collaborate,\noffering Mr. Jubert after-hours access to city museums, swimming pools and\nother locations.Our goal “is to have an interesting offer in night life, not\njust restaurants and clubs, but atypical night life,” said Frédéric Hocquart,\na special counselor for the Town Hall of Paris. “It will make Paris more\nattractive to Parisians, but also abroad. This is why we support\nWATO.”Subsequent parties became less covert but evolved into larger affairs\nwith dress codes, themes and entertainment. In 2014, Mr. Jubert turned the\nEspace Glisse skate park in the 18th Arrondissement into a desert oasis with\n60 tons of sand. An orchestra played the theme from “Lawrence of Arabia” as\n3,500 guests smoked hookahs, rode camels and received henna tattoos.As the\nparties’ reputation grew, so did the pressure to raise the level of\nextravagance. “Venise Sous Paris,” for example, took a year to plan and cost\nmore than a million euros to produce.That party was supposed to take place at\nthe Richard Lenoir vaults, the water-filled tunnels under the Place de la\nBastille between the fourth and 12th Arrondissements. But three weeks after it\nwas announced last October, the city was struck by terrorism. The police\nthought that the canals were too dangerous, so Mr. Jubert looked for a new\nsetting.“Canceling was an awful option,” Mr. Jubert said. “We needed a venue\nthat was attractive, exclusive and never used. Somewhere we could maintain our\ntheatrical plans.”After an extended search, his group settled on a house that\nonce belonged to Calouste Gulbenkian, a British businessman who died in 1955.\nWhile guests were no longer “under Paris,” the concept was still a Venetian\nmasquerade.“I’d never been to Paris, and this seemed like the perfect excuse\nto come out for it,” said Phil Warren, 32, a research engineer who traveled\nfrom California and wore a black cape and mask with LED lights for that party.\n“I’ll pretty much do anything if it’s weird enough.”\n\n","title":"Partying Underground in Paris’s Secret Corners - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Partying Underground in Paris’s Secret Corners https://t.co/LpHfGeCaEc","date":"Sat Apr 02 06:31:23 +0000 2016","favs":217,"id":{"$numberLong":"716151022750724096"},"retweets":79},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22Xu2aG"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013fd"},"content":"In their last conversation, Jeffrey Pendleton told his father that he was\ndoing well, living in New Hampshire with a woman and working at a Burger King\nrestaurant.About four months later, a different story unfolded. Mr. Pendleton\nwas homeless, and on March 13 he was found dead in a jail cell in Manchester,\nwhere he was being held for a misdemeanor because he could not pay the $100\nbail.“The police told me to talk to the detective in New Hampshire,” Mr.\nPendleton’s father, Joseph, said Friday from his home in Palestine, Ark. “He\nsaid they did a cell check, and found him unconscious. Then two hours later he\nwas dead.”His family buried him last week in Palestine, but the authorities\nare still investigating how the 26-year old black man who had no known health\nproblems died so suddenly.“They said they did not find anything wrong with the\nbody, that he shouldn’t have been dead,” the elder Mr. Pendleton said he was\ntold by the coroner. “What they found was a healthy 26-year old man.”Jennie V.\nDuval, the deputy chief medical examiner working on his case, said Mr.\nPendleton’s autopsy was inconclusive and the official cause of death was\nawaiting the toxicology report, with blood test results not expected for four\nweeks.“There was no naked eye evidence of trauma or disease,” Ms. Duval said.\n“We definitely ruled out foul play.”Mr. Pendleton’s death has drawn attention\nto New Hampshire’s practice of putting in jail people who cannot make bail,\noften on misdemeanor charges. As The New York Times has reported in a series\nof reports, specialists say the money-based bail system in the United States\nroutinely means that poor defendants are punished before they get their day in\ncourt, often keeping them incarcerated longer than if they had been convicted\nright away.Last month, the Justice Department sent a letter asking state chief\njustices and court administrators around the country to change their practices\non fines and fees. The aim, it said, was to avoid the harm that falls on\npeople who are unable to pay, and who “lose their jobs and become trapped in\ncycles of poverty that can be nearly impossible to escape.”The department\nurged the courts to consider alternatives to jail for defendants unable to pay\nfines and fees.“Bail that is set without regard to defendants’ financial\ncapacity can result in the incarceration of individuals not because they pose\na threat to public safety or a flight risk, but rather because they cannot\nafford the assigned bail amount,” the letter said.Mr. Pendleton was arrested\non March 8 at about 10 p.m. at a house in Nashua, where the police were sent\nto help probation and parole officers. Officers discovered two warrants for\nMr. Pendleton’s arrest for nonpayment of fines: one for disorderly conduct and\nthe other for a city ordinance violation, said Capt. Eric Nordengren of the\nNashua police.Mr. Pendleton was taken to the Nashua police station, where they\nfound a small quantity of marijuana, and then to the county jail in\nManchester, Captain Nordengren said. In a preliminary appearance in Nashua\nDistrict Court, his bail was set at $100, which he was unable to pay.Then on\nMarch 13, Mr. Pendleton was found unconscious in his cell at 2:45 p.m. and\ncould not be revived; he was pronounced dead at 3:19 p.m., the jail said in a\nstatement. “There appeared no indication that Mr. Pendleton was in any form of\ndistress,” David Dionne, the jail superintendent, said in a report by The\nUnion Leader.A court document said that Mr. Pendleton was to have been held on\nthe “act prohibited” misdemeanor charge until a hearing on April 7.“That’s\napproximately one month,” said Gilles Bissonnette, a director for the American\nCivil Liberties Union of New Hampshire who had provided Mr. Pendleton with\nlegal support. “At that point, he would have effectively served his sentence\nbefore he ever had an opportunity to contest the charge — an outcome that only\na poor person would be confronted with.”Mr. Pendleton’s ordeal also garnered\nsome attention because he had previously won settlements worth thousands of\ndollars against two New Hampshire cities for run-ins with the police.The City\nof Nashua agreed to pay $15,000 to settle a civil claim by the A.C.L.U. and\nMr. Pendleton after he was arrested in 2014 for walking in a public park,\naccording to a copy of the settlement provided by Mr. Bissonnette. About\n$10,315 went to Mr. Pendleton and the rest to the A.C.L.U. in New\nHampshire.The following year, the City of Hudson agreed to pay $37,500 to\nsettle a lawsuit filed by the A.C.L.U. for Mr. Pendleton that said the police\nissued him a summons for panhandling, which they said was illegal. Mr.\nPendleton was allotted about $7,000 of that money.According to the Hudson\nlawsuit, Mr. Pendleton arrived in the Nashua area in 2009 and worked in low-\nwage jobs at fast-food restaurants. He had been homeless since a divorce in\n2013, then lost his job and started sleeping in the woods.Mr. Bissonnette said\nhis office did not have significant contact with Mr. Pendleton after the cases\nwere resolved with settlements. Asked why Mr. Pendleton was unable to pay the\n$100 bail last month, he said, “I don’t know that answer.”\n\n","title":"Unable to Pay $100 Bail, Homeless Man Dies in New Hampshire Jail - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"A homeless man being held because he couldn't pay a $100 bail was found dead in his jail cell https://t.co/zilGrpdQMn","date":"Sat Apr 02 06:24:23 +0000 2016","favs":270,"id":{"$numberLong":"716149259469455360"},"retweets":420},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VhXbr7"}

He says the giant yellow rubber duck that\nprotesters have hauled into the streets as a makeshift mascot in the past\nmonth is too similar to his own creation.The duck used in the demonstrations\nhas X’s in place of its eyes and a Portuguese slogan across its chest that\nsays: “We won’t pay for what is not our fault anymore.” But representatives\nfor the Dutch artist, Florentijn Hofman, who is known for his outsize\ncreations depicting animals, say they saw too many similarities between his\nrubber duck and the one used in Brazil — and they are not amused.Mr. Hofman’s\nsix-story-tall version of the bathtub toy appeared  in a harbor in Hong Kong\nas part of an art festival in 2013. A Brazilian industrial group, FIESP, used\na similar rubber duck in the demonstrations, and Mr. Hofman’s representatives\nsay that it featured the same design and technical patterns of the previous\nwork and that it’s just odd that the protest duck was produced in the same\nfactory where Mr. Hofman’s art duck was created.A spokeswoman for Mr. Hofman,\nKim Engbers, said in an email: “Of course we want to emphasize that it is a\nshame that this parody is used for propaganda. Our project is meant to be\nnonpolitical.”She added: “It is a positive work and has healing functions.”Ms.\nEngbers, however, stopped short of calling the Brazilians’ use of the rubber\nduck a copyright infringement.The owner of the factory that produced the duck\nsaid the design had not been copied, and a spokesman for FIESP said the group\nhad been assured that the design was an original, the BBC reported.This is the\nnot the first time Mr. Hofman has raised concerns about what he considers an\nunauthorized appearance of a duck similar to his.“To me, the rubber duck is an\nicon,” Mr. Hofman has said.In July, he complained about a duck that appeared\nbriefly on the Delaware River at the Tall Ships Philadelphia festival. Event\norganizers disputed the claim that the duck was one of his.He also created an\n82-foot-tall bunny that was featured at a festival in Taiwan in 2014. As it\nwas being disassembled, it accidentally caught fire; its head and legs were\ndestroyed, leaving behind a charred torso, an ear and an arm.\n\n","title":"Artist Says Brazilian Protesters Copied His Giant Rubber Duck - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesworld: Dutch artist, not amused, says Brazilian protesters copied his giant, apolitical rubber duck https://t.co/WO36FiwRMp http…","date":"Sat Apr 02 06:01:03 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716143387741696001"},"retweets":141},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1MIgckR"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f013ff"},"content":"IS it possible to extract blood from people without causing pain? For decades,\nthis problem has stumped the medical industry. In an effort to replace the\nold-fashioned needle, companies are trying to deploy laser beams and tiny\nvacuums to draw blood.In 2014, an engineer at Harvard named Ridhi Tariyal hit\non a far simpler workaround. “I was trying to develop a way for women to\nmonitor their own fertility at home,” she told me, and “those kinds of\ndiagnostic tests require a lot of blood. So I was thinking about women and\nblood. When you put those words together, it becomes obvious. We have an\nopportunity every single month to collect blood from women, without\nneedles.”Together with her business partner, Stephen Gire, she has patented a\nmethod for capturing menstrual flow and transforming it into medical samples.\n“There’s lots of information in there,” Ms. Tariyal said, “but right now, it’s\nall going in the trash.”Why did Ms. Tariyal see a possibility that had eluded\nso many engineers before her? You might say she has an unfair advantage: her\ngender.Because she lives in a female body, she had experiences that just\nwouldn’t be available to her male colleagues. She doesn’t have to imagine\nusing her device, because she herself has been able to beta-test it.Early on,\nshe and Mr. Gire had thought about putting diagnostic chips inside tampons to\ngive women real-time updates about their health. But Ms. Tariyal quickly\nrealized that the “smart tampon,” outfitted with chips and transmitters, gave\nher the heebie-jeebies — it sounded like a torture device from a David\nCronenberg film — and customers would no doubt feel the same way. That’s why\nshe decided that all medical testing must take place outside the body, an\ninsight that shaped the way that she and Mr. Gire designed their product.Eric\nvon Hippel, a scholar of innovation at M.I.T., has spent decades studying what\nseems like a truism: People who suffer from a problem are uniquely equipped to\nsolve it. “What we find is that functionally novel innovations — those for\nwhich a market is not yet defined — tend to come from users,” he said. He\npointed out that young Californians pioneered skateboards so that they could\n“surf” the streets. And surgeons built the first heart-and-lung machines to\nkeep patients alive during long operations. “The reason users are so inventive\nis twofold. One is that they know the needs firsthand,” he said. The other is\nthat they have skin in the game.Dr. von Hippel’s principle certainly applies\nto menstruation. Since ancient times, women have tinkered with pads, tampons\nand pain cures. In Egypt in the 15th century B.C., women found creative uses\nfor papyrus, while their counterparts elsewhere in Africa and in Asia\nexperimented with absorbent moss. Centuries later, the nurses of World War I\nrepurposed cellulose bandages.In the 1920s, Lillian Gilbreth, a visionary of\nindustrial psychology and one of the first female engineers with a Ph.D. in\nthe United States, decided to reinvent the sanitary pad once again. (Gilbreth,\nthe mother of 12 children, was later made famous by the book “Cheaper by the\nDozen._”_) While working for Johnson \u0026amp; Johnson, she recognized that the\nbest ideas would come from women themselves, so she questioned more than a\nthousand women about their frustrations with menstrual products and asked them\nto describe their ideal pad.She also gathered lists of women’s hacks and\nalterations to the off-the-shelf sanitary pads; for instance, one Smith\nCollege student imagined a discreet pad called the Invisos for a Jazz Age\nflapper who planned to dance in a clingy dress. Companies had been\nmanufacturing diaper-like products with names like the Flush Down Ideal and\nthe S.S. Napkin. Gilbreth’s research showed that women had been altering the\npads to fit their own bodies and that they were embarrassed by the names.\nJohnson \u0026amp; Johnson used these insights as the inspiration for new product\nlines.But Gilbreth’s quest to understand female customers seems to have been\nthe exception rather than the rule at companies. According to the authors of\nthe 2012 book “Serial Innovators,” one inventor at Procter \u0026amp; Gamble\nrecalled that even in the 1980s his bosses didn’t seem to know or care that\nwomen hated the brick-like sanitary pads the company produced.Recently, I’ve\nbeen digging through 200 patents, granted since 1976, related to tampons; I’ve\nfound that three out of every four of the inventors behind those patents were\nmen. Clearly men have exerted an enormous amount of control over the look and\nfeel of menstrual products.Ms. Tariyal points out that there are many\nunexplored possibilities in women’s-health technology because for so long,\nwomen have not had the power to push forward their ideas. And this problem\nisn’t just restricted to women’s health.Annette Kahler, an intellectual\nproperty lawyer and scholar, wrote a 2011 paper about the gender gap in\npatents and its effects on the world of technology. “Opportunities are being\nmissed,” she contended, “because the ideas, inventions, perspectives and\nproposed solutions of women are missed.”Consider the story of Sybilla Masters,\noften identified as the first female inventor in America. After she engineered\na corn-grinding machine in the early 1700s, Masters left her home in the\ncolony of Pennsylvania and sailed to London, hoping to procure a British\npatent. But the laws of that time prevented married women from owning\nproperty, and so she had to file her claim under her husband’s name. Thomas\nMasters received the patent on “a new invention found out by Sybilla, his\nwife.” The contents of her mind belonged to him.Female inventors still face\nbarriers to patenting. According to a 2012 study, more than 92 percent of\npatent holders are men. And a 2006 study found that female academics in the\nlife sciences — Ms. Tariyal’s field — were filing about 60 percent fewer\npatents than their male colleagues.“Men had more helpful social networks for\ngetting ideas and commercial activities off the ground,” said Toby Stuart, a\nprofessor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California,\nBerkeley, who was an author of the study. “A prominent male faculty member may\nmake noise at a university’s technology-transfer office if he doesn’t get what\nhe wants, and he also has relationships outside the university and he’s more\nlikely to know venture capitalists.” Meanwhile, “a female professor doesn’t\ntend to know as many people in industry.”Ridhi Tariyal didn’t have that\nproblem. In 2013, as a life-sciences entrepreneurship fellow at Harvard\nBusiness School, she was expected to produce inventions. “The fellowship came\nwith an extensive network,” she said. A chemistry professor invited her to\nwork in his lab, and experts from Harvard’s technology-transfer office helped\nher refine her idea.“Harvard even paid for our patent attorneys,” she said.\n“So obviously, my experience was an exception.”And yet, even with all of these\nadvantages, Ms. Tariyal and Mr. Gire discovered how hard it can be to raise\nmoney for a women’s-health technology. They spent a year meeting with funders,\nshowing off a 3D-printed prototype that extracts liquid from a tampon.The\nmethod holds great promise for the home-diagnostics industry; it is simple\nenough for a woman to use in her own bathroom. Initially, Ms. Tariyal and Mr.\nGire envisioned their customer as a young woman who wanted to monitor herself\nfor common infections like chlamydia. Though tests for sexually transmitted\ninfections are now available free in clinics, “nobody wants to be standing in\nline” to ask for a chlamydia test, according to Ms. Tariyal. ”You know what\nbeats a free test? Privacy beats free,” she said. “Women want to test\nthemselves at home. And you can charge a premium for that privacy. So we were\ntrying to push that angle.”But it turns out that “when you say that you’re\ngoing to build a company around menstrual blood, people think you’re joking,”\nMr. Gire lamented.They attempted to sanitize their demo — for instance, they\nused blue-tinted water in place of blood. But there’s really no way around the\ngross-out factor of a wet tampon. Meetings with potential funders were “very\ndisheartening,” Ms. Tariyal said.A recent study conducted by scholars from\nBabson College revealed that more than 90 percent of the partners in venture-\ncapital firms are male. So Ms. Tariyal and Mr. Gire often sat across the table\nfrom a man, trying to sell him on a tampon machine.“Someone told us that the\nproduct would only help women, and women are only half the population — so\nwhat was the point?” Ms. Tariyal said. Other potential funders wanted to\nreimagine their technology as a product for men: Was there some way to re-\nengineer it so that it would measure testosterone? And one guy suggested they\ndevelop a machine that a man could use to covertly test the health of his\nsexual partners, because “women are liars” who spread venereal diseases.By the\nsummer of 2015, Ms. Tariyal and Mr. Gire began to despair. “After we had an\nespecially tough week, Stephen and I decided that we had to find a way to make\nthis more palatable to investors,” Ms. Tariyal said. “And then we had an aha!\nmoment,” Mr. Gire added.Menstrual flow contains more than just blood; it is\nalso rich with cells shed by the ovaries and uterus. Those cells, paired with\ngenomics tools, might open up a window on women’s bodies and give early\nwarning of cancer and reproductive diseases. “Stephen and I were looking to\nreplace traditional blood tests, and we ended up stumbling across something\nfar better,” Ms. Tariyal said.Their new vision resonated with executives at\nIllumina, a company that makes gene-sequencing equipment. The company\ncontributed lab space and technical assistance. Now Ms. Tariyal and Mr. Gire\nare experimenting with a new diagnostic test for endometriosis, a painful\ndisease caused by uterine tissue that grows in the wrong places. Women drop\noff tampons that can be mined for uterine cells; the cells are then scanned\nfor genomic changes that are associated with disease.The gold standard for\ndiagnosis of endometriosis is laparoscopic surgery, and many women suffer for\nyears before deciding to undergo it. A tampon test, if it worked, could\nprovide a much easier way to find endometriosis in its early stages.They also\ndiscovered that their new idea appealed to a certain kind of funder.“Our first\nbig check came from Len Blavatnik,” the Ukrainian-American billionaire and\nphilanthropist, Ms. Tariyal said. Mr. Blavatnik then asked an adviser named\nPatricia Benet to follow their start-up, now called NextGen Jane, because he\nwanted a female perspective on it — and that led to an even bigger check. The\nstart-up also received financing from Pardis Sabeti, one of the world’s\nleading researchers in evolutionary genomics; she runs the Harvard lab that\ntracked mutations in the Ebola virus during the 2014 outbreak.The role of\nwomen in this story suggests that female networks can transform the way we\ndevelop technology.Ms. Tariyal told me she chose her field because she’s drawn\nto science’s audacious sci-fi aspirations. “I want a hyperloop! I want to live\non Mars!” she said, speaking admiringly of male inventors like Elon Musk.At\nthe same time, she is troubled that “a small coterie of people are determining\nwhat our future looks like.” If our inventors and funders are homogeneous, Ms.\nTariyal pointed out, then “our future is going to look homogeneous.”\n\n","title":"The Tampon of the Future - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"\"Men have exerted an enormous amount of control over the look and feel of menstrual products.\" https://t.co/QBiyobxQJS via @nytopinion","date":"Sat Apr 02 05:45:16 +0000 2016","favs":299,"id":{"$numberLong":"716139416381730816"},"retweets":196},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SGPKY2"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01400"},"content":"HARIDWAR, India — Sitting on an orange sofa set over a Persian carpet, in a\ngated office park of freshly painted tan buildings and manicured lawns, Baba\nRamdev is surrounded by the trappings of any major corporate leader almost\nanywhere in the world.But Mr. Ramdev is also an Indian swami, having renounced\nall worldly pleasures and possessions, and he sits cross-legged on the couch,\nhis face fringed by an untamed beard, his body draped in the saffron cloth of\na Hindu holy man.Famous for bringing yoga to the Indian masses, Mr. Ramdev,\n50, is also the leader of what has become known as the “Baba Cool Movement” —\na group of spiritual men, known here as “babas,” who are marketing healthy\nconsumer items based on the ancient Indian medicinal system of herbal\ntreatments, known as Ayurveda. His rapidly expanding business empire of\npackaged food, cosmetics and home-care products is eating into the sales of\nboth multinational and Indian corporations.The babas’ message about the value\nof traditional Indian ingredients is particularly resonant in the current\nenvironment in India, where a prime minister and his political party have\nbuilt a narrative around the value of ancient Hindu practices, from yoga to\nreverence for cows. Mr. Ramdev is the most prominent of a growing group of\nbrand-building babas, whose ranks include Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, the founder of\nthe Art of Living, an Indian spiritual practice, who promotes a line of\ncreams, soaps and shampoos also called Ayurveda.“There is truly a tectonic\nshift” in the consumer products business in India, said Harish Bijoor, a brand\nstrategy specialist and former head of marketing at a subsidiary of the big\nIndian conglomerate Tata Group.Mr. Ramdev and his friend and business partner,\nAcharya Balakrishna, 44, run Patanjali Ayurved Limited from a corporate\nheadquarters in Haridwar, an ancient Indian city on the banks of the Ganges\nRiver in Uttarakhand State. In an interview, Mr. Ramdev said he was the\ncreative force and public face of Patanjali, even though, as a swami, he does\nnot have an official title or hold any shares of the privately held\ncompany.Rising at 3:30 a.m. each day to drink the juice of the amla fruit, an\nIndian berry rich in vitamin C and considered the top immunity booster in\nAyurveda medicine, he unleashes a torrent of new product ideas — an herbal\nenergy bar, an herbal hair dye, a sugar-free immune booster — that he records\nin large Hindi script in a spiral bound notebook. Then he plunges into three\nhours of yoga, followed by a 12-hour day that is split between Patanjali\nbusiness and the public meetings of a spiritual and political leader.Mr.\nBalakrishna, as the managing director, runs day-to-day operations. “Without\nhim, nothing would be possible,” Mr. Ramdev said of his partner, who paced in\nthe office as the interview with the loquacious swami spilled over its one-\nhour allotment.The two men met in the 1990s, when they studied at the same\ngurukul, a residential school that was the norm for Indian Hindus before the\nBritish arrived. Both the sons of farmers, they went on together to study in\nthe Himalayas, Mr. Ramdev focusing on yoga and Mr. Balakrishna on Ayurveda.In\n1994, they founded the first of three charitable trusts, to run a hospital and\na university dealing in Ayurvedic medicine, and an ashram. There, they held\nyoga camps and free health checkups at which they dispensed Ayurveda\ntreatments, which are largely herbal. Before long, they had set up a\nmanufacturing plant for Ayurveda products.Around the same time, Mr. Ramdev\nbegan his televised yoga classes. Lean and muscular,** **Mr. Ramdev proved to\nbe a telegenic tour de force, bringing yoga to India’s poor and the growing\nmiddle class.He gradually ventured beyond yoga to become a public critic of\ngovernment corruption, leading a mass protest in New Delhi in 2011 and later\nendorsing Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the election in 2014.Mr. Modi\nand his Bharatiya Janata Party swept to power soon after, unleashing a strong\nHindu nationalist sentiment that Mr. Ramdev says has created “an ideal\necosystem” to support his business. Mr. Modi pushed the United Nations to\ncreate International Yoga Day, and he inaugurated it last year, with Mr.\nRamdev by his side, in a nationally televised ceremony involving 35,000\npeople.Few people noticed when Mr. Ramdev and Mr. Balakrishna founded\nPatanjali in 2006, and then, in 2009, began building factories on a 150-acre\ncampus about 20 miles from Haridwar.Patanjali now has 28 factories at the\ncampus that make more than 800 products that are sold at around 20,000\nfranchised outlets around the country, company officials said. Twenty-five\ntechnicians in a dozen glass-walled labs use computers to test ingredients for\ncontaminants, from pesticides to heavy metals.Mr. Ramdev, given to raucous\nlaughter and bouts of giggles that make him seem disarmingly humble, can just\nas suddenly overflow with bravado, as he did when asked about the source of\nPatanjali’s popularity and power.“People buy our products because they believe\nI will only sell them good things,” he said.Beyond Mr. Ramdev’s appeal,\nPatanjali products are attractive because they are high quality and prices are\nabout 20 percent lower than the competition, analysts said.It is not clear how\nPatanjali is able to charge such low prices, given that its profit margin of\n13 percent is within the industry range of 13 to 16 percent. Mr. Ramdev\nventured that, with his fame, his advertising costs are much lower than his\ncompetitors’, who spend as much as 15 percent of their revenue promoting their\nproducts.The faces of Mr. Ramdev and Mr. Balakrishna adorn most every\nbuilding, billboard and truck connected to the company, which is expanding so\nfast it is striking fear into its current and potential competitors. The\ncompany expects to report revenue of $750 million in the fiscal year that\nended in March, more than double the previous year’s $300 million, the two men\nsaid.Credit-Suisse Securities, in a report early this year, said Patanjali’s\n“meteoric rise” had hurt Colgate-Palmolive (India) Ltd., which is majority\nowned by the United States-based Colgate-Palmolive. Sales of Colgate’s\ntoothpastes slowed from growing at about 10 percent annually to just 1 percent\nin the quarter ending in December, in the face of competition from Patanjali,\nRohit Kadam, the analyst who wrote the report, said in an interview.The report\nsaid sales of health supplements at Dabur India Ltd., one of the country’s\nlargest consumer goods companies, had been growing at close to 20 percent\nannually but began falling at the end of last year, hurt by competition from\nPatanjali.In the face of that threat, Patanjali’s competitors “are working on\noverdrive to create similar types of product options,” Mr. Bijoor, the brand\nstrategist, said.Colgate has introduced toothpastes containing the extract of\nneem, an Indian tree, and charcoal, both still used by villagers to clean\ntheir teeth. Spokesmen for Colgate and Dabur did not respond to requests for\ncomment.Experts say that, for the foreseeable future, the only danger signs\nfor Patanjali are the enthusiasms of its founder, Mr. Ramdev.If he takes it “a\nbit too far, he’ll lose new customers,” said Sunil Alagh, a business\nconsultant and formerly chief executive of Britannia Industries Ltd., an\nIndian company famous for packaged cookies.In the past, Mr. Ramdev has dived\ninto controversial conservative causes without hesitation. Last year, for\nexample, he claimed that he could cure homosexuality by treating a person with\nyoga.Mr. Ramdev was also outspoken in his condemnation of a student at a New\nDelhi university who faced sedition charges after the authorities accused him\nof participating in a pro-Pakistan campus rally. “The traitors,” Mr. Ramdev\nsaid, “must be arrested.”Controversy aside, Mr. Bijoor has predicted that the\n“Baba Cool Movement” will eventually outsell both multinationals and top\nIndian companies alike.“It’s about a good connect,” he said. “It’s about\nbecoming the umbilical cord connecting the past to the present.”\n\n","title":"A Yoga Master, the King of ‘Baba Cool,’ Stretches Out an Empire - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesworld: Indian yoga master's health-products empire is based on ancient system of herbal treatments https://t.co/ScpLX9NlqY https…","date":"Sat Apr 02 05:32:04 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716136093167579136"},"retweets":138},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1TpBIw8"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01401"},"content":"A big law firm’s novel lawsuit filed on behalf of a woman who says she was a\nvictim of revenge pornography may be complicated by a decision in a related\ncriminal case.Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles decided last month to drop a\ntwo-year-old criminal case against the woman’s former boyfriend accusing him\nof posting sexually explicit images of her online.The prosecutors asked a\nfederal judge to dismiss the indictment charging David K. Elam II with\nstalking, aggravated identity theft and unauthorized access to the computer of\nthe woman, whom he had met through an online dating service. On March 21,\nJudge Manuel L. Real of Federal District Court for the Central District of\nCalifornia granted the order and dismissed the case against Mr. Elam.The end\nof the criminal case against Mr. Elam, 30, could pose a quandary for lawyers\nfrom the law firm K\u0026amp;L Gates’s Cyber Civil Rights Legal Project, which has\nbeen providing legal representation to the woman and others who are say they\nare victims of “revenge porn” — a type of online harassment that occurs when\nformer lovers or hackers post sexually explicit images of people online\nwithout their permission.A civil case brought on behalf of the woman,\nidentified in court papers as Jane Doe to protect her privacy, was filed by\nthe K\u0026amp;L Gates clinical program a few months after the criminal charges\nwere filed against Mr. Elam in 2014.David Bateman, a partner at K\u0026amp;L Gates,\nwhich is based in Pittsburgh and has offices around the world, said the firm\nhad no plans to drop the lawsuit against Mr. Elam. The suit seeks money\ndamages, asserting that he infringed on the woman’s right to keep the sexually\nexplicit videos private under federal copyright law.He also said that the firm\nhad no second thoughts about taking the woman’s case — which was one of the\nfirst civil lawsuits filed by the program.“We are not able to comment on any\ndecision by federal prosecutors,” Mr. Bateman said in an emailed response.\n“However, our civil case will proceed.”The woman was a law student in\nCalifornia at the time of the incident. Authorities contend Mr. Elam began to\nharass her after they broke up.A representative for Eileen M. Decker, the\nUnited States attorney in Los Angeles, offered no explanation for dropping the\ncase except to say that the office had decided it could not meet its burden of\nproof at trial.Federal authorities began their investigation into Mr. Elam in\n2013. Just two months ago, federal prosecutors notified the court that they\nintended to introduce evidence at trial that in 2012, Mr. Elam harassed and\nstalked another former girlfriend online.Lawyers for Mr. Elam did not return\nrequests for comment.In recent years, federal prosecutors in Los Angeles have\nearned a reputation for being particularly aggressive in pursuing cases\nagainst both former boyfriends and hackers selling unauthorized sexually\nexplicit videos to websites. One notable case was the successful prosecution\nof Hunter Moore, who ran a now-defunct website that specialized in posting\nrevenge porn videos that were stolen from people’s computers and posted\nwithout their permission.The decision to drop the charges against Mr. Elam may\nillustrate the difficulties in pursuing such cases because they require a jury\nnot to hold the victim partly responsible for creating the sexually explicit\nimages in the first place and either sharing them with a former partner or\nstoring them on a cellphone.The woman, who was identified in the criminal case\nonly by the initials N.A., would have had to testify at trial using her own\nname.While prosecutors may have faced hurdles in a criminal trial, a lawsuit\nhas a lower burden of proof.This year, a federal appeals court upheld a stay\nof the civil suit pending the outcome of the criminal case. Now that the\ncriminal case is over, the stay will probably be lifted.\n\n","title":"In ‘Revenge Porn’ Case, Criminal Court Decision May Affect Lawsuit - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"In \"revenge porn\" case, criminal court decision may affect lawsuit https://t.co/HPCw02rUiY","date":"Sat Apr 02 05:01:06 +0000 2016","favs":101,"id":{"$numberLong":"716128298942726144"},"retweets":63},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VZQKcV"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01402"},"content":"SLAY-Z  \nBrazenness is the brand for Azealia Banks, whose work as a nimble, genre-\nslippery New York rapper can sometimes fall subordinate to her gift as a\nbutton-pushing provocateur. She appears topless in the cover image for\n“Slay-Z,” her new mixtape, looking shrewdly bemused. Her outrageous self-\npossession plays out more vibrantly on some of these tracks, like “Big Talk,”\nwhich puts her up against the rapper Rick Ross, and “Riot,” which has a\nklaxon-like hook handled by Nina Sky. There’s no end to Ms. Banks’s swagger,\nthough her toughest moments veer toward the style of a hometown rival, Nicki\nMinaj. Where no one can really surpass her is in the convergence of raw hip-\nhop and electronic dance music: on “The Big Big Beat” and “Used to Being\nAlone,” with two potent variations on house rhythm, and “Queen of Clubs,”\nfeaturing a soulfully bratty vocal against an escalating clamor. “Every time I\nstep in the club, it’s a problem, it’s crazy,” Ms. Banks sings, exaggerating\nwildly but selling the idea.LAND OF GOLD  \nThe title track of Anoushka Shankar’s new album, “Land of Gold” (Deutsche\nGrammophon/Universal Music Classics), begins with a tendril of melody that she\nsoftly plays on her sitar. A female voice emerges, singing what sounds like a\nCeltic lullaby. The singer is Alev Lenz, of mixed German and Turkish heritage,\nand that detail feels meaningful in context: This is an album made in response\nto the humanitarian refugee crisis, implicitly concerned with the crossing of\ncultures and borders. The theme plays out both in Ms. Shankar’s song titles\n(“Dissolving Boundaries,” “Boat to Nowhere”) and in her sensitive rapport with\npartners like Manu Delago, playing the Hang, a resonant metallic idiophone;\nSanjeev Shankar, on the plaintive Indian reed instrument called a shehnai; and\nher husband, the film director Joe Wright, who helped produce the album,\ngiving it a sort of narrative pull. Sanctimony generally takes a back seat to\nempathy in Ms. Shankar’s approach, even on a track featuring the chopped-up\nvocal patter of M.I.A. and the faintly transgressive title “Jump In (Cross the\nLine).”  \nCRISS CROSS  \nThe parenthetical subtitle of “Criss Cross” (Enja), an effervescent new trio\nalbum by the pianist Florian Weber, is “(exploring the music of Monk and Bill\nEvans).” That sounds like a routine assignment — an album of small-scale jazz\nrepertory, with Thelonious Monk as one guidepost and Bill Evans as another —\nbut not the way Mr. Weber goes about it. He enlisted the tenor saxophonist\nDonny McCaslin and the drummer Dan Weiss but opted for no bassist, arranging\nthe music with an ear for tricky, changeable flow. As an improviser, he has\nfluidity and poise but sometimes a bit more head than heart, which makes his\nchoice of partners especially astute. Mr. Weiss brings aerodynamic drive to\neven the most lurching syncopation, while Mr. McCaslin brilliantly covers a\nrange of feeling, from a tender murmur to a rattling howl. At times, often on\nthe ballads, Mr. Weber pares down to a duo, but there’s a special energy to\nthe trio, even on a track that technically falls outside the album’s scope:\nLady Gaga’s “Judas,” remade as a postbop fantasia.  \nLOVERS AND LEAVERS  \nInteriority has often been an unstable element in the music of Hayes Carll. A\nwry Texas troubadour with a knack for crooked grace and a clever turn of\nphrase, he isn’t really known as the confessional type. But his fifth album,\n“Lovers and Leavers” (Thirty Tigers), due out on Friday, April 8, is full of\ntunes that feel cracked wide open: earnest, self-reflective, unguarded. Mr.\nCarll’s recent divorce obviously informed some of these, like “The Love That\nWe Need,” a song of resignation and regret written with Allison Moorer and\nJack Ingram. Mr. Carll also sings with disarming sincerity about fatherhood\n(“The Magic Kid”), friendship (“My Friends”) and infatuation (“Love Is So\nEasy”), accompanied mainly by his own fingerpicked acoustic guitar. (The album\nwas produced by Joe Henry, in a typically spare, tamped-down style.) And a\nminor-key prowl called “Sake of the Song” turns out to be a love letter to his\ntrade. “Tell your truth, however you choose,” he implores, “And do it all for\nthe sake of the song.”  \n\n","title":"New Albums From Azealia Banks and Anoushka Shankar - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesarts: On Azealia Banks's new mixtape \"Slay-Z\" there is no end to the New York rapper's swagger https://t.co/FQfPJ5LWla https://t…","date":"Sat Apr 02 04:46:06 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716124524442435584"},"retweets":117},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1ToeDKw"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01403"},"content":"A chocolate babka has charms that aren’t always apparent from its dowdy\nexterior.Beneath the bumpy streusel and sunken crust lies a soft yeast-risen\ncake, buttery as brioche, shot through with sticky, fudgy veins of chocolate,\nand drenched in enough sugar syrup to render it moist, tender and just the\nslightest bit sticky.It’s a cake as sexy on the inside as it is modest on the\noutside.New York pastry chefs and home cooks are riffing on this traditional\nEastern European loaf to make it their own.There’s the chocolate-cookie\nstudded babka at Sadelle’s, Breads Bakery’s nutella loaf, Bklyn Larder’s\nganache-filled version. Baz Bagel, running even further with the trend, bakes\ntheir babka into bread pudding.Then there’s the chocolate krantz cake from\n“Jerusalem,” the cookbook by Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi, which has\ncaused a minor sensation on baking sites, spawning variations including one\nfilled with chocolate and raspberry jam, another soaked in honey syrup.Before\nall the current hoopla, babka was just a nice Jewish cake from the old country\nwith barely any recognition beyond the lox-loving set. Arguably too rich for\nbreakfast and too bready for dessert, a babka is there to be noshed on all day\nlong — with coffee, with tea, with seltzer and lemon, or by itself after the\nlast bagel has been schmeared and has disappeared.Naturally, Russ \u0026amp;\nDaughters, the appetizing store on the Lower East Side, carries it, as they\nhave for the last two dozen or so years. Before that, said Joshua Russ Tupper,\none of the fourth-generation owners, Lower East Side shops were more\nspecific.“You wouldn’t buy babka at an appetizing shop,” he said. “You’d buy\nit at a bakery. Originally we just sold fish, and candy for some reason. Not\nbagels. Not cream cheese. Not babka.”But as the bagel shops and dairies and\nbakeries closed in the 1970s, Russ \u0026amp; Daughters expanded. Now people from\nall over the country use mail order to get their babka, which Mr. Tupper\ndescribes as having the right balance between the not-too-sweet cake and rich\nchocolate filling, which you need to see swirled throughout when you cut a\nslice.“Figuring out how to get that balance is the challenge,” he said.Because\nI’m never one to miss out on a pastry trend — coupled with my deep-seated love\nof all things appetizing — I decided to try my hand at babka making, too.Much\nto the delight of my neighbors, I baked up dozens, working my way through my\nJewish cookbook collection and recipes on the Internet.I learned many things\nalong the way.This first is that one should never enter into babka making\nlightly. Babkas need time. They can take all day or even longer to make, both\nbecause refrigerating the dough in between steps makes it easier to work with,\nand because a longer proofing period gives the loaf a more complex flavor.As\npartial compensation, babka freezes beautifully, so most recipes yield two\nloaves: one for now, and one to defrost for your next brunch.Although cinnamon\nsugar is the most classic of the babka iterations, and chocolate the most\nnoble, you can in fact fill a babka with pretty much any kind of thick, sweet\ndelicious goo, and it will come out great. Jam, dulce de leche, homemade\nganache, Nutella and hot fudge sauce from a jar will all work. In this recipe,\nI ended up choosing my favorite dark chocolate fudge frosting, which stays\nsoft after baking.And as a final touch, instead of the usual brown sugar\nstreusel scattered on top, I prefer the intensity of bittersweet cocoa\ncrumbs.Traditionalists may think it overkill. But I say, if babka is going to\nbe your chocolate delivery system of choice, you may as well wear it\nproudly.Recipe: **Chocolate Babka**\n\n","title":"A Better Chocolate Babka - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"A better chocolate babka https://t.co/rpL3XUauc2 https://t.co/JCLo1QsCzv","date":"Sat Apr 02 04:36:04 +0000 2016","favs":405,"id":{"$numberLong":"716122001354698752"},"retweets":108},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PLVACU"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01404"},"content":"The death of Zaha Hadid at 65 on Thursday has reverberated through quarters of\nthe architecture world from Baghdad, where she was born, to New York, London\nand Guangzhou, China, where she built. But the sense of loss, mounting online,\nhas been most pronounced among female architects, who saw Ms. Hadid as a rare\nbeacon of hope for their own success in a male-dominated field and a barometer\nof its continuing sexism.“As a female architect, I am in shock and distressed\nthat another brilliant creative mind has passed away, especially a woman on\npar with the best male architects in the world,” Gisela Schmidt, an architect\nin Atlanta, wrote on Facebook. “She was a strong woman in a profession that”\nsilences them, she added. “What a loss for us!”In The Guardian, Eva Jiricna, a\nformer president of the Architectural Association in London and a close friend\nof Ms. Hadid’s, said: “I don’t think any man could actually compete with her.\nIf we can eliminate the practice of talking about female architects, it would\nbe the greatest tribute we could give her.” She added that even after advances\nfor women in recent years, it remained more difficult for a woman than for a\nman to get a job in architecture and to be paid the same.“A client of ours\nsaid to me he didn’t want any of my female colleagues to work on his project,”\nMs. Jiricna said. “It was completely incomprehensible.”Abdullah Mahmoud, a\nyoung architect in Damascus, Syria, who posted a tribute to Ms. Hadid on\nFacebook, said that in his classes at Damascus University, from which he\ngraduated last year, about 70 percent of the students were women — an\nindicator of how the profession’s balance is shifting — and that Ms. Hadid’s\ninfluence was hard to overstate.“For young architects here, especially the\nfemale ones, she was like a great princess,” Mr. Mahmoud said in a telephone\ninterview from Damascus. “For us, it was like: If Zaha Hadid could go to\nLondon and be a great architect and build for the Olympics and in China and\neverywhere, then why can’t we do that? And that was very strong for the women\nI studied with.”Ms. Hadid was the first woman to win the Pritzker Prize,\narchitecture’s top honor, in 2004, a quarter-century after the prize’s\nfounding. Since that milepost, the percentage of women architects in the\nUnited States has barely grown, increasing to 25.7 percent from 24 percent,\naccording the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The architect Richard Meier recalled\nhow several architects used to gather casually for dinner at the Century Club\nin New York, including Philip Johnson, Michael Graves and Peter Eisenman.\n“Zaha was the first woman, as far as I can remember, to attend one,” Mr. Meier\nsaid. “She had a sense of herself that she could fit in wherever she wanted.\nShe knew that what she did was highly respected.”Initially, Ms. Hadid seemed\nto resist the idea of serving as a role model because of her gender.“She’s a\nwoman architect who never wanted to be called a woman architect — she was just\nan architect and one of the best ones,” said Amale Andraos, the dean of\nColumbia University’s architecture school. “But clearly she broke new ground\nby being a woman, by not being Western, by being educated all over the world —\nthere is so much she enabled.”Over time, Ms. Hadid came to recognize her\nimportance as a symbol. In the book “Where Are the Women Architects?,” to be\npublished this month by Princeton University Press, Despina Stratigakos, the\ninterim chairwoman of the University at Buffalo’s architecture department,\nrecounts Ms. Hadid’s comments after winning the Architects’ Journal’s\ninaugural Jane Drew Prize for “her outstanding contribution to the status of\nwomen in architecture” in 2012.“I used to not like being called a woman\narchitect: I’m an architect, not just a woman architect,” Ms. Hadid said after\nwinning the award, in an interview with CNN. “Guys used to tap me on the head\nand say, ‘You are O.K. for a girl.’ But I see the incredible amount of need\nfrom other women for reassurance that it could be done, so I don’t mind that\nat all.”Despite her efforts over the years to be judged on the merits of her\nwork, the news media often included discussion of her physical appearance or\nmanner, rather than her professional performance.“Can you imagine the leading\npractitioners in other professions treated to such personal scrutiny on\nreceiving a major award?” asked Robert Ivy, in Architectural Record, after Ms.\nHadid won the Pritzker. “Marie Curie, for instance, subjected to fashion\ncommentary? Or Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison appraised for her hairstyle? In\nreceiving the Pritzker, Hadid joins those noble ranks and deserves better.\nArchitecture deserves better.”Nevertheless, over the years, Ms. Hadid\ncontinued to be criticized for headstrong behavior that her friends say would\nhave gone unnoticed in a man.“Everybody knows her as a diva and as a tough\nwoman,” the architect Thom Mayne said. “She’s tough because she’s in a\nprofession that takes toughness to get through it. She has this great sense of\nhumor and is actually a very motherly, caring person. Funny, incredibly loyal.\nShe was a sweetheart. And it’s not the part that most of the world sees.”Tegan\nBukowski, a former student of Ms. Hadid’s at the Yale School of Architecture,\nwho now works in the London office of Ms. Hadid’s practice, said the office\nwas rare in the profession, not only because it was nearly equally split\nbetween men and women.“Zaha herself was a role model, but she also created\nrole models in the company by making sure that women thrived,” Ms. Bukowski\nsaid. “She never held down men at all, but it was just about your work and\nyour talent. It never felt like gender was an issue. Because she basically\njust leveled the playing field in a way that I’ve never seen in any other\npractice before. And it makes me so sad to think about her being gone because\nI think, Who can I look up to like that now?”\n\n","title":"Female Architects on the Significance of Zaha Hadid - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Female architects on the significance of Zaha Hadid\nhttps://t.co/xUzOfjs1WG https://t.co/YyptEqqxpp","date":"Sat Apr 02 04:26:05 +0000 2016","favs":585,"id":{"$numberLong":"716119486865215488"},"retweets":354},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1StBsYn"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01405"},"content":"LOS ANGELES — Eugene Kashper looks the part of someone who likes to throw back\na few P.B.R.s from time to time — hipster glasses, scruffy facial hair, faded\nT-shirts and jeans and well-worn sneakers.Talk to him for a few minutes in his\noffice here, though, and you hear a shrewd businessman who blithely weaves in\ndiscussion about market shares, stock keeping units and distribution\nchannels.The talk is not all talk, either. Mr. Kashper, 46, is a millionaire\nmany times over, having made a fortune reviving several all-but-moribund\nEastern European breweries.Now he’s focused on a beer project on another\ncontinent. The project is Pabst Brewing Company, which declares itself the\nlargest American brewery. He bought Pabst in 2014 with the private equity firm\nTSG Consumer Partners for a reported $700 million, a deal that instantly made\nhim one of the most-watched figures in the beer industry.It also made people\nwonder: What in the world was he doing?Pabst Blue Ribbon, far and away the\ncompany’s top-selling beer, had a loyal following among skate punks and ski\nbums, and some currency in hipster enclaves. But it was still classified in\nthe industry as a “sub-premium” beer and business was not booming. The\ncompany’s share of the beer market hovered in the low single digits.“Eugene\nhas a million ideas and a lot of energy, and he’s very engaging,” said Benj\nSteinman, publisher of Beer Marketer’s Insights, a trade publication, and a\nlongtime observer of the beer market. “But I did wonder what he saw in\nPabst.”Mr. Kashper says he saw a big opportunity. “Beer, you know, it’s just\nfun,” he said. Now chief executive, he is pushing an aggressive effort to\nleverage the company’s distribution network, a part of the business that had\nbeen built up under previous owners, and dusting off old beer recipes and\nbrands to capitalize on consumer desire for local products.“We’re ideally\nsuited for the whole locavore thing,” he said.Whether he can pull it off is\nanother question. After decades of consolidation, two big players, Anheuser-\nBusch InBev and Molson Coors, last year controlled roughly 70 percent of the\nAmerican market. Pabst was in fifth place, with 2.6 percent.But Mr. Kashper\noffers no hint of doubt, and his partners say he has already put the company\non the right path.Brian Krumrei, a managing director at TSG, said\nprofitability at Pabst increased by 50 percent in the first year of the firm’s\nownership, though he would not disclose dollar figures.“Eugene is a pretty\npassionate guy, and that has permeated the culture — the 400 people who work\nat Pabst today are pretty passionate about it,” Mr. Krumrei said. “We view\nthat as a huge positive for the business and its potential.”Born in Russia,\nMr. Kashper grew up in New Jersey speaking Russian and English at home. After\ngraduating from Columbia University in 1992 with a degree in East Asian\nstudies, Mr. Kashper, an American citizen, went to work for Ernst \u0026amp; Young,\nwhich quickly capitalized on his language skills by sending him to Moscow.Soon\nafter that move, he left Ernst \u0026amp; Young and moved into the beer industry,\ngetting a job as the lead salesman in Eastern Europe for Stroh’s, an old beer\nbrand coincidentally now under the Pabst umbrella. He then joined forces with\ntwo Russian brothers, Alexander and Arkady Lifshits, and in 1998 they co-\nfounded the Ivan Taranov Breweries.After a series of deals in Russia and\nEastern Europe that netted the partners hundreds of millions of dollars, the\nthree men created Oasis Beverages, a brewer and distributor based in Cyprus.\nOasis also serves as an umbrella for other offshore investment vehicles they\ncontrol.In September 2014, Oasis was announced as the buyer of Pabst, together\nwith TSG. News outlets had a field day, portraying the deal as a Russian\ntakeover of a quintessential if somewhat down-market American beer.But a\ncouple of months later, a different news release went out, saying that Oasis\nhad never been the buyer of Pabst. Mr. Kashper, it said, was the buyer.Why the\nmistake occurred in the first place and why it took two months to set the\nrecord straight remain mysteries. But in so many ways, it matched the history\nof Pabst, which is also filled with unusual twists and turns.Founded in\nMilwaukee in 1844 by Jacob Best Sr., the brewery had a pretty good run for\nmore than a century. But in the 1980s, sales began sliding, and in 1985 Pabst\nlanded in the hands of Paul Kalmanovitz, a beer entrepreneur from California.\nHe died shortly after acquiring the brewery — but not before he had taken a\nhacksaw to costs.Mr. Kalmanovitz left his money to his pets and his breweries\nto a charitable foundation, which sold the company to the billionaire investor\nC. Dean Metropolous in 2010, when it had roughly $500 million in sales. By\nthat time, Pabst had contracted production of its beers to MillerCoors and\nspent virtually nothing on marketing. Mr. Metropolous also moved the company\nfrom Milwaukee to Los Angeles.The lack of marketing became a sort of renegade\npromotion in and of itself, increasing Pabst’s appeal among consumers who were\nturned off by advertising and looking for beer that was more “authentic” —\neven though Pabst no longer made its own beer. Sales rose, at least\nslightly.“Forty years on, many brands had ground to a halt in terms of\nincreasing market share, and that’s where the business stands today — the\nbiggest beer companies aren’t selling more beer,” Mr. Kashper said. “Pabst\nwas.”The trick now will be to take advantage of those strengths. For one\nthing, the company is opening a microbrewery and tasting room at the site of\nthe former Pabst brewing complex in Milwaukee, where it will serve up special\nselections.Mr. Kashper is also looking to sell more of the 77 beer brands and\nthe recipes it owns — many of which have not been brewed in decades — and ride\nthe coattails of the craft beer craze. Pabst will soon start producing Rainier\nPale Mountain Ale at a brewery in Washington State, for example, using a\nrecipe derived from the one for a Rainier beer that was last brewed in the\n1930s and 1940s. Other brands include Lone Star, Schlitz, Olympia, National\nBohemian, Colt 45, Schmidt and Pearl.“We can take advantage of the heritage\nembedded in our brands,” Mr. Kashper said. “We don’t have to spend money\nconvincing consumers our brands are authentic — they already know they\nare.”Stephen Rannekleiv, an investment analyst at Rabobank, said these old\nbrands might put Pabst in a good position.“Pabst in the past has been able to\nbuck trends by playing up its retro feel and being a little offbeat, and those\nsame things are helpful today,” he said.The company is also putting more\nenergy into leveraging its distribution system, which had been nurtured and\nhoned by Mr. Metropolous.Serendipitously, he found one hit to pump through the\nsystem right after buying Pabst, in Not Your Father’s Root Beer, a “hard” or\nalcoholic soda made by Small Town Brewery that became the beer industry’s\nsleeper success story of 2015. The product helped raise Pabst’s overall sales\nin 2015 by 20 percent and pushed its market share up by a percentage point —\neven as sales of its main brand declined.But Mr. Kashper, with his faded Pabst\nBlue Ribbon logo T-shirts and dilapidated sneakers, says he’s not going to\nforget about the company’s primary brand, either.“We’ve become an affordable,\nlighter beer that appeals to people who like craft beer,” Mr. Kashper said.\n“And, look, selling sub-premium beer is a very profitable business for us, no\nmatter what else we may be doing.”\n\n","title":"Pabst Raids Dad’s Beer Fridge as It Looks to the Future - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Pabst Blue Ribbon raids dad’s beer fridge as it looks to the future https://t.co/CbI0ytOqnv https://t.co/NhDvrajKRv","date":"Sat Apr 02 03:56:03 +0000 2016","favs":166,"id":{"$numberLong":"716111930130362368"},"retweets":85},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22X26Ua"}

Everyone will get your message, but that’s the last you’ll\never hear about it. Yes, even if folks try to respond, you won’t see it,” said\na Gmail blog post about the feature.For some, the Mic Drop sounded like the\nperfect passive-aggressive office behavior. But this is April Fools’ Day, the\nworst day of the year and a fertile ground for hoaxes, which are so numerous\nthat many news organizations are live-blogging them.Many unsuspecting Gmail\nusers were simply not in the mood for Minions. Since the Mic Drop button was\nplaced a little too close to the Send button, users lamented their misfiring\nof the cartoon character when dealing with bosses and co-\nworkers.“Unfortunately some of my very intelligent friends are senior\nengineers in Google,” one incensed user named Yihsun Lin wrote in Gmail’s\nproduct forum. “I almost picked up the phone and shout at them because of this\nstupid creation made me sound so rude to one important customer when I made a\nmistake to click this stupid button.”Another user named Connie Mitchell wrote:\n“If I wanted juvenile prank crap on my computer I would be on Facebook wasting\ntime.” (Facebook, a high-traffic zone for Minions and the people who love\nthem, does not appear to have released a prank this year. But the day is\nyoung.)Usually, Gmail is beloved for its forays into office humor. In 2007,\nthe service introduced Gmail Paper, which advertised print deliveries of a\nuser’s inbox (“Allow 2-4 business days for a parcel to arrive via post.”) In\n2011, there was Gmail Autopilot, which offered to analyze and reply to emails\nautomatically, and even came with a special breakup function. And Gmail itself\nwas launched on April 1, 2004.This year, Gmail said in a statement that it had\ngone too far this time: “Well, it looks like we pranked ourselves this year.\nDue to a bug, the Mic Drop feature inadvertently caused more headaches than\nlaughs.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01407"},"content":"London — WHEN I was still an architecture student at Yale, I got stuck in New\nYork City traffic with one of my professors, Zaha Hadid, and her chauffeur. I\nasked her whether she had any advice for me, a young female architecture\nstudent graduating into a depressed market dominated by men. She simply said,\n“Come work for me.”I told her, “O.K., but only if I get to design shoes.”She\nreplied, “If you work for me, you can design anything.”Ms. Hadid died\nyesterday of a heart attack while in the hospital with bronchitis. I lost a\nmentor and professional hero, and the world lost one of its leading form\nmakers. Much of the ensuing praise, though, has so far focused on her gender —\nwhich is unfortunate, because it obscures what was truly significant about her\ncareer as an architect.Don’t get me wrong: Her gender was important to me as a\nwoman in an industry with very few people to look up to, and she inspired\nother young women to follow her lead. But Zaha would be disappointed in the\nAmerican Institute of Architects, which reported her death by calling her a\n“ground-breaking female architect.” She would have said that her gender was\nmerely incidental, as was her ethnicity. A stumbling block at times, but\nnothing to get excited about.The focus on her gender obscures her real\nachievements. The way she drew on Russian constructivist design to create an\nentirely new language of drawing, painting, building and fashion. Long after\nthe novelty of her gender fades from the public’s mind, she will be remembered\nfor the swooping, sumptuous monumentality of her buildings, like the MAXXI art\nmuseum in Rome or her opera house in Guangzhou, China.Zaha did not want to be\ndefined by her gender, and she didn’t define anyone else that way, either. In\nher studio, she offered my female colleagues and me a chance to prove\nourselves equal to our male counterparts. She quietly created an environment\nwhere I could look around and see women in positions of power _next_ to men,\nnot in spite of them. She showed us how gender could fade into the background\nif it was systematically taken out of the equation in favor of an appreciation\nof sheer talent. There are no token women at Zaha Hadid Architects.Which is\nnot to say that she wasn’t nurturing. With no husband and no children, she had\na private life that may have seemed empty of many of the joys that normal\npeople consider default. But Ms. Hadid had many close friends, and fostered a\nwarm, close-knit relationship with her employees. She called us, her group of\ndesigners, her “kids” and treated us as such in a lot of ways.Of course, many\npeople seemed to insist on applying gender stereotypes to her, anyway. Many\ngreat architects, like any great artists, are often difficult to relate to,\nand Ms. Hadid, so intensely focused on her unique vision, was no exception.\nFor male architects, such traits are often taken positively, as proof of\ngenius. But the news media insisted on portraying Ms. Hadid as harsh,\nexacting, difficult — “diva” was the usual term of reference.None of this\nseemed to bother her; she just kept on working, showing what you could achieve\nif you didn’t let prejudice get in your way. The night before Ms. Hadid died,\nshe was commenting on designs from her hospital bed.Arriving at the office on\nFriday, the day after her death, was like returning to a campaign office the\nday after the candidate has suddenly withdrawn from a race. All the excitement\nof the day before, the joy you feel when you’re united behind a single leader\nwith a single purpose, was replaced by shocked silence.What happens next? Her\nwork will continue for years, in the form of buildings that are under\nconstruction or just starting construction, products that are designed and\nready to begin and plans that have been mapped out but not executed. But her\npresence, that woman who turned to me in the middle of Manhattan rush hour and\ntold me I could make it? It’s an irreplaceable loss, not just for those of us\nin her studio, but for an entire generation of architects — men and women\nalike.\n\n","title":"Zaha Hadid: More Than a ‘Female Architect’ - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytopinion: Zaha Hadid was not just a 'female architect,' she was a great architect. https://t.co/ujH81SpRVO https://t.co/QYf9T8Wojv","date":"Sat Apr 02 03:36:01 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716106888954449920"},"retweets":303},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21XpviL"}

Howard, 37, figures that is\nwhere his career will end, perhaps after a fourth trip to the World Cup, in\nRussia in 2018. In an interview with The New York Times on Thursday, Howard\ndiscussed his career, the pay dispute between U.S. Soccer and the women’s\nnational team, and why he took a year off from the national team.**Q.** _The\nequal pay issue. Is this something that is discussed among men’s players?\nWhere do you come down?_**A.** The news breaking today? None of us saw it\ncoming. Any time, no matter the gender or the race, someone feels they are\nunderpaid, it is a problem, and I feel they should fight for their rights, no\nmatter what. Other than that, they have their battle to fight, and they should\ndo that.**Q.** _Is it uncomfortable at all that they raised the men’s pay in\ntheir argument for better pay for themselves? And the men’s\nperformance?_**A.** As we all know, there are a lot of factors that go into\nlabor negotiations. Winning and losing is one of them, but that’s not always\nthe case. When it comes to arguing those points, every factor and reason and\nexcuse is going to be unearthed. It’s not an issue for us.**Q.** _Does your\ndaughter play?_**A.** Yes, and how would I feel? My daughter is the feistiest\n8-year-old you’ve ever seen. I’ve got no worries about her, either today or in\nlabor negotiations.**Q.** _You took that year off after the World Cup from\nnational team duty. Do you feel a bit energized now that you’re back in the\nfold?_**A.** It was professionally the hardest decision I had to make because\nI didn’t want to stop playing for my country. I wanted to keep pushing forward\nand continue on that success we had as a team. But I needed a little bit of a\nbreak — hopefully no one would begrudge me for that — and the only way I could\ncarve out any time was to take some international breaks off. That’s the only\nbreak in our schedule. Other sports have months and months off in their off-\nseason; we don’t. Over the last 13 years, I’ve had, on average, three weeks\noff at the back end of June.**Q.** _Was there trepidation to approach Jurgen\nKlinsmann to say, “Hey, here’s what I’m thinking”?_**A.** Jurgen and I have a\ngreat relationship. Any time I need something, I pick up the phone, I don’t\nask other people. I speak directly to him. My leave of absence, my return, my\nmove to M.L.S.Yeah, there was trepidation. I didn’t want to take the time out.\nI realize that if I stop playing, it opens the door for a goalkeeper\ncontroversy. I know how that’s going to play out. But I have conversations\nwith Jurgen. I’m confident I’ll have every chance to do the job I’ve always\ndone.**Q.** _During the games against Guatemala in the past week, a lot was\nwritten about the “struggling” men’s team. What’s your take on that?_**A.**\nConcacaf qualifying is crazy. What happened these last two games is a\nmicrocosm of what U.S. Soccer and World Cup qualification has looked like\nsince 1990. There’s ups, there’s downs. We come off a road trip, we got our\nbutts handed to us, the media is on us ... we win our home game and everything\nis rosy again until September. That’s like normal to us.But if you really,\nreally broke it down, Guatemala didn’t create any chances. We gave them two\nchances, and their goalkeeper played better than any goalkeeper I’ve seen in a\nlong, long time. So we left Guatemala knowing that they didn’t even believe\nthey could win in four days’ time. Because they basically had to play the game\nof their lives, and be handed something, to win.**Q.** _How did you end up\nwith Colorado?_**A.** Josh Kroenke and Stan Kroenke wanted to get Colorado\nback to the summit. They saw me as a piece of that puzzle. They’ve since\nbrought in [Shkelzen] Gashi and Jermaine Jones and Marco Pappa. They’re\nputting some pieces in place to be successful. They sold me, hook, line and\nsinker. I love a challenge. They finished last last year.**Q.** _You come back\nto a very different M.L.S. than the one you left in 2003. How do you assess\nthe quality of the league now compared to your first tenure?_**A.** It’s night\nand day. Fifteen soccer-specific stadiums, that’s a dream. Steven Gerrard,\nFrank Lampard, Gio dos Santos — playing against these kind of players, that’s\nwhat I’m excited about.**Q.** _Have you gamed out the rest of your\ncareer?_**A.** My contract is three and a half seasons. I imagine that would\nprobably be the end. It would be a good end.**Q.** _Have you thought about\nyour postsoccer life?_**A.** I think it was good to get my feet wet with the\ncommentating. Ultimately, I’d like to be in the M.L.S. in an executive role.\nThat’s something I’m excited about. Coaching? Look, I can’t rule it out, but\nright now, I don’t want to coach. Coaching is very, very difficult. I look at\nsome of the great managers I’ve had. What they do is hard work, every single\nday. It never stops, ever.\n\n","title":"Tim Howard Says Women’s Team Should Fight for Rights - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Goalkeeper Tim Howard says women’s team should fight for rights https://t.co/vdDGJK2vsw https://t.co/YWT9SXd5SA","date":"Sat Apr 02 03:06:05 +0000 2016","favs":910,"id":{"$numberLong":"716099354038239233"},"retweets":311},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VZIfyw"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01409"},"content":"Students at several college campuses are clashing with their administrations\nand debating the limits of free speech after finding chalk messages voicing\nsupport for Donald J. Trump scrawled on campus property.Last week, at Emory\nUniversity in Atlanta, officials scrambled to respond to a student\ndemonstration after roughly 100 messages were found on campus. The students\nfelt that there was an anti-diversity subtext to the so-called chalking\nwritten on campus about Mr. Trump, the Republican front-runner whose divisive\ncomments about Muslims, women, Hispanics and disabled people have offended his\ncritics but have tended to embolden his supporters.Casidy Campbell, a 21-year-\nold senior at Emory, said in an interview that the pro-Trump messages\ncontained phrases like “Build a Wall” and “Accept the Inevitable,” and said\nthat the messages were written near multicultural spaces, like the black\nstudent union.“We’re not here to infringe on people’s First Amendment rights,”\nMs. Campbell said. “Think about how your language can be oppressive toward\nother people.”On Thursday, Nancy Seideman, a spokeswoman for Emory, said most\nof the messages were near the Dobbs University Center, the headquarters of\nmany student organizations on campus. The school also said that since no\nphotos existed of the messages that could be considered inflammatory, their\nexistence could not be confirmed.The episodes at Emory and other campuses\nillustrate the power of a humble stick of chalk, a utensil used by college\nstudents for decades. “Chalking” on sidewalks has long been a colorful and\nlow-cost way to attract attention to meetups, musicals and other events. But\ndebates over political messages have become so contentious in recent years\nthat many schools have issued policies over who can write them, and where and\nwhen they can be written.Other schools have banned the practice outright:\nWesleyan University issued a moratorium in 2003, after members of the faculty\ncomplained that they were being written about in sexually explicit chalk\nmessages.In a bulletin sent to students last week, Emory’s president, James W.\nWagner, appeared to try to balance the needs of students who felt threatened\nwith those who may feel that supporting Mr. Trump is part of political\ndiscourse.“As an academic community, we must value and encourage the\nexpression of ideas, vigorous debate, speech, dissent and protest,” he wrote.”\nAt the same time, our commitment to respect, civility and inclusion calls us\nto provide a safe environment that inspires and supports courageous\ninquiry.”Mr. Wagner was then filmed scrawling a chalk message of his own:\n“Emory stands for free expression!”The debate over pro-Trump chalking has\nattracted its critics, who feel that students who are upset by the chalk\nshould get a thicker skin. The case at Emory especially garnered attention\nafter the school’s student government offered emergency funds to student\ngroups wanting to respond to the incident, and offered open hours to meet with\nstudents. (The school offers counseling services to all students, Ms. Seideman\nsaid.)One high-profile critic is Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker and a\nlongtime Georgia congressman. He is also an Emory alum.“As an Emory alum I am\nworried about the fragility and timidity of some students. In the age of ISIS\nhow can a name in chalk be frightening?” Mr. Gingrich wrote on Twitter on\nThursday, adding, “Emory has me worried because I thought college was a place\nto grow up and explore ideas not a place to hide and be intimidated by\ntrivia.”Isabelle Saldaña, a 21-year-old junior at Emory, said that the\ndiscussion about diversity and inclusion on college campuses shouldn’t be\nlimited to chalking. She said minority students have been in conflict with\ntheir administration for over a year over what they see as a lack of fair\ntreatment in comparison with other groups on campus, and the percentage of\nminority faculty members.“It’s less about the actual chalkings,” she said.\n“This isn’t something that’s unique to Emory. This is a national conversation,\neven an international conversation, on the value of black and brown\npeople.”College students have long clashed with school officials – and each\nother – over issues of censorship, but Mr. Trump has been something like an\naccelerant on a simmering fire, said Samantha Harris, a lawyer and the\ndirector of policy of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.“With\nthe Trump candidacy, this is the first time we’ve sort of seen calls for\ncensorship of, literally, support for a candidate,” Ms. Harris said. “For a\nlong time there’s been a sense by students that they have a right not to be\nuncomfortable. You do have a right not to feel unsafe. The question is: What\ndoes unsafe mean?”In other words, she said, students who write messages on the\nsidewalk in support of Mr. Trump would have a high bar to meet for their\nspeech not to be protected by the Constitution. A message crosses into\nunprotected speech when it crosses into the type of harassment or incitement\nof violence that essentially bars a student from gaining access to an\neducational opportunity.“One thing we see a lot of on campuses is the\nconflation of emotional and physical safety,” Ms. Harris said. “If I chalk\n‘Trump 2016’ and someone says, ‘that makes me feel unsafe,’ that does not\nautomatically convert it into a threat.”Still, some school officials, like\nthose at the University of Kansas, are moving to distance themselves from the\nmessages, without calling into question the right of a student to write\nthem.“The chalking was not approved by any K.U. administrator, nor were we\naware of it,” Erinn Barcomb-Peterson said of pro-Trump chalkings on campus.\n“The university does have a policy regarding chalking but in recent years has\nerred on the side of free speech when determining how to enforce the\npolicy.”Students tend to see things differently. Shegufta Huma, a Kansas\nstudent who shared a photo of the chalkings, demanded that the university\ncomment: “Is this the post-racial paradise folks pretend exists?” Ms. Huma\ntweeted at the school’s official Twitter account on Tuesday.Some students see\nthe Trump name as synonymous with hate speech, and in at least one case,\nsupport for Mr. Trump and the speech against a religious group appeared to be\nclosely aligned. On Thursday, the words “Stop Islam” were scrawled next to\n“Trump 2016” on The Diag, an open space in the middle of the University of\nMichigan’s campus.“Attacks directed toward any member or group within the\nUniversity of Michigan community, based on a belief or characteristic, are\ninconsistent with our values of respect, civility and equality,” according to\na statement from the school sent by a spokesman, Rick Fitzgerald. “We all\nunderstand that where speech is free it will sometimes wound.”Even if\ncharacterized as an attack, the message still might not necessarily constitute\nharassment, inciting violence or otherwise impeding a student’s learning\nexperience, Ms. Harris said.“There are many things that are objectively\noffensive that are still constitutionally protected,” she said. “For most\nMuslim students, simply seeing ‘Stop Islam’ chalked on a sidewalk would not\nliterally prevent them from accessing the educational benefits of the\ninstitution.”\n\n","title":"Pro-Trump Chalk Messages Cause Conflicts on College Campuses - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Pro-Donald Trump chalk messages cause conflicts on college campuses https://t.co/gKgG2SQCs9 https://t.co/eobQvilu5Z","date":"Sat Apr 02 02:06:04 +0000 2016","favs":283,"id":{"$numberLong":"716084253944115200"},"retweets":110},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1MIohGr"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0140a"},"content":"Karachi, Pakistan — IN the world we live in, there is no dearth of pious men\nwho believe that most of the world’s problems can be fixed by giving their\nwomen a little thrashing. And this business of a man’s God-given right to give\na woman a little thrashing has brought together all of Pakistan’s pious men.A\nfew weeks ago, Pakistan’s largest province passed a new law called the Punjab\nProtection of Women Against Violence Act. The law institutes radical measures\nthat say a husband can’t beat his wife, and if he does he will face criminal\ncharges and possibly even eviction from his home. It proposes setting up a\nhotline women can call to report abuse. In some cases, offenders will be\nrequired to wear a bracelet with a GPS monitor and will not be allowed to buy\nguns.A coalition of more than 30 religious and political parties has declared\nthe law un-Islamic, an attempt to secularize Pakistan and a clear and present\nthreat to our most sacred institution: the family. They have threatened\ncountrywide street protests if the government doesn’t back down.Their logic\ngoes like this: If you beat up a person on the street, it’s a criminal\nassault. If you bash someone in your bedroom, you’re protected by the sanctity\nof your home. If you kill a stranger, it’s murder. If you shoot your own\nsister, you’re defending your honor. I’m sure the nice folks campaigning\nagainst the bill don’t want to beat up their wives or murder their sisters,\nbut they are fighting for their fellow men’s right to do just that.It’s not\nonly opposition parties that are against the bill: The government-appointed\nCouncil of Islamic Ideology has also declared it repugnant to our religion and\nculture. The council’s main task is to ensure that all the laws in the country\ncomply with Shariah. But basically it’s a bunch of old men who go to sleep\nworrying that there are all these women out there trying to trick them into\nbed. Maybe that’s why there are no pious old women on the council, even though\nthere’s no shortage of them in Pakistan.The council’s past proclamations have\ndefended a man’s right to marry a minor, dispensed him from asking for\npermission from his first wife before taking a second or a third, and made it\nimpossible for women to prove rape. It’s probably the most privileged dirty\nold men’s club in the country.Some of us routinely condemn these pious old\nmen, but it seems they are not just a bunch of pampered religious nuts. In\nfact, they are giving voice to Pakistani men’s collective misery over the fact\nthat their women are out of control. Look at university exam results; women\nare hogging all the top positions. Go to a bank; there is a woman counting\nyour money with her fancy nails. Turn on your TV; there is a female journalist\nquestioning powerful men about politics and sports.One of these journalists\nrecently was grilling a famous mufti opposed to the bill. Bewildered, the\nmufti said: Are you a woman, or are you a TV journalist? She was professional\nenough not to retort: Are you a mufti, or just another old fart?It wasn’t\nsupposed to be like this. Three decades ago, most Pakistani women who had paid\njobs worked at menial tasks, and the others were confined to traditional\nprofessions like medicine or teaching or, occasionally, law. There was a small\nand brave women’s movement. Women were writing novels and making movies, but\nthey were few in number. Now they are flying planes, heading companies,\npolicing the streets, climbing mountains and winning Oscars and Nobel Prizes.\nThere are millions of women across the country running little beauty parlors\nfrom their homes, employing other women and gaining a measure of\nindependence.But for every bank teller, there are still millions of women who\nare farmhands or house help. For every TV journalist, there are many more\nwomen who live in half-slavery, scrubbing and cleaning, and shouldering the\nheavy burden of protecting and raising their kids.Let’s not just blame the\nmullahs and muftis. Misogyny is way older than any religion. Even people who\nhave never seen the inside of a mosque or the Sufis who want to become one\nwith the universe wouldn’t think twice before treating a woman as something\nbetween a pest and a pet goat.Some members of Parliament stayed away when this\nbill was being passed in the Punjab assembly. They probably represent a\nmajority. Some of us even call ourselves feminist. “See, I have never stopped\nmy sister from going to school, never given my girlfriend a black eye. That\nmakes me a feminist, right? But we must protect our families. You don’t want a\nfamily-loving feminist man going around with a GPS tracker, do you?”What\nreally scares the so-called feminist men is that a lot of women are actually\nquite bored with talking about being a woman. They talk about their work. A\nfilm director talks about bad actors. A development worker talks about idiotic\nfunding patterns. A maid talks about her cellphone and the quality of\ndetergents.There’s a woman in my neighborhood who walks fast. She is always\ncarrying two kids in her arms. Not infants but 3-, 4-year-old sturdy kids,\nheavy weights. She walks fast. Probably you have to walk fast when you are\ncarrying two kids. She doesn’t expect a lift from the many cars passing by.\nShe can’t afford a cab. She is walking toward her bus. Always with the two\nkids in her arms and a bag around her shoulder. She gives Quran lessons at\npeople’s homes.I don’t think all those pious men, or anyone else, can tell\nthat woman with the two kids how to walk her daily walk. If someone asks her\nhow it feels to be a woman in this society, she’d probably answer, “Can’t you\nsee I’m working?”\n\n","title":"The Dirty Old Men of Pakistan - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytopinion: Some men in Pakistan are fighting for a man’s right to hit his wife or murder his sister. https://t.co/3zewiixFuu https://t…","date":"Sat Apr 02 01:56:04 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"716081736359223296"},"retweets":483},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VYABnT"}

Boyce, the chief of detectives for the New York Police\nDepartment, said the woman, a 20-year-old student from Egypt, would not face\ncriminal charges because she had emotional issues. The woman, who admitted to\nthe authorities that she had cut herself, was taken to Bellevue Hospital\nCenter for a psychiatric evaluation, the police said.The woman, whose name was\nnot released, initially told investigators that she was leaving a school she\nattends at 65 Broadway in the financial district around 4:20 p.m. on Thursday\nwhen a white man grabbed her from behind, spun her around and slashed her\nacross the face, the police said. But investigators found evidence that\ncontradicted her story, and she recanted.The authorities said surveillance\nvideo from the area showed that she had not left the building before calling\nthe police, and Chief Boyce said investigators found blood in a bathroom on\nthe 15th floor.

His assailant\nhad demanded money, and when the victim said he did not have any, he was\nslashed from behind, the police said.Around 3 p.m. on Friday, a 51-year-old\nman was slashed in the back at Pennsylvania Station.

There,\nstudents and passers-by took pictures and videos, posting them on Snapchat and\nInstagram.Within a half-hour, the bull was corralled on the lawn of the\ncollege’s classroom building. One bystander captured on video the moment it\nwas cornered by the police and lassoed.New York City has a long history of\nlivestock on the loose, as does Jamaica.In January, just a few blocks away\nfrom the college, a cow managed to break free from a slaughterhouse. Calls to\n911 poured in reporting a “cow on the run,” the authorities said. That bovine\nescapee was caught at a parking garage; the police at the time released a\npicture of its “perp walk” into a trailer. It was sent to a sanctuary in New\nJersey, and given the name Freddie, after Freddie Mercury, the lead singer of\nQueen. Similar escapes had been reported in the area in 2009 and 2011.And last\nmonth near Times Square, visitors got the additional spectacle of  a police\nhorse, free of its rider, galloping through Midtown Manhattan. The horse,\nGunny, was spooked by a sudden sound from a nearby truck, and tossed off the\nofficer.Gunny, the police said, was quickly sent back to active duty.In other\nlivestock escapes, the animals were returned to their owners.The latest animal\nhas a better ending.On Friday, officials said the bovine had been taken to an\nAnimal Care Centers of NYC in Brooklyn.Staff members from the center talked\nwith the owner, a cattle rancher from Monticello, N.Y., and started pulling\ntogether money in case they needed to buy it and spare it from slaughter, said\nKaty Hansen, a spokeswoman for the group. The group ultimately did not pay for\nthe bull, she said.By afternoon, it was loaded up again. He was picked up by\nthe comedian Jon Stewart and his wife, Tracey, to take to Farm Sanctuary’s\nshelter in Watkins Glen, N.Y, according to Farm Sanctuary, an animal rescue\ngroup that operates several shelters. But before it left, Ms. Hansen said, the\nstaff members had given it a name: Frank Lee, for Frank Lee Morris, the\nprisoner who, in 1962, escaped from Alcatraz.\n\n","title":"Bull in Queens Is Captured, and Jon Stewart Chauffeurs It to Freedom - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"A bull that escaped in Queens was captured.

Russell\nand the Ghetto Film School.The Ghetto Film School started in 2000 as an after-\nschool program in the South Bronx to introduce and mentor minority children in\nthe craft of filmmaking. Since then, it has opened a high school and roped in\nmany well-heeled board members, among them James Murdoch of 21st Century Fox;\nRachael Horovitz, a producer of “Moneyball”; and Mr. Russell, the director of\n“Joy” and “American Hustle.”A diverse group of actors and Hollywood insiders\ngathered for cocktails at 11 Howard, a new hotel and lounge by Aby Rosen,\nchatting freely about race and posing for pictures.“Let’s do this,” Mr.\nRussell boomed, as photographers descended and the director gave a signal to\nhis celebrity attendees that it was time for a group shot.“It’s like high\nschool,” the manager Jason Weinberg said, as Allison Williams, Whoopi\nGoldberg, Tony Bennett, Deborah Harry and other famous faces huddled around\nMr. Russell.It’s a far cry from the early days of the film school, when Mr.\nRussell could barely get anyone in the industry interested in it. “People were\nlike, ‘Yeah? Really?’” he said, feigning indifference.So the industry appears\nto be changing, in no small part because of this year’s #OscarsSoWhite.Around\n8, guests moved into a narrow dining room on the second floor, where a raw\nsalmon appetizer was served and a student from the school, Andrew Grell, 19,\ntalked about the importance of mentorship. “You should have called me,” Ms.\nGoldberg shouted. “I’m cheap and I’m easy.”Mr. Russell spoke, too, commending\nthe founder, Joe Hall, for his leadership in growing the school. He was also\namazed by how much past students had grown. “I see these people and I say,\n‘When did I meet you?’ And I expect them to say four years ago, and they say\n15. And I go, ‘How could I be that old?’”As a thyme-flavored sorbet was served\nfor dessert, guests began moving around the table. Mr. Balaban stood by the\nwindows gabbing with Christian Slater. Ms. Williams was nearby, accepting\ncongratulations for the last episode of “Girls,” which focused on her\ncharacter.A few feet away were Ms. Goldberg and Chris Tucker. Ms. Goldberg\nsaid she didn’t think there was a conscious decision to exclude minority\nactors in Hollywood. “It’s not deliberate,” she said. “People cast what they\nknow.”Still, she said it was depressing that so many great films have excluded\nher and other black actors. “The Coen brothers aren’t calling me,” she said,\nlaughing.And the problems are even worse behind the camera, Ms. Mirren said,\npointing out that she rarely meets black or Asian crew members, and — in a\n50-year film career, with more than 60 movies under her belt — is working with\na female cinematographer for only the second time.“I do feel the dam is\nbreaking,” Ms. Mirren said. “I might be wrong.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0140e"},"content":"WASHINGTON — President Obama on Friday questioned Donald J. Trump’s fitness\nfor office after statements from the Republican front-runner that the United\nStates and its allies should move away from decades of constraints on the use\nof nuclear weapons. “We don’t want somebody in the Oval Office who doesn’t\nrecognize how important that is,” Mr. Obama said.Speaking to reporters at the\nend of a summit meeting devoted to nuclear security, the president said the\ncomments by Mr. Trump reflected a person who “doesn’t know much about foreign\npolicy or nuclear policy or the Korean Peninsula or the world generally.”Mr.\nObama has not hesitated to criticize Mr. Trump for contributing to a coarse\ntone and circuslike atmosphere on the campaign trail. But his criticism of the\ncandidate’s comments on nuclear proliferation was not about public language or\npersonal style, but about one of the gravest responsibilities of an American\npresident. It carried an extra edge because it involved an issue that Mr.\nObama has made a central goal of his presidency.He said world leaders and\nother participants at the conference had expressed concerns about Mr. Trump’s\ncomments during private conversations with him at the summit meeting, which\ngathered more than 50 world leaders to discuss ways to reduce the threat of a\nnuclear attack, whether from the leakage of nuclear fuel or the theft of a\nbomb by a terrorist group.“Even those countries that are used to a carnival\natmosphere in their own politics want sobriety and clarity when it comes to\nU.S. elections because they understand that the president of the United States\nneeds to know what’s going on around the world,” Mr. Obama said.For the\npresident, the two-day Nuclear Security Summit underscored both the loftiness\nof his vision for a nuclear-free planet and the hurdles of translating that\nvision into reality in a world of insecure leaders and of terrorist groups\nplotting to seize weapons. But the remarks of an American presidential\ncandidate roiled the waters.Mr. Trump said he was open to allowing Japan and\nSouth Korea to acquire nuclear weapons to deter their rogue neighbor, North\nKorea. He also declined to rule out using nuclear weapons in a military\nconflict in Europe, saying, “You don’t want to, say, take everything off the\ntable.”He first broached the issue of a nuclear-armed Japan and South Korea in\nan interview with The New York Times last week, putting it in the context of\nhis case that the United States should no longer bear the full burden of\ndefending its Asian allies. He defended his comments in a town-hall-style\nmeeting on Tuesday in Milwaukee, televised by CNN.“You have so many countries\nalready — China, Pakistan, you have so many countries, Russia — you have so\nmany countries right now that have them,” he said. “Now, wouldn’t you rather,\nin a certain sense, have Japan have nuclear weapons when North Korea has\nnuclear weapons?” A senior Japanese government official quickly reiterated\nthat it was Japan’s policy never to possess nuclear weapons.On Friday, Mr.\nObama described the alliance with Japan and South Korea as “one of the\ncornerstones of our presence in the Asia-Pacific region” — one that was paid\nfor with the sacrifices of American soldiers during World War II, one that has\nexpanded American influence and commerce and one that “has underwritten the\npeace and prosperity of that region.”“You don’t mess with that,” Mr. Obama\nadded.In summarizing the accomplishments of the Nuclear Security Summits —\nthis was the fourth and final one of his presidency — Mr. Obama acknowledged a\ntension between his emphasis on nonproliferation and the American military’s\nrelentless efforts to improve the efficiency of its existing stockpile of\nnuclear warheads. These American technological advances rattle Russia and\nChina, which cite them as a pretext to develop their own new weapons.“I’ve\ntried to strike the proper balance,” Mr. Obama said. He noted that he had\ntried to negotiate a further round of arms reductions with Russia after the\nNew Start treaty. But the return to the presidency of Vladimir V. Putin ended\nthose prospects. In the meantime, he said, the United States needed to make\nsure its stockpile was “safe and reliable.”Mr. Putin boycotted this meeting,\nwhich foreclosed the possibility of ambitious agreements, since Russia is one\nof the world’s two largest nuclear-weapons states, along with the United\nStates.Earlier on Friday, Mr. Obama argued that his marquee accomplishment in\nnonproliferation — the nuclear deal with Iran — had “achieved a substantial\nsuccess.” Because of restrictions that the deal imposed on Iran’s nuclear\nprogram, he said, it would now take the Iranians about a year to build a bomb\n— if it breached the deal — as opposed to two to three months before the\ndiplomatic effort began in mid-2012.Asked about reports that the Treasury\nDepartment would allow Iran to conduct transactions in United States dollars,\nMr. Obama did not answer directly, but suggested that Iran could get access to\nAmerican banking markets indirectly through European banks. The reports have\ndrawn sharp criticism from lawmakers, including the House speaker, Paul D.\nRyan, who urged the White House not to go ahead.Beyond that issue, Mr. Obama\nsaid Tehran could attract more American businesses by adhering not just to the\nletter of the nuclear deal but to its spirit, which meant not shipping\nmissiles to the militant group Hezbollah, or otherwise destabilizing the\nregion.The attacks in Brussels and Paris led the president to add a session on\nterrorism and nuclear security. After banishing reporters and cameras from the\nroom, he showed the leaders a video depicting a terrorist attack in a city\ninvolving a nuclear device. Afterward, the leaders discussed how they would\nhandle such an attack.“Fortunately, no terrorist group has yet succeeded in\ngetting their hands on a nuclear device,” Mr. Obama told them beforehand. “Our\nwork here will help ensure that we’re doing everything possible to prevent\nthat.”The meeting generated a list of announcements, including the reduction\nof stockpiles of highly enriched uranium in a variety of countries, including\nPoland and Kazakhstan, and an agreement to remove separated plutonium from\nJapan. The nature of these gatherings is that each nation brings along its\n“gifts,” or proposed offerings, and American officials say that having the\nleaders all show up for the summit meeting creates a forcing mechanism to get\nthat work done.But there are also moments that reveal behind-the-scenes\ndisagreements, and one was evident Friday with Japan.The energy secretary,\nErnest J. Moniz, appeared with a senior Japanese official to celebrate the\nremoval of half a ton of highly enriched uranium and separated plutonium,\nwhich was shipped to the United States. But the two men took no questions,\nleaving the Japanese unchallenged about the fact that they are moving ahead on\na new plutonium reprocessing plant that should produce up to eight tons of\nplutonium each year.That raises concern that Japan will sit on a large supply\nof nuclear fuel, always a source of tension with its neighbors. Francie\nIsraeli, an Energy Department spokeswoman, said that Japan had removed some of\nthe most sensitive materials and that “we understand that they intend to\nbalance any future reprocessing activities with consumption or disposition.”\n\n","title":"Obama Rebukes Donald Trump’s Comments on Nuclear Weapons - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"President Obama rebukes Donald Trump’s comments on nuclear weapons https://t.co/MF2YL150AC https://t.co/YcdWrEIioU","date":"Sat Apr 02 00:01:03 +0000 2016","favs":628,"id":{"$numberLong":"716052791333138432"},"retweets":382},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25BIkfU"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01411"},"content":"All sorts of people are swabbing inside their cheeks and spitting into\ncollection tubes these days in the interest of researching their ancestry. Yet\nan old-fashioned paper chase remains far more telegenic, as TLC’s “Who Do You\nThink You Are?” demonstrates once again when it returns for a new season on\nSunday.But are old newspaper clippings and census records the only options for\nfamily-tree television? Not at BYUtv, which recently unveiled an improbable-\nsounding genealogical competition show. Yes, you read that right.“Who Do You\nThink You Are?” has been around since 2010. It started out on NBC, then moved\nto its current address, where it may well be the classiest show in TLC’s\ntrash-heavy lineup. In each episode a celebrity or other well-known figure\nresearches his or her roots with the help of experts. (Ancestry, the\ngenealogy-tracing company, is a sponsor of the show.) The results are often\nmoving, and that’s certainly the case with Sunday’s episode, in which the\nactress Aisha Tyler (“Archer,” “The Talk”) is introduced to a great-great-\ngrandfather and some hard truths about her family’s story.This episode, like\nmany, finds its way back to the era of slavery (Ms. Tyler is black), where the\ngenealogical record often becomes iffy for African-Americans. In the just-\nconcluded season of a similar show, PBS’s “Finding Your Roots With Henry Louis\nGates Jr.,” Dr. Gates was as surprised as his guest, LL Cool J, to find a\nbranch in that rapper’s family showing free-black lineage going back to before\n1800.“The whole of the 19th century before the Civil War,” Dr. Gates told him,\n“this side of your family never picked one boll of cotton.”Although DNA test\nresults are sometimes brought to bear, it’s the documents — old newspaper\nclippings, ledgers, birth records, photographs — that make “Finding Your\nRoots” and “Who Do You Think You Are?” compelling. But how can television\ncapitalize on the scientific side of the genealogy craze now that it is so\neasy and cheap to get a DNA profile?In late February BYUtv, which has ties to\nthe Mormon Church and its extensive genealogical records, took a stab at that\nquestion, introducing a preposterous-sounding show called “Relative Race.”\nPicture a version of “The Amazing Race” in which contestants — in this case,\nfour couples — are on a cross-country scavenger hunt that leads them to DNA-\nmatched relatives they have never met. The sixth episode is coming up\nSunday.One of the gimmicks is that the couples can’t use electronic aids to\nguide them to their destinations, and the series, if nothing else, proves that\nno one knows how to read a paper map anymore. The show’s bickering-while-\ndriving component is just plain annoying, but when the contestants finally\nmeet those fourth or sixth cousins, it’s kind of sweet.Another new reality\nshow, TLC’s “Long Lost Family,” works a variation on the genealogical search,\nseeking to reunite biologically connected people. One woman searches for the\nson she gave up for adoption decades ago; another who was adopted at birth\nseeks her biological mother; and so on.The show’s hosts, Chris Jacobs and Lisa\nJoyner, were both adopted themselves, which gives the proceedings an added\nlayer of depth. But the real pull comes from ordinary people’s stories of\ndifficult decisions, ambivalent separations, long decades lived with\nunanswered questions and a lingering sense of loss. It’s TLC, so the show\n(which immediately follows “Who Do You Think You Are?” on Sundays) is tricked\nout with stagy emotional scenes. Yet amid all the tear-shedding, there is some\nsociology worth contemplating.\n\n","title":"TV’s Genealogy Craze Yields Game Shows and Paper Chases but Also Interesting Lessons - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"TV’s genealogy craze leads to game shows and paper chases — but also interesting lessons https://t.co/fx0jjI0Yq9 https://t.co/WcIwJdd21f","date":"Fri Apr 01 23:02:00 +0000 2016","favs":140,"id":{"$numberLong":"716037927978070016"},"retweets":75},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SGxyhr"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01413"},"content":"It was still dark one morning early this year when Joe Lacob, the majority\nowner of the Golden State Warriors, drove his Mercedes station wagon through\nthe Stanford University campus. He parked near the business school, then\nwalked down a sidewalk through a drizzle to meet a group of Silicon Valley\nexecutives. The ex-C.E.O. of OpenTable, now a partner at Andreessen Horowitz,\nwas coming. So were a founder of the online-learning start-up Curious and a\nmanaging director of Vanguard Ventures. On another morning, they all might\nhave met at a charity event or a TED Talk. But it was a Tuesday, and that\nmeant basketball.Lacob, who has worked in venture capital for three decades,\nhas an open, expressive face and broad shoulders. He’s six feet tall but seems\ntaller. The previous night, he watched his Warriors play a home game in\nOakland, and now he looked tired. “The Tuesday mornings after we play Monday\nnights are the hardest,” he said. The basketball court, which is normally used\nby students and faculty members, has a tidy, corporate look: gleaming hardwood\nsurrounded by plexiglass walls. In his Warriors T-shirt and shorts, Lacob\npushed his hands against the glass and stretched his legs. “Honestly, this is\nmy favorite time of the week,” he told me.One by one, other players arrived.\nMost have known Lacob for years, since early in his career at Kleiner Perkins\nCaufield \u0026amp; Byers, which is when he helped start this pickup game. There\nwas no reason for anyone to be deferential to him. But owning a basketball\nteam has cachet, especially when that team has come to rank among the best in\nN.B.A. history. Nobody mentioned his own business affairs, but everyone was\neager to talk about Lacob’s. “Joe, good to see Barnes back,” someone said,\nreferring to Harrison Barnes, a Warriors player who had missed games with an\ninjury.The group ran the court for an hour, playing games to 13 by twos and\nthrees. Lacob, 60, was one of the older players there, and he had clearly\nthought through his strengths and limitations. He would head to a particular\nspot — often one on the right side, about a third of the way around the three-\npoint arc — and wait. When he saw an opportunity, he called for the ball or\ncut along the arc toward it. If he received a pass, he would usually shoot.\nHis shot was peculiar, fluttering like a knuckleball, rotating only a few\ntimes before it reached the basket, but it went in more often than not. The\nfirst game ended with his sinking a three-pointer, then raising his arms in\ntriumph. A few minutes later, his team moved in position to win again. Lacob\nstood at the top of the key with the ball. “Here comes the game-winner,” he\nsaid to nobody in particular.After he finished playing, Lacob wiped the\nperspiration from his hands with a towel. Then he pulled out his championship\nring and passed it around for examination. “They’ve been asking to see it for\ntwo months,” he explained. The ring had an extravagant and revealing design.\nOne diamond had been inlaid for each of the 200-odd games the Warriors won\nfrom 2010, when Lacob and his investors bought the team, through last year’s\nN.B.A. finals. “How much does this thing weigh?” asked Tom McConnell, the\nmanaging director from Vanguard Ventures, lifting his hand up and down as if\ntrying to estimate its value.Silicon Valley — the place itself, but also the\nsociety of smart, technologically savvy people who surround it — is full of\nbasketball fans. Many of them made a lot of money in their 30s and 40s. Now in\ntheir 50s, they’re looking for something gratifying to do with it. In 2002,\nWyc Grousbeck, a principal at Highland Capital Partners who spent two years at\nStanford’s business school, bought the Boston Celtics along with a group of\ninvestors that included Lacob. In recent years, venture capitalists, private-\nequity investors and hedge-funders have been acquiring N.B.A. teams. The\nDetroit Pistons, Milwaukee Bucks, Philadelphia 76ers and Atlanta Hawks all\nbelong to this new class of investor. The Sacramento Kings and the Memphis\nGrizzlies are both owned by Silicon Valley engineers. If you include Lacob’s\nWarriors, that’s more than a quarter of the league.Lacob was not the first\nventure capitalist to buy a franchise, but he is the first to operate one\naccording to what might be called Silicon Valley precepts: nimble management,\nopen communication, integrating the wisdom of outside advisers and continuous\nre-evaluation of what companies do and how they do it. None of that typically\nhappens in professional sports. Most franchise owners of previous generations\nbecame wealthy mastering businesses that did one specific thing, if only\nbecause that was the way that people used to become wealthy in America.\nThey’ve run their teams, for better or worse, in the same autocratic,\nhidebound fashion that they ran those companies. As a manager, Lacob prefers\nto surround himself with expertise and exploit it.This season, Lacob’s sixth\nas majority owner, the Warriors are on pace to break the league record of 72\nwins in a season (which is just 82 games long). He and his partners bought a\nteam that already had Stephen Curry, Golden State’s best player and a\ntranscendent talent who is having one of the most dominant seasons in league\nhistory. He would be hitting tongue-flick jump shots from 30 feet away from\nthe basket no matter who owned it.But Lacob won’t accept that what the\nWarriors have achieved is a product of anything but a master plan. “The great,\ngreat venture capitalists who built company after company, that’s not an\naccident,” he said. “And none of this is an accident, either.”After the pickup\ngame, Lacob pulled on a sweatshirt and went to breakfast at a cafeteria on the\nground floor. He goes there so often that one of the smoothies on the menu,\ninvolving orange juice, vanilla yogurt, bananas and strawberries, has been\nnamed for him. He pointed this out, then ordered one. When I asked him about\nthe previous night’s game, he could hardly contain himself. He boasted that\nthe Warriors are playing in a far more sophisticated fashion than the rest of\nthe league. “We’ve crushed them on the basketball court, and we’re going to\nfor years because of the way we’ve built this team,” he said. But what really\nset the franchise apart, he said, was the way it operated as a business.\n“We’re light-years ahead of probably every other team in structure, in\nplanning, in how we’re going to go about things,” he said. “We’re going to be\na handful for the rest of the N.B.A. to deal with for a long time.”**When\nLacob** and his group of investors bought the Warriors in 2010, the $450\nmillion they paid was deemed wildly excessive by nearly everyone. Larry\nEllison, one of the 10 richest people in the world, was the losing bidder. It\nwas more than anyone had ever spent on an N.B.A. franchise at the time. And\nthis wasn’t the Lakers or the Celtics or even the Knicks. This was the\nWarriors, a team that plays in Oakland and had last won a championship in\n1975. In 2010, Lacob promised another within five years. And last June, the\nWarriors won the finals, defeating LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers in\nsix games.In the months since, they’ve attained the status of a cultural\nphenomenon. More than any team since the “Showtime” Lakers of Magic Johnson\nand Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, they’ve become famous not just for winning but also\nfor how they win. You don’t need to know the nuances of the sport to\nappreciate Curry’s uncanny accuracy, or the fact that he routinely launches\nshots from longer distances than anyone ever has. You just need Internet\naccess and a willingness to suspend disbelief. Curry has moved beyond\n“SportsCenter” to mainstream pop culture; even his 3-year-old, Riley, has\ndeveloped a following. When Curry went on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” to be\ninterviewed, a reaction shot of her in the audience elicited the biggest cheer\nof the night.What’s happening with the Warriors as a business isn’t something\nKimmel is likely to mention, but it’s equally impressive. The $450 million\nthat Lacob’s group paid to Chris Cohan, the former owner, seemed so laughably\nexpensive because of the woeful state of the Warriors franchise. This wasn’t\njust a bad team, but a team that seemed permanently stuck in a state of\nirrelevance. “The little engine that couldn’t” is how the investor Nick\nSwinmurn, the founder of Zappos and a lifelong fan of the Warriors, describes\nit. During Cohan’s 16-year ownership, the Warriors had reached the N.B.A.\nplayoffs only once. Sixteen of the league’s 30 teams advance every season. “So\non an odds basis,” Lacob notes, “you’re supposed to make it half the time.\nSomething was very wrong.”Such ineptitude had eroded interest. There were only\n7,000 season-ticket holders. The arena where the team played, in a vast\nparking lot beside a highway, was outdated. Its corridors were narrow, its\ncatering facilities rudimentary. It didn’t have rooms that could be leased for\ncorporate meetings. While the league’s newest facilities have been built with\npalatial home clubhouses the size of health clubs, the Warriors’ was austere\nand cramped. One look at it during a road trip was said to discourage players\naround the league from considering the team when they became free agents.Other\npotential buyers perceived the institutional decrepitude as a drawback. Lacob\nand his partner, the Hollywood entrepreneur Peter Guber, believed it\nrepresented an opportunity. “That’s what Joe does,” says Chip Perry, the\nfounder of Autotrader.com, a Kleiner Perkins investment that Lacob aided as a\nboard member for 14 years. “He saw potential in what we were doing with\nAutotrader, even when others were dismissive. He’s one of those rare people\nwho can look around the corner and see something interesting.” In the\nWarriors, Lacob saw a start-up disguised as an underperforming business, a\nsports franchise that had been run autocratically — and therefore ineptly — as\nthe industry evolved around it.That $450 million investment is now worth\naround $2 billion. In 2019, the Warriors will move to a new, self-financed\narena complex on the San Francisco waterfront that will include office\nbuildings and commercial space. The move is estimated to add as much as $1\nbillion more to the club’s value. And while there’s only one Curry, the way\nLacob and Guber run the franchise is replicable — at least in theory.Among\nthis emergent generation of investment tycoons, that hasn’t gone unnoticed. “I\nknew what Joe had done,” said Marc Lasry of Avenue Capital Group, a Moroccan-\nborn billionaire who partnered with the private-equity investor Wesley Edens\nto buy the Milwaukee Bucks in 2014. “We’re trying to do the same.” Lasry\ninsists he loves basketball, but the way he described his intentions sounded\nless like “Hoosiers” than like “The Big Short”: “We looked at it and said:\n‘The Bucks have huge potential. We think we can bring in the way we do\nbusiness and do a huge turnaround.’ ”Venture capitalists make large\ninvestments in companies that they don’t necessarily control. Lacob brought\nthe same mind-set, if not the actual structure, to his basketball team. “In\nventure capital, I started 70 companies,” he told me. “I also watched my\npartners’ deals, maybe 200 of them. That’s a lot of companies. I thought about\nthe way we design a board of directors, the way we design the financing.\nThere’s an architecture to it. And I started thinking about the architecture I\nwould use when I owned and built my own team someday.”Lacob gave Guber, who\nowns a smaller share, all but equal standing because Guber brought four\ndecades of connections in movies, music, sports and media to the deal.\nTogether, they hired a general manager who had never worked for a team before,\nlet alone run one, and two coaches who hadn’t coached at any level. At the\ntime, these moves were perceived around the league as rookie mistakes. But\nLacob was no rookie, not at building companies. And it turned out that they\nwere not mistakes.**Underneath the stands** in Oracle Arena, off a corridor\nthat connects the Warriors’ clubhouse to the court, is a modest-size room\nwhere Cohan, when he was owner, entertained family and friends. After taking\ncontrol, Lacob renamed it the Bridge Club and opened it to the team’s minority\nshareholders and their guests. They congregate there before each game, filling\nplates with carved roast beef and elaborate canapés. There is an open bar and,\nfor those who prefer fine wine, unencumbered access to it from automated,\nclimate-controlled dispensers.One evening this season, Lacob arrived late\nafter fighting traffic from Menlo Park. He asked politely for a turkey burger,\nthen found a seat at a high-top table. Between bites, he greeted a steady flow\nof friends and colleagues, most of whom are big names in Silicon Valley. John\nWalecka of Redpoint Ventures — whose current investments include companies\ncalled Moogsoft, Quantifind, Datameer and Qihoo 360 Technology — walked past.\nSo did Mark Stevens, who was a partner at Sequoia Capital when the firm helped\nfinance Google, PayPal and LinkedIn.The Bridge Club has become one of the best\nvenues for venture-capital networking in the Bay Area. It’s a perk for the\nminority owners, but it serves a purpose for Lacob. Before and after each\ngame, he’s accessible to any investors who want his ear. “It’s the atmosphere\nof knowing you have a voice — knowing you’re part of this,” he explained. “One\nthing I didn’t like when I owned part of the Celtics — was I really heard? I\ndon’t know. I wanted to make sure that when I did this, everybody got\nheard.”The N.B.A. demands that each franchise confer one owner, regardless of\nstake size, with nearly dictatorial power. Lacob wields his softly, just as he\ntypically sits in the back of corporate board meetings without saying much,\nabsorbing information, then guiding the discussion toward a decision. “I’m a\nprofessional listener,” he told me. “There’s a lot of smart people in the\nworld, you know. I’m not the smartest. I’m just an integrator. The N.B.A.\nisn’t like the outside world. I can do whatever I want. But you don’t treat\npeople that way.”Even teams in small markets cost hundreds of millions of\ndollars these days. Unless you’re Steve Ballmer, the former Microsoft chief\nwho spent $2 billion on the Los Angeles Clippers without the help of outside\ninvestors, most potential owners don’t have the wherewithal, or the gumption,\nto finance a purchase themselves. But rather than money without strings\nattached — investors who would have little involvement beyond writing checks —\nLacob and Guber purposefully sought out entrepreneurs and businessmen with\nattributes and access that complemented their own. “Everyone he’s partnered\nwith has a strategic reason to be there,” says Dennis Mannion, C.E.O. of the\nDetroit Pistons, who has held executive positions with teams in all four major\nAmerican sports leagues. “You have this phenomenal bullpen of talent.”So after\nthe shareholder Dennis Wong, the managing director of SPI Holdings, advised\nLacob on the real estate purchase for the new arena, Walecka helped with the\nfinancing. When I spoke with Swinmurn, he reeled off rapid-fire opinions on\nthe design of the Warriors’ branded attire, the type of food sold at the\nconcession stands and other disparate topics. Occasionally, minority partners\ncan even influence what happens on the court. John Burbank of Passport\nCapital, who uses a deep knowledge of mathematics in his own investments,\ncontributes detailed memos applying complex metrics to potential acquisitions.\n“I don’t know if any of it has 180ed us on a player,” Bob Myers, the Warriors’\ngeneral manager, told me, “but it has certainly moved us in a direction, one\nway or another. And he’s done it enough that it’s just the course of things\nnow. It’s part of the process.”Small-percentage shareholders have always\nexisted in sports, but they’ve typically been local doctors or car dealers\nwho’ve thrown in maybe a few hundred thousand dollars. They get a trip to\nspring training or a playoff game, a handshake at the Christmas party, a nice\nprofit when they sell their shares, and not much else. “Nothing is more\nlimited than being a limited partner of George Steinbrenner’s” is a quip that\nis most frequently attributed to the former Yankees investor John McMullen.But\nsports isn’t a small industry anymore. Playing the games and charging people\nto see them now constitutes only a fraction of the business. Franchises run\ngourmet restaurants and concert venues these days, and entire streets of\nretail outlets. They service fans in distant cities through audio and video\nstreaming and proprietary content. Those owners who want to personally dictate\neverything “down to the color of the underwear,” as Stevens puts it, can find\nthemselves at a competitive disadvantage. “It’s very hard when someone has had\ngreat success in another business — the fish-delivery business, the box-\ncutting business,” Guber says. “And then you come into this because ‘I want to\nbuy a sports team, and I know how to run a business.’ That just isn’t a\nformula for great success in today’s world.”Lacob’s experience in venture\ncapital, building a diverse portfolio of businesses, prepared him well for the\npeculiarities of owning a franchise, which perhaps explained why spending time\nin the Warriors’ front office often felt like hanging out at a software\ncompany. Soon after buying the team, Lacob supervised the removal of the walls\ninside its headquarters, which sit atop a parking garage in downtown Oakland.\nThe various departments now share the same open-plan room; when I visited, I\nkept expecting to see a kegerator or some hoverboards. “You walk through there\nnow, and it’s young, and there’s excitement,” said Gib Arnold, a former\nUniversity of Hawaii head coach, who spent several days observing the\nfranchise last year. “It’s Google in the N.B.A.”**In sports,** unlike other\nbusinesses, companies have two bottom lines. Their owners want to win, of\ncourse, but they also want to make money, and the two are linked more loosely\nthan you might think. You can make a lot of money with a bad team, as the\nN.F.L.’s Washington Redskins have done since 1999, when they were bought by\nDaniel Snyder. He has been a terrible owner, winning just 43 percent of his\ngames, burning through seven head coaches, never reaching the Super Bowl and\nstubbornly refusing to change the team’s polarizing name. Yet if you judge him\nby the standards of any other business, he has been exemplary. The Redskins\nare the third-highest-grossing team in the N.F.L.; Snyder’s $800 million\ninvestment has more than tripled. If the team had public stockholders, they\nwould be giving him a party.Competitive success is more elusive. Teams that\nwin a sequence of titles, or even come close, need superior talent. That’s\nespecially true in basketball, where an extraordinary player — a Bill Russell,\na Magic Johnson or a Michael Jordan — is one of only 10 on the court at any\ntime. Put two or more together, uniting Kareem Abdul-Jabbar with Johnson or\nJordan with Scottie Pippen, and you can create what in sports is\nhyperbolically called a dynasty.How much this ever has to do with the owner of\nthe team is questionable. The Chicago Bulls amassed six N.B.A. titles with\nJordan. But Jerry Reinsdorf, who bought the franchise in 1985, hasn’t won\nsince the last of those titles, in 1998. (He also has owned baseball’s Chicago\nWhite Sox since 1981. The White Sox won the World Series in 2005 but otherwise\nhave performed unmemorably.) Whatever magic Reinsdorf used to create the Bulls\ndynasty in the 1990s presumably remains at his disposal, yet the team has\ncracked .500 in just seven of the 17 seasons since Jordan departed. The\ndetermining factor there seems easy to identify.This isn’t to say that owners\nhave no impact. They choose how to spend their money — and how much of it to\nspend. They determine the goals of a franchise and how it will go about\nattaining them. But their attempts to directly influence the sports side of\ntheir operations have usually ended badly. “These people have been wildly\nsuccessful in all their endeavors,” says Jerry West, the N.B.A. Hall of Famer\nwho spent 20 years as the general manager of the Los Angeles Lakers. “But\nbeing involved in a sports team is so much different than anything they’ve\ndone in their lives.”In Los Angeles, West worked for Jerry Buss, arguably the\nmost successful owner in modern sports history. Buss presided over a franchise\nthat reached the N.B.A. finals 16 times in his 33 seasons. He also invented or\nperfected club seating, luxury boxes and the glitzy showmanship that now seems\nan integral part of sporting events. “Jerry Buss was an innovator who thought\nbasketball should have the cachet of a Broadway show,” West told me. “The fun!\nThe excitement! But what made that possible? It was winning the way we won.\nMagic Johnson played the game with a joy that everyone could see. And he\nplayed with maybe the greatest player ever in Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. And he had\nJames Worthy. We had seven players you could put on an All-Star team. And\nJerry Buss had nothing to do with that.”As West describes it, Buss regularly\nneeded to be talked out of personnel moves that would have destroyed his team.\n“You don’t know some of the things that he wanted to do,” West said. He\ndescribed one potential trade that Buss agreed to make: Worthy, the future\nHall of Famer, to Dallas for Mark Aguirre and Roy Tarpley, who each had a\nreputation for being easily distracted. West found that idea so objectionable\nthat he vowed to quit if Buss didn’t renege. “I went home to my wife and said,\n‘I’m probably going to lose my job, but I can’t have this happen,’ ” he says.\nIn the end, West says, he was able to persuade Buss.When Lacob and Guber\nbought the Warriors, they hired West as a senior adviser. They hoped his\nreputation as a basketball genius could stave off criticism of any\ncontroversial personnel moves they might make — “the cover of darkness,” as\nGuber termed it. “Peter said, ‘We’re taking over this team, it’s a disaster,\nit’s going to be ugly, all these things will go wrong, we’re not going to win\nfor a while,’ ” Lacob recalls. “If we make a mistake, ‘Well, Jerry West\nthought it was a good idea.’ ” But West was also promised a deeper role, one\nwithout decision-making power but with plenty of input. “Bringing in Jerry\nWest is not just a V.C. move but a typical Kleiner move,” says Vanguard\nVentures’ McConnell. “They always put Nobel laureates on their advisory\nboards. In basketball, that’s West.”West is known for his spirited, and\noccasionally profane, defense of his strongly held opinions. But Lacob doesn’t\nmind the shouting. His professional experience involved investing hundreds of\nmillions of dollars in nascent businesses, some of them in categories that\ndidn’t yet exist, then relying on the judgment of the executives he hired to\nguide them to profitability. He doesn’t just appreciate conviction; he relies\non it.Since joining the Warriors, West has disagreed strongly with Lacob on\nseveral personnel moves. Each time, Lacob has deferred. “Not everything you’ll\ndo as an owner will work,” West says. “Some things that you’ll do, or might\nwant to do, will not work. So you have to have the right people in place who\ncan tell you that, not people who will crumble as soon as you express your\nopinion. That’s the first part. And then you have to be willing to listen to\nthem.” With all the innovations that the ownership group has put into place,\nWest seems to be saying, if Lacob’s skin had been a little thinner or his need\nto assert his authority a little greater, the Warriors might still be\nstruggling.**Lacob has** fantasized about owning a team since he was 9, when\nhe walked into a Boys Club in New Bedford, Mass., his hometown, and saw his\nfirst parquet basketball floor. He graduated from the University of\nCalifornia, Irvine, as the first in his family to attend college and earned\nadditional degrees at U.C.L.A. and Stanford. By then, his life’s blueprint was\njust about complete. He would use the first half to get rich, then devote the\nrest to acquiring and running a team. “The first day that I met Joe, in 1998,\nhe told me that he wanted to buy the Warriors,” says Warren Thaler, a former\nCleveland Cavaliers director who serves with Lacob on the board of Align\nTechnology.Once he had his investors in place, Lacob treated the Warriors like\nanother of his fledgling companies in need of adept management. In 2011, he\nhired Bob Myers as an assistant general manager. He promoted him to general\nmanager a year later. Myers, now 41, lettered in basketball at U.C.L.A. as a\nwalk-on, studied law at Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles, then started a career\nas an agent, representing athletes. “The reason I’m sitting here now is\nbecause of that V.C. model,” he told me. “I had no track record. I had no past\nexperience. If you only believed in past performance, you’re talking to\nsomeone else. I mean, I wouldn’t have hired me.” Last season, Myers was named\nthe N.B.A.’s Executive of the Year.At Kleiner Perkins, Lacob was often forced\nto change entire management teams and restructure companies before he could\nmake them profitable. He wasn’t daunted by the challenge of turning around the\nWarriors. “You make highly contentious decisions in venture capital all the\ntime,” says Trae Vassallo, a former Kleiner Perkins partner who worked with\nLacob. “But not everybody sees them.”In March 2012, Lacob took the microphone\nduring a game at halftime to honor Chris Mullin, who played for Golden State\nfrom 1985 to 1997. From the moment he began speaking, Lacob was booed. It had\nnothing to do with Mullin. The previous week, the Warriors sent Monta Ellis,\nthe team’s most popular player, to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Andrew\nBogut. With time, that would take its place among the most effective trades in\nbasketball history. The Warriors did more than acquire Bogut, a seven-footer\nwho had missed half the season with a broken ankle. Trading Ellis allowed\nCurry, the point guard, to look for his own shots instead of mainly\nfacilitating Ellis’s. In truth, Lacob hadn’t wanted to trade Ellis. His\nbasketball advisers, including West, persuaded him. “They made their case,\nespecially Jerry,” Lacob says, “and I accepted it. They were right.”Lacob\nunderstood that the Warriors, who had a losing record, needed to be dismantled\nbefore they could be rebuilt. He often had to implement a similar strategy\nwith struggling companies. But the fans had been hearing about long-range\nplans for decades and had little confidence in them. And now they no longer\nhad Ellis. The booing continued for so long that the former Warrior Rick Barry\nhad to beseech the crowd to allow the ceremony to continue. By then, Lacob was\nshaking. The humiliation was so public, so raw, that Lacob’s friends were\nmoved to send messages of support. Many mention it now, four years later, as a\nrite of passage.That fall, the team had to decide whether to extend Curry’s\ncontract. The guard had shown flashes of exceptional talent, but he kept\ninjuring his ankles. The previous season, which was shortened by a labor\ndispute, he missed 40 of 66 games. “We had to make a decision in the margins,\nin the gray area,” Myers says. “He was hurt at the time — he’d just sprained\nhis ankle again.” Lacob listened to both sides. Then he asked if anyone could\nrecall an N.B.A. player whose career had ended because of ankle injuries.\n“Nobody could think of any,” Myers says. “And that kind of made the decision\nfor us.”What they did by offering Curry a four-year, $44 million extension,\nLacob explained, was rely not on the future stability of Curry’s anatomy so\nmuch as the composition of his psyche: his determination to push through\nnagging discomfort to make himself great. “Now, if we were wrong, we’d just\ncommitted $44 million to a player who can’t play basketball,” Myers says. “So\nthe risk was there.” Not only has Curry developed into the sport’s best\nplayer, but his paltry — in terms of N.B.A. superstardom — $11 million annual\ncompensation gives the Warriors ample salary-cap room to surround him with\nother talent.In 2011, Lacob and Guber chose Mark Jackson, the former St.\nJohn’s and Knicks point guard, to be their team’s head coach. Jackson was an\nunusual hire; he played for seven N.B.A. teams and worked as a commentator,\nbut he had never coached. In his second and third seasons, he led the Warriors\nto the playoffs. “We were at the zero-yard line when Mark showed up here,”\nMyers says. “And he got us to the playoffs, and we won a round and became\nrespectable.” So when Lacob fired him in 2014, after a 51-31 season, and\nreplaced him with Steve Kerr, the basketball world was shocked. But Lacob had\ndecided that a different type of leadership was needed for the Warriors to\nmake the leap from a playoff team to a championship team. Such noodling with\nsuccess, replacing a leader with a limited strategic vision with another who\nis comfortable aiming higher, rarely happens in sports. But in venture capital\nit happens all the time.Lacob had known Kerr since the late ’90s. They had\nbeen part of a group that traveled to Scotland on golfing trips. Kerr won\nN.B.A. titles as a player, first with Jordan and the Bulls and later with the\nSpurs. He ran the Suns’ front office as their general manager. He had\ncommentated on N.B.A. broadcasts. What he hadn’t done, as the man in charge or\neven as an assistant, was coach a basketball team. But Lacob had an intuition\nthat Kerr would do better in the organization’s structure — in which\ndepartment heads are expected to weigh in on matters outside their\njurisdiction — than the more regimented Jackson.Kerr’s willingness to at least\nconsider suggestions from almost any source may have saved the Warriors during\nlast year’s championship series. They were behind Cleveland, 2-1, when Nick\nU’Ren — Kerr’s assistant, whose responsibilities include constructing the\nmusical playlists used during practices and splicing highlight reels —\nhappened to be watching a tape of the 2014 playoffs. Noticing how San Antonio\ndefended LeBron James, he suggested that the Warriors replace Bogut in the\nlineup with Andre Iguodala, who is half a foot shorter but athletic enough to\nat least force James to work to get good shots. Kerr took the suggestion, and\nthe Warriors didn’t lose another game. Kerr publicly gave U’Ren the\ncredit.“I’ve played for nine different organizations,” Shaun Livingston, a\nWarriors guard, told me, “and I’ve never seen anything like that. This wasn’t\neven an assistant coach; it was a video coordinator. And Steve Kerr listened\nto him, and he did it. All the bridges are open here. There’s an open forum of\nideas. A good idea really can come from anywhere. And that kind of thinking\nhas to start at the top.”**But you know** what’s a really good idea? Letting\nCurry shoot the ball 16 times from beyond the three-point line, as the\nWarriors did during a February game against Oklahoma City. The Warriors take\nmore three-point shots than any other team, and they make a lot more of them —\n20 percent more than the closest-ranking team, the Houston Rockets. In a\nsense, they’ve turned the standard way to run a basketball offense inside-out\nby looking to end a possession not with a layup but with an open jumper from\nback near midcourt. It’s a revolutionary strategy, but one that seems likely\nto work only if you have Curry to take the shot. And like so much else about\nCurry, that obscures the impact of Lacob and Guber’s innovations. Maybe they\nwould have transformed the franchise without Curry, but it’s impossible to\nknow.Oklahoma City was the Warriors’ sixth stop in nine days on a winter road\ntrip that had strained the limits of continental travel, from Portland to Los\nAngeles to Miami, and a loss to one of the league’s best teams would hardly\nhave been a disgrace. Curry wouldn’t let it happen. He made 12 of those three-\npointers, scoring 47 points in all. And with four seconds left in overtime and\nthe game tied at 118, he brought the ball past the half-court line and stopped\nto set himself just beyond the R in the Thunder logo that straddles midcourt.\nThen he swished a jump shot. The Warriors, who led for a total of 29 seconds\nout of 53 minutes of play, had won again.Even after winning the league’s\nM.V.P. award last season, Curry has improved in virtually every trackable\nmetric. He is averaging more than 30 points a game while making 51 percent of\nhis shots, including a preposterous 46 percent of three-pointers. Still,\nthere’s no way to do statistical justice to those stretches on the court,\nsometimes a minute or two and sometimes an entire quarter, when Curry appears\nto have entered a freeze frame, running around while everyone else remains\nstill.I saw it happen in Oakland this season. The Warriors were behind Phoenix\nin the second quarter. Curry hit a casually spectacular fadeaway from the foul\nline that ended with him sitting on the court. Then he brought the ball\ndowncourt at speed and abruptly flipped it to another player, who was\nunguarded, without looking his way, creating an easy jumper. Finally, with the\ncrowd at full roar, Curry launched the ball from several steps beyond the\nthree-point line, and its parabola toward the basket seemed to last forever.\nIt was impossible to watch the ball and Curry at the same time, but out of the\ncorner of my eye I saw Curry turn and begin to run back downcourt, his arms\nspread wide, before his shot had even reached the top of its trajectory. For\nme, the moment seemed to crystallize the entire Warriors season.Lacob presents\nwinning as an inevitable result of the way the team has been constructed. I\ncouldn’t argue with one of the best records in N.B.A. history. Yet I also\ncouldn’t shake the idea that the story could easily have gone a different\ndirection. Since the start of the 2013-14 season, the Warriors have won 76\npercent of their games. Playing without Curry, they’re 3-6. And if he were\nsidelined for the playoffs tomorrow, it seems unlikely that the Warriors would\nbe favored to win the championship. As with Jordan and the Bulls, a strong\ncase can be made that Curry, not the ownership group, provides the point of\ndifference. “They did what every really good organization should do with their\nstar,” the Bucks’ Lasry said. “They nurtured him. But they got lucky in that\nSteph became far and away the best player in the league.”Still, Curry’s mere\npresence wouldn’t have created the means to overhaul a franchise. It takes an\nextraordinary player to do it — but that isn’t all it takes. LeBron James\nstill hasn’t won a championship for the Cavaliers; playing together, the\nperennial All-Stars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook haven’t won in Oklahoma\nCity. The decision to keep Curry, coupled with the good fortune that he\nremained healthy and grew into a transcendent player, gave Lacob and Guber’s\nstructural innovations the chance to have their desired effect. But as Lacob\nsees it, Curry’s dominance on the court, though essential, is inextricable\nfrom everything else he’s done with the franchise over the last few years,\nfrom knocking down the office walls to the Ellis trade. “It’s not just Steph\nCurry,” he told me once. “It’s architecting a team, a style of play, the way\nthey all play together. It’s all extremely thought through.”This confluence of\ngood planning and luck reminded me of a conversation I had with Lacob over a\nglass of wine one evening at the Bridge Club. He confided that he figures he’s\none of the 10 best blackjack players in the world. “I shouldn’t say this,” he\nadded, “but I’ve won over $1 million at one sitting nine times.” As in\ngambling, there are no certain outcomes in sports, which is exactly what makes\nthem worth watching. Whether you’re playing pickup basketball on a Tuesday\nmorning or hoping to turn a substandard N.B.A. franchise into a champion, all\nyou can do is try to increase your chances of getting the outcome you desire.\nIt was easy to see that Lacob had a knack for doing just that. For everything\nhe did, he had worked out a system.As an undergraduate at Irvine, Lacob took a\ncalculus class from Edward Thorp, whose 1962 book, “Beat the Dealer,” proved\nthat a blackjack player could gain a slight edge on the house by counting\ncards. Thorp was banned by casinos, so he taught his students the system,\nbacked them on trips to Las Vegas and shared in the rewards. Lacob was one of\nthose students. When he goes to a casino now, his blackjack sessions aren’t\ncertainties, but Lacob has far better odds of succeeding at them than anyone\nelse at the table. His purchase of the Warriors, I realized, was the same way.\nHe counted the cards and played the odds. And he won.__\n\n","title":"What Happened When Venture Capitalists Took Over the Golden State Warriors - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTmag: What happened when venture capitalists took over the Golden State Warriors https://t.co/JC0y4On8ME https://t.co/K4ghUchFoz","date":"Fri Apr 01 20:00:20 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715992209951219713"},"retweets":46},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PJQgjo"}

Slack is part of a group\nof prominent start-ups known as “unicorns,” private companies valued at $1\nbillion or more.“As has always been the case, we are taking this opportunity\nto further secure our leadership position as we continue to execute on our\nambitious growth plans,” Stewart Butterfield, chief executive of Slack, said\nin a statement. “This capital adds to our existing reserves and increases our\nability to focus on an uncompromising long-term, strategic view.”The\nfinancing, which puts Slack’s value at nearly $1 billion more than at its last\nmajor financing round nearly a year ago, comes during a tumultuous financing\nclimate for technology start-ups. Many companies have faced difficulties\nraising subsequent rounds of venture capital over the last six months as\ninvestors look for progress in revenue growth and profit — items which, in\nrecent years, have often taken a back seat to promoting high user growth.Slack\nhas promoted its early emphasis on paid customer accounts that accompany early\nuser growth, noting that more than 800,000 users pay for the service.The\nround, which brings Slack’s total venture financing to $540 million, was led\nby the new investors Thrive Capital with participation from GGV and Comcast\nVentures, along with a cohort of existing investors including Accel Partners\nand Spark Growth.“We believe Slack will define the future of seamless\ncommunication in an increasingly complex world across platforms, teams and\napplications,” Josh Kushner, managing partner at Thrive Capital, said in a\nstatement.Slack, begun in 2013 by Mr. Butterfield and a handful of other\nentrepreneurs, was the byproduct of a failed attempt to create a big\nmultiplayer online game called Glitch, which was released in 2011. The team\nused an internal version of group chat to communicate with one another while\nbuilding the game. When Glitch was shuttered in 2012, Mr. Butterfield and his\npartners made the communication software the primary product offering.Over the\nlast few years, Slack has swollen to serve 2.7 million daily active users,\nincluding companies like Samsung, Spotify, eBay and the United States\nDepartment of State.But critics warn that while Slack may have traction with\ntech companies and small start-ups, it could be difficult for the company to\nattract the even larger corporations that would provide significant repeat\nrevenue over time.Recently, the ride-hailing service Uber dropped Slack\nbecause the service could not handle the thousands of Uber employees trying to\ncommunicate simultaneously, according to people who work at both\ncompanies.Slack must also compete with collaboration software companies like\nAtlassian, which went public in December and now has a market capitalization\nof around $5.3 billion, as well as companies like Campfire and Yammer, the\nlatter of which is owned by Microsoft.\n\n","title":"Slack, a Leading Unicorn, Raises $200 Million in New Financing - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Slack says it has raised $200 million in new financing, valuing the company at $3.6 billion https://t.co/beSLqHOcqq","date":"Fri Apr 01 19:40:08 +0000 2016","favs":104,"id":{"$numberLong":"715987130334490624"},"retweets":96},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PL1cNG"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01415"},"content":"One team clinched a World Series berth at Wrigley Field last October, but it\nwas not the Chicago Cubs. They never led in the National League Championship\nSeries, falling meekly to the Mets in four games. They responded with the\nperfect winter.The Cubs raided the roster of the St. Louis Cardinals, their\nforemost rivals and the reigning N.L. Central champions, for Jason Heyward and\nJohn Lackey. Heyward was the Cardinals’ star right fielder, Lackey their Game\n1 starter in the playoffs. The Cubs also signed second baseman Ben Zobrist,\nlast seen winning a title with the Kansas City Royals, and added reliever Adam\nWarren in a trade with the Yankees.Other teams also improved in the off-\nseason, but nobody this good got this much better. The Cubs were not building\nan instant contender, but topping off a skyscraper.These Cubs are strong\nenough to reach the World Series for the first time since 1945. Fate is rarely\nkind to the franchise, but no other force now stands in its way.“It all\ndepends on how we respond to the adversity that comes up during the season,\nwhich is the great unknown,” said Theo Epstein, the Cubs’ president for\nbaseball operations. “It’s the thing that defines every baseball team. What’s\nthe last team that hasn’t had any adversity? Maybe the ’84 Tigers. How many\nteams since then haven’t had to respond to some major stuff that’s come up\nduring the course of the season?“We’re a defending third-place team until\nwe’re not, but there’s a tremendous amount of trust that we have in the\ntalent, depth and character of the players in the clubhouse. It’s an exciting\ntime. I look forward to seeing what they can do in a very competitive\nenvironment.”The Cubs’ hitters strike out a lot, so they might still be\nvulnerable in a short series against the Mets. But some of their best hitters\nare so young and talented, they can and will improve. Remember: A year ago,\nKris Bryant, Addison Russell and Kyle Schwarber had never played in the\nmajors. We have probably not seen their best.With Lackey joining Jon Lester\nand the Cy Young Award winner Jake Arrieta, the Cubs have three elite\nstarters. They also have the depth and the dollars to make a major in-season\ntrade. Epstein and his lieutenants are aggressive and creative, and they will\nsurely be involved if Oakland tries to deal Sonny Gray or another team shops a\npremier pitcher.Of course, as Epstein noted, the Cubs did finish third last\nseason, behind the Cardinals and the Pittsburgh Pirates — but ahead of every\nother team in the majors. The good teams in the Central feasted off the\nrebuilding Cincinnati Reds and the Milwaukee Brewers, but health and age\nconcerns stalk the Cardinals, and the Pirates’ rotation is unimposing.Besides\nlosing Lackey, the Cardinals lost the reliable Lance Lynn to Tommy John\nsurgery. They welcome back Adam Wainwright, an ace who tore his Achilles’\ntendon last April, and signed Mike Leake. Carlos Martinez and Michael Wacha\nwere All-Stars last season, and Jaime Garcia had a 2.43 E.R.A. But Martinez\nand Wacha also wore down late, and Garcia has not made more than 20 starts in\na season since 2011.The Cardinals’ pitching still seems strong, but the lineup\nranked 24th in the majors in runs last season. Randal Grichuk and Stephen\nPiscotty will assume bigger roles after Heyward’s defection, but the team will\nmiss the injured Jhonny Peralta and will hope that its heartbeat — catcher\nYadier Molina — holds up after two thumb operations.We should know better by\nnow than to doubt the Pirates. The pitching coach Ray Searage finds the best\nin his pupils, and though the offense has been shut out at home in each of the\nlast two N.L. wild-card games, the lineup is strong, with potential to keep\nimproving. Yet that pitching staff seems likely to regress at some point.\nAfter Gerrit Cole, the starters — Francisco Liriano, Jeff Locke, Jon Niese and\nJuan Nicasio — are not durable. Only Cole has thrown 200 innings in a season,\nand the bullpen lost a few strong complementary parts over the winter. Tyler\nGlasnow and perhaps Jameson Taillon await in the minors.The Reds and the\nBrewers have familiar faces hanging around — Joey Votto, Brandon Phillips and\nJay Bruce in Cincinnati; Ryan Braun and Jonathan Lucroy in Milwaukee — but\nhave otherwise been torn down. They have few reliable pitchers to spare, and\nthe Brewers just lost one — the standout reliever Will Smith — to a torn knee\nligament sustained in a most bizarre way.“I was standing on one leg, trying to\ntake the shoe off, and I pulled hard and it stayed on,” Smith told  The\nMilwaukee Journal  Sentinel. “My knee just went up and popped.”That sounds\nlike the kind of voodoo that once plagued the Mets, before their surge last\nsummer. They looked carefree early in spring training and ragged late, but all\nthat really matters is the health of their rotation. If those pitchers take\ntheir regular turns — and get a midseason boost from Zack Wheeler — the Mets\nshould win a second consecutive division title for the first time in their\nhistory.Full seasons from Yoenis Cespedes, Travis d’Arnaud and Michael\nConforto — who had not played above Class A at this point last season — should\nhelp give the Mets a top-tier offense. Concerns about the infield defense and\nDavid Wright’s durability should not be enough to knock the Mets from first\nplace.The Washington Nationals, though, will do their best. It would not be\nshocking to see them finally put everything together under Dusty Baker, their\nnew manager. But something always seems off about the Nationals, whose talent\npromises more than the players deliver — sometimes they flop in the regular\nseason, sometimes in October. Maybe Daniel Murphy, their new second baseman,\ncan help with the latter.The Nationals should win a wild-card berth, given\ntheir sturdy foundation: the N.L.’s best position player in Bryce Harper and\nan annual Cy Young Award candidate in Max Scherzer. A healthy Anthony Rendon\nwould greatly help the lineup, and consistent dominance from the free-agent-\nto-be Stephen Strasburg would bolster the rotation. So would a midseason call-\nup of Lucas Giolito, an overpowering right-hander.The Miami Marlins have not\nbeen to the postseason since 2003, and the N.L.’s longest drought is unlikely\nto end now. The Marlins’ rotation falls off sharply after Jose Fernandez and\nWei-Yin Chen, but some players command attention, like Fernandez and second\nbaseman Dee Gordon, who led the league in hitting and stolen bases while\nwinning a Gold Glove. The Marlins brought in their center-field fence by 11\nfeet, but the old dimensions could barely contain the slugger Giancarlo\nStanton anyway.The Philadelphia Phillies are not ready to contend, but they\nfinally have a clear direction. The trades of Cole Hamels and Ken Giles\nflooded the farm system with talent, and two pitchers from those deals, Jerad\nEickhoff and Vince Velasquez, join the rotation. Few teams have as much talent\non the left side of the infield as the Phillies, with third baseman Maikel\nFranco and the top shortstop prospect J. P. Crawford.The Atlanta Braves,\nlikewise, could be quite imposing in a year or two. For now, as they close\nTurner Field, they will keep one eye on their minor league system, which is\nstocked with high-end prospects. The major league roster, filled largely with\nplace-holding veterans, is not much to see.In the West, the calendar promises\nanother charmed ride for the San Francisco Giants. They won the World Series\nin 2010, 2012 and 2014, each time after missing the playoffs the previous\nseason.“I do think injuries have hurt us in the odd years,” General Manager\nBobby Evans said, citing Buster Posey in 2011, Angel Pagan in 2013 and Hunter\nPence in 2015. “I can’t foretell what would have happened, because everybody\nhas injuries. We had injuries in ’10 and ’12 and ’14, too, but we overcame\nthem.”Injury risks abound in the outfield, where Pence and the newcomer Denard\nSpan combined for just 113 games last season. Pagan, 34, has been fragile in\nhis career. But those three are still productive, as are the infielders and\nthe catcher, Posey, who support a strong pitching staff that now includes\nJohnny Cueto and Jeff Samardzija to help the redoubtable Madison Bumgarner.The\nArizona Diamondbacks also added two starters, at considerable cost. They\nagreed to a record $34.4 million average annual salary to lure Zack Greinke in\nfree agency, and they dealt Dansby Swanson — the No. 1 overall pick in last\nJune’s draft — in a package to Atlanta for Shelby Miller. The Diamondbacks\ninsist they are built to last.“The thing that irritates me the most is the\nidea that we were ‘all in for ’16,’ ” said Tony La Russa, the Diamondbacks’\nchief baseball officer. “ ‘All in for ’16’ means you totally dismantled the\nminor league system. People say we depleted it.”That, La Russa contends, is\nfalse. He points out that the Diamondbacks have acquired dozens of players 23\nor younger over the last two seasons. The average age on the roster at the end\nof last season was 26 years 341 days, the youngest in the majors.“The great\nmajority of our pitchers and position players are young,” La Russa said. “And\nthey did pretty good last year. But now, as contenders, you have to get to\nthat next level of terrain. So the question to be answered starting April 4 is\nhow quickly are we going to learn to develop those skills to get you those\nclose-game wins?”The guess here is that the Diamondbacks — who have smooth\nfielders and ranked eighth in the majors in runs last season — will win enough\nto snare a wild-card berth. They seem to have fewer questions than the Los\nAngeles Dodgers, who left spring training in tatters.Outfielder Andre Ethier,\nsecond baseman Howie Kendrick, catcher Yasmani Grandal, shortstop Corey\nSeager, and starters Brett Anderson, Mike Bolsinger and Scott Kazmir all have\nhealth questions, to varying degrees. It is still hard to know whether the\nDodgers will get the All-Star versions of outfielders Joc Pederson and Yasiel\nPuig, or something much less. Clayton Kershaw, at least, remains the most\ndominant mound force in baseball.Like the Central and East divisions, the West\nincludes two clear also-rans. The San Diego Padres (74-88 last season) and the\nColorado Rockies (68-94) did little this off-season to address their rosters.\nOutside expectations are low, and they know it.“Most people will give you kind\nof a generic answer, that if a team is not expected to do a lot, we’re going\nto surprise people,” Padres first baseman Wil Myers said. “But I really do\nbelieve that. We’ve got a team here that can really do some good things. We’ve\ngot the right players to make a run in September.”One thing we know is that an\ninflux of overwhelming talent will arrive at Petco Park in July. The Padres\nare hosting the All-Star Game.\n\n","title":"It Finally Looks Like the Cubs’ Turn - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Could this finally be the Cubs' year? https://t.co/pmFk4gGwFl https://t.co/7QUH2ykEQB","date":"Fri Apr 01 19:15:08 +0000 2016","favs":177,"id":{"$numberLong":"715980836894547969"},"retweets":91},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25BgtMU"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01416"},"content":"As sleek “engineered stone” countertops grow in popularity, safety experts are\nwarning that workers who handle them are at particularly high risk from an old\nworkplace hazard — silica, the mineral tied to silicosis, a debilitating and\npotentially deadly lung disease.The countertops are made from processed\nquartz, a material containing silica levels as high as 90 percent, or twice\nthe amount found in marble.When slabs of engineered stone are cut and finished\nto fit a kitchen or bathroom, large quantities of silica particles are\nreleased. If workers inhale them, it can start a process leading to silicosis\nas well as to lung cancer and kidney disease.The risks posed by the\ncountertops are receiving new scrutiny after the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration last week announced long-delayed rules to sharply reduce\nexposure to silica among workers. When announcing the changes, federal\nofficials and safety experts also reiterated warnings about the silica-related\nrisks posed by the new countertops.Outside the United States, where the use of\nengineered stone products first took off, there have been numerous cases of\nsilicosis. In Israel, for example, about 300 workers have been found to have\nthe disease, including 22 patients who have undergone lung transplants, said\nDr. Mordechai R. Kramer, who heads the Institute of Pulmonary Medicine in\nPetah Tikva, Israel.The countertops do not pose risks to consumers in their\nhomes. But workers handling engineered stone can have significant exposure to\nsilica, particularly if they are working without proper equipment.“It is the\npeople who get the slabs and cut them to size who are at risk,” said Dr. Paul\nD. Blanc, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San\nFrancisco, who specializes in occupational health.Imports of engineered stone\nslabs into the United States grew by about 50 percent from 2013 to 2014,\naccording to federal estimates. The products are popular with designers and\nconsumers because they are attractive, durable, easy to clean and cheaper than\nmarble counters.To produce them, quartz stones are crushed, mixed with plastic\nand formed into slabs. During the process, colors and other materials are\nadded to create a variety of surface finishes and textures.Major manufacturers\nof the products, which are sold under brand names like Zodiaq, Caesarstone and\nSilestone, include DuPont; Caesarstone Sdot-Yam, a company based in Israel;\nand Cosentino, which has its headquarters in Spain.Consumers buy the\ncountertops though retail stores, choosing the colors and styles they want\nfrom samples. An outside contractor then goes to a customer’s home, takes\nmeasurements, and cuts, drills and finishes the countertop in a workshop.A\n2012 article in a medical publication, Chest Journal, reported on the outbreak\nof silicosis in workers in Israel. Two years later, another publication, The\nInternational Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health, described a\nsimilar outbreak in Spain.In that study, researchers reported that while the\noverall number of silicosis cases in Spain had declined from 2003 to 2007, the\nnumber of cases had subsequently risen, driven by cases involving engineered\nstone. In some instances, workers needed lung transplants to survive.“The use\nof new construction materials such as quartz conglomerates has increased\nsilicosis incidence due to intense occupational exposures,” that study\nconcluded.In the United States, workplace controls are often better than those\nfound abroad. Nonetheless, a 2013 study by researchers at the University of\nOklahoma, who surveyed the safety equipment used at countertop fabrication\ncompanies in that state, found that most protections were inadequate. Such\ncompanies often employ just a handful of people.It is unclear in how many\ncases engineered stone has contributed to silicosis in the United States. Two\nyears ago, Texas health officials reported the first documented case in the\ncountry of silicosis among countertop workers. The man, Ublester Rodriguez,\nhad spent nearly a decade working with engineered stone countertops and other\nproducts containing silica.Mr. Rodriguez, a 39-year-old father of three who\nlives in the Houston area, declined to be interviewed for this article, citing\ncontinuing litigation. But in a pretrial deposition, Mr. Rodriguez, who now\nbreathes with the aid of an oxygen tank, testified he often left work covered\nin white dust.“When you come out of that room, your eyes were like white,” he\nsaid. “White. Your hair — your hair was like totally white because of the\ndust.”Manufacturers provide material safety data sheets describing the silica-\nrelated risks of engineered stone, and they say that worker hazards can be\neliminated using controls such as protective respirators and equipment\ndesigned to trap silica dust, like power saws that release streams of water.In\nresponse to written questions, Caesarstone said it did not know how many cases\nof silicosis had been reported among people working with its products or\nwhether the annual number of those cases was rising or falling.After the\narticle in Chest Journal, Caesarstone threatened legal action against the\npublication, which had documented the outbreak of silicosis in\nIsrael.Originally, the article used the term “Caesarstone silicosis” in its\ntitle, in reference to the company’s major position in the Israeli market for\nengineered stone. But soon after the study appeared, Caesarstone threatened to\nbring a lawsuit against the American College of Chest Physicians, the\norganization that publishes the journal, unless the term was\nremoved.“Utilization of Caesarstone’s trademark and trade name as a name of a\ndisease causes the company significant damage and irreparably harms its good\nwill,” the company wrote in a 2012 letter.In a statement, Dr. Richard S.\nIrwin, the publication’s editor in chief, said he decided to remove the term\nfrom the report because the types of silicosis described in it were not unique\nto Caesarstone but applied to engineered stone products in general.“Chest did\nnot make the change because of threatened legal action,” Dr. Irwin said in the\nstatement.Dr. Irwin added that the report’s authors agreed with his decision.\nDr. Kramer, the Israeli physician who led the study, estimated that\nCaesarstone accounted for 99 percent of the market there, adding that the\ncompany had faced dozens of lawsuits from injured workers.Dr. Blanc, the\nexpert at the University of California, said the cases of silicosis related to\nengineered stone already reported may be the forerunners of many more to\ncome.Along with the United States, the use of engineered stone is also booming\nin China, a nation where workers often have little safety protection. “You can\nonly imagine what is going on over there,” he said.\n\n","title":"Popular Quartz Countertops Pose a Risk to Workers - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Quartz countertops may be popular, but they also pose a risk to workers https://t.co/VkMcbbOyb2","date":"Fri Apr 01 18:40:05 +0000 2016","favs":60,"id":{"$numberLong":"715972014566195200"},"retweets":46},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25BcoYU"}

The newspaper\nspelled her name “Saga,” although most press reports refer to her as “Saja.”By\nher account a relative arranged for her to marry a man she described as a\nuniversity lecturer and “normal person” who went by the name Hisham Mohamed,\nbut the union was short-lived. She left him three months after the wedding\nbecause he had not told his first wife that he was marrying a second, she\nsaid. She claimed to have had a daughter by Mr. Baghdadi but told the\nnewspaper she had not spoken to him since 2009.The interview appeared to have\nbeen the first Ms. Dulaimi had ever done, but her name has been in the news\nbefore in recent years, along with her claim to have once been wed to the\nworld’s most wanted terrorist. The veracity of her story has always been\nunclear.In 2014 Ms. Dulaimi was arrested by Lebanon with her daughter while\ntrying to enter the country from Syria. At the time Lebanese authorities told\nreporters that she was Mr. Baghdadi’s ex-wife and the girl was his daughter,\nbut Iraqi officials at the time disagreed. She had been arrested once before\nin Syria but was released as part of a prisoner swap between the government\nand the Nusra Front, a Qaeda affiliate.Will McCants, the director of the\nBrookings Institution’s Project on U.S. Relations With the Islamic World, said\nhe had researched Ms. Dulaimi while writing his recent book, a history of the\nIslamic State. He said he was “highly suspicious” of her claims.“The Iraqi\nstate and Baghdadi’s former associates have all said he had two wives, not\nthree,” Mr. McCants said. Those women are named Asmaa Fawzi Muhammad al-\nKubaysi, who is his cousin, and Isra’ Rajab al-Qaysi. It is a short list and\nMs. Dulaimi’s name is not on it.Mr. McCants also pointed out that Ms. Dulaimi\ncalled the ISIS leader by the “wrong name” in her interview. Abu Bakr al-\nBaghdadi is a nom de guerre. He was born Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri, not\nHisham Mohamed. While he has used aliases in the past, Mr. McCants said he was\nnot aware of “Hisham Mohamed” ever being one of them.There are other\nbiographical details in Ms. Dulaimi’s account that appear not to fit with what\nis known about Mr. Baghdadi’s past. She described him as a quiet man who\nsometimes vanished for days at a time, but said she did not think he fought\nagainst American forces in Iraq as her first husband had.“I didn’t notice that\nhe was actively involved in the resistance movement at all,” she said.That was\nmost certainly not the case for Mr. Baghdadi in 2008. By the time Ms. Dulaimi\nclaims to have been married to the ISIS leader he was already rising through\nthe ranks of Al Qaeda in Iraq, serving as the head of its various Islamic law\ncommittees and growing close to its leaders, according to research by Mr.\nMcCants.\n\n","title":"ISIS Leader Is My Ex-Husband, Woman Says, but Doubts Remain - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"ISIS leader is my ex-husband, woman says, but doubts remain https://t.co/RdQY9u0YVt https://t.co/6UFF1TFMJE","date":"Fri Apr 01 18:15:35 +0000 2016","favs":172,"id":{"$numberLong":"715965851204190208"},"retweets":114},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1Sqy8Nz"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01418"},"content":"RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. — At the 10th tee, one of Danielle Kang’s amateur\nplaying partners greeted her with the news that she had holed out from the\nfairway for an eagle on Mission Hills Country Club’s par-4 first hole.“You\nwould have been so proud of me,” the player, Caitlyn Jenner, told Kang.Kang\nwas overjoyed for her friend but not because of any shot Jenner had hit on\nWednesday during the pro-am ahead of the first women’s major of the year, the\nANA Inspiration. At Tuesday night’s pro-am draw party, Kang had watched in\nwonder as Jenner was swarmed by well-wishers seeking autographs and snapping\nselfies.It was the first time Kang had been in public with Jenner, her\nlongtime friend, since Jenner had become the world’s most visible transgender\nwoman. Kang, 23, was struck by Jenner’s transformation — not in her physical\nappearance but in her public acceptance.As a teenager, Kang became close to\nJenner, then known as Bruce, a member at Sherwood Country Club outside Los\nAngeles, where Kang honed her game. Kang gave Jenner golf tips, and Jenner,\nthe 1976 Olympic decathlon gold medalist, offered her advice on excelling in\nthe competitive arena. They established a routine: Kang, a two-time United\nStates Women’s Amateur champion, would beat Jenner on the course, and Jenner\nwould buy her lunch afterward.Jenner took to affectionately calling Kang,\nwhose father died when she was young, “daughter.”“He was always a nice guy; he\nwas a good friend,” Kang said.But her relationship with Jenner caused\nconsternation within her circle of acquaintances. Some people did not\nunderstand why she chose to spend time with Jenner.“When he was Bruce, people\nwere like, ‘Oh, that guy’s weird,’ ” Kang said, adding: “People talked bad.\nThey always presumed all these ideas about him.”One afternoon when she was\naround 18, Kang said, she approached Jenner.“I didn’t like what people were\nsaying,” she said, adding: “I didn’t know if it was true. So I confronted him.\nI said, ‘What’s the deal here?’ ”Kang said Jenner invited her to lunch at the\nSherwood clubhouse and over sandwiches told her that he identified as a woman\nnamed Caitlyn and that he would on occasion dress up in a wig and women’s\nclothes in public at night.“He explained this whole deal,” said Kang, who\nasked Jenner if he still wished to be called Bruce. “He said, ‘Yeah,’ and I\nsaid, ‘O.K., I’ll call you Bruce until you become Caitlyn.’ ”Kang’s next words\nstrengthened their friendship. “O.K.,” she said, “let’s go play golf.’ ”In\n2013, Jenner played the pro-am of this event with Kang, who recalled, with a\nlaugh, that he expressed disappointment for a long time afterward that their\nteam did not win. Two years later, Jenner spoke for the first time publicly\nabout transitioning from a man to a woman in an interview with Diane Sawyer of\nABC.Jenner made her public debut as a woman on the cover of Vanity Fair’s July\n2015 issue. Overnight, Jenner acquired scores of new friends in the\ntransgender community. She became an instant role model for those in society\nwho felt like outsiders.But she never forgot Kang’s nonjudgmental acceptance.\nWhen Jenner decided to make her pro-am debut as Caitlyn at this year’s event\nat Mission Hills, there was no question with whom she would play. Kang’s\nmother, Grace Lee, said Jenner phoned the organizers and said, “I’m not\nplaying unless I’m playing with Danielle.”Jenner, who got her handicap down to\na 5 before she began to transition to a woman, has seen her game change over\nthe past year.“She says she putts better because of her boobs,” Kang said.\n“They anchor her.” She laughed. “She told me I should get a boob job.”Jenner’s\ngolf coming-out party was essentially two years in the making.“Last year I\nasked her to come,” Kang said. “She was going through the whole change stuff.\nI said, ‘O.K., well, you can come next year, then, when you’re Caitlyn.’ ”Kang\nsaid Jenner almost backed out of this year’s event because of a full schedule\nof appointments and previous commitments, including the filming of the second\nseason of her E! reality television show, “I Am Cait.”Kang said that she\ncajoled Jenner into rescheduling her other appointments and that she was so\nglad she did after seeing the positive reception Jenner received at the draw\nparty.“She’s exactly the same person to me,” Kang said. “I was like, ‘Wow,\npeople love you.’ ”She added, “However she has inspired them, it’s great to\nsee.”One of the golfers who had her photograph taken with Jenner was Jaye\nMarie Green, who posted the close-up of her cheek-to-cheek pose with Jenner on\nher Instagram account. Green was surprised when a few of her 19,600 followers\ndecided to unfollow her and wrote negative comments about the picture.Green,\n22, contemplated deleting the photograph, she said, “because I don’t like\nreading anything negative, ever.”But the photograph stayed.“I took a picture\nwith a human being,” Green said. “If someone’s mad about that, I can’t control\nwhat other people do in life.”Green added, “It kind of made me then realize\nwhat Caitlyn goes through every day.”Wednesday began far too early for\nJenner’s comfort. She is not a morning person but was on the first tee at 7\na.m., with the pro Marina Alex, who played the first nine holes with the group\nof four amateurs before handing them over to Kang. The amateurs included the\nrecently retired United States soccer star Abby Wambach, who said she took up\ngolf less than a year ago.Despite telling Matt Lauer of the “Today” show in an\ninterview last year that she intended to play from the women’s tees, Jenner\ndid not hit from the forward tees. She shared a cart with Wambach, who kept\nthe mood light with her high-decibel, high-energy high jinks, which included\njumping into Poppie’s Pond around the 18th green while fully clothed.On the\n12th tee, Jenner was answering questions when Wambach interjected, “She’s\nhappy with her partner.” Jenner tried to ignore her, but Wambach kept talking.\n“We’re partners in crime,” Wambach said.Jenner joked that her partner “lacks\nenthusiasm.” She smiled. “We’re having fun,” she said.The pro-am event was\ngood preparation for a coming women’s tournament at Sherwood in which Jenner\nintends to participate. “All the ladies want me to play,” she said.A\ntournament official said he had fielded more news media requests for Jenner\nthan for the world’s No. 1 women’s player, Lydia Ko.“I don’t worry about\npopularity,” Jenner said. “I feel like I’m in a position to do more.”\n\n","title":"Playing Alongside a Friend Now Known as Caitlyn - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTSports: At a pro-am, Caitlyn Jenner said she'd play only if her pro was Danielle Kang.

She said the reopening would depend on the outcome\nof labor negotiations between unions representing police officers at the\nairport and the Interior Ministry.The unions have been discussing their\nsecurity concerns with senior management in the Belgian federal police before\nand after the terrorist attack on March 22, in which two suicide bombers\ndetonated explosives in the departure hall just before 8 a.m. The unions have\nthreatened not to go back to work if their requests for additional safety\nmeasures are not addressed.The Belgian government met on Friday to discuss the\nreopening of the airport, which is several miles northeast of Brussels, in\nZaventem. But officials said afterward that they would wait for the\nnegotiations between unions and police officials to succeed before setting a\ndate for the reopening.“For us, security is paramount, but we have to find\nsolutions at the negotiating table with police unions,” the deputy prime\nminister, Kris Peeters, said after the meeting. “I hope that we are going to\nfind solutions as quickly as possible.”In a statement on Thursday, the airport\nauthority said that the airport was “technically ready” to resume commercial\nflights, using a temporary setup for passenger check-ins. Ms. Muls said that\nthe airport would be able to process 800 departing passengers an hour, about\n20 percent of its normal capacity.The airport has been closed since the\nattacks that killed 32 people and injured hundreds.A third suicide bomber\nattacked the Maelbeek subway station in Brussels, near the European Union\nheadquarters, more than an hour after the airport bombings. Subway service in\nthe Belgian capital is still disrupted.On Wednesday, a group of police\nofficers working at the airport wrote an open letter expressing deep concern\nabout the absence of security checks for nontravelers entering the airport and\nabout the number of baggage handlers and other staff members suspected of\nhaving criminal records or of being sympathetic to the Islamic State.Vincent\nGilles, the head of Belgium’s largest police union, said on Thursday that\nrepeated requests for increased security at the airport before the attacks\nwent unheeded and that a request made in December to install a security check\noutside the entrance to the airport terminal had been rebuffed.Arnaud Feist,\nthe chief executive of Brussels Airport, told the Belgian broadcasting company\nRTBF on Friday that setting up checks at entrances would only move the threat\noutside the building.“A fairly compact grouping of people standing in line\nmight be more problematic than people who are spread out in the airport,” he\nsaid.He also said he was not aware of any airport workers with criminal\nrecords or who were sympathetic to the Islamic State.Separately, news agencies\nreported on Friday that an Italian court had approved the extradition to\nBelgium of an Algerian man who was arrested last week in Salerno and accused\nof forging documents used by people involved in the March 22 attacks in\nBrussels and the Paris attacks in November.\n\n","title":"Brussels Airport’s Reopening Delayed by Security Dispute - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Brussels Airport remains closed because of security concerns https://t.co/vOHiSpeSUa https://t.co/3CIwbRVVml","date":"Fri Apr 01 17:50:09 +0000 2016","favs":124,"id":{"$numberLong":"715959448280424449"},"retweets":128},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VYIbPt"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0141a"},"content":"DENVER — When the aerospace company Sierra Nevada Corporation moved into the\nColorado Technology Center about eight years ago, employees on their lunch\nbreak could stroll by the alpaca farm next door.Now the animals are gone, and\nthe land is cleared and ready for the new development surging along the\nDenver-to-Boulder corridor.At campaign rallies throughout the South and\nMidwest, economic frustration and sluggish wage growth are dominant themes.\nStates like Alaska and Oklahoma, faced with low oil prices, are grappling with\nbankruptcies and layoffs. And overall growth in the United States economy\nremains disappointing.But this thriving industrial park is just one sign of\nthe many metropolises and smaller cities across the nation that have not only\nregained their footing since the recession, but are on the upswing. Here in\nthe Mountain West — but also in places as varied as Seattle and Portland,\nOre., in the Northwest, and Atlanta and Orlando, Fla., in the Southeast —\nemployers are hiring at a steady clip, housing prices are up and consumers are\nspending more freely.“It’s pretty clear that some metropolitan areas are doing\nreally well,” said Andrew McAfee, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology. “The ingredients to that formula seem to be some combination of\ngreat research universities and knowledge-intensive industries, whether it’s\nhigh tech on the West Coast, biotechnology here in the East or clusters of\ntechnology and robotics in places like Pittsburgh.”The Denver metropolitan\narea has become a showcase of the sunnier side of the American economy. While\nthe region has some inherent advantages, like a spectacular landscape that\nbeguiles outdoor enthusiasts, Colorado had long been held back by a dependence\non natural resources as its economic base.Its transformation into one of the\nmost dynamic economies in the country was led by local business leaders and\ngovernment officials, who took advantage of existing assets while also raising\ntaxes at times to invest in critical transportation links, development-\nfriendly policies and a network of colleges and universities.“It’s the outcome\nof really about 30 years of diversifying our economy” away from fossil-fuel\nindustries and military contractors, said Tom Clark, chief executive of the\nMetro Denver Economic Development Corporation. “In the 1980s, we were Coors,\ncarbon and the Cold War.”With a history of boom-and-bust commodity cycles,\nColorado hit bottom in the mid-’80s, when energy prices collapsed. Nearly a\nthird of the office space in downtown Denver, the state’s oil-and-gas\nheadquarters, sat empty. Many of the city’s cultural institutions teetered,\nand a cloud of brown smog smeared the horizon.Now the brilliant blue skyline\nis punctuated with red cranes, and Denver’s soundtrack includes the steady\nthrum of power drills operated by hard-hatted construction workers who are\nputting up office buildings and housing at a feverish pace.Technology start-\nups, including Ibotta, Craftsy, Home Advisor and Gnip (bought by Twitter in\n2014), found a footing in Colorado. Financial services firms like Charles\nSchwab, TIAA and Fidelity Investments expanded their operations.A raft of\nsmaller aerospace and commercial satellite companies like Sierra Nevada, which\njust won a NASA contract to build the mini-space shuttle Dream Chaser, have\nelbowed in beside giants like Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Colorado led the\ncountry last year in new health care jobs.Several measures helped things\nalong. A new rail line that will connect the airport to the downtown and serve\noutlying industrial parks and a push to support cultural institutions\n“required people to vote to raise their taxes,” Mr. Clark of Metro Denver\nsaid. “This wasn’t something done by the elites.”What Denver and its\nsurrounding cities share with other boomtowns is an appealing environment for\na skilled work force, which has increasingly meant the difference between\nprosperity and stagnation.Such places have become business incubators and\nmagnets for educated millennials. The lifestyles that 20- and 30-somethings\noften seek depend on a medley of urban living, public transit and lots of\nentertainment options (which in Colorado includes marijuana, legalized for\nrecreational use since 2014).“Opportunity is being driven by the digital\neconomy,” said Zoë Baird, president of the Markle foundation, which recently\nbegan a pilot program called Skillful in Colorado to match employers and\nworkers based on skills, rather than simply degrees. “That is where the job\ngrowth and economic growth is coming from.”According to the latest figures\navailable, the Denver-Aurora-Lakewood region had an unemployment rate of 2.7\npercent, the lowest of any metropolitan area with a population above one\nmillion. (The national average was 4.9 percent in February.)A recent report by\nthe Leeds School of Business, at the main Boulder campus of the University of\nColorado, predicted that the state would gain more than 65,000 jobs in 2016,\nor about 2.5 percent above last year’s level.“People used to come to Colorado\njust for the state. They liked the lifestyle and hoped they could scrape a\nliving together,” said Fiona Arnold, executive director of the Colorado Office\nof Economic Development and International Trade. “Now employers are chasing\nthem.”Take Charles Schwab, which has its headquarters in San Francisco and is\nexpanding in a handful of cities, including Phoenix, Orlando, Indianapolis and\nAustin, Tex. At its new campus in Lone Tree, outside Denver, hiring is enough\nof a main activity that a dedicated “talent acquisition suite” was installed\noff a lobby, a stylish space with gray suede couches, a kitchen and cozy\nprivate rooms where prospective employees can be comfortably courted.This\nyear, Schwab plans to add 1,360 people to its staff in Colorado.Other\nbusinesses have taken advantage of opportunities for collaboration with\nuniversities and government laboratories.Sierra Nevada’s plant, for example,\nfeatures a thermal vacuum chamber that simulates the cold void of space and a\npint-size mission control to track its commercial satellite launches.But when\nit needed to recreate the intense vibration of a space launch, it trucked the\nDream Chaser prototype to the earthquake simulator at the University of\nColorado campus 20 minutes away.Erik Mitisek, the state’s chief innovation\nofficer, said the region’s economic diversity was building on itself. Many\npeople don’t want to relocate for a single job opportunity, he said. They want\nto know they have other options.“That was probably a hurdle before,” said Mr.\nMitisek, a co-founder of Denver Startup Week, a sort of entrepreneurial\nLollapalooza, in 2012. “But now there is a lot of depth in the market.”Bryan\nLeach, a former lawyer who founded Ibotta (pronounced “I bought a”), a mobile\nshopping app, has seen that evolution firsthand. After starting his career in\nthe District of Columbia, he tested several western states in the early 2000s.\nArizona had too many rattlesnakes, he said half jokingly. Wyoming was too\nsmall. California was too expensive.Then he and his wife visited Denver. They\ncould manage to buy a new five-bedroom house and have the occasional dinner\nout without borrowing from their in-laws, he said. But at first he couldn’t\nfind the right job.No more. In Mr. Leach’s view, Denver has reached a\n“critical mass” of new business ventures. People who love Colorado’s lifestyle\nno longer “feel like they have to sacrifice the quality of career\nopportunities,” he said.Mr. Leach’s own company has undergone extraordinary\ngrowth. In 2012 he ditched his lawyerly dark suits and now wears a tech\nentrepreneur’s uniform of orange sneakers and a purple shirt. He started\nIbotta in the windowless basement of a fire station, paying $8 a square foot\nto house himself and one other employee.In March, the company moved more than\n200 full- and part-time employees into a new 40,000-square-foot office in\nDenver’s tallest tower.The relative lack of racial and cultural diversity (the\nstate is 87 percent white) can deter some people from relocating, Mr. Leach\nconceded, but he thinks that is changing with an increasingly cosmopolitan mix\nof people, arts, restaurants and shops. His own weekend ritual includes dim\nsum and rock climbing.The dynamism reminds him of his youth in Atlanta in the\n1980s and ’90s, when the Southern hub was growing at a phenomenal pace.“Now I\nget to be part of the generation that is building the new economy,” he said.\n\n","title":"The Cities on the Sunny Side of the American Economy - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The Denver metropolitan area has become a showcase of the sunnier side of the U.S. economy https://t.co/DdihfHngdS https://t.co/pciQIJbhNn","date":"Fri Apr 01 16:59:55 +0000 2016","favs":139,"id":{"$numberLong":"715946808548147200"},"retweets":108},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PI99n0"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0141b"},"content":"There’s a hopped-up scene in “Miles Ahead,” controlled yet frenzied, when you\nget why Don Cheadle decided to go for broke. He’s playing Miles Davis (he also\ndirected) and the time is the late 1970s — although it’s also the 1960s. Time\nand space tend to blur in this movie and while the setting is a ’70s boxing\nmatch, a couple of figures from Miles’s past — his wife, his younger self —\nsoon swing in to shake things up. She’s running scared and the 1970s Miles is\nrunning amok, but the younger Miles, well, there he is, too, playing it cool\nin the ring. Music _is_ fighting, at least for this pugilist.Does it matter\nthat stretches of “Miles Ahead” — a gun-rattling, squealing-tire car chase\nincluded — came out of the filmmakers’ imagination rather than Davis’s life?\n(Mr. Cheadle shares script credit with Steven Baigelman.) Purists may howl,\nbut they’ll also miss the pleasure and point of this playfully impressionistic\nmovie. Big-screen biographies tend to come in one flavor: the bittersweet\nhagiographic. Most are polite exhumations that follow the often great man of\nhistory/art/politics arc with the usual highs and lows, witchy and whiny\nwomen, and transcendent payoff. “Miles Ahead” has these, including the\ntranscendence; this is, after all, about Miles Davis.But which Miles, which\nperiod, which sound? It’s a little of this, a lot of that, with melody,\nrhythm, harmony. Some of it takes place in the ’50s, around the time he met\nhis first wife, Frances Taylor (Emayatzy Corinealdi), and was working with the\narranger Gil Evans, with whom Davis cut the record “Miles Ahead.” Mostly, the\nmovie gets its funny-strange groove on in ’79, when Davis had gone quiet (1975\nto early 1980) and didn’t play his horn. “I would walk by it and look at it,”\nDavis wrote in his autobiography, “then think about trying to play. But after\nthat I didn’t even do that.” In the movie, when he eyes his horn it’s as if it\nwere a threat or a mirror: _You lookin’ at me?_The movie’s framing device is\nfamiliar, but works. In 1979, a journalist, Dave (Ewan McGregor), bangs on\nMiles’s New York brownstone. Dave is a scribbler for Rolling Stone or so he\nclaims, and is here for the story, which is more or less the filmmakers’ and\nour goal, too. Scuffing around in a bathrobe and dark glasses the sizes of\nhubcaps, Miles has gone hermit, the Prince of Darkness turned the Prince of\nSilence. His health is bad and one of his hips is shot, and all the street\ndrugs probably aren’t helping. (By his own account, Davis was at one point\nsnorting four or five grams of coke a day, while smoking four packs of\ncigarettes. Forget playing — how could he breathe?)In narrative terms, Dave\nthe journalist is the streamlined and far more economical version of the\nreporter in “Citizen Kane” who, after death comes to Charles Foster Kane in\nhis castle, sets the investigation — the biography — in motion. Dave breaches\nMiles’s Xanadu with a foot in the door, a scene that Mr. Cheadle plays for\nslapstick-spiked comedy. (Dave ends up inside, Miles out, banging to be let\nin.) Davis is a monumental figure, but Mr. Cheadle isn’t working in marble.\nHis approach is human-scaled. He lets you see Miles sweat, shows the vanity —\nMiles primping his hair — panic, drug-hunger, meanness, but also the sly\nintelligence, pleasure and genius. Miles is modal, as he tells Dave, a nod to\nthe improvisational scale-based jazz exemplified by his landmark record “Kind\nof Blue.”Frances turns out to be Miles’s Rosebud in this telling. Shortly\nafter Dave wedges himself into Miles’s life, they end up at Columbia Records,\nwhere Miles — after a showdown with some music types, including one played by\na peerless Michael Stuhlbarg — ends up in an elevator lined with mounted\nrecords. Seeing Frances on the cover of his album “Some Day My Prince Will\nCome” sends Miles back in time. There, he is the younger Miles, dressed in\nsharp suits, on top of the scene and in love with Frances, who melts in and\nout like a dream as the story shifts between past and present. Mr. Cheadle,\nmaking his directorial feature debut, switches times, moods and modes\neffortlessly.Things go bad, as does Miles. Mr. Cheadle doesn’t judge; instead,\nhe presents Miles as a man of complications and contradictions who, after\nhanging up the phone with Frances, returns to a bed full of women. Sometimes,\nit seems that Mr. Cheadle has shaved off too many of the real man’s edges, as\nin a domestic fight in which Miles doesn’t throw the first punch. It’s a\ntough, furious scene, but for impact it has nothing on the follow-up, which\nshows a seemingly contrite Miles putting first a jeweled necklace — and then\nhis arm — around the anguished Frances’ neck. It turns out that Mr. Cheadle is\nsomewhat of a pugilist himself, and he has a killer sucker punch._“Miles\nAhead” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying adult guardian or parent)\nfor all that jazz._ _Running time: 1 hour 40 minutes._\n\n","title":"Review: ‘Miles Ahead,’ an Impressionistic Take on Miles Davis - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesarts: A review of Don Cheadle's \"Miles Ahead,\" about Miles Davis https://t.co/wvMLreGvFA https://t.co/z3gd3tSeRT","date":"Fri Apr 01 16:45:09 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715943094638796800"},"retweets":87},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1TlMVxQ"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0141c"},"content":"Hans-Dietrich Genscher, a widely respected German elder statesman who helped\nbreak down international resistance to the 1990 reunification of East and West\nGermany, died on Thursday at his home near Bonn. He was 89.His office\nconfirmed the death, saying he had been stricken by heart failure. Bonn was\nWest Germany’s capital during the Cold War.Mr. Genscher was a pivotal\npolitical leader in the Federal Republic of Germany. He served as its foreign\nminister for 18 years as he helped negotiate its absorption of East\nGermany.With Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he laid the foundation for the modern\nGerman nation, becoming one of the most influential voices in postwar Germany\nand winning esteem for his work toward a united Europe.In Germany he came to\nbe regarded as a living political legend, and his death elicited an outpouring\nof tributes from around the world.“Germany has lost an internationally\nrespected statesman, and I, personally, a highly valued adviser,” Chancellor\nAngela Merkel said.Former Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who worked\nclosely with Mr. Genscher, said “the United States never had any better friend\nnor a more important partner in managing the peaceful end to the Cold War.”\nAnd former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger hailed him as an\n“intelligent, wise and humane” architect “of a peaceful international\norder.”Others recalled Mr. Genscher’s historic speech in 1989 to thousands of\nEast Germans who had fled to Prague that they were being granted free passage\nto the West. Mr. Genscher announced the news from the balcony of the German\nembassy in that city on the night of Sept. 30, words that were greeted with an\neruption of cheers.Mr. Genscher was born on March 21, 1927, in Reideburg, near\nHalle, in what he called “the other part of our Fatherland”: the sector that\nwas occupied by Soviet troops after World War II and that became Communist\nEast Germany in 1949.He left Halle in 1952, as a young lawyer, to pursue a\ncareer in the West. He returned for visits in the early 1970s once that became\npossible for West Germans under retirement age.He never lost hope, he said,\nthat the East-West division would be overcome, and he said that he envisioned\nit coming after the reform-minded Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev came to\npower in Moscow in 1985.Mr. Genscher traveled extensively over the next few\nyears to persuade allies and antagonists alike to take Mr. Gorbachev at his\nword about Soviet economic change, diplomacy and arms control. Later, as\ncommunism began to collapse across Eastern Europe in 1989, he offered\nassurances that German reunification would not pose a threat.Mr. Genscher was\nan opportunist by nature, a trait that was useful in his leading a small pro-\nbusiness, libertarian West German political party, the Free Democrats.In his\nday, the party’s support determined whether Social Democrats or Christian\nDemocrats could form a majority government in Parliament.Chancellors of both\nthose parties made him vice chancellor, and he served as foreign minister for\nan 18-year stretch that began in 1974, the longest term anyone has served in\nthat office. That period included reunification, which was presided over by\nMr. Kohl, a Christian Democrat, in 1990.“It is not very often given to a\npolitician to turn out to be right,” Mr. Genscher said then. “Even less often,\nit happens while he’s still alive, and yet more rarely while he’s still in\noffice. I have the advantage of all three together.”Mr. Genscher was a doughy,\neasily lampooned figure from Saxony with a distinctly East German accent that\nsounded funny to many in the western part of Germany. He also had a deadpan\nsense of humor. He said in 1987 that, under oath, he had been obliged to\ndescribe himself as “the greatest foreign minister of all time.”His admirers\ncalled him “Genschman,” after Superman, though he had struggled with\ntuberculosis as a young man and in 1989 had a mild heart attack, which slowed\nhim down, if only briefly.Not everyone was an admirer. Skeptics in London\nduring the government of Margaret Thatcher and in Washington under Ronald\nReagan were said to have distrusted “Genscherism” as “slippery.” (One\nexception was George P. Shultz, the secretary of state for much of the Reagan\nyears, who wrote that Mr. Genscher had been remarkably dependable.)Later, Mr.\nGenscher’s critics said his eager recognition of independence for Croatia and\nSlovenia as Yugoslavia began to break up in 1991, and his pressure on European\nallies to do the same, had done nothing to deter the Balkan wars that left\nhundreds of thousands dead.Mr. Genscher grew up under the Nazi dictatorship.\nDrafted into the Army in 1945, he was held as a prisoner of war by American\nand later British forces. He returned to Halle for his high school diploma and\nlaw studies, which he completed in Leipzig.In 1952, he left East Germany for\nBremen in the West, where he joined the Free Democrats. He soon moved to Bonn\nto work in the party leadership and married Luise Schweizer in 1958.They\ndivorced in 1966, a year after he won a seat in the Bundestag for the first\ntime. In 1969, he married Barbara Schmidt, his parliamentary office secretary,\nwho survives him, as does his daughter, Martina, from his first marriage.The\nFree Democrats gave their support in Parliament to the Social Democrats of\nWilly Brandt in 1969, and Mr. Genscher became interior minister in a coalition\nthat started a long process seeking to balance détente with Moscow without\nweakening West German commitment to the NATO alliance.That laid the groundwork\nfor treaties to open relations with East Germany and other East European\ncountries and normalized the status of divided Berlin, until then a focal\npoint for Cold War tensions.The security services under Mr. Genscher were\nblamed for letting an East German spy serve as a close personal aide to Mr.\nBrandt for so long that the spy’s unmasking, in the spring of 1974, caused the\nchancellor’s downfall. Still, Mr. Brandt’s successor, Helmut Schmidt, made Mr.\nGenscher foreign minister and vice chancellor.Their collaboration continued\nuntil 1982, when Mr. Genscher, then his party’s national leader, threw his\nsupport to Mr. Kohl’s Christian Democrats. The decision came after Mr. Schmidt\nwas unable to persuade his party, the Social Democrats, to support an\nAmerican-led plan to install medium-range missiles in West Germany to counter\na new threat from Soviet SS-20 rockets.Mr. Schmidt thought the political move\n“two-faced,” but Mr. Genscher kept both of his crucial government positions\nunder Mr. Kohl.The Atlantic alliance weathered the storm, and Mr. Gorbachev\nswept away the Soviet old guard before East Germany and the Soviet Union\nfinally crumbled.Mr. Genscher resigned from the German government in 1992,\nsoon after his 65th birthday. Six years later, he decided to leave Parliament\nand returned to private legal practice and consulting, writing many\ncommentaries on public affairs in European newspapers.But he never lost his\nclose ties to Russia, and the ability to negotiate with its leaders. In\nDecember 2013, that skill resulted in the release of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky,\nformerly Russia’s wealthiest man, who had spent a decade as President Vladimir\nV. Putin’s most prominent political prisoner.Mr. Genscher viewed as a high\npoint of his career his success, in the fall of 1989, in persuading the East\nGerman leader Erich Honecker, who must have known it was the beginning of the\nend, to give free passage to the West to 5,500 East Germans who had fled to\nthe West German Embassy in Prague.Mr. Genscher called his speech that night\n“the most moving hour in my political career.”\n\n","title":"Hans-Dietrich Genscher, an Architect of German Reunification, Dies at 89 - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Hans-Dietrich Genscher, an architect of German reunification, died on Thursday https://t.co/DwqwvUHwlq https://t.co/zwI620TZbR","date":"Fri Apr 01 15:40:09 +0000 2016","favs":160,"id":{"$numberLong":"715926733564805120"},"retweets":160},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PKgSRB"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0141d"},"content":"Dame Zaha Hadid, the Iraqi-born British architect whose soaring structures\nleft a mark on skylines and imaginations around the world and in the process\nreshaped architecture for the modern age, died in Miami on Thursday. She was\n65.Ms. Hadid contracted bronchitis earlier this week and suffered a sudden\nheart attack while being treated in the hospital, her office, Zaha Hadid\nArchitects in London, said.She was not just a rock star and a designer of\nspectacles. She also liberated architectural geometry, giving it a whole new\nexpressive identity. Geometry became, in her hands, a vehicle for\nunprecedented and eye-popping new spaces but also for emotional ambiguity. Her\nbuildings elevated uncertainty to an art, conveyed in the odd ways one entered\nand moved through those buildings and in the questions her structures raised\nabout how they were supported.Her work, with its formal fluidity — also\nimplying mobility, speed, freedom — spoke to a worldview widely shared by a\nyounger generation. “I am non-European, I don’t do conventional work and I am\na woman,” she once told an interviewer. “On the one hand all of these things\ntogether make it easier — but on the other hand it is very\ndifficult.”Strikingly, Ms. Hadid never allowed herself or her work to be\npigeonholed by her background or her gender. Architecture was architecture: it\nhad its own reasoning and trajectory. And she was one of a kind, a path\nbreaker. In 2004, she became the first woman to win the Pritzker Prize,\narchitecture’s Nobel; the first, on her own, to be awarded the RIBA Gold\nMedal, Britain’s top architectural award, in 2015.Inevitably, she stirred\nnearly as much controversy as she won admiration, provoking protests from\nhuman rights advocates when her $250 million cultural center in Baku,\nAzerbaijan, forced the eviction of families from the site. A commission to\ndesign a stadium in Qatar — a sensuous plan that more than a few observers\nlikened to female anatomy — became, in truth unfairly, a lightning rod for\ncritics who decry the treatment of foreign laborers by the government there.\nShe sued for defamation one critic who falsely reported that 1,000 workers had\ndied building her stadium — before construction had even begun. She won a\nsettlement and an apology.After winning the competition to design a new\nstadium for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, Ms. Hadid’s firm was fired by Japanese\nauthorities, over accusations about looming cost overruns, a decision Ms.\nHadid loudly declared unjust and political.Zaha Hadid was born in Baghdad on\nOct. 31, 1950. Her father was an industrialist, educated in London, who headed\na progressive party advocating for secularism and democracy in Iraq. Baghdad\nwas a cosmopolitan hub of modern ideas, which clearly shaped her upbringing.\nShe attended a Catholic school where students spoke French, and Muslims and\nJews were welcome. After that, she studied mathematics at the American\nUniversity in Beirut (she would later say her years in Lebanon were the\nhappiest of her life).Then, in 1972, she arrived at the Architectural\nAssociation in London, a center for experimental design. Her teachers included\nElia Zenghelis and Rem Koolhaas. They “ignited my ambition,” she would recall,\nand “taught me to trust even my strangest intuitions.”Ms. Hadid’s intuitions\nled her, among other directions, toward the Russian avant-garde, and its\nleaders: Vladimir Tatlin, El Lissitzky and Kazimir Malevich. Her graduation\nproject at the Architectural Assocation, called Malevich’s Tectonik, was a\nproposal for a hotel atop Hungerford Bridge over the Thames.For a while she\nworked at Mr. Koolhaas’s Office for Metropolitan Architecture, in Rotterdam, a\ncutting-edge firm and crucible for gifted young architects. By the 1980s she\nhad established her own practice in London. And she began to draw attention\nwith an unrealized plan in 1982-83 for the Peak Club in Hong Kong.Ms. Hadid’s\nconcept was a jagged, gravity-defying composition of beams and floating shards\ncantilevered into the rock face. It encapsulated the 1980s movement called\nDeconstructivism. During these years Ms. Hadid turned out an astonishing,\nsuper-refined variety of futuristic drawings and paintings. She used her art\nto test spatial ideas that she couldn’t yet make concrete without the aid of\ncomputer algorithms. She soon developed an insiders’ reputation as a leading\ntheoretical designer of groundbreaking forms with unrealized projects like the\nCardiff Bay opera house in Wales.Getting her designs built was something\nelse.In 1994, she realized her first commission, a fire station on the\ncorporate campus of Vitra, a furniture company, in Weil am Rhein, Germany. It\ninspired a design of typically outsized imagination: a winged composition, all\nsharp angles and protrusions. Architects were impressed. The firefighters, not\nso much. They moved out, and the station became an event space.Not one to\ncompromise or concede much to those who called her works impractical,\nindulgent and imprudent, from early on she made the most, creatively speaking,\nof what commissions she got. When her Rosenthal Center for Contemporary Art in\nCincinnati, a relatively modest project, opened in 2003, Herbert Muschamp,\nthen architecture critic for The New York Times, declared it “the most\nimportant American building to be completed since the end of the Cold War.”The\ncenter can, he said, “be experienced as an exercise in heightening the mind-\nbody connection.” It “presents vantage points of sufficient variety to keep\nphotographers snapping happily for many years to come,” he added.Projects\nfollowed, like the Phaeno Science Center in Wolfsburg, Germany; the Bridge\nPavilion in Zaragoza, Spain; and an opera house in Guangzhou, China, whose\nrock crystal-shaped design she likened to “pebbles in a stream smoothed by\nerosion.”Her sources were nature, history, whatever she thought useful. Ms.\nHadid’s design for the Maxxi, a modern art museum in Rome, alluded distantly\nto Baroque precedents, and became one of the rare modern buildings in the city\nto vie for attention with its numerous historical sites. Like the fire station\nit wasn’t entirely practical, but it was a voluptuous and muscular building,\nmulti-tiered, with ramps that flowed like streams and floors tilted like\nhills, many walls swerving and swooning.It took years before Ms. Hadid won\nmajor commissions in Britain, where she became a citizen and established a\nthriving office. Her Aquatics Center in London, built for the 2012 Olympics,\nwas a cathedral for water sports, with an undulating roof and two 50-meter\npools. It has become a city landmark and neighborhood attraction, bustling\nwith kids and recreational swimmers.Her partner at Zaha Hadid Architects,\nPatrik Schumacher, played an instrumental and collaborative role in her\ncareer. Mr. Schumacher coined the term parametricism to encompass the\ncomputer-based approach that helped the firm’s most extravagant concepts\nbecome reality. Ms. Hadid called what resulted “an organic language of\narchitecture, based on these new tools, which allow us to integrate highly\ncomplex forms into a fluid and seamless whole.”Robert A.M. Stern, the dean of\nthe Yale Architecture School, where Ms. Hadid was a visiting professor this\nsemester, described her legacy on Thursday as “an architecture that I could\nnever have imagined, much less imagined getting built.” He remembered her as\n“the master of a cutting remark about another architect’s work, but also\nastonishingly warm, generous and radiant,” he said. “She was like the\nsun.”Survived by an older brother, Haytham Hadid, of Beirut, she leaves\nunfinished, among other projects, a luxury apartment building beside the High\nLine in New York City.Ms. Hadid embodied, in its profligacy and promise, the\nera of so-called starchitects, who roamed the planet in pursuit of their own\ncreative genius, offering miracles, occasionally delivering. “She was bigger\nthan life, a force of nature,” as Amale Andraos, the dean of Columbia\nUniversity’s architecture school, put it on Thursday. “She was a pioneer.”She\nwas. For women, for what cities can aspire to build and for the art of\narchitecture.\n\n","title":"Zaha Hadid, Groundbreaking Architect, Dies at 65 - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The NYT obituary for Zaha Hadid, the first woman to win architecture's highest prize https://t.co/9alXCetvOF https://t.co/pnQpzqvUsm","date":"Fri Apr 01 14:36:55 +0000 2016","favs":467,"id":{"$numberLong":"715910820903972864"},"retweets":386},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VfTbXV"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0141e"},"content":"If you were going to sit down and sketch out an ideal scenario for the\nAmerican job market in 2016, it would look something like this:The United\nStates would keep adding jobs at a steady clip. Wages would rise gradually —\nenough to put more money in workers’ pockets, but not so fast as to lead the\nFederal Reserve to move abruptly to keep the economy from overheating. Steady\njob growth wouldn’t show up in continued drops in the unemployment rate, but\nrather in a rising labor force. That is, people who had stopped even looking\nfor a job in recent years would come back into the job market, allowing for\nstrong job growth mixed with a steady jobless rate.That happens to be the\nreality  revealed in the March jobs numbers released Friday, and really in\nevery jobs report published so far in 2016.I don’t want to sound hopelessly\noptimistic or naïve about the problems the United States economy is facing. In\nthe near term, measures of economic output have looked far weaker than\nmeasures of the job market, which implies productivity growth is exceptionally\nweak right now. In the longer term, incomes for working-class Americans\nhaven’t really grown over the last couple of decades.These are big, serious\nproblems with far-reaching consequences. But in terms of the nuts and bolts of\nthe labor market in 2016, things are really shaping up well for anyone who\nwants to see Americans get back to work and see the damage left by the\nrecession eight years ago finally healed.Over the last four months, the size\nof the United States labor force has risen by 1.92 million, the strongest\nsince the boom time of early 2000.Indeed, the jobless rate ticked up a bit in\nMarch, to 5 percent from 4.9 percent, precisely because among the 396,000\nAmericans who joined the labor force, not all found jobs.The unemployment rate\nhas been exceptionally stable lately; it has been between 4.9 and 5.1 percent\nfor eight consecutive months. That’s good news if you’re worried that the Fed\nmight move too abruptly to raise interest rates and end the expansion\nprematurely. The fact that job growth remains strong but is pulling new people\ninto the job market, not just pushing the unemployment rate lower, suggests\nthe Fed can be patient, because the labor market is at less risk of getting\ntoo tight, fueling inflation.A couple of telling statistics: The number of\npeople who are not in the labor force but who tell survey takers they want a\njob — these are people who aren’t actively looking for work and therefore\ndon’t count as unemployed, yet have a vague sense that they’d prefer to have a\njob — has fallen by more than 10 percent in the last year, to 5.4 million.And\nthe proportion of the adult population that is working has risen to 59.9\npercent, up from 59.3 percent a year ago. The level is still well below the\nroughly 63 percent that prevailed before the recession, but some portion of\nthe drop is because of demographic shifts, and the progress since the start of\n2014 is impressive.On wages, the 0.3 percent rise in average hourly earnings\nin March and 2.3 percent rise in the last year is hardly the stuff of raucous\ncelebration, but inflation has been low enough that this still represents a\nmeaningful uptick in buying power for the average worker. And its gradual pace\nof growth, as mentioned earlier, means the Federal Reserve will feel\ncomfortable sticking with a cautious, slow path of raising interest rates,\nrather than get any ideas that a huge outbreak of inflation is on the way.The\neconomy has a lot of profound problems, and the damage of the 2008 recession\nis still not fully healed. But the March numbers offer more comfort that, in\nterms of the job market at least, it’s heading in the right direction.\n\n","title":"This Is the Job Market We’ve Been Hoping for All These Years - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @Neil_Irwin: This is the job market we've been hoping for all these years.\n\nhttps://t.co/dNLzm4oL0c","date":"Fri Apr 01 14:30:07 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715909108591935488"},"retweets":81},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/02/upshot/this-is-the-job-market-weve-been-hoping-for-all-these-years.html?_r=0"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01420"},"content":"And so the worst-kept secret in fashion has been confirmed: Hedi Slimane, the\ncreative and image director of Yves Saint Laurent, has left the brand. Given\nthe strength of the rumors of his departure that have been circulating since\nJanuary, this may go down as the most anticlimactic fashion announcement ever\nmade.But despite the fact that it happened on April Fools’ Day (a coincidence\nthat probably escaped no one), the news has serious implications. Mr. Slimane\nis the fourth designer at a major fashion house to recently leave his post\nafter less than five years. Last July, Alexander Wang left Balenciaga after\nthree years; in October, Raf Simons left Christian Dior after the same amount\nof time; and in February, Stefano Pilati left Zegna. Mr. Slimane has been at\nthe helm of YSL since 2012.Mr. Slimane accomplished a lot in that time,\ntransforming the brand’s reputation as well as its financial fortunes. Saint\nLaurent is now the fastest-growing line in the luxury portfolio of its parent\ncompany, Kering, reporting slightly less than 1 billion euros, or about $1.14\nbillion, in revenue for 2015, up 38 percent from 2014. Saint Laurent now\naccounts for 12 percent of sales by Kering’s luxury brands and 8 percent of\nthe group’s total sales.To do so, Mr. Slimane also created a model of an all-\npowerful aesthetic mastermind that has since been adopted by Alessandro\nMichele at Gucci and has become the dream of many designers. But the idea that\nthe brand’s transformation is complete, as the news release suggests (to be\nspecific, the statement characterized Mr. Slimane’s stay as “a four-year\nmission, which has led to the complete repositioning of the brand”), and can\nsimply be handed over to another designer, is a troubling one.Yet this seems\nto have become the conventional wisdom of the industry. Gildo Zegna, chief\nexecutive of the Italian men’s wear label Ermenegildo Zegna, said something\nvery similar when Mr. Pilati left: “We wanted to develop a strong point of\nview in fashion, and for Zegna to be a show not to be missed in Milan. We have\nreached this objective faster than expected.” On to the next! At a lunch to\nstart Milan Fashion Week in February, I sat next to François-Henri Pinault,\nchief executive of Kering, and asked him about such abbreviated relationships,\nas one does when faced with that kind of opportunity. He shrugged and said,\n“That is the normal life cycle of modern luxury.”Let’s hope that isn’t\ntrue.Fashion has been infected by the contemporary disease of short-termism.\nAnd this means “fashion” writ large: not only executives on the corporate\nside, who in public companies necessarily have to think in reporting quarters,\nbut also the members of the design side, which is not exempt here. There is a\ntendency to blame corporate “moneymen” for the evils of a system that is\ncrushing the poor creative flower of a designer, wringing all the invention\nout of him or her, but it is increasingly clear that that is an antiquated\nidea.Mr. Simons left; he was not forced out. Mr. Slimane, with his insistence\non total control and refusal to live in Paris, instead remaining in Los\nAngeles and making the brand come to him, is no one’s idea of a pushover. The\ntalk surrounding his contract negotiations centered on speculation about what\nhe wanted (supposedly more money), not what he was being required to do.The\nrelationship horizon line on both sides seems to be shrinking. Indeed, in\nmultiple conversations with fashion chief executives since all this began, the\nanswer that keeps coming up when they are asked why they don’t give designers\nlonger contracts — five years, seven years (the average length of a creative\ndirector contract currently is three) — is that the designers won’t sign them;\nthat the designers want the freedom to renegotiate (or leave). You can\nunderstand it, to a certain extent: If designers’ work increases sales at a\nglobal mega-brand to a meaningful level, they want their salaries to reflect\nthe success. One executive told me designers he spoke to would be happy to\nsign one-year contracts if they could.Compare this to the length of time\nfounders such as Yves Saint Laurent himself was at his house (40 years), or\nValentino Garavani (48 years), or Hubert de Givenchy (43 years). One of the\nreasons those brands had worth even after their founders retired — the reasons\nthey were valuable enough to be bought by conglomerates and private equity\nfirms such as their current owners, Kering, the Qatari investment firm\nMayhoola, and Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton respectively — was that their good\nwill and aesthetic equity had been defined and built over decades. That is\nwhat was purchased, as much as the names themselves. Because that is what\nattracts not just one generation of shoppers, but the next and the\nnext.Creating an image for a brand and truly embedding it in the life of a\nconsumer takes investment not just in renovation but in the relationship —\nbetween brand and individual, and designer and brand. After all, the products\nthemselves require investment. They are not cheap. Consumers have to believe\nthey will hold their meaning over time. And the meaning is created by the\ndesigner.Modern luxury theory has it that the brand has to be greater than any\nindividual, but we should not forget that brands are given their personality\nand their depth by the people who make them. They aren’t caretakers; they are\ncontent creators (and not in the social media meaning of the word). Comme des\nGarçons is Comme des Garçons because of its founder and designer, Rei\nKawakubo; Ralph Lauren because of Ralph Lauren; Giorgio Armani because of\nGiorgio Armani; Chanel because of Coco Chanel and now the designer Karl\nLagerfeld.Indeed, though the latter did not create the style of the maison he\ntook on in 1983, he has worked within its vernacular for over 30 years. As a\nresult, it is still clear what the brand stands for, and you can buy into that\nvalue system or use it to telegraph your own. Similarly, Maria Grazia Chiuri\nand Pierpaolo Piccioli, creative directors of Valentino since 2008, have\nsucceeded in establishing a modern character for the company that speaks to\nthe legacy of its founder, rooted as it is in beauty and decoration, while\nalso giving it a resonance in contemporary culture by combining a certain\nrigor of line with elaborate craftsmanship. But it has evolved over seasons —\ntheir first few shows looked very different — and if they had departed after\nYear 3, their contribution would have had very little impact. It would have\nbeen a blip, rather than an identity.If the value system a brand represents\nchanges, and changes very dramatically, as it did at YSL under Mr. Slimane,\nwho crushed its botoxed Le Smokings under a highly merchandised California\nyouthquake truck, it: a) takes a while for the world to adjust (remember the\ninitial shock! horror! at his grunge grrls on the runway in Season 2); and b)\ncan give consumers whiplash if it then segues into something else entirely.As\nto what might lie ahead, at least for YSL, rumors are centered on Anthony\nVaccarello, a young Belgian-Italian designer whose last show was very 1980s\nrocker — in part because it doesn’t seem a huge departure from the Slimane\naesthetic, though it is more aggressively sexy and less holistic. Kering said\nit would make an announcement “in due course.”Mr. Slimane has been,\ncharacteristically, silent about his plans. There was talk he might go to\nDior, which is still searching for a designer, but it is even more likely he\nwill segue into the art world. His creative universe has always seemed more\nlike performance art than simply clothing.This week, two new ad campaigns,\nshot by Mr. Slimane, were previewed by YSL: one featuring Jane Birkin in a\nSmoking suit, and one featuring Cara Delevingne in looks from Mr. Slimane’s\nlast show. There will be a bridge period where, at least from the outside,\neverything will look very much the same. And it’s hard to imagine that given\nthe cost of Mr. Slimane’s reinvention, which extended beyond the runway to\nstores, furniture for the stores and a new hôtel particulier in Paris, Kering\nwould be prepared to do the same for whoever comes next.Ideally, that person\nwould stay longer than three years. But a certain precedent has been set. The\nunsettling prospect of a fashion world of free agents, more than any single\nlook, may be the legacy of Mr. Slimane. And it’s unclear where in that\nscenario any long-term profits lie.\n\n","title":"Hedi Slimane’s Dangerous Legacy - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Why Hedi Slimane's legacy is troubling for the fashion industry https://t.co/fMq4C6yFZp https://t.co/ZybjLGe8NE","date":"Fri Apr 01 13:45:05 +0000 2016","favs":131,"id":{"$numberLong":"715897775435685889"},"retweets":69},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VY08h1"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01421"},"content":"Hedi Slimane, an enfant terrible of high fashion who masterminded a turnaround\nof fortunes at Yves Saint Laurent, has left his position as creative and image\ndirector of the house after almost four years, it was announced on Friday.The\nannouncement, in a joint statement by Yves Saint Laurent and Kering, its\nparent group, ended months of speculation that Mr. Slimane would be\ndeparting.Protracted contract negotiations between Mr. Slimane, who is based\nin Los Angeles, and Kering executives, who are based in Europe, were the talk\nof Paris Fashion Week last month. Whispers had reached their zenith before his\ntriumphant — now final — show for the house, with an ’80s-inspired couture\ncollection, no music and personalized seats for the coterie of editors and\nbuyers invited to the private Parisian mansion where it was held.Mr. Slimane,\n47, a former men’s wear designer at Dior Homme, had made a series of sweeping\nchanges to the house since his arrival in 2012, moving the design studio to\nLos Angeles from Paris, renaming its ready-to-wear line Saint Laurent,\nredesigning its logo and creating a distinctive design aesthetic that proved\nphenomenally successful with shoppers. The once-sluggish Saint Laurent is now\na commercial powerhouse, reporting slightly less than 1 billion euros, or\nabout $1.14 billion, in revenue for 2015, up 38 percent from 2014. Saint\nLaurent now accounts for 12 percent of sales by Kering’s luxury brands and 8\npercent of the group’s total sales.Thomas Chauvet, luxury analyst at the\ninvestment banking company Citi, noted that Saint Laurent’s popularity — and\nprofits — during Mr. Slimane’s reign had been buoyed by his successful\ntransition into leather goods, which accounted for around half of all the\nhouse’s sales last year.“At the end of a four-year mission, which has led to\nthe complete repositioning of the brand, the Maison Yves Saint Laurent\nannounces the departure of Hedi Slimane as its creative and image director,’’\nthe statement said. It lauded what it called the “holistic reform” during his\ntenure “that has brought back its utmost modernity and fashion authority while\nkeeping alive and respecting the original vision of Mr. Saint Laurent.”There\nwas no comment in the statement from Mr. Slimane, nor any word of who might\nsucceed him. Kering said it would make an announcement on a new creative\ndirection for Saint Laurent, suggesting that a replacement had already been\nchosen.Designers who have been touted for the position include Anthony\nVaccarello — whose Paris show was unusually crowded last month as a result of\nthe talk —and Jonathan Saunders.Mr. Slimane’s departure comes on the heels of\nothers at major houses in recent months, including Raf Simons at Christian\nDior and Alber Elbaz at Lanvin.Praise for Mr. Slimane’s talent flew thick and\nfast from the boardroom.“I would like to thank Hedi Slimane very much for his\nvision in reforming such an iconic house as Yves Saint Laurent,” said\nFrancesca Bellettini, chief executive of Yves Saint Laurent. “The direction\nthat has been taken over the last four years represents an incredible\nfoundation for the brand to build on for its continuous success.”François-\nHenri Pinault, chairman and chief executive of the Kering Group, said: “What\nYves Saint Laurent has achieved over the past four years represents a unique\nchapter in the history of the house. I am very grateful to Hedi Slimane, and\nthe whole Yves Saint Laurent team, for having set the path that the house has\nsuccessfully embraced, and which will grant longevity to this legendary\nbrand.”\n\n","title":"Hedi Slimane Has Left Saint Laurent, Kering Confirms - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTFashion: Hedi Slimane is leaving Saint Laurent, Kering confirms https://t.co/Q0w7NWMXwO https://t.co/smpe16NltL","date":"Fri Apr 01 12:42:26 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715882011139948544"},"retweets":92},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22UEJut"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01422"},"content":"After years of economic desperation, American workers are finally regaining\nsome of the ground they lost in the last decade’s recession and the pallid\nrecovery that followed.Companies have been hiring in recent months at a pace\nnot seen before in this century. Wages are rising faster than inflation.\nJoblessness is hovering near the low levels last reached in 2007 before the\neconomy’s downturn.And perhaps most significantly, the army of unemployed\npeople who gave up and dropped out of the job market is not only looking for\nwork, but actually finding it.The 215,000 jump in payrolls in March reported\nby the Labor Department on Friday capped the best two-year period for hiring\nsince the late 1990s, while the proportion of Americans in the labor force —\nwhich had been on a downward trajectory since 2001 and an even steeper slide\nsince 2008 — hit a two-year high.“It’s really a best-case scenario,” said\nMichelle Meyer, deputy head of United States economics at Bank of America\nMerrill Lynch. “I was particularly encouraged by the pickup in labor force\nparticipation.”The underlying strength apparent in the report for March\nreinforces growing evidence that the economy, despite a host of remaining\nills, is now consistently moving in the right direction.“This is close to a\nGoldilocks scenario,” said Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at Brown\nBrothers Harriman. He noted that hiring and wage gains were healthy in March,\nbut not so robust as to ignite inflation fears and tempt the Federal Reserve\nto move more quickly to raise rates and temper growth.To be sure, the damage\nfrom the financial crisis and the severe recession it spawned is still not\nfully healed. Even with improvement of the past six months, the proportion of\nAmericans in the labor force remains significantly below where it was when the\nrecession began at the end of 2007.“The labor force in the last few months has\nseen significant gains,” said Claire McKenna, senior policy analyst with the\nNational Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for lower-wage workers.\n“Things are moving in the right direction, but very slowly.”At the same time,\nwhile some of the highest-paid employees on Wall Street and at many leading\ncompanies have enjoyed big jumps in compensation, most workers have\nexperienced only very modest wage gains, heightening worries about income\ninequality.The American economy still faces fundamental headwinds that are not\nlikely to abate soon — like a persistent trade gap, low productivity and the\nlong-term erosion of factory jobs that provide an economic lifeline to workers\nwithout a college degree.In fact, the manufacturing sector was one of the few\nweak spots in the economy last month, losing 29,000 jobs.But companies in the\nbusiness of providing health care, leisure and hospitality and retailing each\ngained more than 40,000 jobs in March. And two very different sectors that pay\nwell — construction as well as professional and business services — both added\nmore than 30,000 jobs.The overall unemployment rate rose to 5 percent last\nmonth, compared with 4.9 percent in February. But even that was a positive\nindication, analysts said, since it was the uptick in new entrants to the\nlabor force that mostly accounted for the rise rather than job losses.If\nanything, Friday’s report portrays an economy gradually returning to a more\nnormal trajectory, while so far avoiding the bubblelike excesses that\nprevailed in the late 1990s and just before the Great Recession in December\n2007.“The last two years have been the best since 1998 and 1999, and that’s\nsaying a lot,” said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a research and\nconsulting firm. “Those were boom years that we look back on very fondly, so\nto have that level of job growth again is pretty remarkable.”As a result, the\neconomic backdrop of the presidential campaign is also starting to shift.\nDemocrats note that unemployment has fallen sharply since President Obama took\noffice; the jobless rate stood at 7.8 percent in January 2009.Republicans have\nbeen citing stagnant wage growth, as well as the exit of many workers from the\nlabor force in recent years. On the campaign trail, they also contend that Mr.\nObama’s stewardship of the economy has hobbled businesses in a web of\nexcessive regulations.But the steady expansion of the work force and the signs\nthat a tightening labor market is finally translating into wage gains could\nease some of the economic anxiety that has marked the primary season for\nRepublican and Democratic candidates alike.While some big companies have\nannounced layoffs in recent months facing worries on Wall Street about profit\nmargins, smaller firms are picking up the slack, especially in the technology\nsector.“If you’re a start-up, you’re either growing or dying and we’ve been\ngrowing,” said Adam M. Ochstein, the founder of the Chicago-based StratEx,\nwhich provides software that enables companies to automate human resources\ndepartments and cut down on paperwork.StratEx hired two workers in March and\nplans to hire eight this month, bringing its overall work force to just over\n80.To lure software developers with three to five years under their belt, Mr.\nOchstein has to pay about $100,000 a year. New hires for StratEx’s help desk,\nwho have been working for the same amount of time, command less than half that\nannually.Until recently, the proportion of Americans either employed or\nactively looking for a job was falling. But it appears to have bottomed out at\n62.4 percent in September 2015. The 63 percent participation rate is now back\nto where it was in February 2014.Although it has been a modest improvement, it\nwas enough to draw the attention of Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman. She\ntermed the increase in participation “heartening” at a news conference last\nmonth.“Wages and participation are where the rubber meets the road,” said\nMichael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. “We will take our\ncue about the overall strength of the economy based on that.”Mr. Gapen, like\nmany on Wall Street, urged the Fed to let the good times roll.“Ms. Yellen is\nlikely to see the March report as evidence that the Fed’s policies are working\nand that their accommodative policies are helping to heal the labor market,”\nhe said. “So why push rates higher and potentially choke off that process?”\n\n","title":"Jobs and Wages Notch Gains as the Economy Tries to Heal - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesbusiness: U.S. employers added 215,000 jobs in March, a steady pace despite volatility on Wall Street and overseas https://t.co/…","date":"Fri Apr 01 12:40:48 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715881598776958976"},"retweets":59},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VfsZgd"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01423"},"content":"A thousand years after the Vikings braved the icy seas from Greenland to the\nNew World in search of timber and plunder, satellite technology has found\nintriguing evidence of a long-elusive prize in archaeology — a second Norse\nsettlement in North America, further south than ever known.The new Canadian\nsite, with telltale signs of iron-working, was discovered last summer after\ninfrared images from 400 miles in space showed possible man-made shapes under\ndiscolored vegetation. The site is on the southwest coast of Newfoundland,\nabout 300 miles south of L’Anse aux Meadows, the first and so far only\nconfirmed Viking settlement in North America, discovered in 1960.Since then,\narchaeologists, following up clues in the histories known as the sagas, have\nbeen hunting for the holy grail of other Viking, or Norse, landmarks in the\nAmericas that would have existed 500 years before Columbus, to no avail.But\nlast year, Sarah H. Parcak (pronounced PAR-kak), a leading space archaeologist\nworking with Canadian experts and the science series NOVA for a two-hour\ntelevision documentary, “Vikings Unearthed,” that will be aired on PBS next\nweek, turned her eyes in the sky on coastlines from Baffin Island, west of\nGreenland, to Massachusetts. She found hundreds of potential “hot spots” that\nhigh-resolution aerial photography narrowed to a handful and then one\nparticularly promising candidate — “a dark stain” with buried rectilinear\nfeatures.Magnetometer readings later taken at the remote site, called Point\nRosee by researchers, a grassy headland above a rocky beach an hour’s trek\nfrom the nearest road, showed elevated iron readings. And trenches that were\nthen dug exposed Viking-style turf walls along with ash residue, roasted ore\ncalled bog iron and a fire-cracked boulder — signs of metallurgy not\nassociated with native people of the region.In addition, radiocarbon tests\ndating the materials to the Norse era, and the absence of historical objects\npointing to any other cultures, helped persuade scientists involved in the\nproject and outside experts of the site’s promise. The experts are to resume\ndigging there this summer.“It screams, ‘Please excavate me!,’ ” said Dr.\nParcak, an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Alabama at\nBirmingham, who won the $1 million TED prize last year for her pioneering work\nusing satellite images to expose the looting of ancient Egyptian antiquities\nand is using it to globally crowdsource new archaeological sites from\nspace.The NOVA program will stream online at pbs.org/nova in the United States\nat 3:30 p.m. Monday, Eastern time, (along with a BBC program in England), and\nwill be broadcast on PBS at 9 p.m. Wednesday.Given the dashed hopes of\nprevious searches and the many spurious claims of Viking presence in the\nAmericas, scientists on the project as well as outside experts have voiced\ncaution.“Tremendous, if it’s really true,” said William Fitzhugh, director of\nthe Arctic Studies Center and Curator in Anthropology at the Smithsonian’s\nNational Museum of Natural History in Washington. “It wouldn’t be unexpected,”\nhe said, but added that he wanted to see the data.“There’s no lock that it’s\nNorse, but there’s no alternative evidence,” said Douglas Bolender, a research\nassistant professor at the Andrew Fiske Memorial Center for Archeological\nResearch and the Department of Anthropology at the University of\nMassachusetts, Boston, who joined the expedition. He said a buried structure\nthere could be a smithy for longboat nails and weaponry, another strong\nindicator of Viking presence.“It would just be logical that there’s more than\none site,” said Gerald F. Bigelow, a lecturer in history at Bates College in\nLewiston, Me., and a specialist in archaeology of the North Atlantic.Davide\nZori, an assistant professor of archaeology at Baylor University in Waco,\nTex., and a specialist on Viking expansion in the North Atlantic, called the\nfind potentially “very important.”Much depends on what else is found at the\nsite. In archaeology, context is everything. A famous prehistoric site in\nBrooklin, Me., yielded an 11th century silver Norse coin but it is believed to\nhave landed there through trade and not as proof of Viking settlement.Master\nshipbuilders and seafarers, warriors, traders and raiders, the Vikings boiled\nout of the Scandinavian fjords starting around the 8th century, marauding\nthrough Asia and the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. The Vikings focused\nparticularly on the British Isles, and west to Iceland and Greenland, as\nmemorialized in oral narratives and later recorded as the sagas by 13th-\ncentury Icelandic monks.Around 1000, Leif Ericson led an expedition to what\nbecame known as Vinland at the northernmost point of Newfoundland at L’Anse\naux Meadows (the name an obscure corruption from the French) where explorers\nstarting in 1960 discovered remnants of an extensive colony, including\ndwellings, a forge, and carpentry workshop — the Vikings’ first and so far\nonly known landmark in the New World. They appear to have been routed by\nindigenous people the Norse called Skraeling.One intriguing find was the seeds\nof a butternut tree, which did not grow that far north and hinted of travels\nto milder climates in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. But evidence of other Viking\nsettlements has been lacking.Dr. Parcak began her research by using a\ncommercial satellite called WorldView-3, belonging to the company\nDigitalGlobe, to search known Norse sites on minuscule Papa Stour in the\nShetland Islands of Scotland. Using the near-infrared spectrum invisible to\nthe human eye, the satellite detected buried walls, and digging yielded a\ncarnelian bead from India similar to those found at other Viking sites. Dr.\nParcak then focused her satellite search on thousands of miles of coastline\nfrom the Canadian Arctic to New England.After two weeks of digging at Point\nRosee, an unexpected find in a flooded trench excited the explorers — several\nseeds, or perhaps blueberries, which were hurriedly sent for testing. The\ndates came back wildly off — 700 years after the Vikings, maybe even\ncontemporary. They seem to have migrated onto the site much later.“You feeling\nnervous, Sarah?” a NOVA reporter asked Dr. Parcak.“No, I’m not,” she said.\n\n","title":"View From Space Hints at a New Viking Site in North America - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Satellite imagery may have helped discover a second Viking settlement in North America https://t.co/7L9SbGRlid https://t.co/PE0lWfJFpU","date":"Fri Apr 01 12:01:04 +0000 2016","favs":383,"id":{"$numberLong":"715871602618015744"},"retweets":237},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22TCBmG"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01424"},"content":"In recent years, venture capitalists have funded all manner of improbable\nideas. An app that lets random people call and wake you up. A bathroom scale\nthat posts your weight on Twitter.And then there is Doug Evans’s brainchild.\nWith no experience running tech companies and a bungled juice-bar chain under\nhis belt, he has extracted a remarkable $120 million in investments from\nSilicon Valley titans, including Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield\n\u0026amp; Byers, and big companies like Campbell Soup.His pitch: a $700 machine\nthat makes an eight-ounce glass of juice.Mr. Evans is a raw-food evangelist,\nalthough “occasionally I eat steamed vegetables, to not be dogmatic,” he said.\nHe wears shoes made of hemp. But even as Silicon Valley retreats from its\nrecent boom, this unlikely entrepreneur has persuaded top investors to throw\ntheir money at one of the most enigmatic start-ups in years.His company,\nJuicero, opens for business this week. But what is it?Is it a juice-ordering\napp? Is it just another kitchen-counter contraption? Or is it a 111,000\n-square-foot food-processing factory, staffed by dozens of hourly workers,\nwashing and slicing up fruits and vegetables in Los Angeles?It is all of these\nthings. “It’s the most complicated business that I’ve ever funded,” said David\nKrane, a partner at GV, formerly Google Ventures. “It’s software. It’s\nconsumer electronics. It’s produce and packaging.”Many of the tycoons who\ninhabit Silicon Valley are obsessed with health and longevity while harboring\nthe conviction that technology can improve anything, even one of nature’s most\nelementary foodstuffs — in this case, juice. And they believe that niche\ntrends, if properly disrupted, can become billion-dollar markets. Juicero is\nthe latest expression of these techno-utopian impulses.It is also the latest\nexample of an unproven start-up raising enormous sums of money. Born in an\nearlier era in the Valley, the headier times of 18 months or so ago, Mr.\nEvans’s idea captivated some of the industry’s most ambitious investors. In\ntoday’s more conservative financing environment, such a pitch might not get\nfunded.No matter. In coming days, Juicero starts taking orders.The machine\nitself is a white plastic slab roughly the size of a food processor. To get\nsome juice, you insert a pouch that resembles an IV bag and press a button. A\ncouple of minutes later, a thin stream of vividly colored liquid squirts into\na glass.For health nuts willing to pay a premium, Juicero promises the\nplatonic ideal of juice. Plus, the machine never needs to be cleaned.But\ngetting from farm to glass involves a daunting mix of hardware, code and food\nprocessing. The arrangement relies on a smartphone app, always-on Wi-Fi, QR\ncodes, high-tech packaging and an army of workers slicing fruits and\nvegetables in very particular ways.Ultimately, however, what makes Juicero so\nspecial is not quantifiable by conventional science, said Mr. Evans, the\nfounder and chief executive.“Not all juice is equal,” he said. “How do you\nmeasure life force? How do you measure chi?”Nearly as unlikely as Juicero\nitself is the man behind it. Mr. Evans trained as an Army paratrooper before\njoining a graphic design firm. His love affair with juice began in 1999, when\nhe met Denise Mari, a vegan, at a nightclub. Soon he was dating Ms. Mari and\nconverted to veganism, too.Hoping to create an eatery compatible with their\nstrict dietary regimen, Mr. Evans and Ms. Mari bought some industrial-strength\njuicers and developed Organic Avenue, which sold $10 bottles of cold-pressed,\nunpasteurized juice and other vegan snacks.“It was a vision of a restaurant\nsomeone could go to where no animals were harmed, and no humans were harmed,”\nhe said. “It was so magical to be able to have that. I was drinking several\nglasses of juice a day as my primary form of hydration.”After the first store\nopened in 2006, the business grew quickly. But margins were persistently thin.\nNew York real estate is expensive, and the inventory was perishable.“We were\non the brink of insolvency,” Mr. Evans said.In 2012, Mr. Evans and Ms. Mari,\nwho are separated but remain friends, sold a majority interest in Organic\nAvenue to a private equity firm. Shortly after that, both were ousted. (The\ncompany was eventually sold to another private equity firm, which shuttered\nall the stores.)Upon being fired, Mr. Evans said, he had a problem. “For me, I\nwas just wondering: How am I going to get my juice?” he said.He bought every\njuicer he could find, but he was never satisfied. “It didn’t have the magic\nthat I was accustomed to.”So he resolved to create a miniaturized version of\nthe industrial presses he had used at Organic Avenue. Working with freelance\nwelders and machinists, he built prototypes in his Brooklyn kitchen. By 2013,\nhe had a working model, albeit one that occasionally blew apart, sending\npieces of metal and food scraps flying across the room.He approached Ms. Mari\nand some of the original backers of Organic Avenue, who invested enough money\nfor him to keep going. “Then I got an introduction to a partner at Kleiner\nPerkins through a vegan fashion designer who knew someone at the Humane\nSociety who knew them,” Mr. Evans said.The partner at Kleiner Perkins, Amol\nDeshpande, was a believer, and the firm agreed to invest an additional half-\nmillion dollars and incubate Juicero in Silicon Valley. Mr. Evans left\nBrooklyn, moved into temporary housing in a shopping center on Sand Hill Road\nand raised $16.5 million in Series A financing.With the extra money, Mr. Evans\nbegan hiring software engineers, mechanical engineers, food scientists and app\ndevelopers. It wasn’t long before Mr. Evans realized he needed still more\nmoney. The innards of the machine were complex but manageable. It was the\nsoftware, the production facility, the electrical testing and a thousand other\nthings that necessitated a bigger staff.“I was just naïve,” Mr. Evans said. “I\nwas like Forrest Gump. I had no idea what it took to make a piece of hardware\nthat could ship to consumers safely.”So in 2015, Juicero raised a $70 million\nSeries B round. But even that was not enough. Mr. Evans is now raising more\nmoney, currently $28 million and counting.By some measures, Juicero is very\nmuch on trend. Soylent, a liquefied meal replacement, is already popular among\nsingle-minded coders too busy to eat. Chime, a device meant to brew Indian\nchai, will soon be on the market. A company called Tovala is raising money on\nKickstarter, hoping to build a hybrid microwave and toaster, and also sell\nspecialized meal packs.And cold-pressed juice, the variety that Mr. Evans is\nhoping to capitalize on, has had a minor renaissance in recent years. Suja, a\nSan Diego company, is selling bottles across the country, including in Costco,\nfor as little as $3.50 each. In 2011, Starbucks acquired Evolution Fresh, and\nnow sells cold-pressed juice in its thousands of coffee shops.“Just five years\nago, cold-pressed juice was a niche trend, popular only with health fanatics,”\nAndrew Alvarez, an analyst with IBISWorld, a market research firm, wrote in a\nrecent report. Now though, it “has hit the mainstream and given rise to\nhundreds of new juice bars, typically selling juice at higher price\npoints.”Still, there are signs that juice mania may have peaked. Last year,\nretail juice sales in the United States declined by 2 percent from 2014,\naccording to Euromonitor International, another market research firm. Sales of\nhome juicers were down 6 percent in the United States last year.There are also\nhealth concerns. One reason sales have been falling, analysts believe, is that\npeople are increasingly worried about sugar, even the naturally occurring\nkinds.Finally, there are the environmental questions about the single-serve\nmodel pioneered by coffee companies such as Keurig and Nespresso, which\ncreates a throwaway container with each serving. Every glass of Juicero juice\nneeds its own pack, which is shipped from Los Angeles to the customer,\nalthough Mr. Evans said he was developing a compostable pack.To succeed,\nJuicero will have to buck these trends, and also clear a more pedestrian\nhurdle — persuading people to pay a premium for another kitchen doodad. “Seven\nhundred dollars for a small cooking appliance is extremely high,” said\nVirginia Lee, beverage analyst for Euromonitor. “There are a lot of appliances\ncompeting for counter space, never mind the wallet.”Expensive as it is, what\nMr. Evans has packed into that counter space is rather remarkable. Inside the\nmachine is a series of gears and metal plates that exert 8,000 pounds of\npressure on packs of chopped fruits and vegetables.To make a glass of juice,\nyou insert a pack ($4 to $10 each) into the machine, close the door and press\na button. There are five flavors, including Sweet Roots (carrot, beet, orange,\nlemon and apple) and Spicy Greens (pineapple, romaine, celery, cucumber,\nspinach, parsley and jalapeño).Each pack has a QR code on it. A camera in the\nmachine scans the code on each pack and, using Wi-Fi, checks in with an online\ndatabase. If the pack is no longer fresh, or has been deemed contaminated, the\nmachine won’t press it. If the pack is O.K., the gears start turning and out\nsquirts the juice.So far, so complicated. But the real logistical feat is\nbehind the scenes. To create those packs in the Los Angeles plant, workers\nreceive truckloads of produce from nearby organic farms, triple-wash it, then\nchop it into specific shapes (carrots are finely diced, while beets are\nchunkier).A specialized machine then fills each pack. The packs are then sent\nby FedEx to users, who order them using Juicero’s smartphone app.Mr. Evans and\nhis investors speak of Juicero being a “platform” for a new paradigm of food\ndelivery. And they speak of commercial sales. Already, chain restaurants\nincluding Le Pain Quotidien have agreed to use Juicero. The hope is that\nbigger companies will put machines in their office kitchens, too.At this\npoint, however, the investors betting millions don’t have any sales data to\nreassure them. Instead, they have little more than Mr. Evans’s enthusiasm for\njuice. He drinks it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He is so committed to a\nlargely liquid diet that he rarely consumes water.“Organic cold-pressed juice\nis rainwater filtered through the soil and the roots and the stems and the\nplants,” he said. “You extract the water molecules, the chlorophyll, the\nanthocyanin and the flavonoids and the micronutrients. You’re getting this\nliving nutrition. It’s like drinking the nectar of the earth.”But do other\npeople have such refined palates when it comes to juice? Will those who don’t\nsubsist entirely on raw produce be able to tell a difference between organic\nand nonorganic fruit, as Mr. Evans claims to do? Even if they can, what will\nthey be willing to pay for the privilege of consuming it in their own\nkitchens? After all, this is a machine that won’t make a glass of carrot juice\nif your Wi-Fi is down.Industry insiders say that if anyone can pull it off, it\nis Mr. Evans. “This is not some guy who looked at a Bloomberg terminal and\nsaid, ‘Juice is trending,’” said Colleen Wachob, a former Organic Avenue\nemployee who is now chief brand officer at MindBodyGreen, a lifestyle website.\n“He’s been into this since before it was cool.”\n\n","title":"A $700 Juicer for the Kitchen That Caught Silicon Valley’s Eye - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"His pitch: a $700 box that makes 8 oz. of juice.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01425"},"content":"Tesla Motors says its new Model 3 is, at $35,000 each, meant to bring the\ncompany’s electric vehicle technology to the masses. And with more than\n115,000 orders before the car was even introduced, it is well on its way.A\ncrowd of Tesla fans cheered as the Model 3, a sleek five-seater, was unveiled\nThursday evening at the company’s design studio in Hawthorne, Calif.\nInterested customers lined up at Tesla dealerships around the country, and the\nenthusiasm was matched with a torrent of comments online.The Model 3 is “the\nfinal step in the master plan, which is a mass market, affordable car,”\nTesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, said at the unveiling. “It was only\npossible to do after going through the prior steps.”The vehicle comes after\nyears of lower-volume production of Tesla’s initial Roadster, Model S and\nModel X.“With any new technology, it takes multiple iterations and it takes\neconomies of scale before you can make it great and affordable,” Mr. Musk\nsaid.The Model 3 will be able to travel at least 215 miles on a single charge\nand can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in less than six seconds.Each advance\norder included a charge of $1,000, and the company took in more than $115\nmillion within 24 hours. If those orders all translate into sales, revenue\nfrom the Model 3 will exceed $4 billion. A screen at the debut event Thursday\nshowed online reservations continuing to tick past 133,000.“This is kind of\ncrazy,” Mr. Musk said in announcing the number of advance orders.Although the\nModel 3 unveiling generated intense buzz, the company faces competition from\nautomotive giants like General Motors and Renault-Nissan, which have also\nbegun manufacturing electric vehicles. Low fuel prices could hurt overall\nsales of electric vehicles.But on Thursday, Mr. Musk’s biggest worry appeared\nto be satisfying demand for his new car. Delivery of the Model 3 is scheduled\nto begin at the end of 2017, first for customers on the West Coast of North\nAmerica, then the East Coast, and then overseas.“I do feel fairly confident it\nwill be next year,” Mr. Musk said to laughter from the audience.Meeting\nanticipated interest in the cheaper model will require a sharp increase in\nTesla’s production capacity. Last year the company delivered 50,580\nvehicles.Mr. Musk said Thursday that he believed the company’s factory in\nFremont, Calif., could produce as many as 500,000 vehicles annually.“It’s very\ndoable,” he said.The expansion also requires the construction of a huge\nbattery production plant. Tesla began construction of its Gigafactory 1 in\nnorthern Nevada in 2014. It is now operational, and once it is at full\ncapacity, it will “produce more lithium ion batteries than all other factories\nin the world combined,” Mr. Musk said.\n\n","title":"Tesla Model 3 Orders Surge Even Before Its Unveiling - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Tesla’s Model 3 orders surge even before its unveiling https://t.co/OppS8yHyb2 https://t.co/csgoWhMl1H","date":"Fri Apr 01 11:11:05 +0000 2016","favs":236,"id":{"$numberLong":"715859023971622912"},"retweets":147},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1RQcXqD"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01426"},"content":"KOLKATA, India — The police in Kolkata on Friday filed a criminal complaint of\nculpable homicide and criminal breach of trust against the company that was\nbuilding an elevated highway that collapsed on Thursday, and then detained\neight of the company’s executives.As rescue workers continued to look through\nthe rubble and cut into trapped vehicles with blowtorches and other equipment,\nthe company, IVRCL, came under intense scrutiny, with reports that it had run\ninto problems with at least two states and a publicly owned company under the\nIndian Ministry of Railways.At least 23 people were killed in the accident in\nthe crowded Ganesh Talkies area of Kolkata, formerly Calcutta, and 85 people\nwere injured, the police said. Five hundred people in various rescue\ncapacities were working at the site Friday night, said a Kolkata police\nsergeant, S. Satgava, adding, “We cannot tell how many more are trapped.” One\nperson was rescued Friday evening, he said.Early on Saturday morning, rescuers\nremoved what they said was the last body from the rubble.Television footage\nfrom the scene of the collapse showed cranes lifting steel plates, bulldozers\nclearing concrete rubble and workers cutting metal slabs into smaller pieces\nto lift them out of the wreckage. Part of the highway was twisted and hanging\ndown, said Sandeep Channan, an official with the National Disaster Response\nForce, and engineers were working to stabilize it.One local man observing the\nscene wondered out loud how residents could feel safe living under the\nstructure if the project resumed after this accident.IVRCL is a major\nconstruction company carrying out irrigation, road, mining and power projects\nacross India, as well as in Sri Lanka, the Middle East and Africa. At a news\nconference on Friday in Hyderabad, where the company is based, officials said\nthey were shocked by the episode but refused to comment on the police\ncomplaint, saying they had not seen it.K. Panduranga Rao, the group head of\nhuman resources and administration at IVRCL, said in a telephone interview\nthat he was not the appropriate person to comment on punitive actions taken\nagainst his company, but also refused to refer questions to anyone else.There\nwere numerous questions about the company, and no shortage of critics. Derek\nO’Brien, a spokesman for the state of West Bengal, which includes Kolkata,\nsaid the company had been barred from doing business in the state of Uttar\nPradesh. He said the police had detained six company officials in Kolkata and\ntwo in Hyderabad for questioning.“The company has a bad reputation,” he told\nthe news agency ANI. “The law will take its own course. No one will be\nspared.”Satish Agnihotri, the chairman and managing director of Rail Vikas\nNigam Limited, the publicly owned company under the Railways Ministry, called\nIVRCL “a major defaulter.” In a telephone interview, he said his company had\nterminated its contracts with IVRCL over the past three years because of poor\nperformance.“They were working with us, with our company, and because of their\nlack of performance, or because of their poor performance, we terminated their\ncontracts,” he said.IVRCL would be forbidden to bid on any further contracts\nfor two years after the last termination, he added. Mr. Agnihotri said his\ncompany had also cashed in performance guarantees for several of IVRCL’s\nprojects, although he could not recall the penalty amounts.Chandreshwar Prasad\nSingh, the minister of urban development, housing and transportation in the\nstate of Jharkhand, said in an interview that his state had blacklisted IVRCL\nin February because of delays in finishing projects that included laying\npipelines for drinking water and putting up electrical wires in eight rural\ndistricts.“Such companies need to know that it is a question both of quality\nand quantity,” said Mr. Singh, who in February took to the floor of the State\nAssembly to accuse the company of cheating the government. They need to know\nthat projects “must be finished in a time-bound manner,” he added. “IVRCL\nfailed on all accounts.”“What happens, or should happen with blacklisting, is\nthat other states sit up and take note of the company’s image and do not award\nany future projects as well,” Mr. Singh said.But that seems not to have\nhappened, probably because government contracts are awarded to the lowest\nbidder once basic technical criteria have been met, finance experts said.They\nsaid that the infrastructure industry in India was under stress, and that\namong its biggest weakness was in the management of complex construction\nprojects, like the elevated highway that collapsed in Kolkata.West Bengal’s\nchief minister, Mamata Banerjee, told The Press Trust of India, a news agency,\nthat IVRCL had been awarded the contract for the highway in 2009, under a\nprevious administration.Bureaucratic and other delays hampered the project\nfrom the start. The company said on its website that the project was among its\ntoughest, cutting through a crowded neighborhood and requiring heavy\nmachinery. Construction time was limited to six hours a day.The company had\nbeen struggling with debt. After a restructuring plan fell apart early this\nyear, banks that were its largest debtors converted their debt into equity,\ntaking control of the company, The Press Trust of India reported.\n\n","title":"Construction Firm Accused in India Overpass Collapse - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Construction Firm Charged in India Overpass Collapse https://t.co/O1CqZcknLD","date":"Fri Apr 01 11:05:32 +0000 2016","favs":105,"id":{"$numberLong":"715857624621821952"},"retweets":69},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22Uzf31"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01427"},"content":"“Words cannot describe what we’ve done,” said Thierry W. Despont, referring to\nthe interior design of the apartments at 53W53, a condominium building rising\nbeside the Museum of Modern Art in Midtown Manhattan.But a reporter can at\nleast try.Mr. Despont, a French-born, New York-based architect and designer\nwho has outfitted private homes for the likes of Calvin Klein and Bill Gates,\nhas incorporated a trove of upscale materials and finishes into the model\napartment at 53W53.The towering black walnut front door is framed in bronze\nwith a glowing onyx sidelight, and the custom bronze handle from E. R. Butler\n\u0026amp; Company mimics the shape of the tapering building, designed by the\narchitect Jean Nouvel.In the kitchen, thinly sliced slabs of polished Statuary\nmarble are backlighted to create glowing backsplashes above Molteni\u0026amp;C Dada\ncabinetry from Italy. The master bathroom is a glittering dreamlike quarry,\nwith sinks carved from solid blocks of Verona limestone floating on what\nappear to be cushions of light, and walls clad in slabs of veined Black St.\nLaurent marble and honey-hued Peruvian travertine.“It’s quite different from\nanything else that’s being built in New York City,” Mr. Despont said of the\nproject, which is being developed by Hines, the Pontiac Land Group and Goldman\nSachs, with apartments priced from about $3 million to more than $70\nmillion.Across the city, a number of other developers and designers are making\nthe same claim. Where granite countertops, strip hardwood flooring and a Sub-\nZero refrigerator once sufficed, now highly distinctive materials and finishes\nand custom components are required to signify luxury and set a project apart.\nIn the competition to woo buyers, the new playing fields are the stone and\ntile showrooms, the flooring and cabinetry shops, and the factories that\nproduce decorative hardware and plumbing fixtures.The big-bucks look doesn’t\ncome cheap. For instance, while one-and-a-quarter-inch-thick slabs of common\ngranite like Ubatuba and Absolute Black can cost under $20 a square foot, not\nincluding fabrication and installation, according to Stone Source, a national\nstone supplier, top-grade white Calacatta and Statuary marble from Italy can\nrun up to $150 per square foot.At 45 East 22nd Street, the designer Martin\nBrudnizki has assembled his own opulent material palette for a 65-story, $500\nmillion 83-unit tower being developed by the Continuum Company, where one-\nbedrooms start at $2.75 million and penthouses rise to more than $38\nmillion.The model unit has an oak front door nearly three inches thick, with\nfluted trim, and the kitchen is equipped with Bleu de Savoie marble\ncountertops, an exotic Mercury Black marble peninsula with a distinctive wave\npattern and custom bronze Nanz hardware. The master bathroom is a blizzard of\nMountain White Danby marble with bold black veins, furnished with a polished\nstainless-steel vanity and glossy teak doors.“We tried to do some very\nspecific, unusual things,” said Ian Bruce Eichner, the chairman of the\nContinuum Company. “It’s a little edgy — no guts, no glory.”And at 172 Madison\nAvenue, a 69-unit condominium with prices ranging from about $1.8 million to\n$33 million, the designer Shamir Shah is installing hefty blackened-oak doors\nwith a white cerused finish to highlight the grain, along with eight-inch-wide\nplank oak floors. The master bathroom is a high-contrast affair in Taurus\nBlack and Bianco Neve marble, with custom bronze-framed medicine cabinets, and\nthe centerpiece of the powder room is a wall of heavily textured chiseled\nlimestone, bathed in light from an LED cove.“We didn’t cheap out, even though\nwe could have built it for much less,” said Yitzchak Tessler, the founder and\nchief executive of Tessler Developments, which is developing the building. “We\nwant to offer something that’s better and nicer than what someone else is\ndoing.”Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel,\nestimated a bathroom clad in premium marble could cost twice as much as one\nfinished with standard ceramic tile. Spending on lavish finishes is now almost\na necessity, he said: “There’s a lot of competition, and the key from the\ndeveloper’s standpoint is that they have to differentiate.”That’s a departure\nfrom the last development cycle, before the financial crisis of 2008, Mr.\nMiller said, when “whether or not a building had a starchitect or a beautiful\nlobby, when you got into the apartments themselves, they all had almost the\nsame finishes — what was initially unique and luxurious became generic.”The\ndrive to deliver something extraordinary is fueled by new market realities:\nDevelopment activity is increasingly skewed toward the very top of the market,\nand the costs developers have to absorb have skyrocketed.“Developers have to\ngo all in, because many are paying at or near record prices for land, and\nthey’re competing for resources like labor and materials, and paying a premium\nfor that,” Mr. Miller said. “They’re already committed to a high price point.\nIf they don’t create something unique within that space, all of it is for\nnaught.”That’s how Madison Realty Capital, the developer of 1 Great Jones\nAlley, a 16-unit condominium designed by BKSK Architects, arrived at the\ndecision to splurge on finishes. Kitchens there have Calacatta marble\ncountertops purported to come from the very quarry where Michelangelo sourced\nstone for his sculpture of David. Satin nickel door levers are custom made by\nE. R. Butler, and master bathrooms have Turkish quartzite slab walls and\nfloors, teak-wrapped Japanese soaking tubs and Dornbracht plumbing fixtures\nwith a rose-gold finish.“Historically, when fixed project costs start to rise\n— the foundation, the superstructure, the mechanical systems –— there’s a\ntendency to start to cut costs on the finishes,” said Dan Cobleigh, the\nmanaging director of design and development at Madison Realty Capital. “We\nwere faced with that when the budget was getting ever higher.” The company’s\ninitial target of $28 million swelled to about $31 million.But instead of\ncutting back, Mr. Cobleigh’s company invested more to create something extra\nluxurious, spending a total of roughly $4 million over the cost of typical\ncondominium materials.“You have to try to create a product that no one else\nhas ever seen before,” he said. “We thought we’d give ourselves a pretty good\nchance, in a competitive market, to outdo our competition.”So far, the\nstrategy seems to be working. One quarter of the units, priced from $4.6 to\n$22.5 million, were spoken for even before sales officially started earlier\nthis month.This obsession with finishes isn’t limited to ultra-high-end\nbuildings, or to Manhattan. Several Brooklyn condominium developments with\nsomewhat more earthly prices are following suit.At 465 Pacific Street in\nBoerum Hill, a 30-unit condominium, rising at a cost of more than $50 million,\nMorris Adjmi Architects and the developers, Avery Hall Investments and Aria\nDevelopment Group, were just as choosy with finishes, although the units are\ndesigned to reflect the more relaxed vibe of brownstone Brooklyn.\nNevertheless, the team is spending about 20 percent more than it would have on\ntypical condominium finishes, opting for oiled oak floors with a matte finish,\nbathrooms with Arctic Gray marble floors in a chevron pattern and kitchens\nwith custom Shaker-inspired walnut pulls and honed countertops of snowy Bianco\nDolomiti marble.“When you touch this marble, it has a different feel,” said\nJesse Wark, a principal of Avery Hall Investments. “We must have gone through\n20 different samples, having them finish it multiple ways, to get what we\nwanted.”As Mr. Wark pointed out, by way of explanation: “Brooklyn is maturing\nquickly; the level of design and expectations for new homes has gone through\nthe roof. We’re really sensitive, and aligned, to that.”Sales began in\nOctober, with prices from $835,000 to $4.85 million, and every unit has\nsold.At 51 Jay Street in Dumbo, the architecture firm ODA and the developers\nSlate Property Group and Adam America Real Estate are behind a 74-unit\ncondominium conversion that blends upscale finishes with an industrial\naesthetic. Floors are fumed oak planks in a herringbone pattern; black\nlacquered kitchen cabinets have a traditional paneled design with ribbed glass\ninserts; master bathroom walls are tiled in white Sivec marble from Macedonia\nwith black Nero Marquina marble trim; and the floors and tubs are covered in\nWalnut Brown marble.“We believe this combination of materials elevates the\ncomposition, and looks like something super-upscale,” said Eran Chen, the\nfounder and executive director of ODA. “It responds to the heritage and\nhistory of the building, but still feels fresh.”More than 70 percent of the\nunits, priced from about $1 million to $6 million, have sold since sales\nstarted in January 2015.So how is a buyer to know what’s worth paying for? Is\none condominium’s Calacatta Michelangelo better — or more valuable — than\nanother’s Mountain White Danby or Bianco Dolomiti?It’s difficult to say.Evan\nNussbaum, a vice president of Stone Source, explained the basics. “In the\nstone world, we look at quality across two main measures,” he said. “You have\nthe actual quality of the stone, meaning its durability in terms of abrasion\nresistance and absorption. Then we look at selection, which has everything to\ndo with aesthetics.”Not all stone coming out of the same quarry is of equal\nquality, he said. Suppliers try to choose the best material, but the tighter\nthe selection, the higher the price. There are also few standards for stone\nnames, which further complicates matters: One company’s Silver Wave marble\nmight be exactly the same as another company’s Kenya Black.But there are a few\nthings a buyer should keep in mind. For starters, while marble is all the rage\nin new condominiums, it’s not always the most practical choice.“All marbles\nare going to patina,” Mr. Nussbaum said. “They’re all going to scratch and\nacid etch, even when they’re sealed, but some of them wear that better than\nothers.”Buyers who blanch at the thought of acid etching, the mark left by\nsubstances such as lemon juice, might prefer developments offering more\ndurable options like quartzite, granite or Caesarstone.If nothing but marble\nwill do, however, Mr. Nussbaum recommends a honed rather than polished finish\nfor counters and floors, because the matte surface helps to hide acid etching.\nYou should also be aware, he said, that the denser the marble and the lower\nits absorption rate, the more resistant it will be to wear. Some of the best\nwhite marbles in that regard, he added, are those from Carrara, Italy, and\nDanby, Vt. (More information can be found in the database on Stone Source’s\nwebsite, which rates various marbles according to abrasion resistance,\nabsorption, acid sensitivity and recommended uses.)Judging the quality of a\nhardwood floor is easier: Just look down.“You can spot a cheap finish a mile\naway, even if you’re not in the industry,” said James Caroll II, the principal\nof LV Wood, a flooring supplier in New York. “When a finish is not high-end,\nit appears almost like a hard plastic coating on top of the wood.” But when\nit’s done right, there’s “a very natural, tactile feel.”Hardwood floors are\nusually covered with either a water-based polyurethane or an oil finish. Most\nnew developments go with the polyurethane, because it’s tough and requires\nalmost no maintenance. But if the wood is damaged, the whole floor often has\nto be sanded and refinished.Oil finishes, on the other hand, create a soft\nmatte surface that may wear more over time, and require regular maintenance,\nbut are easily spot-repaired when scratched.When it comes to wide-plank\nfloors, which are popular at the moment, Mr. Caroll said, “the wider it is,\nthe more expensive it is.” But wider planks tend to exaggerate the natural\nshrinking and movement of wood, which may later result in gaps between the\nboards. (The best way to prevent that, he said, is to maintain a constant\ninterior humidity level.) Multistep treatments — cerusing, fuming, bleaching\nand wire brushing — also tend to drive up the price of a floor, as do\ncomplicated installations like herringbones and other patterns.In the kitchen,\ndevelopers are playing up premium cabinetry systems by brands like Henrybuilt,\nMolteni\u0026amp;C Dada and Smallbone of Devizes, all of which offer a high level\nof craftsmanship and attention to detail.“It’s about what’s on the inside, how\nit functions and what it feels like to use it,” said Scott Hudson, the chief\nexecutive of Henrybuilt, whose company supplied kitchens to the 33-unit\nSterling Mason condominium at 71 Laight Street in TriBeCa, designed by Morris\nAdjmi Architects and the interior design firm Gachot.For retail customers,\nHenrybuilt’s kitchens start at about $50,000 and can run well over $100,000.\nThe resulting product “is more hand-built,” Mr. Hudson said, “and diminishes\nthe feeling of being just like everything else.”And that’s exactly what\ndesigners and developers are hoping for.“We agonize over every material and\nchoice,” said Mr. Adjmi, the architect. “But when people come through that\ndoor, what matters most is how everything works together — and how they feel.”\n\n","title":"Exotic Marble and Opulent Finishes Lure Buyers - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Exotic Marble and Opulent Finishes Lure Buyers https://t.co/tJzcEb9tti","date":"Fri Apr 01 10:45:12 +0000 2016","favs":70,"id":{"$numberLong":"715852506954391553"},"retweets":38},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22UwpLt"}

The portion of\nthe overpass that fell was more than 300 feet long, according to Sovan\nChatterjee, the mayor of Kolkata, formerly known as Calcutta.By Friday\nmorning, 22 people were confirmed dead, said S. Das, a Kolkata police officer,\nand the toll could rise further still. At least 85 were injured, a spokesman\nfor the Kolkata police said.“Monumental tragedy,” Derek O’Brien, a spokesman\nfor the state of West Bengal, which includes Kolkata, said in a Twitter post.\nThe state’s chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, who is seeking re-election, left\na campaign event to go to the scene of the disaster.Television video showed a\nlarge structure of metal and concrete that had crashed to the ground in a\ncramped, congested area. People could be seen digging through the wreckage\nwith their bare hands, and cranes were removing crushed cars.The overpass is\nin the crowded Ganesh Talkies neighborhood, named after an old movie theater.\nThe project had been under construction since 2009 and has missed several\ndeadlines for completion, according to The Telegraph, an Indian daily.In 2014,\nIVRCL, the company building the overpass, asked the government for more funds,\nciting its inability to buy materials. At that point, the project was more\nthan three years behind schedule, and residents had complained that it was\ndangerously near their homes — a growing peril as India undertakes\ninfrastructure projects in its increasingly crowded cities.It was not\nimmediately clear what had caused the accident. K. Panduranga Rao, an official\nwith IVRCL, told reporters on Thursday that a girder supporting the structure\nhad collapsed. But his associate, A. G. K. Murty, said it was too soon to know\nthe cause.“One girder missed, then the second one also fell; that’s how this\naccident has taken place,” Mr. Rao said in televised comments. “It’s nothing\nbut a god’s act.”Both said about 70 percent of the project had been\ncompleted.Ms. Banerjee, the state’s chief minister, said that the project had\nbegun under a previous administration, which contracted it to IVRCL. She said\nIVRCL had not shared the details of the project’s plan with the current\ngovernment.“Stringent action will be taken against officials of the\nconstruction company and others involved,” she said, according to The Press\nTrust of India, a news agency.Last year, Ms. Banerjee publicly committed to\ncompleting the much-delayed overpass by February, according to The Telegraph,\na goal that engineers associated with the project told the paper was\nunrealistic. Her political opponents were swift to blame Ms. Banerjee’s\nadministration.“This is a very serious example of corruption,” said Kailash\nVijayvargiya, a general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party. “The chief\nminister is directly responsible for the Kolkata accident, and charges of\nmurder must be filed against the chief minister.”\n\n","title":"Kolkata Overpass Collapse Leaves Dozens Dead or Injured - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesworld: Kolkata, India, overpass collapse kills 18; rescuers strain to save people still trapped https://t.co/nmoz6ssb78 https://…","date":"Fri Apr 01 10:22:03 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715846683431669760"},"retweets":127},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VcNpX7"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0142a"},"content":"About two weeks after a grisly shooting in a Pittsburgh suburb, Wendy Bell, a\nlocal news anchor for WTAE-TV, wrote a public Facebook post that focused in\npart on finding hope and offering kindness.But before the offering kindness\npart, she swerved into racial commentary that led to her being fired on\nWednesday.She was responding to a shooting at a backyard party on March 9 in\nWilkinsburg, Pa., that killed five people, including a pregnant woman. No one\nhas been arrested, and the police have not yet publicly identified\nsuspects.Yet in her Facebook post on March 21, which was later edited and\neventually deleted, Ms. Bell played detective in a way that some felt relied\non damaging stereotypes.“You needn’t be a criminal profiler to draw a mental\nsketch of the killers who broke so many hearts two weeks ago Wednesday,” she\nwrote. The post continued: “They are young black men, likely in their teens or\nin their early 20s. They have multiple siblings from multiple fathers and\ntheir mothers work multiple jobs. These boys have been in the system before.\nThey’ve grown up there. They know the police. They’ve been arrested.”In the\nsame post, Ms. Bell mentioned a hard-working, young, black man whom she saw\nworking at a restaurant, praising him in a way that came across as\npatronizing. “I wonder how long it had been since someone told him he was\nspecial,” she wrote.Ms. Bell did not immediately respond to a phone message\nseeking comment.Station officials moved last week to take her off the air and\ndistance themselves from the remarks. Charles W. Wolfertz, the station’s\npresident and general manager, addressed viewers in a broadcast explaining the\nmove during which he said Ms. Bell showed “an egregious lack of judgment.”In a\nstatement circulated by the station’s parent company, Hearst, WTAE-TV said her\ncomments were “inconsistent with the company’s ethics and journalistic\nstandards.”A Hearst spokesman declined further comment.Ms. Bell, who joined\nthe station in 1998 and has won 21 regional Emmy Awards, apologized last week\non her Facebook account, which has since been deleted. “I now understand that\nsome of the words I chose were insensitive and could be viewed as racist,” she\nwrote. “I regret offending anyone. I’m truly sorry.”But on Wednesday, she told\nThe Associated Press that she didn’t get a “fair shake” and argued that\npeople’s focus should be on “African-Americans being killed by other African-\nAmericans.”“It makes me sick,” she said. “What matters is what’s going on in\nAmerica, and it is the death of black people in this country.”She continued:\n“I live next to three war-torn communities in the city of Pittsburgh, that I\nlove dearly. My stories, they struck a nerve. They touched people, but it’s\nnot enough. More needs to be done. The problem needs to be\naddressed.”Criticism of her Facebook post has spread well beyond Pittsburgh. A\nFacebook group was formed demanding that WTAE-TV “hold Wendy Bell accountable”\nand attracted more than 1,000 members.Damon Young, the editor in chief of Very\nSmart Brothas, a publication targeted at African-American readers, summed up a\ncommon sentiment, writing, “Wendy Bell is utterly clueless about race, White\nprivilege, and how her privilege contributes to her tone deaf myopia in\nregards to race.”But Ms. Bell also attracted supporters, many of whom have\nbeen peppering the station’s Facebook page with comments supporting her over\nwhat they see as an unjust firing motivated by political correctness.“She\nspoke the truth, and the people responsible for having her fired should be\nashamed for this happening,” one supporter wrote.Ms. Bell had previously been\nforced to apologize for remarks perceived as offensive to African-Americans,\naccording to the liberal watchdog Media Matters. In 2010, after a segment on\nsunscreen, Ms. Bell turned to her black co-anchor and said: “I want whatever\nyou’re using.”Apologizing later, she said, “The words I said didn’t come out\nthe right way, and as such, offended some of you, which leaves me deeply\ntroubled. I would never want to offend ANYONE, as my words clearly did. I hope\nyou will accept my sincere apology.”\n\n","title":"Pittsburgh TV Anchor Is Fired After Racial Facebook Post - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"A Pittsburgh TV anchor is fired after a racial Facebook post about a shooting at a backyard party https://t.co/3k1Qug5TkJ","date":"Fri Apr 01 10:11:47 +0000 2016","favs":94,"id":{"$numberLong":"715844100096974848"},"retweets":81},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1Sqy7Jq"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0142b"},"content":"Bernie Sanders’s surrogate Susan Sarandon went on MSNBC’s “All in With Chris\nHayes” earlier this week and said something that made folks’ jaws drop.When\nHayes asked Sarandon whether Sanders’s supporters would vote for Hillary\nClinton if Clinton won the Democratic nomination, this exchange\nfollowed:_SARANDON: I think Bernie probably would encourage people because he\ndoesn’t have any ego. I think a lot of people are, sorry, I can’t bring myself\nto do that.__HAYES: How about you personally?__SARANDON: I don’t know. I’m\ngoing to see what happens.__HAYES: Really?__SARANDON: Really.__HAYES: I cannot\nbelieve as you’re watching the, if Donald Trump…__SARANDON: Some people feel\nDonald Trump will bring the revolution immediately if he gets in then things\nwill really, you know, explode.__HAYES: You’re saying the Leninist model\nof…__SARANDON: Some people feel that._(I don’t generally use the Republican\nfront-runner’s name in my columns, but I must present the quote as\ntranscribed. Sorry.)What was Sarandon talking about with her coy language?\n“Bring the revolution”? Exactly what kind of revolution? “Explode”? Was the\npurpose to present this as a difficult but ultimately positive development?The\ncomments smacked of petulance and privilege.No member of an American minority\ngroup — whether ethnic, racial, queer-identified, immigrant, refugee or poor —\nwould (or should) assume the luxury of uttering such a imbecilic phrase,\nfilled with lust for doom.But I don’t doubt that she has met “some people”\nwith a Bernie-or-bust, scorched-earth electoral portentousness. As The Wall\nStreet Journal reported earlier this month, “A new Wall Street Journal/NBC\nNews poll indicates one third of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders’ supporters\ncannot see themselves voting for Hillary Clinton in November.”Be absolutely\nclear: While there are meaningful differences between Clinton and Sanders,\neither would be a far better choice for president than any of the remaining\nRepublican contenders, especially the demagogic real estate developer.\nAssisting or allowing his ascendance by electoral abstinence in order to force\na “revolution” is heretical.This position is dangerous, shortsighted and self-\nimmolating.If Sanders wins the nomination, liberals should rally round him.\nConversely, if Clinton does, they should rally round her.This is not a game.\nThe presidency, particularly the next one, matters, and elections can be\ndecided by relatively small margins. No president has won the popular vote by\nmore than 10 percentage points since Ronald Reagan in 1984.When Al Gore ran\nagainst George W. Bush in 2000, some claimed that a vote for Gore was almost\nthe same as a vote for Bush and encouraged people to cast protest votes for\nRalph Nader. Sarandon supported Nader during that election. Bush became\npresident, and what did we get? Two incredibly young, incredibly conservative\njustices, John G. Roberts Jr. and Samuel A. Alito Jr., who will be on the\ncourt for decades, and two wars — in Afghanistan and Iraq — that, together,\nlasted over a decade.In addition to setting the tone and direction of the\ncountry, the president has some constitutional duties that are profound and\nconsequential. They include being commander in chief, making treaties and\nappointing judges, including, most importantly, justices to the Supreme Court.\nBush demonstrated the consequences of that.The real estate developer is now\ntalking carelessly about promoting nuclear proliferation and torture (then\nthere’s Ted Cruz’s talk of carpet bombing and glowing sand).And, there is a\nvacancy on the Supreme Court. Not only that, but as of Tuesday, there were\nalso 84 federal judiciary vacancies with 49 pending nominees.The question of\nwho makes those appointments matters immensely.As Jeffrey Toobin pointed out\nin The New Yorker in 2014:“When Obama took office, Republican appointees\ncontrolled ten of the thirteen circuit courts of appeals; Democratic\nappointees now constitute a majority in nine circuits. Because federal judges\nhave life tenure, nearly all of Obama’s judges will continue serving well\nafter he leaves office.**”**Furthermore, Toobin laid out the diversity of the\nObama transformation, writing:“Sheldon Goldman, a professor at the University\nof Massachusetts at Amherst and a scholar of judicial appointments, said, ‘The\nmajority of Obama’s appointments are women and nonwhite males.’ Forty-two\npercent of his judgeships have gone to women. Twenty-two percent of George W.\nBush’s judges and 29 percent of Bill Clinton’s were women. Thirty-six percent\nof President Obama’s judges have been minorities, compared with 18 percent for\nBush and 24 percent for Clinton.”And beyond war and courts, there is the issue\nof inclusion.Take Obama’s legacy on gay rights. He signed the bill repealing\n“don’t ask, don’t tell.” And in 2012, Obama became the first sitting president\nto support same-sex marriage. Last year, Obama became the first president to\nsay “lesbian,” “transgender” and “bisexual” in a State of the Union speech.Of\nmore substance, according to the Gay \u0026amp; Lesbian Victory Institute:“To date,\nthe Obama-Biden Administration has appointed more than 250 openly LGBT\nprofessionals to full-time and advisory positions in the executive branch;\nmore than all known LGBT appointments of other presidential administrations\ncombined.”There is no reason to believe that this level of acceptance would\ncontinue under the real estate developer’s administration. In fact, the\nHuffington Post Queer Voices editor at large Michelangelo Signorile wrote an\narticle in February titled, “No, LGBT People Aren’t Exempt from Donald Trump’s\nBlatant Bigotry,” responding to a trending idea that the Republican front-\nrunner wasn’t as bad for queer people as other Republican candidates:“It’s\nabsolutely false — he’s as extreme as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and will do\nnothing for LGBT rights — and it’s time to disabuse the media and everyone\nelse of this notion once and for all.”Then there are all the other promises —\nthreats? — the real estate developer has made. He has said he would deport all\nundocumented immigrants, build a border wall between the United States and\nMexico, end birthright citizenship, dismantle Obamacare and replace it with\nsomething “terrific” (whatever that means), defund Planned Parenthood and\ntemporarily ban most foreign Muslims from coming to this country, among other\nthings.There is no true equivalency between either of the Democratic\ncandidates and this man, and anyone who make such a claim is engaging in a\nrepugnant, dishonorable scare tactic not worth our respect.It is unfortunate\nfor Sanders, who seems infinitely sober and sensible, that some of his\nsurrogates and supporters present themselves as absolutist and doctrinaire. As\nSanders himself has said, “on her worst day, Hillary Clinton will be an\ninfinitely better candidate and president than the Republican candidate on his\nbest day.”The New York Times Upshot even pointed out last May that Sanders and\nClinton “voted the same way 93 percent of the time in the two years they\nshared in the Senate” and in many of the cases in which Clinton voted\ndifferently from Sanders, “she voted with an overwhelming majority of her\ncolleagues, including Republicans.”That doesn’t mean that those differing\nvotes weren’t significant. They were. As the Upshot put it, the 31 times they\ndisagreed “happened to be” on some of “the biggest issues of the day,\nincluding measures on continuing the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, an\nimmigration reform bill and bank bailouts during the depths of the Great\nRecession.”And yet those differences hardly bring either candidate anywhere\nclose to being as frightening as the specter of the real estate developer\nassuming the office of president of the United States.Elections are about\nchoices, not always between a dream candidate and a dreaded one, but sometimes\nbetween common sense and catastrophe. Progressives had better remember this\ncome November, no matter who the Democratic nominee is.\n\n","title":"‘Bernie or Bust’ Is Bonkers - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":".@CharlesMBlow says \"Bernie or bust\" is bonkers https://t.co/V3KpI20RTd via @nytopinion https://t.co/liN8XVAnBr","date":"Fri Apr 01 09:40:49 +0000 2016","favs":318,"id":{"$numberLong":"715836306874634242"},"retweets":139},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SC8oAl"}

Katrina,\n53, and Wendie, 54, were 24 when they married.**Where did they grow\nup?**Wendie in Washington in a Reform Jewish household with parents who were\nprofessionals and traveled widely for work. Katrina in happy homes in\nThornwood and Katonah, N.Y., then in Australia from age 12 to 18; her father\nwas in finance, her mother is an artist and active in her community: “We went\nto my dad for permission, we went to my mother for comfort,” Katrina said. She\nknew she was “in the wrong body” from age 6, but also knew, even at that age,\nthat that would never be revealed.**How did they meet?**In 1985 at a Halloween\nparty in New York City. Wendie, then a journalist, was working for Newsweek.\nKatrina, then still Scott, was working for Morgan Stanley. They felt\nimmediately connected and shared a sense of humor. Wendie could quote Monty\nPython, which made Katrina announce “this was the woman I am going to\nmarry.”Wendie describes the connection as beshert, the Yiddish word for\ndestined, or soul mates. Katrina, then Christian, converted to Judaism during\ntheir marriage.**Why did they marry?**Several months after they began dating,\nKatrina was transferred to Japan, which prompted a proposal. “I was in love,\nbut also terrified,” said Katrina, who added that it felt somewhat deceitful\nto propose marriage. “I knew I was not meant to be a boy, but I loved Wendie\nand consciously picked a conventional life.” Katrina had known since puberty\nthat she was attracted only to women. “I felt as though I had to live up to\nother people’s expectations,” said Katrina, who said that keeping her secret\ndespite marriage was a deep conflict for her.Wendie thought they were\nperfectly suited to each other. “Everything lined up,” she said.**Where did\nthey live**** after marrying?**They first lived in Tokyo for Katrina’s work.\nThey later moved to Cambridge, Mass., so Katrina could attend Harvard Business\nSchool, and then to New York and eventually back to Japan. By their second\nstint in Tokyo in 1991, they had two daughters.**How were the early\nyears?**Both say happy and exciting. “We really got each other,” Katrina said.\nThey had a fulfilling intimate life, they loved their girls and they had a\ngroup of international friends.But the secret was troubling to Katrina; she\nhad thought that if she had what she called a “normal” life, with a marriage,\nchildren and a prestigious job, her gender issues would resolve. They didn’t.\nShe kept burying that feeling.**First signs of t****rouble?**In 1992, Katrina,\nthen still Scott, confessed to an affair. Although Wendie was surprised, she\nalso said it seemed to be common for businessmen in Japan.“I wasn’t happy with\nmyself, and began to despise myself,” Katrina said. “The affair was self-\nsabotage.”**Did they try to work on things with therapy?**Yes, they found an\nEnglish-speaking counselor. There were promises that the affair would stop,\nbut soon Wendie discovered another.**Who asked for the split?**Wendie. In\n1993, they left Japan and separated. Wendie returned to Washington. They\nreconciled briefly later that year, but it didn’t last. Katrina, still Scott,\ntook jobs in Russia and Indonesia and was a committed parent, seeing the\nfamily often and staying in constant touch. Katrina provided financial\nsupport, including buying the family a home.**The final breakup?**They were\ndivorced in 1996 in Washington. “Whatever anger we felt toward each other, we\nagreed to keep between us and not entangle the girls,” Wendie said. The\ndivorce was cheap and fast. Wendie still felt confused about the breakup,\nthough. “I never understood exactly what Katrina was unhappy about in our\nrelationship,” she said.**How did they move on?**Wendie went back to school\nand trained in a new profession. The children were in preschool. “Katrina\nalways had my back and was generous with time and money,” Wendie said. Katrina\nremarried twice after Wendie, continuing to hold her secret.It was in 2002,\nwhile working in Russia, that Katrina came out to a colleague about being\ntransgender. She read “She’s Not There: A Life in Two Genders,” by Jennifer\nFinney Boylan, which she said showed her “a person with the same condition as\nI had who was normal.” She knew she could survive the decision to live as a\nwoman. She began hormone therapy and completed her transition, including\nsurgery, in 2006 in Washington.Initially, Wendie was angry. She didn’t want\ntheir daughters, then 13 and 14, to “end up in therapy their whole\nlives.”Katrina said that “Wendie’s anger was justified, but there was nothing\nI could do about it,” adding that “I couldn’t go back.” Katrina’s parents and\nsiblings were supportive from the time they learned the truth.“Katrina coming\nout as transgender made everything clearer,” Wendie said. “I had never felt\nunloved.” One of their daughters wrote her college admission essay on her\nfather’s transition to being female.**Did they feel stigmatized?**As a\ndivorced woman, Wendie did not, though she was sometimes shocked at the\nreactions to Katrina’s being transgender. Katrina felt a stigma in some\ncircles. When she dated a lesbian, she didn’t feel welcome in certain parts of\nthe lesbian community.**How did they fare financially?**Katrina provided well\nfor the family but said she was better off in her career as a male. “Even\nthough I had a Harvard business degree, the salaries offered to me as a woman\nwere much less than those offered to me as a man,” she said.**How did their\nchildren react?**The transgender issue was challenging for a while; they\ntalked about “dropping the T-bomb” with their friends. “Back then, it killed\nconversation, but transgender awareness has dramatically improved in the last\n10 years,” said Wendie, who also noted that when Katrina first transitioned,\nshe dressed very feminine and young. “I think she was going through an\nadolescence,” Wendie said. “She was much more feminine than I am.”“True, I was\nlike a teenager again,” Katrina said.**Should they have divorced\nsooner?**Wendie says maybe they should have hung in a bit longer. She also\nwishes she could have had the option to stay married to Katrina through the\ntransition. “I don’t know if it would have worked, but my love for her was a\nconstant,” she said.“I don’t regret marrying and I adore our children,”\nKatrina said. “But I shouldn’t have married anyone until I dealt with my\ngender issues. I downplayed the act of deceiving those I loved, but that’s\nwhat eroded me over the years. Deceit morphs into self-loathing, and you start\nto hate yourself, and that’s not good for any relationship.”**Is their new\nlife better?**They all live in the Washington area.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0142d"},"content":"JANESVILLE, Wis. — The danger signs are mounting for Donald J. Trump in\nWisconsin: Right-wing radio hosts are flaying him, Gov. Scott Walker and other\nelected Republicans have endorsed Senator Ted Cruz, and a new poll showed Mr.\nCruz with a 10-percentage-point lead in the state before Tuesday’s primary.The\nStop Trump movement may never have another opportunity like the one here,\nwhere resistance to Mr. Trump was running high even before his campaign became\nconsumed by a new round of controversies, from his mocking of Mr. Cruz’s wife\nto the arrest of his campaign manager to his comments in favor of punishing\nwomen who get abortions.If Mr. Trump is dealt a setback in the Wisconsin\nprimary, including a potential sweep by Mr. Cruz of all 42 delegates, it would\nbe his most prominent reversal since his second-place finish in the Iowa\ncaucuses in February. And it would show Mr. Trump’s vulnerability before the\nrace moves to New York and other Northeastern states.The state’s Republican\nestablishment, cohesive and battle-tested after years of partisan warfare\nunder Mr. Walker, has dug in to support Mr. Cruz — not out of true love for\nthe Texas senator, but in a marriage of convenience to halt Mr. Trump, whose\ntemperament and conservatism many doubt.But at the same time, if the forces\narrayed against Mr. Trump do not prevail in Wisconsin, they are unlikely to\nslow Mr. Trump in the ideologically more favorable turf of the East,\nincreasing his chances of locking down the nomination before the July national\nconvention.A poll released Wednesday by Marquette University Law School showed\nMr. Cruz leading the Republican field with 40 percent and Mr. Trump with 30\npercent, a reversal from a month earlier when Mr. Trump held a 10-point lead.\nGov. John Kasich of Ohio was third, with 21 percent.A Cruz victory will\nsuggest that a backlash against Mr. Trump has set in after a series of nasty\nepisodes, including his insults of Heidi Cruz and the arrest of Corey\nLewandowski, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, on a charge of manhandling a female\nreporter.Mr. Cruz went further than ever before on Tuesday during a CNN town\nhall in Milwaukee, where he suggested he would not support Mr. Trump if he\nbecame the party’s nominee.“It’s gotten really ugly,” Mr. Cruz said. “What\nlesson do our kids take watching us?”Earlier, he said the battery charge filed\nin Florida against Mr. Lewandowski should be “a firable offense.”With Mr.\nTrump adamantly defending Mr. Lewandowski as the victim in the encounter,\nafter video evidence contradicted the manager’s earlier charge that the\nreporter was “delusional,” Mr. Cruz said, “Nominating Donald Trump would be an\nabsolute train wreck.”Mr. Trump’s unfavorable rating in the Marquette poll,\nconducted before Mr. Lewandowski’s arrest, was 70 percent. Only 24 percent of\nwomen planning to vote in the Republican primary backed Mr. Trump, fewer than\nfor the other two candidates.Still, Mr. Trump has many advantages in\nWisconsin, including its large number of white working-class voters, a group\nthat has flocked to him throughout the campaign, and a passionate base of\nsupporters for whom he can do no wrong. He plans a heavy schedule of\nappearances through the weekend.Thousands waited more than two hours on\nTuesday to hear him in Janesville during the candidate’s first visit to the\nstate. At the rally, he belittled Mr. Walker for his record and even his love\nfor Harley-Davidson motorcycles. “He doesn’t look like a motorcycle guy to me,\nI’m sorry,” Mr. Trump said to laughter.Neither women nor men waiting to hear\nhim, many of whom bought Trump hats, buttons and shirts from vendors working\nthe crowd like a Green Bay Packers game, said they were unsettled by Mr.\nTrump’s derogatory remarks about women.“I think he calls ’em as he sees ’em,”\nsaid Mae Pospeschil, a title searcher from Beloit.Unlike in neighboring\nIllinois and Michigan, Midwestern industrial states where Mr. Trump had strong\nvictories, the race in Wisconsin is much tighter, in part because of sharp\nregional differences among Republicans.Voters in the Milwaukee suburbs, the\nreddest counties in the state, hold highly negative views of Mr. Trump,\naccording to a polling analysis by The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel. Voters in\nnorthern and western counties are more slightly favorable to Mr. Trump, the\nMarquette poll showed.Ed Goeas, a pollster who works for an anti-Trump “super\nPAC” that is hammering him with television ads in Wisconsin for insulting\nwomen, said married Republican women were turning against the New York\nbusinessman.“I see an opportunity for us to have Trump walk out of there with\nno delegates,” Mr. Goeas said. A Trump defeat could change the tenor of the\nrace.“The narrative that comes out of Wisconsin has a huge impact,” Mr. Goeas\nsaid.Mr. Trump is struggling in the suburbs with its more affluent and better\neducated voters, the heart of Walker territory, which sustained the governor\nin a bitter recall election in 2012 and his re-election in 2014. “The\nRepublican base still loves Scott Walker,” said Tom Schreibel, a former chief\nof staff for Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican who represents the\nregion. “The further you get from major metropolitan areas, Trump gets\nstronger.”Another factor in the race is the influence of the state’s right-\nwing talk radio, which has been anti-Trump.Charlie Sykes, a radio host in\nMilwaukee, who derisively calls Trump supporters “Trumpkins” for their\nunquestioning loyalty, subjected Mr. Trump to a punishing interview this week.\n“Remember, we’re not on the playground,” he chided the businessman over his\ninsults of Mrs. Cruz. “We’re running for president of the United States.”The\nregional differences matter because of how Wisconsin awards delegates. Three\ngo to the winner of each of the state’s eight congressional districts.\nEighteen more are awarded to the winner of the statewide vote.Mr. Cruz has\nbrought his most intensive retail effort to the state since the early\nnominating contests in Iowa and South Carolina, campaigning in Wisconsin for a\nweek and setting up a “Camp Cruz” for volunteer door knockers in the Milwaukee\nsuburbs.“Wisconsin will be a solid example of our campaign’s ability to run a\nsingle-state race, much like Iowa,” which Mr. Cruz won, his campaign pollster,\nChris Wilson, said in an interview.But Mr. Cruz’s efforts are threatened by\nMr. Kasich. The Cruz campaign says Mr. Kasich will siphon off anti-Trump votes\nand hand Mr. Trump the three delegates from some districts.Recognizing the\nthreat, a pro-Cruz super PAC began a harsh anti-Kasich radio ad campaign in\nthe state on Tuesday.Mr. Kasich’s campaign rejects the charge that he is a\nspoiler. It maintains that he is strong enough to win two or three districts\nin Wisconsin: around Madison, the liberal state capital; and the close-in\nMilwaukee suburbs, where Mr. Kasich campaigned Tuesday. The Marquette poll\nshowed Mr. Kasich leading in the Madison media market.“I think that if Kasich\nis not in, Donald would win altogether more delegates than with Kasich\ninvolved,” said Tommy Thompson, a former Wisconsin governor, who is the\nchairman of Mr. Kasich’s campaign in the state. Like other Kasich supporters,\nhe is banking on the Ohio governor emerging as the consensus nominee in an\nopen convention as the best choice to defeat a Democrat in November.“It’s\nshort game versus long game,” he said.\n\n","title":"Signs of Wisconsin Backlash Against Donald Trump, Who Trails in Poll - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The Stop Trump movement may never have another opportunity like the one in Wisconsin https://t.co/U7mWg7Se8b https://t.co/apjw6tvk8l","date":"Fri Apr 01 09:01:02 +0000 2016","favs":256,"id":{"$numberLong":"715826294550872066"},"retweets":125},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1Sqy8NB"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0142e"},"content":"There are at least three holidays in South Korea notionally dedicated to\nfriendship and romance. The first comes from the West: Valentine’s Day, on\nFeb. 14, when girls give chocolate to boys. The second is a gendered response:\nWhite Day, on March 14, an invention of the candy industry, when boys offer\ngirls marshmallows, white chocolate and other snowy confections.The third is a\npop-cultural delight. It is Black Day, on April 14, a celebration of\nloneliness and sorrow: “couples’ hell, singles’ heaven,” as the K-pop band\nPascol called it in its 2014 anthem, “Merry Black Day.” Those unencumbered by\ndates or romance are meant to gather in their sharpest, blackest outfits and\neat one of Korea’s great comfort foods, _jajangmyeon_, a thick, coal-colored\ngravy of black-bean sauce, pork and onions ladled over fat noodles and served\nwith sweet pickled daikon.Few actually do. Black Day is perhaps a better idea\nthan practice. “I don’t know anyone who’s actually done the ‘sob into my\njajangmyeon because my dating life is a trash fire’ thing,” Phil Chang, a\nbrand strategist and creative director in New York who grew up in Seoul, told\nme. “Because who really needs an excuse to eat jajangmyeon, ever?”Who, indeed?\nThis is comfort food of the first order, as pleasing as takeout pizza, kung\npao chicken or a pint of ice cream eaten directly from the tub.The dish is a\nKoreanified take on the fried sauce noodles served in Shandong Province in\nChina. Brought to Korea by immigrants to Incheon, on the western coast of the\nKorean Peninsula, it now occupies a place in the nation’s cuisine that is\nsimilar to the one General Tso’s chicken has in American food. That is:\nJajangmyeon is a birth-country dish translated to accommodate the too-tired-\nto-cook takeout tastes of a host nation. It is milder than the Chinese\noriginal, a little more porky, totally irresistible.You can find jajangmyeon\nat Korean restaurants across the United States, particularly those run by\nKoreans of Chinese descent. But making the dish at home is no chore, at least\nif you have access to a Korean market or the Internet to score a few\ningredients, and results in a magnificent delight in about an hour the first\ntime you make it and somewhat less thereafter. That is longer than it would\ntake a guy riding a moped in a duct-tape-patched North Face bubble jacket to\ndeliver it to your house in Seoul, to be sure. But you’re probably not in\nSeoul anyway, and if you make it at home, jajangmyeon will transcend the\ngloopy realities of delivery food to become the sort of dish you’ll have\npeople asking you to make once or twice a month.For Koreans, the best\njajangmyeon is often the one they grew up eating, whether prepared at a\nfavorite neighborhood restaurant or, less frequently, by their moms. (In the\nUnited States, we feel the same way about pizza.) And that is no less true for\nme, though I came late to the dish. My first and favorite jajangmyeon is the\none I was served at Hyo Dong Gak, a Korean-Chinese restaurant in Manhattan,\nafter confessing to a Korean-born friend my strong and abiding affection for\nAmericanized Chinese food. “We have that, too,” she exclaimed. Soon she\nhustled me off for lunch: jajangmyeon and a plate of _tangsuyuk_, the Korean\nversion of Chinese-American sweet-and-sour pork. I could never eat that\ntangsuyuk again and be happy. But I wanted to eat — and cook — the\nrestaurant’s jajangmyeon whenever I liked.Recipes for jajangmyeon abound.\nDeuki Hong and Matt Rodbard put a fine one into their recent cookbook,\n“Koreatown.” Robin Ha has an illustrated version in her forthcoming “Cook\nKorean: A Comic Book With Recipes.” Maangchi, the Korean cooking YouTube star,\npublished one in her “Maangchi’s Real Korean Cooking.” My jajangmyeon riffs\nslightly on all of those.But as I worked out the recipe, it was the inky\ndeliciousness of my first taste of the dish that served as my lodestar.The\npreparation is not dissimilar to making a ragu in Italian cuisine. You sauté\ndiced pork belly and shoulder, then add to it ginger and garlic, then\nvegetables. To this softened but still slightly crisp mixture, you add\n_chunjang_, the Korean black-bean paste that is more caramelized than the\nChinese version and, to many, crucial to a successful jajangmyeon. Water makes\nit into sauce, and a light hand with salt and sugar helps even the flavors\nout. Ladle the result over noodles cooked soft and pliant, then serve right\naway.“You want enough sauce so that the noodles are fully blacked out,” Chang\ntold me. “But you don’t want so much that it looks like a tar pit when you’re\ndone.”Which is hardly romantic. But on black days, it is excellent\nadvice.**Recipe:** Jajangmyeon__\n\n","title":"A Korean Noodle Dish for Lonely Hearts - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTmag: Jajangmyeon is comfort food of the first order, as pleasing as pizza or kung pao chicken. https://t.co/XzP00PUa8H https://t.co/…","date":"Fri Apr 01 08:16:03 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715814973340053504"},"retweets":69},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VW3LEg"}

Two-party systems that were once stable are\nunder new pressure, fracturing and creating openings for populists on the\nextremes, left and right.This week in Brussels, far-right protesters disrupted\na memorial gathering for victims of the terrorist attacks on March 22. In the\nUnited States, Donald J. Trump has shaken up Republican elites in this year’s\npresidential primary contests. In Germany and Austria, extreme-right parties\nare surging. Spain remains paralyzed after an election that punished the\npolitical establishment and scattered votes across the spectrum.In France, the\nfar-right National Front has hammered at the political mainstream for decades,\nto limited effect. But a surge of migrants into Europe, as well as the\nbombings in Brussels last week and two major attacks in Paris last year, have\nleft the National Front with the political winds at its back, after years of\ntrying to sanitize its image as an extremist party.It has seized issues ready-\nmade for its base, calling for France First, or a France for the French, in\nelliptical anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim language. Such appeals have resonated\nmore broadly with a public worried about security, migration and economic\nstagnation. Others have been drawn to the party by a vague but nagging belief\nthat politics as usual has done more to serve politicians and moneyed\ninterests than ordinary people.Weeks after the Nov. 13 Paris attacks, The New\nYork Times followed a local candidate for the National Front, Stéphane Ravier,\nas he campaigned for regional elections in Marseille.“For 40 years, it’s been\nthe same politicians in Europe,” Mr. Ravier said, chatting with a butcher on\nthe campaign trail. “Right now, it’s really a mess.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01430"},"content":"EVERY morning since August, I have steeled myself to enter an alternate\nuniverse. I scroll through social media feeds where people are convinced that\nCongress funds the Islamic State, that our president hates this country and\nwants it to fail and that Donald J. Trump is the only glimmer of hope in this\nbleak landscape.It’s my look at a list of Twitter users whom I’ve identified\nas Trump supporters. Some accounts have only a few followers while some have\ntens of thousands. (No one comes close to Mr. Trump himself, at more than\nseven million.) They include people of many professions and backgrounds. I\nfound them by reading at responses to news media or political accounts, and\nthen went on to seek out other accounts they followed. It’s a large, sprawling\nnetwork.As an academic, I study social media and social movements, from the\nuprising in Egypt to Black Lives Matter. As I watched this election season\nunfold, I wanted to gain a better understanding of the power of the Trump\nsocial media echo chamber. What I’ve been reading has surprised even my jaded\neyes. It’s a world of wild falsehoods and some truth that you see only rarely\nin mainstream news outlets, or hear spoken among party elites.It’s popular to\nargue today that Mr. Trump’s success is, in part, a creation of the\ntraditional news media — cable networks that couldn’t get enough of his\ncelebrity and the ratings it brought, and newspapers that didn’t scrutinize\nhim with enough care. There is some truth in that, but the contention misses a\nlarger reality.Mr. Trump’s rise is actually a symptom of the mass media’s\ngrowing weakness, especially in controlling the limits of what it is\nacceptable to say.For decades, journalists at major media organizations acted\nas gatekeepers who passed judgment on what ideas could be publicly discussed,\nand what was considered too radical. This is sometimes called the “Overton\nwindow,” after Joseph P. Overton of the conservative Mackinac Center for\nPublic Policy, who discussed the relatively narrow range of policies that are\nviewed as politically acceptable. What such gatekeepers thought was acceptable\noften overlapped with what those in power believed, too. Conversations outside\nthe frame of this window were not tolerated.For worse, and sometimes for\nbetter, the Overton window is broken. We are in an era of rapidly weakening\ngatekeepers.When I first came to this country from Turkey as a graduate\nstudent in the late 1990s, I was something of an anomaly: an adult foreigner\nwith white skin who was fluent in English but not a native. Though I was a\nnewcomer culturally, many people in my new home, Austin, Tex., assumed I was\nborn and raised here. I have a bit of an accent, but my appearance seemed to\noverwhelm their ear.Curious about my new country, I soaked up conversations.\nSometimes, they went very, very wrong in ways I couldn’t understand.It would\ngo something like this: I would be chatting with a seemingly nice person who\nwould complain that a brother-in-law had lost a job. As I sympathetically\nlistened, there would be a brief, unrelated mention of a black man who was\nhired for some other job. Just as I was squinting to try to comprehend the\npoint, a vile and thunderous racist rant would be unleashed.I ran back to my\nclassmates who were born in this country, in horror, wondering what had\nhappened.“Oh, you don’t know the code,” they told me with a laugh.“The code”\nwas their shorthand for how racists sent out feelers to find kindred spirits.\nSince many people of all races opposed racism, racial identity itself was no\nguarantee of agreement. I didn’t know the markers of this “code,” so I\nsometimes failed to recognize them, or responded inadequately to them.Today,\nthis feeling-out process happens online and is much quicker, resulting in\ncascading self-affirmation. People naturally thrive by finding like-minded\nothers, and I watch as Trump supporters affirm one another in their belief\nthat white America is being sold out by secretly Muslim lawmakers, and that\nevery unpleasant claim about Donald Trump is a fabrication by a cabal that\nincludes the Republican leadership and the mass media. I watch as their\nnetworks expand, and as followers find one another as they voice ever more\nextreme opinions.After many months of observing Mr. Trump’s supporters online,\nI wanted to see this phenomenon in person, so this month I attended a Trump\nrally in Fayetteville, N.C.I tried a few conversations that sought to\nchallenge the attendees’ beliefs, but they went nowhere for a simple reason:\nHis supporters and I did not share the same factual universe. At one point, I\nheard Mr. Trump declare that Congress had funded the Islamic State. I looked\naround, bewildered, as there was no reaction from the crowd. My social media\nforays confirm that even that was not an uncommon belief.Mr. Trump doesn’t\nonly speak outrageous falsehoods; he also voices truths outside the Overton\nwindow that have been largely ignored, especially by Republican elites. For\nexample, academic research shows that rather than deep cuts, Tea Party voters\nactually favor government programs, as long as they perceive a benefit for\nthemselves. It’s fairly obvious that the current model of global trade\nprovides a lot more benefits to corporations than to workers, and yet it took\nMr. Trump’s rise to have this basic issue widely covered. In Fayetteville, Mr.\nTrump complained that much of the military’s expensive weaponry had been\npurchased simply because the large corporations selling it had political\nclout. As he said this, the people around me, many of them from military\nfamilies, leapt to their feet in approval.The demagogy that Mr. Trump deploys\ndidn’t come out of nowhere, but was encouraged by the Republican leadership.\nIn 2012, Mitt Romney effusively accepted Mr. Trump’s endorsement even though\nthe tycoon had repeatedly questioned President Obama’s citizenship. In this\nelection, the Republican Party may have hoped to engineer a controlled fire\nthat would burn only political opponents — the current president, say, or\nDemocrats as a whole, but not their preferred candidates. That’s a technique\nthat may have worked in the era of mass media. Instead, it now rages,\nuncontrolled, on social media.Many of the Trump supporters whom I’ve been\nfollowing say that they no longer trust any big institutions, whether\npolitical parties or media outlets. Instead, they share personal stories that\nsupport their common narrative, which mixes falsehoods and facts — often\nignored by these powerful institutions they now loathe — with the politics of\nracial resentment.Mr. Trump has been criticized for not conducting internal\npolling to adjust his message, as major campaigns generally do. He does\nsomething better, though. He uses Twitter as a kind of gut focus-group polling\nto pick up and amplify messages that resonate. Also, while his rally speeches\nmay seem rambling, after having watched many, I believe he uses crowd response\nto refine his message. He is not a bumbling celebrity; he is a politician\ndeeply in touch with his own, polarized base.The Trump phenomenon is not\nsimply a creation of newspaper columnists or cable news bookers who initially\nthought his candidacy was a joke to be exploited for ratings. His emergence\nshows the strength of his supporters, united on social media, who believe that\nthe media is a joke. Mr. Trump and his fans have broken the Overton window,\nand there is no going back.\n\n","title":"Adventures in the Trump Twittersphere - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytopinion: What does the Trump social media echo chamber tells us about his success?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01431"},"content":"SEOUL, South Korea — For decades, squatters have lived inside a dilapidated\nred brick house on a hillside not far from the royal palace in Seoul.The\nhouse’s significance in Korean history is hard to envision. Its windows are\ncracked and full of spider webs. Doors are boarded up. The leaky, sagging roof\nis draped with tarps.Yet the home, known as “Dilkusha” — the Hindi word for\n“Heart’s Delight” that is carved into its foundation — is now being celebrated\nfor its ties to Korea’s uprising against Japanese colonial rule in 1919.Its\nowner, Albert Wilder Taylor, a gold-mining engineer from Nevada and part-time\njournalist, broke the news of the revolt and the bloody crackdown by Japanese\ntroops to the outside world.The March 1 Independence Movement, as it is now\ncalled, is enshrined in the Constitution of South Korea as a pivotal event in\nKoreans’ struggle to break free from the Japanese. In preparation for the\ncentenary celebration of the revolt, the home is being turned into a\nmuseum.“None of those who lived there, their neighbors or local officials knew\nthe history of the house,” said Stanley Kim, a professor of film and\ntelevision at Seoil University in Seoul who in 2005 helped rediscover the\nbuilding’s link to Mr. Taylor. “None of them knew the meaning of the word\n‘Dilkusha’ carved in a foundation stone.”Built on a slope of Mount Inwang,\nwhich overlooks the royal palace here in the capital, Dilkusha was the most\nprominent among colonial-style houses owned by Westerners in Seoul a century\nago. Mr. Taylor built the home in 1923 and lived with his family there before\nthe Japanese authorities expelled them from Korea in 1942.Mr. Taylor’s ties to\nthe house and his role in the revolution were quickly forgotten. A politician\noccupied the house for a while, but after he was banished for corruption in\n1963, homeless families moved in. As many as 20 households once squeezed\ninside, the authorities say. A forest of terraced houses, apartments and\nchurches has sprouted up in the neighborhood, obscuring Dilkusha.Kim Jeong-ok,\n64, moved into Dilkusha in 2007 after a divorce left her bankrupt and\nhomeless; she took over a two-room space from an older woman who was moving\nout after 30 years. Although they do not own the house, people who have lived\nthere, some for more than 40 years, sell their space to newcomers when they\nmove out, she said.Like other squatters there, Ms. Kim said she did not know\nthe house’s name or history until television crews and historians began\nvisiting.It took Professor Kim at Seoil University two months to find Dilkusha\nafter a meeting with Mr. Taylor’s son, Bruce, in 2005, about turning his\nmother’s memoir of her time in Korea into a film (Bruce Taylor died last\nyear).Since the house’s history has been rediscovered, it has begun attracting\ntourists. The government, which owns the house and plans to designate it as a\ncultural asset, has said it will help the squatters relocate so renovations\ncan begin.Jennifer Linley Taylor, Mr. Taylor’s granddaughter, was invited to\nSeoul in March for the uprising’s anniversary, an important national holiday.\nShe donated hundreds of her grandparents’ belongings, including letters and\ndrawings of Koreans by her grandmother, Mary Linley Taylor, to the Seoul\nMuseum of History. The family had already donated Mr. Taylor’s rare photos of\nSeoul.The museum will display those items and “restore the status Dilkusha\ndeserves as the heritage of Mr. Albert Taylor, who contributed to the birth of\nour country,” said Lyu Gyeong-gi, a vice mayor of Seoul.A government museum\nsouth of Seoul already honors Mr. Taylor as a hero who braved Japanese\nretaliation to report the uprising and bloody crackdown to the world. Bruce\nTaylor was made an honorary citizen of Seoul in 2006, and his mother’s book,\n“Chain of Amber,” was translated and published here in 2014.Mr. Taylor arrived\nin Korea in 1896. He mined gold, ran an import business and worked as a\ncorrespondent for The Associated Press and The Japan Advertiser, a now-defunct\nAmerican-owned English newspaper in Tokyo.He happened upon his worldwide scoop\nwhile visiting his wife at Severance Hospital in Seoul, where she gave birth\nto their son on Feb. 28, 1919. Unknown to Mr. Taylor, a group of Korean\npatriots, inspired by President Woodrow Wilson’s speech supporting countries’\nright to self-determination, were printing their manifesto in the\nbasement.When he lifted up his newborn son, he found under his wife’s sheets\ncopies of the “Korean Declaration of Independence,” which called for an\nuprising against Japanese colonial rule the next day. Japanese soldiers had\nraided the hospital and found the printing press but not copies of the\ndeclaration; a nurse had hidden them in Mrs. Taylor’s bed.“To this day, I aver\nthat, as a newly fledged newspaper correspondent, he was more thrilled to find\nthose documents than he was to find his own son and heir,” Mrs. Taylor wrote\nin her memoir, which was published in English in 1992, 10 years after her\ndeath.The revolt lasted for weeks. Thousands of Koreans, many of them\nChristians, were killed in bloody crackdowns by Japanese soldiers, according\nto historians.“Outside, on the street all was commotion, an occasional scream,\nshots, and at other times the sound of hymns being sung; there was one great\nshout, constantly repeated, ‘Mansei, Mansei,’” Mrs. Taylor wrote in her book,\nreferring to the Korean for ‘Hurray!’Mr. Taylor filed his report and a copy of\nthe declaration through his brother, Bill, who hid them in the hollowed-out\nheel of his shoe and smuggled them to Tokyo, she wrote. With foreign\nmissionaries and diplomats, Mr. Taylor later traveled south of Seoul and\nreported that Japanese soldiers were massacring villagers. In the town of\nJeam-ri, he wrote, Japanese soldiers herded Koreans suspected as protesters\ninto a church, shot them or stabbed them with bayonets, then set the building\nand the village on fire.“When we got to the place, which had been a village of\nabout 40 houses, we found only four or five standing, all the rest were\nsmoking ruins,” Mr. Taylor reported in April 1919. “We found a body\nfrightfully burned and twisted lying in a compound and another either of a\nyoung man or woman just outside the church compound.”Mr. Taylor died at age 73\nin California in 1948, three years after Korea was liberated.In accordance\nwith Mr. Taylor’s will, Mrs. Taylor brought her husband’s ashes to Korea,\nwhere he had spent 46 years of his life, and interred them at the Yanghwajin\nForeigners’ Cemetery in Seoul. His father, George Alexander Taylor, also a\nmining engineer, was buried in the same cemetery in 1908.Renovating Dilkusha,\na few miles from the cemetery, will help restore the connection between Mr.\nTaylor and his family and Korean history, Jennifer Taylor said. “Korea was his\ncountry,” she said, “his homeland.”\n\n","title":"Seoul Celebrates the Home of an American Hero - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Seoul Journal: Seoul Celebrates the Home of an American Hero https://t.co/jVvT1OofX6","date":"Fri Apr 01 07:20:31 +0000 2016","favs":85,"id":{"$numberLong":"715800999139667968"},"retweets":42},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22U5PSp"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01432"},"content":"SEOUL, South Korea — The Constitutional Court in South Korea on Thursday\nrejected a challenge to the country’s ban on the sex trade, handing a defeat\nto prostitutes who have campaigned for years to decriminalize their work.“The\ngrowing trend to liberalize and promote openness in sex doesn’t condone or\njustify its commercialization,” Justice Kim Chang-jong wrote in the court’s\nmajority ruling, which found that the 2004 antiprostitution law, under which\nprostitutes and their clients can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year,\ndid not violate the South Korean Constitution. Justice Kim’s opinion was\nendorsed by five other justices.But the court was more divided than in past\nrulings upholding the ban. Three of its nine justices fiercely criticized what\nthey called a government crackdown on women driven to prostitution by\ndesperate circumstances. One dissenting justice, Cho Yong-ho, called the\nchoice of those women “a matter of survival.”“The majority view insists that\nprostitution should not be protected by law because it harms human dignity,”\nJustice Cho wrote in his dissent. “But nothing harms human dignity more than a\nthreat to survival.”Last year, the Constitutional Court struck down a decades-\nold law making adultery punishable by up to two years in prison, a landmark\nruling that analysts said reflected changing social attitudes toward sex in\nthis still largely conservative country.Prostitution has always been illegal\nin South Korea, but for decades the authorities turned a blind eye to it, and\nred-light districts prospered. That approach changed after 2002, when 14 young\nprostitutes died in a fire, trapped in their rooms. Amid a public outcry, the\ngovernment enacted the 2004 statute, which not only outlaws prostitution but\ncalls on the authorities to take active measures to eradicate it.An aggressive\ncampaign against the sex trade followed, and some prostitutes fought back. In\n2012, Kim Jeong-mi, a Seoul prostitute, filed the challenge that the court\nrejected Thursday. There had been previous challenges to the law, all\nunsuccessful, but Ms. Kim’s drew considerable attention because it was the\nfirst one brought by a prostitute.Attempts to reach Ms. Kim for comment on\nThursday were unsuccessful. A few prostitutes who listened to the ruling in\ncourt said they were saddened and outraged. “We are not giving up our fight\nfor a livelihood,” said one, Chang Se-hee.Justice Cho said it was unfair to\npunish prostitutes and their frequently poor clientele while doing little\nabout wealthy men who engage in “sponsor’s contracts,” or paid sexual\nrelationships with young women.Two other dissenting justices, Kim Yi-su and\nKang Il-won, argued that the state should help rehabilitate prostitutes rather\nthan punish them with a criminal charge.But the court’s majority argued that\ndecriminalizing prostitution would encourage the sex industry and “further\ndegrade sexual morality” in a culture where, they noted, a common form of\nbribery involves “jeopdae,” a form of wining and dining that often involves\nprostitutes.Kang Hyun-joon, the head of a national association of prostitutes,\nsaid after the ruling that it “pushes the poor women to the brink of death.”\nHe said his group would take the issue to the United Nations Human Rights\nCouncil.The Korean Women Lawyers Association issued a statement welcoming the\nruling, saying that if prostitution were legalized, more minors would be drawn\ninto the trade.“This is a victory for the nation!” a woman outside the court\nhouse shouted, raising her arms. She declined to be interviewed.\n\n","title":"South Korean Court Upholds Ban on Prostitution - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesworld: South Korean Constitutional Court rejects prostitutes' challenge to ban on sex trade https://t.co/Ldj5zMBTJL https://t.co…","date":"Fri Apr 01 06:31:04 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715788554119553024"},"retweets":73},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1TlTh09"}

In 2012, jamming signals sent by\nthe North forced 252 commercial flights to turn off their GPS and use an\nalternate navigation tool. The latest signals, detected on Thursday, were not\nas strong as in past attempts, the South Korean Ministry of Science, ICT and\nFuture Planning said in a statement.South Korea traced the signals to Haeju, a\ntown on North Korea’s southwestern coast, and to Diamond Mountain in the\ncountry’s southeast, the Science Ministry said. The jamming signals were still\nbeing sent on Friday, said Moon Sang-gyun, a spokesman for the South’s Defense\nMinistry. The Defense Ministry and the South’s Unification Ministry called\nthem a “provocation” and called on the North to stop them.Last week, Alison\nEvans, a senior analyst and East Asia expert for IHS, a research organization\nin London, said North Korea was likely to attempt cyberattacks or try to\ndisrupt GPS signals in the South to show its displeasure with annual United\nStates-South Korean joint military exercises that have been underway since\nearly March. But she said Pyongyang was likely to try to “manage the risk of\nescalation” while doing so.The Science Ministry’s announcement came as\nPresident Park Geun-hye was in Washington for a nuclear security summit\nmeeting, where she met with President Obama and with President Xi Jinping of\nChina to discuss the enforcement of new sanctions imposed on Pyongyang for its\nmost recent test of a nuclear device and launch of a long-range rocket.The\nNorth has launched a number of short- and medium-range missiles since the\nUnited Nations adopted the tougher sanctions last month. It launched another\nshort-range missile on Friday from its east coast, said a South Korean\nmilitary official, who asked not to be identified because a formal\nannouncement had not yet been made.\n\n","title":"North Korea Tried to Jam GPS Signals Across Border, South Korea Says - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"North Korea Jamming GPS Signals Across Border, South Korea Says https://t.co/cb7ob3aq5f","date":"Fri Apr 01 06:21:51 +0000 2016","favs":102,"id":{"$numberLong":"715786232530382849"},"retweets":93},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22TZ1Ev"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01434"},"content":"San Francisco police officers sent dozens of racist and homophobic text\nmessages in the past several months, even as another group of officers was\nbeing investigated by prosecutors for having traded similar messages, the\ncity’s district attorney said Thursday.The disclosure of the new round of text\nmessages, which includes derogatory references to blacks, Asians, lesbians,\ngays and transgender people, comes as the Police Department is under federal\ninvestigation after complaints that some officers routinely behave in a\nracially biased manner.Along with dozens of other police departments around\nthe nation, the San Francisco police — who work in one of the nation’s most\nculturally diverse cities — have come under scrutiny during the past\nyear.Officers have been accused of using unnecessary deadly force and\nbrutality, and of focusing enforcement efforts on black neighborhoods while\nignoring similar infractions elsewhere. Police critics, including many among\nthe city’s dwindling black population, have held protests and called for the\nresignation of the police chief, Gregory P. Suhr.On Thursday, George Gascón,\nthe city’s district attorney, said that the text messages were a worrying sign\nthat the department had a problem with racism and homophobia that was more\ningrained than investigators had anticipated.Especially concerning, Mr. Gascón\nsaid, was that the officers involved in the new case were sending offensive\ntexts even as the city investigated 14 of their colleagues last year for\nsending and receiving similar messages.“This indicates some significant and\ndeeper problems within the department,” said Mr. Gascón, who is a former San\nFrancisco police chief. “This conduct is clearly a danger to the\nadministration of justice and makes the work of San Francisco police more\ndifficult.”Mr. Gascón said the officers recently found to have sent or\nreceived the messages were probably involved in at least several hundred\ncriminal cases that would need to be reviewed for signs of bias. He said his\noffice was beginning to examine those cases.“We know that there will be cases\nthat will be in jeopardy,” Mr. Gascón said.Chief Suhr said Thursday that the\ndepartment turned over the text messages to the district attorney’s office in\nOctober as part of a sexual assault investigation of an officer. As part of\nthat inquiry, the cellphones of several officers were examined, he said.Chief\nSuhr said that his department had no tolerance for the derogatory language\ncontained in the texts and that he had quickly moved to discipline the\nofficers implicated.He said that of the seven officers involved in the new\ncase, four had been suspended and three others who had received a single text\nbut had not responded inappropriately had not been punished.Two of the four\nsuspended officers subsequently left the department, and the other two are\nfacing departmental discipline, he said.“Certainly to have officers like this\namong the fine men and women in the department is disconcerting, but we will\nroot them out,” Chief Suhr said.Martin Halloran, the president of the San\nFrancisco Police Officers Association, said that the group “condemns the\nappalling racist behavior committed by a handful of officers.” In January, the\nJustice Department announced that it would review the San Francisco Police\nDepartment after the Dec. 2 shooting death of a black man, Mario Woods, 26, on\na city street.The episode, in which at least 15 shots were fired at Mr. Woods\nby at least five officers, was captured on a cellphone video, prompting\nprotests in the city. The police said Mr. Woods had had a knife and had\nrefused to obey police orders.The federal review, requested by Mayor Edwin M.\nLee, will examine a variety of aspects of the Police Department, including\nofficers’ stops of civilians, use of force and training protocol.The district\nattorney’s office is also continuing to review criminal cases related to the\nofficers involved in the initial text messaging case. Those texts disparaged\ngays, women, Mexicans and Filipinos, and proposed lynching blacks.A review by\nprosecutors of some 4,000 cases handled by those 14 officers — including 1,600\nconvictions — is continuing, to determine if the arrests or prosecutions were\ncorrupted by the officers’ beliefs. So far, 13 cases have been dismissed,\naccording to the district attorney’s office.The Police Department’s effort to\ndismiss some of those officers was later overturned by a Superior Court judge,\nwho said the department had failed to act within a one-year statute of\nlimitations.\n\n","title":"More Racist and Homophobic Texts by San Francisco Police Are Found - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"More racist and homophobic texts by San Francisco police are found https://t.co/kQD8lERvGc","date":"Fri Apr 01 06:11:11 +0000 2016","favs":188,"id":{"$numberLong":"715783547815137280"},"retweets":177},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22TCB6k"}

We would not have risked death, me and my children, and\nthousands of others, to make the crossing.I’m 39 and Kurdish, from the city of\nHasakah. I knew from watching the news that Hasakah was under threat from the\nIslamic State. Every day last spring, the government would shell the city’s\noutskirts. Sometimes a stray shell would land near us.One day, at 5 in the\nmorning, we heard the shelling and we knew that the Islamic State had arrived.\nI took my children and two bags and fled. In those days, everyone had two bags\nready at all times: one containing important documents and the other clothes\nand other essentials. We ran through a dry riverbed. It was still muddy and we\nsank in up to our ankles.Even before the Islamic State came, life under the\nKurdish forces was very hard. There was no wood to burn. Once I asked my\nhusband, “If we took out one of the roof beams to put on the stove, and left\none, do you think the roof would fall?” He laughed. “Yes,” he said. “It would\nfall, and we’d be living in the street on top of everything.”If you have a son\nin Hasakah today he has to go to war.

Two\ndays later, we stood in the dark with 35 others somewhere on the Turkish\ncoast.We were the last people on the beach, my daughter, her husband, their\nbaby and me. My daughter was sobbing. She said she didn’t want to go and that\nif she died, the guilt was around my neck. I didn’t know what to do. Then,\nlike a dream, a young man came and lifted her and the baby into the boat. It\nwas just me on the shore. I waded out to the boat. The smugglers lifted me\nfrom below, and my nephew pulled me up.The day we arrived here in Idomeni\npeople were still crossing the border into Macedonia. We thought we had\narrived. We thought the hard part was the sea.There is a saying in Arabic:\n“Even heaven, without people, is unbearable.”I have three sisters and three\nbrothers in Germany. The European Union wants to keep us divided between\ncountries. If we sign up for the relocation program and the European Union\nassigns us a European country and we get that citizenship, will we be able to\ngo to our family in Germany?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01436"},"content":"LONDON — The Jews of Scotland finally have a tartan to call their own. Or,\ndisputatiously, they seem to have two of them.Rabbi Mendel Jacobs, who calls\nhimself the only Scottish-born rabbi in Scotland, has drawn a wave of\nattention for his “Jewish Tartan,” the first kosher Jewish tartan registered\nwith the official Scottish Register of Tartans, established by the Scottish\nParliament in 2008.A combination of colors from the Scottish saltire flag and\nthe Israeli one, both blue and white, the tartan plaid has a central gold line\nrepresenting the gold from the Ark, silver to represent the Torah and a deep\nred to symbolize Kiddush wine. Rabbi Jacobs chose the colors, he said in a\ntelephone interview, and designed it with the help of Brian Wilton of the\nScottish Tartans Authority, the predecessor to the register.Rabbi Jacobs bills\nthe tartan as kosher because it complies with the Jewish law, shatnez, that\nprohibits wearing a mixture of wool and linen.And he said with pride, “I had\nthe honor to present a yarmulke to Donald Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and her\nhusband,” Jared Kushner. Ms. Trump converted to Judaism when she married.Rabbi\nJacobs was born in Glasgow, where he now runs a Lubavitcher congregation. Some\nyears ago, a friend told him that a Polish tartan and a Sikh tartan had been\nregistered. “So why not a Jewish one?” he wondered.“Jews have always enjoyed a\npositive relationship with Scotland,” he said, “one of the few countries in\nEurope with no history of anti-Semitism and where relations have always been\npeaceful.”“We’ve already had a lot of interest from around the world,” Rabbi\nJacobs said. Items in the new plaid are available for purchase, including\nprayer shawls, neckties, kilts, kilt pins shaped like the Star of David, and\nplaid skullcaps. You can even buy three Jewish Tartan golf balls for 14.95\npounds (about $21.50).But this is not the first time the Jews of Scotland have\nbeen presented with a tartan. In 2008, a Glaswegian dentist, Clive Schmulian,\nsat next to Paul Harris, the editor of The Jewish Telegraph, a British\nregional newspaper, at a charity dinner. They decided to develop a Jewish\ntartan, also made purely of wool, and asked Slanj, a Scottish manufacturer of\nkilts, to come up with three designs.The Jewish Telegraph conducted an online\npoll, and one design was selected and registered for the “Scottish Jewish\nCommunity.” Proceeds from sales went to charity. But that tartan is no longer\nproduced, giving Rabbi Jacobs a clear field with his more colorful design.He\nsaid he had registered his design eight years ago, before the tartan of Dr.\nSchmulian’s and Mr. Harris’s. “But now there’s a kind of rebirth, which is\nmuch bigger,” Rabbi Jacobs said.Jews have lived in Scotland for centuries,\nwith numerous English Jews coming north to escape persecution in the Middle\nAges. A majority of Scottish Jews today are descended from immigrants who\narrived in the late 19th century, mainly settling in Glasgow and\nEdinburgh.“People use them for weddings and gatherings,” Rabbi Jacobs said of\nthe tartans. “Quite a few men join whisky societies and clubs, and they get\nthemselves this kilt to wear.”\n\n","title":"Kosher Kilts and Plaid Skullcaps: Scotland’s Jews Get a Tartan - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesworld: “Jews have always enjoyed a positive relationship with Scotland,” and now a kosher tartan: https://t.co/bVODptYTdy https:…","date":"Fri Apr 01 05:46:04 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715777229159055360"},"retweets":103},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1ROpICa"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01437"},"content":"WASHINGTON — President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China said Thursday\nthat they would sign the Paris Agreement on climate change on April 22, the\nfirst day the United Nations accord will be open for government\nsignatures.Officials cast the announcement as a statement of joint resolve by\nthe world’s two largest greenhouse gas polluters, even though there are doubts\nabout whether the United States can meet its obligations under the\nagreement.In February, the Supreme Court temporarily blocked an Obama\nadministration regulation to curb greenhouse gas pollution from power plants,\nthe centerpiece of Mr. Obama’s climate change policy and the major way for the\nadministration to meet its targets under the Paris accord.The two world\nleaders made the announcement on the sidelines of a nuclear security meeting\nin Washington.“Our cooperation and our joint statements were critical in\narriving at the Paris agreement, and our two countries have agreed that we\nwill not only sign the agreement on the first day possible, but we’re\ncommitting to formally join it as soon as possible this year,” Mr. Obama told\nreporters at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, where he was meeting\nwith Mr. Xi at the nuclear gathering.Mr. Obama, who spoke across a table from\nMr. Xi, added, “And we urge other countries to do the same.”Mr. Xi, speaking\nthrough an interpreter, said, “As the two biggest economies, China and the\nU.S. have a responsibility to work together.”The Paris Agreement, reached in\nDecember, is the first global accord to commit nearly every nation to take\ndomestic actions to tackle climate change. To promote the accord, Ban Ki-moon,\nthe United Nations secretary general, planned the signing ceremony for April\n22, Earth Day, although world leaders will have a year afterward to sign.The\nannouncement by Mr. Obama and Mr. Xi is intended to push other countries to\nsign on, particularly since diplomats say the Supreme Court order has caused\nsome countries to question American climate policy and might cause them to\nrefuse or hesitate to sign the accord.The Paris Agreement will enter into\nlegal force only when enough countries have signed on: Together they have to\nbe responsible for causing 55 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas\nemissions.Because of the Supreme Court stay, the regulation curbing greenhouse\ngas emissions will not be put in place until legal challenges by 29 states and\nseveral business organizations have been resolved, which is unlikely to happen\nbefore next year. The regulation would help the United States cut greenhouse\ngas emissions between 26 percent to 28 percent from 2005 levels by\n2025.Chinese energy experts said China’s pledge to sign the accord was\nindependent of the status of American climate policy.“The understanding is\nthat China is doing this for its own sake,” said Ranping Song, an expert on\nChina’s climate change policies with the World Resources Institute, a\nWashington research organization. “It’s good for their environment; it’s good\nfor their economy.”Mr. Xi’s administration has endorsed an aggressive\nexpansion of renewable energy sources in China. The country’s latest five-year\neconomic plan calls for the country to generate 15 percent of its energy from\nnonfossil fuel sources by 2020.Combined, the United States and China account\nfor about 40 percent of global emissions.Mr. Ban has invited world leaders to\ncome to New York for the April signing ceremony, which he hopes will represent\nthe largest single joint signing of a major global accord in history.“The most\nimportant thing is how many signatures we get on that day,” said Laurence\nTubiana, France’s chief climate change envoy to the United Nations and a key\nbroker of the Paris deal. “We need to show momentum because we know for some\ncountries it may be difficult to sign.”Todd Stern, the Obama administration’s\nchief climate change envoy, said that the day after the Supreme Court’s order,\nmany of his counterparts in other countries expressed anxiety.“I heard, ‘Does\nthis mean you’re pulling out of Paris?’ ” he recalled in a recent interview.\n“I said: ‘No, no, no, no — under any circumstances, we’re going to stay the\ncourse. One way or another, we’re not moving off our target.’ ”Mr. Stern, who\nhas led climate change negotiations for the Obama administration since 2009,\nwill step down from his post on Friday.The United States is not the only major\npolluting country that may have trouble following through on its Paris\ncommitments. President Dilma Rousseff of Brazil committed to an ambitious plan\nto reduce her country’s emissions 43 percent from 2005 levels by 2030. The\nclimate plan has been a signature of Ms. Rousseff’s administration, but she\nnow faces possible impeachment, which could throw the Brazilian plan into\nquestion.In the United States, enactment of Mr. Obama’s climate change\ncommitments under the Paris deal will ultimately fall to the next president.\nBut that fact also worries some climate diplomats as they watch the 2016\npresidential campaign from afar. Although the Democratic front-runner, Hillary\nClinton, has pledged to enact and strengthen the Paris Agreement, on the\nRepublican side both Donald J. Trump and Ted Cruz have questioned or denied\nthe science of human-caused climate change. Mr. Trump has forcefully denounced\nthe Paris agreement.“Everyone who is looking at the election campaign from\nabroad is puzzled,” Ms. Tubiana said. “Donald Trump is a different type of\nperson. We’re thinking — is this something that could really happen?”\n\n","title":"Obama and President Xi of China Vow to Sign Paris Climate Accord Promptly - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytpolitics: President Obama and President Xi of China vow to sign Paris climate accord promptly https://t.co/KEXDZO1N6G https://t.co/7…","date":"Fri Apr 01 05:32:02 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715773695491440641"},"retweets":134},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1opzzUq"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01438"},"content":"Medical testing done by the closely watched start-up Theranos was plagued by\nquality control problems that could have led to inaccurate results for\npatients, according to an inspection report released by federal regulators on\nThursday.Among other findings in the report, which ran 121 pages, the company\nused unqualified or inadequately trained personnel and stored samples in\nfreezers that were not at the proper temperature. It also failed to ensure\nthat the quality control for an important blood-clotting test was acceptable\nbefore reporting results for patients.The report is from an inspection last\nfall of Theranos’s laboratory in Newark, Calif., by the Centers for Medicare\nand Medicaid Services, which regulates clinical laboratories. Failure to\ncorrect the problems would put that laboratory in danger of losing its\ncertification.Brooke Buchanan, a spokeswoman for Theranos, said the company\nhad revamped its procedures.“We’ve made mistakes in the past,” she said in an\nemailed statement, “but when the company was made aware of the deficiencies we\nhave dedicated every resource to remedy those failures.”Privately-held\nTheranos has become known for its claim of being able to perform numerous\nmedical tests using only a finger prick of blood. Its founder, a 32-year-old\nStanford dropout named Elizabeth Holmes, has graced various magazine covers\nand is a billionaire on paper.But news reports have raised questions about\nwhether Theranos can do what it says it can.Earlier this week, researchers at\nthe Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai published the first independent\nassessment of Theranos, finding that it produced more irregular results than\ntwo more conventional laboratories.The new inspection report followed a much\nshorter one released by federal regulators in January, which cited Theranos\nfor various deficiencies, including one that posed “immediate jeopardy to\npatient health and safety.”The new inspection report is revealing because it\ncontains data from Theranos’s own internal testing. However, some of the data\nis redacted to protect what Theranos views as its confidential information,\nmaking it difficult in some cases to tell what test is being referred to and\nwhether the testing was done using Theranos’s proprietary technology or\nmachines it bought from lab equipment suppliers like Siemens.Perhaps the most\nserious findings involve a test of blood clotting used on patients who take\nthe blood thinner warfarin. Too much warfarin can lead to internal bleeding\nand too little can leave a patient with an increased risk of a stroke.\nTheranos executives have acknowledged this was the test cited for the\nimmediate jeopardy to patients.The new report says that some equipment for\nthis test was run numerous times without obtaining acceptable quality control.\nYet results were provided to patients. The document said that a review of the\nresults from April to September of last year found that 81 of 81 reported\nfinal patient results were not accurate.Theranos also provided some results of\nvitamin B12 tests to patients, despite warnings that quality control was\noff.The report also contained what appeared to be comparisons between results\nfrom Theranos’s proprietary technology and the same samples run on\nconventional equipment. It notes that the results should have been within 20\npercent of one another.But for one test the results differed by 21 to 130\npercent based on nine random samples. For another, the difference ranged from\n21 to 39 percent, and for a third it ranged from 22 to 146 percent. The things\nthat were measured in these tests were redacted.The document also contains\nTheranos’s responses to the findings. Time and again the company wrote: “The\nlab has completed an assessment to identify any patients affected or having\nthe potential to be affected by this issue.”But it is not clear from the\ndocument how many patients were affected and what they were told.\n\n","title":"Report Shows Theranos Testing Plagued by Problems - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Report Shows Theranos Testing Plagued by Problems https://t.co/AJLRdJoZeu","date":"Fri Apr 01 05:25:34 +0000 2016","favs":89,"id":{"$numberLong":"715772071763120130"},"retweets":55},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1MYfevF"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01439"},"content":"WASHINGTON — DURING my 10 years in the Wisconsin State Legislature, I spent\nsignificant time in Milwaukee’s majority black neighborhoods. I listened as\nconstituents described obstructions to their constitutional right to vote.In\nthose days I came to believe that we needed a strong Voting Rights Act. Our\ncredibility as elected officials depends on the fairness of our elections. So\nafter joining Congress, I supported the law’s reauthorization in 1982, and, as\nchairman of the House Judiciary Committee, I led successful efforts to\nreauthorize it in 2006.In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down a portion of\nthis most recent authorization. If Congress doesn’t act soon, 2016 will be the\nfirst time since 1964 that the United States will elect a president without\nthe full protections of the law. Modernizing the act to address the Supreme\nCourt’s concerns should be one of Congress’s highest priorities.Enacted in\n1965, the Voting Rights Act began a healing process that ameliorated decades\nof discrimination. It is vital to this country’s commitment to never again\npermit racial prejudice to determine who has access to a ballot.One of the\nlaw’s core protections is its preclearance system. Before the law’s passage,\nstates and local governments would discriminate against minority voters,\nCongress or courts would ban the discriminatory practices, and states would\nfind new ways to discriminate.Preclearance sought to remedy that problem by\nrequiring states and localities with a documented history of discrimination to\nallow the federal government to review certain changes to voting practices\nbefore they are implemented. There is no adequate remedy for voter\ndiscrimination after an election because there is no way to know who would\nhave won absent discrimination. Preclearance prevents discrimination before it\naffects elections.During the 2006 reauthorization, the Judiciary Committees\nheld about 20 hearings. Congress amassed a legislative record of more than\n15,000 pages in which it documented discrimination and demonstrated “the\ncontinued need for federal oversight.” Both the 1982 and 2006\nreauthorizations, however, maintained the same 1965 criteria, later updated in\nthe 1970s, for determining which states would be subject to preclearance.In\n2013, the Supreme Court held in Shelby County v. Holder that while\npreclearance was a constitutional response to voter discrimination, it was\nalso unconstitutional to apply it to states based on a decades-old formula. A\nresult is that very few jurisdictions are subject to preclearance today. The\nlaw’s strongest protections have been rendered meaningless.I introduced the\nVoting Rights Act of 2015 as a response to that decision. When the justices\nhanded down the ruling, nine states, mostly in the Deep South, as well as\nparts of six other states, had to preclear their voting changes with the\ngovernment. My bill would modernize the act so that the preclearance rules\napplied equally to every state in the country.Under the bill, a state or\njurisdiction could be subject to preclearance if a court ruled that it had\ndiscriminated against voters on the basis of race five or more times in the\nmost recent 15 years. States that stopped discriminating automatically would\nfall out of the bill’s protections; states that started discriminating would\nfall in.In this way, the bill responds to the Supreme Court’s concerns about\nthe dated formula and resurrects the protections of the law that have been a\npart of American elections for five decades.The bill also includes important\ntransparency provisions. One of the most effective ways to suppress voting is\nto change the rules. The proposed Voting Rights Act would require officials to\ngive public notice within 48 hours of certain voting changes that are made 180\ndays before a federal election. Local governments may have valid reasons to\nchange polling locations or the resources they spend on an election, but the\npublic should be well informed about them before Election Day.We watched this\nproblem unfold recently in Arizona when thousands of people waited hours to\nvote in both the Democratic and Republican primaries. The culprit was fewer\nresources devoted to voting. Maricopa County in Arizona, for example, had just\n60 polling stations. This was down from at least 200 stations four years ago,\nand 400 stations in 2008. The proposed bill would have ensured that meaningful\ndebate over polling stations happened before the primary. More people might\nhave voted. Would that have changed the results? We’ll never know.The Voting\nRights Act of 2015, which has more than 100 co-sponsors, 13 of them\nRepublicans, has been introduced in the House and referred to the Judiciary\nCommittee, where it awaits action. Some of my colleagues view the bill as\nunnecessary because of the progress we have made against voter discrimination.\nThe bill’s structure, however, ensures that preclearance will apply only if in\nfact discrimination occurs.Ensuring that every eligible voter can cast a\nballot without fear, deterrence and prejudice is a basic American right. I\nwould rather lose my job than suppress votes to keep it.The Voting Rights Act\nnot only stops discrimination but also strengthens the public’s faith that\nvotes will be counted and elections remain fair.The 2016 primary season has\nbeen marred by hateful rhetoric and ugly politics. Passing the Voting Rights\nAct of 2015 would be Congress’s most enlightened response.\n\n","title":"Suppress Votes?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0143a"},"content":"Warwick Mills shows the kind of innovative know-how common among American\ntextile companies that have survived the fierce global competition of recent\nyears.The small private company in New Hampshire has climbed steadily up the\neconomic ladder of its industry to produce specialized fabrics that weave in\nceramics, metals and fiberglass. These high-value fabrics are used in products\nlike safety gloves for industrial workers and body armor for the police and\nmilitary.Now, Warwick Mills is joining the Defense Department, universities\nincluding the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and nearly 50 other\ncompanies in an ambitious $320 million project to push the American textile\nindustry into the digital age. Key to the plan is a technical ingredient:\nembedding a variety of tiny semiconductors and sensors into fabrics that can\nsee, hear, communicate, store energy, warm or cool a person or monitor the\nwearer’s health.“These would be high-tech offerings that change the game for\nthe companies involved and for the industry,” said Charles Howland, president\nand chief engineer of Warwick Mills.The advanced fabrics project, which is\nbeing announced on Friday, represents a new frontier for the Internet of\nThings. The term describes putting sensors and computing in all manner of\nphysical objects — jet engines, power generators, cars, farm equipment and\nthermostats, among others — to measure and monitor everything from machines in\nneed of repair to traffic patterns. Venture capitalists, start-ups and big\ncorporations like General Electric and IBM are rushing to Internet of Things\ntechnology.This latest initiative, Advanced Functional Fabrics of America, is\nintended to create a national network of research and development, design and\nmanufacturing capabilities for the new fabrics. The products of this emerging\nfield are being called “functional fabrics,” “connected fabrics,” “textile\ndevices” and “smart garments.”The field requires contributions from many\ndisciplines, including materials science, electrical engineering, software\ndevelopment, human-computer interaction, advanced manufacturing and fashion\ndesign.Clothes filled with sensors and chips could give new meaning to the\nterm wearables, now mainly wristbound digital devices like a fitness monitor\nor an Apple Watch.The Defense Department is investing to develop new combat\nuniforms that might communicate and change color, signaling friend or foe to\nhelp prevent deaths by friendly fire, or uniforms filled with optical sensors\nto make a soldier invisible to an enemy’s night-vision goggles. So far, the\nPentagon, more than 30 universities, 49 companies and the state governments of\nMassachusetts and Georgia have agreed to participate, and more are expected to\njoin.Some of the pioneering research has been done at M.I.T., which is leading\nthe project. Advanced research, in the precompetitive stage, will be published\nand shared.The project also envisions creating about two dozen start-up\nincubators, the organizers say. The incubator-generated ideas, according to\nthe plan, could be swiftly translated into commercial products, which would be\nmanufactured at existing American mills.Creating jobs, as well as technology,\nwill be a measure of the project’s success or failure. It hopes to reverse the\nsteady erosion of textile jobs in the United States and, according to the\nproject proposal, generate more than 50,000 jobs in 10 years across a range of\nindustries.“This is about reimagining what a fabric is, and rebirthing\ntextiles into a high-tech industry,” said Yoel Fink, a professor of materials\nscience and electrical engineering at M.I.T., who is director of the advanced\nfabrics project.The broad linking of government, universities and corporations\nto both advance research and develop new markets is a model advocated in a new\nbook, “The New ABCs of Research: Achieving Breakthrough Collaborations”\n(Oxford University Press), by Ben Shneiderman, a professor of computer science\nat the University of Maryland. In an interview, Mr. Shneiderman called the\nadvanced fabrics project “a well-crafted plan.”The participating companies\nspan many industries. They include chip makers like Intel and Analog Devices;\ntextile and apparel makers like Milliken, Nike and VF Corporation; materials\nmakers like Corning and DuPont; and health and medical device companies like\nMedtronic. Intel has separately worked on blending computers and fashion.For\nsome companies, the functional fabrics are a potential add-on market. For\nothers, they could disrupt their businesses.Ray Stata, co-founder and chairman\nof Analog Devices, said it was “pretty early to speculate” about the\nopportunity for the semiconductor industry. “But I do think that using the\nadvanced technology of this country to rebuild the textile industry is an\nexciting concept,” he said.The stakes are higher for VF Corporation, one of\nthe world’s largest apparel makers, whose brands include Wrangler, Lee,\nTimberland, the North Face and Nautica. The company has a global work force of\nmore than 60,000 workers, producing 1.5 million items of apparel a day.Until\nabout two years ago, VF did not really have a R\u0026amp;D operation, said Marty\nLawrence, a general manager for innovation. Instead, it mainly tapped research\nefforts at universities and by its suppliers.But eying trends in the industry\nand technology, VF has hired scientists and set up four innovation centers in\nthe United States that focus on areas including new fabrics for bluejeans and\ncognitive science.The functional fabrics project, Mr. Lawrence said,\nrepresents “the future of apparel.”In Inman, S.C., Norman H. Chapman runs\nInman Mills, a company founded by his great-grandfather in 1901. Inman Mills\nhit rough times in the early 2000s, cutting its work force by more than half,\nto 500 people.Today, the company’s payroll is up to 700. That is largely\nbecause it navigated a transition from making shirting and apparel lining to\nmore specialized, flame-resistant fabrics, with fibers including silica and\nfiberglass. One product is a fabric for the interior lining of bed mattresses.\nIf there is a fire, the silica and fiberglass become a seal, blocking oxygen\nfrom getting into the mattress so it is less likely to burn.Add another\nsensor-filled strand to the yarn, Mr. Chapman said, and the mattress lining\ncould be used to track sleep patterns and health. “Our future depends on how\nwe can innovate with fabrics,” he said.How large a market functional fabrics\nmay become, and how soon, depends on more than technology. There are issues of\ncost, usability, demand, marketing and design.Genevieve Dion, a former fashion\ndesigner whose couture clothes were sold at Bergdorf Goodman and Barneys, is\nparticipating in the project. Today, she is the director of the Shima Seiki\nHaute Technology Laboratory at Drexel University.A garment, Ms. Dion said, may\nbe able to cool you, warm you and monitor your health, and still be a flop. It\nhas to be affordable, lightweight, withstand repeated washings and look\nattractive.“If someone is wearing a smart garment and you can’t tell,” Ms.\nDion said. “I will have succeeded.”\n\n","title":"U.S. Textile Industry Turns to Tech as Gateway to Revival - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"U.S. Textile Industry Turns to Tech as Gateway to Revival https://t.co/55XytJWieg","date":"Fri Apr 01 04:25:01 +0000 2016","favs":93,"id":{"$numberLong":"715756832778792961"},"retweets":71},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1MY6p5b"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0143b"},"content":"The New York City Board of Elections has a proofreading problem — and even\nsmall mistakes are turning out to be costly.The board was forced to spend more\nthan $200,000 in overnight postage last month to send corrected absentee\nballots for the coming presidential primary, after it discovered an error in\nthe Spanish version of the ballot.The mistake was discovered around the same\ntime the board realized it had made another error: A recent notice sent to\n60,000 newly registered voters included the wrong date for a Sept. 13 primary\nelection for state and local offices. The board then mailed out a correction\nthat may have inadvertently confused voters about the date of the higher-\nprofile presidential primary on April 19.Those incidents follow a major\nmistake in the Chinese translation that appeared on ballots for the state’s\nelection in November 2013, which led to the firing of one translator and the\nresignation of another.Last month’s costly translation error occurred on\nDemocratic primary ballots mailed to military personnel and American citizens\nliving abroad.Democratic voters in the New York presidential primary vote for\nboth a candidate and delegates to the party’s nominating convention. But the\noriginal ballots that were mailed out failed to indicate in Spanish which\ndelegates had pledged to support Bernie Sanders and which had done so for\nHillary Clinton.When officials spotted the mistake, they notified the State\nBoard of Elections, which in turn consulted the Justice Department, said\nMichael J. Ryan, the executive director of the city’s elections board.\nCorrected ballots were printed and sent to 4,131 voters overseas, including\n230 military personnel.The printing cost was less than $5,000, Mr. Ryan\nsaid.But because time was short, it was decided to send the ballots by\novernight mail. The bill for postage was $208,579.“Given the disparate\naddresses overseas, overnight mailing, it can be quite costly,” Mr. Ryan\nsaid.Most of the corrected ballots were mailed last weekend, although some may\nhave gone out as late as Monday, he said.The mistake did not affect the\nthousands of absentee ballots sent to voters with addresses in New York or\nother states, which were printed after the mistake had been discovered.Mr.\nRyan said the error was a byproduct of the city’s transition to an electronic\nvoting system, which involves paper ballots read by digital scanners. Although\nthe system was put in place in 2010, it will be used in a Democratic\npresidential primary, with balloting for both candidates and delegates, for\nthe first time this year.In the Republican primary, voters cast ballots only\nfor a candidate; the party chooses the delegates in a separate process.In the\nelection board’s other recent fumble, tens of thousands of newly registered\nvoters received a notice from the agency alerting them to the dates of various\nelections this year, but it included an incorrect date for the Sept. 13\nprimary for state and local candidates.The board then sent a postcard to the\nsame voters with the words “Date Correction” blazoned across the front.“The\ndate on the notice for the primary election was incorrect,” the postcard said.\n“The correct date is Sep. 13, 2016.” But the card did not say which primary it\nwas referring to, raising the possibility that some voters would confuse it\nfor the presidential primary.“You’d have to be under a rock not to know that\npeople are thinking about the April 19 primary and to not even mention it,”\nsaid Kate Doran, of the New York City League of Women Voters. “All of us in\nthe good-government world are just rolling our eyes.”Councilman Ben Kallos, a\nDemocrat from Manhattan who has been a frequent critic of the elections board,\nattributed the errors to the agency’s notorious history as a patronage\nmill.“At the root of this is making sure that the people working at the Board\nof Elections are actually hired from an open process,” Mr. Kallos said. “We\nneed to root out patronage in government and at the Board of Elections.”The\ntwo recent mistakes occurred less than three years after the translation error\nin 2013, which Mr. Ryan said was far more serious because it was not caught\nuntil Election Day that November.In that case, ballots used at polling\nstations serving a high concentration of Chinese voters omitted the Chinese\ntranslation of a ballot proposition.There were six propositions on the ballot.\nThe state’s elections board provided translations for each of them to the\ncity’s board. But when city officials created the ballots, someone mistakenly\nused the same Chinese translation for two different propositions. Mr. Ryan\ncalled it “a cutting and pasting error.”“We strive for perfection at the Board\nof Elections,” Mr. Ryan said. “However, any system that’s run by human beings\nis going to encounter human error. The best that we can hope for is that if an\nerror is made, we catch it and we fix it.”\n\n","title":"A $200,000 Ballot Error and Other Misprints at New York City’s Board of Elections - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"A $200,000 ballot error and other misprints at NYC’s Board of Elections https://t.co/oDwuHDeEog","date":"Fri Apr 01 03:56:05 +0000 2016","favs":70,"id":{"$numberLong":"715749551483789314"},"retweets":58},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PIFF8z"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0143c"},"content":"What could it possibly be like to be old? The stooped shuffle, the halting\nspeech, the dimming senses.An exhibit opening on Friday at Liberty Science\nCenter in Jersey City answers the question by letting you walk a proverbial\nmile in your elders’ orthopedic shoes. Slip into the R70i Age Suit, a robotic\ncontraption complete with “augmented reality” goggles, and suddenly you are\n85.It is not very pleasant.An attendant cranks up a fader and your vision\ndissolves into melty, grayed-out blobs, like a memorably unvivid psychedelic\nexperience. “This is called age-related macular degeneration,” the suit’s\ninventor, Bran Ferren, said at a preview on Thursday.More knobs twiddle, and\nyour hearing is subsumed in a fog of tinnitus, muffling and distortion. A dose\nof echo is added to the sound mix, interrupting your speaking and simulating\nthe effects of aphasia.Now it was time to move about. Loaded with hardware and\na computer, the suit itself weighs 40 pounds, distributed as uncomfortably as\npossible. “It’s going to get much worse,” promised Mr. Ferren, a noted special\neffects designer. “You haven’t lived.”I raised an arm, as if to reach up on a\nshelf, and the suit’s system of torquers and electronic disc brakes sprang\ninto action. It felt like my joints had become entirely ungreased. I could\nbarely lift my arm above my shoulder.Mr. Ferren invited me onto a treadmill. I\nhobbled up.“Now let’s start losing muscle strength,” he said.Why does your\ngrandfather move so slowly? Because, apparently, walking across the parking\nlot for him feels like hour three of a hike up a mountain, wearing an\noverstuffed, lopsided backpack. (This may also explain why he’s cranky.)For an\nextra frisson, Mr. Ferren set the resistance on one side of my body to a so-\ncalled normal level and the other to an extreme. The settings mimicked how he\nfelt while trying to walk just before he had a hip replaced five weeks ago at\nthe tender age of 63.“So far you’ve walked about a half block and your heart\nis beating at 130 beats a minute,” he said.There are entire realms of\nwretchedness attendant upon owning and operating an 85-year-old body that the\nGenworth Aging Experience exhibit does not even touch upon.Comprehensive\nsagging, internal and external. Pain in places you did not know could hurt.\nDifficulty urinating. Difficulty not urinating. Watching your friends die off.\nWatching yourself become irrelevant, an object of pity or puzzlement if\nacknowledged at all.Still, in just 10 minutes, the aging suit induced a\nremarkable amount of frustration, depression and hopelessness. If doing even\nthe most basic tasks of daily living is this much trouble, you wonder, why\nbother?But it also makes you a little less likely to lose patience and a\nlittle more likely to feel empathy with the older people in your life.The\nlatter is the main point of the exhibit, which is sponsored by Genworth\nFinancial, a company that sells long-term care insurance.“How do you start\npeople talking about these things which they are averse to talking about?”\nsaid Mr. Ferren, whose mother has an incurable, degenerative disease. “And if\nwhat you require is live-in care, how do you pay for that? Most families don’t\nhave the ability to do this, and they blow through their savings early\non.”Part of me, of course, wondered how realistic the simulations were.“This\nis really what my father feels like walking down the street?” I asked Mr.\nFerren.“Why don’t you ask him?” Mr. Ferren suggested.My father, Aaron Newman,\nhappens to be 85. I called him up. I described the treadmill experience and\nasked if that sounded about right.“No,” he said. “It’s much worse.”My mother,\nHelen Newman, who is only 84, got on the phone. I told her how the suit made\nme feel like nothing was worth the effort.“That’s actually how I reacted this\nmorning,” she said. “I got up with all my bones creaking, I staggered to the\nbathroom, and I said, ‘Ahh, I’ll go back to bed.’”\n\n","title":"A Futuristic Suit That Gives You a Taste of Old Age - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"A futuristic suit that allows you to experience old age\nhttps://t.co/1nl55OmLzd https://t.co/OBS4D0ikpZ","date":"Fri Apr 01 03:46:04 +0000 2016","favs":306,"id":{"$numberLong":"715747030409289728"},"retweets":147},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1MFmMc0"}

Bunch III, director of\nthe museum, said in a statement.The museum, which is part of the Smithsonian,\nreleased the statement after days of debate in the news and social media over\nwhether the museum should mention accusations against Mr. Cosby brought by\ndozens of women over the past year and a half. Several women who have accused\nMr. Cosby of sexual assault had said they were upset that their allegations\nwere not going to be included. Mr. Cosby has denied the accusations.Curators\nat the museum, on the National Mall, had said that they felt Mr. Cosby’s\nachievements should stand alone. But the museum said on Thursday that Mr.\nBunch had decided that the museum should mention the accusations, although\nmuseum officials could not say yet what the labels would say.The museum said\nthat Mr. Bunch had already been considering including such a reference, even\nbefore the recent questioning.The entertainer’s presence will be small in the\nmuseum, which will showcase more than 3,000 artifacts over all,  in 11\ninaugural exhibitions on subjects such as slavery, the military, music and\nentertainment. The Cosby sections will include just a few objects that\nrecognize his work as a comedian, and his work on the television programs “I\nSpy” and “The Cosby Show.”The exhibits feature a comedy record, “I Started Out\nas a Child,” from 1964, a comic book from “I Spy,” and clips from “I Spy” and\n“The Cosby Show,” which are in a five-minute video of roughly 30 television\nprograms. The accompanying text identifies “The Cosby Show” as “one of the\nbest-loved American TV shows.”“While many comedians mined laughter by probing\nracial and political differences, Bill Cosby (b. 1937) built his\ngroundbreaking career around universal themes of family and childhood,” says\none section of the label that curators had drawn up as of mid-March.His work\nin support of black Hollywood stuntmen is also mentioned.One of Mr. Cosby’s\naccusers, Patricia Leary Steuer, 59, who has said the entertainer assaulted\nher decades ago, welcomed the inclusion. She said that it wasn’t her call to\ndecide whether he should be included in the museum, but she said that\nmentioning the accusations presented a fuller picture.“Without talking about\nthe specter, the pall, hanging over him, it does not feel like a full\nrepresentation to me,” she said.In his statement on Thursday, Mr. Bunch said\nhe disagreed with those who felt that the Smithsonian “should eliminate all\nmention of Bill Cosby as a result of recent revelations.”“This is not an\nexhibition that ‘honors or celebrates’ Bill Cosby but one that acknowledges\nhis role, among many others, in American entertainment,” he said.“Like all of\nhistory, our interpretation of Bill Cosby is a work in progress, something\nthat will continue to evolve as new evidence and insights come to the fore,”\nMr. Bunch said.The Smithsonian faced similar questions last year when its\nNational Museum of African Art featured works on loan from the substantial art\ncollection of Mr. Cosby and his wife, Camille.In that case, the Smithsonian\neventually put up a sign telling visitors that the museum did not condone the\nbehavior of which Mr. Cosby was accused.\n\n","title":"Smithsonian Says Museum Will Include Mention of Bill Cosby Sexual Assault Accusations - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Smithsonian says museum will include mention of Bill Cosby sexual assault accusations https://t.co/xHAg33KTem","date":"Fri Apr 01 03:36:03 +0000 2016","favs":155,"id":{"$numberLong":"715744509330636800"},"retweets":130},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1ROwrfe"}

Getting past the private security\nguards is but one interim step as well. The key hurdle is bypassing the Trump\nsentries, the eagle-eyed loyalists in black suits who are the ultimate\ndeterminers of who gets in and who stays out.“Are you a Trump supporter?” they\nasked some of those in line at Mr. Trump’s campaign rally at the Holiday Inn\nExpress here on Tuesday, looking carefully for any signs of deception. They\nscrutinized T-shirts to make sure there were no protest slogans. They kept a\nwatchful eye for anti-Trump banners designed to draw the television cameras\naway from Mr. Trump.And if the Trump aides appeared suspicious of someone’s\nmotivations, they would sometimes ask point-blank: “Are you a protester?”So\nconflict-prone have Mr. Trump’s campaign rallies become that they have\nprompted an elaborate game of cat-and-mouse that takes place out of view of\nthe television cameras. Mr. Trump’s loyalists sniff out the protesters before\nthey can disrupt the proceedings. The activists communicate their plans\nthrough an encrypted text-messaging app and huddle days before Mr. Trump takes\nthe stage.At one such secret session, in a strip mall storefront 40 miles away\nin Madison, about two dozen anti-Trump activists debated over the weekend how\nbest to counter Mr. Trump. Should they loudly disrupt the Janesville rally and\ntry to get it shut down altogether, as happened in Chicago? Or would a silent\nand symbolic protest better make their point and not provide ammunition to Mr.\nTrump?The various goals were scrawled on a white board. Protest assignments\nwere divvied up, like sign making and news media outreach. There was no\nconsensus as to how to proceed, given the diverse interests motivating the\nprotesters.“I think disrupting, shutting down his speech, actually helps him,”\nsaid Greg Gelembiuk, 54, telling his fellow demonstrators that Mr. Trump has\nused clashes with protesters to portray himself as the aggrieved party and\nrally his base.But there was more at stake than “trying to get Trump to shut\nup,” countered Stephanie Roades, 38, a longtime racial justice activist. The\ngoal, she said, was to provide a counterbalance to all the hate and violence\nthat has been on display at some Trump rallies. “He has legitimized a large\ngroup of people to act this way.”Mr. Trump’s campaign declined to discuss its\nsecurity precautions. It was clear, though, that the Trump sentries caught\nsome but not all the protesters who passed before them, and that they also\nensnared a reporter, who had no plans to disrupt anything, in their\ndragnet.Ms. Roades was with 10 anti-Trump protesters who had planned to sneak\nin with signs that said things like, “No hate in our state” and “Hate is not a\nWisconsin value.” But four of them were stopped at the door, Ms. Roades said,\nincluding herself.Another one of those who were thwarted, Nathan Royko Maurer,\n43, said he briefly made it inside but was ousted after taking a seat.\nSecurity approached him, he recalled, and said that he had been identified as\na protester. “You’re going to have to leave,” they had said.As it turned out,\nthere was more action outside the site than inside. The Janesville police were\nlooking for a man, who appeared to be wearing a red “Make America Great Again”\nbaseball hat, who pepper-sprayed a 15-year-old protester who swung at a Trump\nsupporter after, she said, she was groped.There is a local flair to the Trump\nprotest movement, with demonstrations largely carried out by activists on the\nground at his various stops. But there is also some national coordination\ninvolving activist groups like Black Lives Matter, the Grassroots Global\nJustice Alliance, Mijente and Showing Up for Racial Justice, or SURJ.Just this\nmonth, a group of activists formed the Stop Trump National Network to marshal\nthose nationwide eager to block Mr. Trump’s White House bid.Planning for the\nactions here started a couple of weeks ago, before Mr. Trump’s Janesville\nrally had even been announced. Members of Groundwork, an affiliate of Showing\nUp for Racial Justice, which encourages whites to fight against racism, held a\nconference call with national activists to discuss strategy.In the local\nstrategy sessions, people laid bare their preferences and anxieties. Ricky\nDiaz, a 28-year-old community organizer from Milwaukee, was pushing something\nvisually dramatic, but not too noisy. He suggested someone dressing in a suit\nto represent Mr. Trump surrounded by people dressed as slaves. Kristen Brock-\nPetroshius, an organizer with SURJ, spoke of waking up at 4 a.m. one morning\ndays before the rally in a fit of fear, stressing over what arrangements to\nmake for her wife and children should she die in a protest.Z Haukeness, a\nregional SURJ organizer, said they were not trying to stop free speech;\nrather, they were cracking down on what activists called hate speech.A turning\npoint in the effort to go after Mr. Trump in a more coordinated way came after\na Trump supporter punched a protester as he was leaving a rally in\nFayetteville, N.C., which garnered headlines. No one was talking about the 39\ndisruptions that protesters made during Mr. Trump’s speech, said Andrew Willis\nGarcés, who works with Showing Up for Racial Justice.“At that point is when a\nlot of our folks are starting to feel like these one-off disruptions are not\nhaving the impact we want them to have,” Mr. Willis Garcés said.Eventually,\nWisconsin organizers developed a two-pronged approach. First, they tried to\npressure the Holiday Inn Express to cancel the rally. After that failed, they\nsought to disrupt the speech itself.The night before Mr. Trump was scheduled\nto appear, six protesters fastened themselves together with pipes wrapped in\nchicken wire and tape and sat down in the hotel lobby, demanding that the\nevent be canceled.After about four hours, the police cut the six protesters\nout of the restraints and arrested them.While the Monday night sit-in received\na lot of news media attention, Ms. Roades said the arrests left them a little\nshort-handed for the Tuesday protest at the Trump rally. And so that left the\nmuch smaller group of 10, which was whittled to six by the time security\nscreened the others. Of that group, only one person ended up protesting: Mr.\nGelembiuk.About 15 minutes into Mr. Trump’s speech, Mr. Gelembiuk slipped out\ntwo small banners from his jeans, turned his back to Mr. Trump and quietly\nheld them over his head. One had a quotation from a prosecutor deriding Trump\nUniversity. The other had a picture of Mr. Trump in clown face with the quote\n“White Flour!” as a play on white power.After about 20 seconds, a few Trump\nsupporters started shouting, “Trump! Trump! Trump!” — the signal that a\nprotester was among them. Security quickly ushered out Mr. Gelembiuk from his\nback-row seat.\n\n","title":"Before a Trump Rally, Protesters Lay Plans Behind the Scenes - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The many hoops one must jump through to attend a Donald Trump rally https://t.co/KV77Ny03PP https://t.co/wxjoh0ITGS","date":"Fri Apr 01 03:26:06 +0000 2016","favs":176,"id":{"$numberLong":"715742005725380608"},"retweets":92},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1opC1Kq"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0143f"},"content":"William Orrell is the best in the world in his sport. A 17-year-old from North\nCarolina, Orrell is ranked No. 1 and is the reigning junior Olympic and world\nchampion. He has a popular YouTube channel, a product line named after him,\nand legions of admiring fans in dozens of countries.He has gained all this\nnotoriety by stacking cups in small pyramids at a mind-boggling clip.“A lot of\npeople don’t think it is a sport,” said Orrell, who will defend his world\ntitle at the World Sport Stacking Championships, which begin Saturday in\nSpeichersdorf, Germany. “But why is stacking cups any less important than\nputting a ball in a hole or through a hoop?”A casual game that started with\nDixie cups at a Boys \u0026amp; Girls Club in Oceanside, Calif., more than 30 years\nago is evolving into a fast-growing sport that is part of the physical\neducation curriculum at thousands of American schools. More than two dozen\nnations will field teams at the world championships, and stacking is growing\nfastest in Asia, where children as young as 10, like fifth-ranked Chan Keng\nIan, are helping to globalize the sport.Stacking has been an A.A.U. Junior\nOlympics event since 2012, alongside swimming, karate, and track and field but\nalso baton twirling and jump rope. School districts like stacking because it\nis low liability and anyone can play, even children with physical or mental\ndisabilities.Wayne Godinet, a Samoan-American from Oceanside, is widely\ncredited with turning cup stacking into a sport. He was a director at the Boys\n\u0026amp; Girls Club, and, one day back in 1981, he took a stack of Dixie cups and\ntold the children to stack them in a pyramid, then run and touch a wall, come\nback and stack them again.“I knew we were on to something immediately,” said\nGodinet, now a community activist. “The kids loved it, so we started making\npyramids, introducing relays. It took off.”Godinet said that he wanted to turn\nthe game into a sport because he recognized that children who were small or\nwere not athletically inclined had low self-esteem.“This was a sport that\nleveled the playing field,” he said.Godinet received a patent in 1986 for a\ncup stacking kit he sold for $6, and by 1990, there were cup stacking programs\nin schools and clubs in 37 states.In 1990, one of Godinet’s protégés, 9-year-\nold Matt Adame, appeared on “The Tonight Show” with Johnny Carson. Bob Fox,\nthen a physical education teacher in Highlands Ranch, Colo., saw the show and\nthen attended one of Godinet’s tournaments. Fox later held one of his own.\nWhen more than 250 children turned up, he recognized the sport’s potential.In\n1998, he founded Speed Stacks Inc., which now has 98 percent share of the\nmarket for cup sets, which usually cost around $25 to $60.Through Speed\nStacks, the activity gained a more formal structure, with an emphasis on\nspeed, and became a big business.Don Teel and Larry Goers, who are now co-\nowners of Speed Stacks, are also the co-directors of the sport’s best-known\ngoverning body, the World Sport Stacking Association, which they founded in\n2001. The company said that it sold three million cup sets in the last five\nyears and that the sport was now played in 56 countries and more than 27,000\nAmerican schools. The association hosts 150 to 175 tournaments per\nyear.Stackers compete in three individual events: the 3-3-3, three stacks of\nthree cups each; 3-6-3, three stacks of three, six and three cups; and the\ncycle, a sequence of three formations. There are also doubles events and\nrelays. Cups must be stacked up and then taken down in a specific order, and\nthey cannot wobble or fall off the mat. At most tournaments, the overall\nwinners are crowned by adding the stackers’ fastest times in each of the three\nindividual disciplines.Godinet’s company stopped producing cup sets years ago,\nbut he said he was not upset that Speed Stacks developed his idea into a\nlucrative business.“I’m O.K. with that because this sport has transformed the\nlives of so many kids,” he said.Trey Griffith is one such child. When Jimmy\nGriffith learned that his son, Trey, was on the autism spectrum, he feared\nthat he would never be able to bond with his son over a common love of\nsports.But a few years after discovering a set of cups in the back of his\nsister’s closet, Trey, 12, has become one of the best sport stackers in the\nworld. And his father has found a way to connect with him, competing together\nin parent-child competitions.Jimmy Griffith said that there are a number of\nworld-class stackers, including Jesse Horn, a Missouri teen who calls himself\nMr. Stacking Dude, who are on the autism spectrum.Trey’s mother, Carmen, who\nalso stacks, said their motto was, “Families who stack together, stay\ntogether.” She said stacking had helped her son make friendships and gain\nconfidence.He has found his tribe at tournaments and by stacking with children\nfrom around the world on the video chat site ooVoo.“Stackers are the smart\nkids, the really nice kids,” Carmen Griffith said. “It’s an incredibly\nnurturing, supportive community.”The sport is dominated by tweens and\nteenagers, but adults stack competitively, too. Mark Sykes, the coach of the\nAmerican team at the world championships, will be competing at the event for\nthe sixth time, but he said he knew he had no chance to beat stackers like 14\n-year-old Josh Hainsel, who is ranked second and recently won the national\nchampionship.On a drizzly Saturday in March, the clattering din of cups being\nstacked echoed across a high school gymnasium in southwest Portland, Ore.,\nwhere 80 competitors had gathered for a regional sport stacking championship\nevent. All but a handful of the athletes were children, some as young as 2.The\ntop stackers, including three members of the United States national team —\nEzekiel McDowell, 19, Gabby Rivera, 14, and Joey Cooksey, 17 — warmed up at a\ntable in the corner of the gym. Cameron Wapner, an 18-year-old from Simi\nValley, Calif., said that at one time, he owned 88 cup sets.“We’re the weird\nkids who sit in the back of the class, listening to music,” Cooksey said.As\ncompetition unfolded across multiple age divisions and five events, the\natmosphere was competitive but supportive. When cups wobbled off the stacking\nmap or onto the floor, earning the competitor a scratch, or failed attempt,\nrivals offered words of encouragement and consolation. No one threw cups or\ncursed, and there was no obnoxious parenting.While this tribe may be united in\nits love of stacking, some question whether Speed Stacks has too much control\nover the sport.Godinet said that he appreciated what the company had done to\nexpand the sport but that he thought that stacking would benefit from having\nan independent governing body.Only cups made by Speed Stacks, which are made\nin China, can be used in World Sport Stacking Association tournaments.“It’s a\nlittle like if Spaulding ran the N.B.A.,” said Jeremi Mattern, who made the\n2013 documentary “Stacker,” which chronicled the 2011 World Sport Stacking\nChampionships, won by 10-year-old William Polly.At the Portland event, Wapner\nreferred to a set of cups he pulled from his bag as “contraband” because they\nwere made by the German company Flash Cups.According to its website, the\nowners of Flash Cups founded the International Sport Stacking Federation in\n2006 in order to “circumvent” the Speed Stacks monopoly and create “brand\nindependent” tournaments.“Writing rules where only its equipment makes for a\nsanctioned competition is a problem if it really wants to be a sport,” said\nDionne Koller, the director of the University of Baltimore’s Center for Sport\nand the Law.Speed Stacks also has cup lines named after Polly and Orrell, but\ntheir parents said the competitors received no royalties from the sale of\ntheir product lines. They also do not win prize money and must pay their own\nway to competitions like the world championships.“There is no TV or media\nrevenue associated with sport stacking, so royalties are not able to be paid\nfor any endorsed products,” Goers said in an email. “We provide endorsers with\nfree equipment, but mostly they get the bragging rights that come with having\ntheir name on a product line that stackers worldwide use.”As the sport\nevolves, will its child stars lose interest if bragging rights, fun and\ncamaraderie are their only incentives to keep playing?When making “Stacker,”\nMattern observed that once children entered junior high and high school, they\ndeveloped other interests and had less time to devote to stacking. Polly, a\ntwo-time world champion and three-time national champion who held many of the\nsport’s records before Orrell bested them, is already in semiretirement at\n15.“I’ve done everything I think I can do in the sport,” he said.\n\n","title":"Cup Stacking: A Sport Whose Growth Runneth Over - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Cup stacking: a sport whose growth runneth over\nhttps://t.co/jvzSTnDDpw https://t.co/AqlapbgJ2R","date":"Fri Apr 01 03:06:03 +0000 2016","favs":181,"id":{"$numberLong":"715736958559993856"},"retweets":96},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1RP3v76"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01440"},"content":"Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont kicked off his effort to win the April 19\nNew York Democratic presidential primary with a large, boisterous rally in the\nBronx on Thursday night, highlighting his local roots and telling New Yorkers\nthat he would work to make sure people have well-paying jobs, affordable\nhousing and access to good public education.Mr. Sanders spoke to thousands of\nsupporters at St. Mary’s Park (the campaign said 18,500 turned out), where he\nvowed to provide more resources to the Bronx and other communities across the\ncountry. He also told supporters at the outdoor event that they would be\ncritical to winning the nomination and to carrying out his policies.“What this\ncampaign is about is creating a political revolution,” Mr. Sanders told his\ncheering supporters. “You are the heart and soul of this revolution.”Mr.\nSanders also focused on his background, telling the crowd that his New York\nupbringing influenced his platform. “I learned a little bit about what it\nmeans to grow up in a family that has no money and I also learned a little bit\nabout the immigrant experience — those lessons I will never forget,” he\nsaid.The event was one of the most diverse gatherings Mr. Sanders has hosted\nin months, with many black and Latino supporters in the crowd chanting his\nname continually.Mr. Sanders said winning New York would mean a victory in the\ngeneral election in November.“If there is a large voter turnout, we will win,”\nMr. Sanders said. “And if we win here in New York, we are going to make it to\nthe White House.”The crowd Thursday night was so large that it spilled from\nthe park to a nearby field.“I say to the 1 percent, I say to Wall Street, I\nsay to the billionaire class, watch out, we are coming after you,” Mr. Sanders\nsaid. “We have a great chance to win in Wisconsin. Then we are coming back to\nNew York City.”Mr. Sanders grew up in Brooklyn, the son of an immigrant,\nwatching a black and white television in a three-and-a-half room tenement.His\ncampaign strategy for New York is to focus intensely on how his upbringing in\nthe city and his family’s financial challenges helped shape him into a\ncandidate intent on reforming Wall Street and addressing income inequality. He\nwill also use his personal narrative — told through statewide advertising buys\nand back-to-back campaign events — to try to persuade voters that his time in\nthe state makes him a better choice than his rival, Hillary Clinton, who is\nhighlighting her years in the United States Senate representing New York.“He\nis going to run as a Brooklynite and Hillary is going to run as a senator,”\nsaid Tad Devine, a senior strategist for Mr. Sanders’s campaign. “We are going\nto talk about his own story, his narrative.”Mr. Devine said Wednesday that he\nand other advisers were planning Mr. Sanders’s schedule, and that the campaign\nexpected to run ads created specifically for New York voters. He added that\nwhile Mr. Sanders will campaign this weekend in Wisconsin, which holds its\nDemocratic primary on Tuesday, the senator will soon barnstorm through the\nfive boroughs and other parts of the state to court liberal supporters.Despite\nhis local roots, Mr. Sanders may face an uphill fight in New York. A poll from\nQuinnipiac University released Thursday found Mrs. Clinton leading Mr. Sanders\nby a margin of 54 percent to 42 percent. The poll showed Mrs. Clinton doing\nbest among women and older voters, with Mr. Sanders beating her among men and\nwith “very liberal” voters.But progressive candidates have a history of doing\nwell in New York against opponents who have backing from party leaders, said\nStu Loeser, who owns a media strategy firm and was a longtime spokesman for\nMayor Michael R. Bloomberg.He pointed out that Christine C. Quinn, a former\nCity Council speaker, was the front-runner in the New York City’s mayoral race\nin 2013 and had tremendous support from party and business leaders. But she\nultimately lost as voters elected Bill de Blasio, who had support from the\nmore progressive wing of the party.“Primary after primary in New York, when\nthere is a choice between a serious progressive candidate and an establishment\ncandidate, the progressive candidate tends to overperform, and that is\nsomething Clinton supporters might be concerned about,” Mr. Loeser said.Still,\nMr. Sanders’s biggest challenge will be making inroads among minority voters.\nAbout one-third of likely Democratic primary voters in New York state will be\nblack or Latino, and it will be critical for the senator to garner support\namong them, said Lee M. Miringoff, the director of the Marist College\nInstitute for Public Opinion.Mr. Sanders could find support in areas of New\nYork City where progressives live, like the Upper West Side, as well as\nBrooklyn neighborhoods that have become magnets for young people, like Park\nSlope, Williamsburg and Bushwick, experts said.If Mr. Sanders wins New York,\nit will change the narrative of the race, Mr. Miringoff said. “Winning would\ncreate a story beyond the mere delegate count, which I think would propel his\ncampaign,” Mr. Miringoff said.\n\n","title":"Bernie Sanders Seeks to Win Over New York by Stressing Brooklyn Roots - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Bernie Sanders seeks to win over New York by stressing Brooklyn roots https://t.co/DstIsPdEcS https://t.co/S5FBIXavBA","date":"Fri Apr 01 02:46:03 +0000 2016","favs":460,"id":{"$numberLong":"715731926519255041"},"retweets":223},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VWJcYm"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01441"},"content":"U.S. Soccer, the governing body for the sport in America, pays the members of\nthe men’s and women’s national teams who represent the United States in\ninternational competitions. The men’s team has historically been mediocre. The\nwomen’s team has been a quadrennial phenomenon, winning world and Olympic\nchampionships and bringing much of the country to a standstill in the\nprocess.Citing this disparity, as well as rising revenue numbers, five players\non the women’s team filed a federal complaint Wednesday, accusing U.S. Soccer\nof wage discrimination because, they said, they earned as little as 40 percent\nof what players on the United States men’s national team earned even as they\nmarched to the team’s third World Cup championship last year. The five\nplayers, some of the world’s most prominent women’s athletes, said they were\nbeing shortchanged on everything from bonuses to appearance fees to per\ndiems.The case, submitted to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the\nfederal agency that enforces civil rights laws against workplace\ndiscrimination, is the latest front in the spreading debate over equal\ntreatment of female athletes. A tennis tournament director was forced to\nresign recently after saying that female players “ride on the coattails of the\nmen,” and the N.C.A.A. has drawn scrutiny for the financial disparities\nbetween the men’s and women’s basketball tournaments.“The numbers speak for\nthemselves,” said goalkeeper Hope Solo, one of the players to sign the\ncomplaint. “We are the best in the world, have three World Cup championships,\nfour Olympic championships.” Solo said the men’s players “get paid more to\njust show up than we get paid to win major championships.”Solo was joined in\nthe complaint by the co-captains Carli Lloyd and Becky Sauerbrunn, forward\nAlex Morgan and midfielder Megan Rapinoe.U.S. Soccer officials pushed back\nforcefully on the players’ claims in a conference call Thursday night, citing\nfigures that the federation said showed the men’s national team produced\nrevenue and attendance about double that of the women’s team, and television\nratings that were “a multiple” of what the women attract, according to Sunil\nGulati, the U.S. Soccer president. A federation spokesman, Neil Buethe, called\nsome of the revenue figures in the players’ complaint “inaccurate, misleading\nor both.”In a statement released earlier Thursday, U.S. Soccer recounted the\nrole the federation has played in the growth of women’s soccer, including its\nintroduction to the Olympic Games and in providing full-time salaries for top\nplayers. It said it was willing to discuss compensation as part of continuing\ntalks over a new collective bargaining agreement.But in linking their\ncompensation to the men’s pay, the women’s players put U.S. Soccer in a\ndifficult position. The federation has collective bargaining agreements with\nboth teams, but the financial terms differ widely.A men’s player, for example,\nreceives $5,000 for a loss in a friendly match but as much as $17,625 for a\nwin against a top opponent. A women’s player receives $1,350 for a similar\nmatch, but only if the United States wins; women’s players receive no bonuses\nfor losses or ties.Opportunities for women to participate in sports have\nincreased greatly in the more than 40 years since the passage of the gender-\nequity legislation known as Title IX. But sports officials continue to\nstruggle with matters of compensation.It has been argued that men’s sports,\nand their players, deserve a financial edge because they draw bigger crowds\nand generate far more money in ticket sales and corporate sponsorships. That\nis the case for U.S. Soccer’s national teams, the federation said Thursday.\nBut that is not true for every sport. Women’s figure skating, for instance,\nhas often drawn higher TV ratings and bigger crowds than men’s figure\nskating.In their complaint, the five players cited recent U.S. Soccer\nfinancial reports as proof that they have become the federation’s main\neconomic engine even as, they said, they often earned only half as much — or\nless — than their male counterparts.At the same time, the players said, they\nexceeded revenue projections by as much as $16 million in 2015, when their\nWorld Cup triumph set television viewership records and a nine-game victory\ntour in packed stadiums produced record gate receipts and attendance\nfigures.U.S. Soccer officials disputed those figures, arguing that the women\nand their lawyer, Jeffrey Kessler, cherry-picked an extraordinarily successful\nyear to draw broad conclusions.Michael LeRoy, who teaches collective\nbargaining and sports at the University of Illinois, said that market\nconditions between the men’s and women’s sports are vastly different. LeRoy\npointed to a high-profile case brought by Marianne Stanley, the women’s\nbasketball coach at the University of Southern California in the early 1990s,\nwho argued she should be paid at a level equal to the men’s coach. Her legal\neffort was unsuccessful.“They have to prove equality of work and market\nconditions, and it’s such a rigid legal requirement,” LeRoy said of the\nwomen’s soccer players.While women have often been dismissed in international\nsoccer — the men’s World Cup began in 1930 and the women’s not until 1991 —\nthey have become the sport’s standard-bearers in the United States. The\nwomen’s team has provided the type of repeated success that has remained\nelusive for the American men. Not so long ago, a woman, Mia Hamm, may have\nbeen the best-known soccer player in the country.When Hamm and her teammates\nwon the 1999 World Cup in the United States, they also set records for\nattendance and television viewing. Last summer, when the United States\ndefeated Japan to win another Women’s World Cup, the final was seen by 25.4\nmillion viewers on Fox — a record for a men’s or women’s soccer game on\nEnglish-language television in this country.“We have been quite patient over\nthe years with the belief that the federation would do the right thing and\ncompensate us fairly,” said Lloyd, the most valuable player of the Women’s\nWorld Cup.Although only five players signed the complaint, they said they were\nacting on behalf of the entire women’s team, saying they are all employees of\nU.S. Soccer through their national team contracts. That is significant,\naccording to Peter Romer-Friedman, the deputy director of litigation for the\nWashington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights.“By speaking up publicly, the\nplayers are saying, ‘It’s important for the public to know that we’ve filed\nthis suit,’ ” Romer-Friedman said. “Frankly, as a civil rights lawyer, it is\nimportant for them to speak out because it has an educational effect.”The\nfiling of the complaint was the latest move in an increasingly contentious\nlegal fight between U.S. Soccer and the women’s national team, which is\nfavored to repeat as Olympic champion at the Rio Games in August but has long\ngrumbled about its pay, working conditions and travel and hotel\narrangements.The long-simmering feud boiled over after last summer’s Women’s\nWorld Cup triumph. A match in Hawaii that was part of the team’s victory tour\nwas canceled when the players refused to play on an artificial-turf field they\ndeemed unsafe. Gulati later apologized for the situation.Two months later, the\ndisagreement veered into federal court when U.S. Soccer took the unusual step\nof filing a lawsuit against the national team’s players’ union as part of a\ndispute about the validity of the players’ collective bargaining agreement.\nThe federation contends the agreement, which expired in 2012, lives on in a\nmemorandum of understanding the sides signed in early 2013. The union contends\nit does not.In response to the complaint filed Wednesday, U.S. Soccer argued\nthat not only was the players’ pay collectively bargained, but that the\nplayers had insisted more than once on a salary-based system as a means of\neconomic security over the bonus-centric plan the men work under. Russell\nSauer, the outside counsel for the federation during labor talks, also said\nthe women’s labor contract included provisions — severance and injury pay,\nhealth benefits and maternity leave, for example — not available to the men’s\nteam.“The truth is,” Sauer said, “the players are claiming discrimination\nbased on a more conservative structure, based on guaranteed compensation\nrather than pay to play, which they themselves requested, negotiated and\napproved of not once, but twice.”Furthermore, U.S. Soccer noted, a major\nsource of revenue and contention — World Cup prize money — is determined by\nFIFA, world soccer’s governing body, not the federation. But the women’s\ncomplaint seems to take aim at a bigger share of domestic revenue, like\nsponsorships and television contracts, and U.S. Soccer financial reports hint\nat a richer future involving the team: The federation’s budget projections for\n2016 include $2.3 million for a 10-game victory tour after this summer’s\nOlympics.\n\n","title":"Top Female Players Accuse U.S. Soccer of Wage Discrimination - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Top female players accuse U.S. Soccer of wage discrimination https://t.co/K6lhrPTJAR https://t.co/NBVlE4acmD","date":"Fri Apr 01 01:36:05 +0000 2016","favs":555,"id":{"$numberLong":"715714319401529344"},"retweets":441},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1TlWmgO"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01442"},"content":"ALBANY — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and state legislative leaders announced on\nThursday that they had reached a budget agreement that would raise the minimum\nwage in New York City to $15 by the end of 2018, but initiate slower increases\nelsewhere, even in the city’s wealthy suburbs.For Mr. Cuomo, the wage\nagreement came with clear concessions, as some lawmakers outside the city won\na softer phase-in period. Long Island and Westchester County will not reach a\n$15 wage for nearly six years; areas north of Westchester are assured only of\nreaching $12.50 by 2021.In announcing the $15 wage, New York became the second\nstate to embrace that threshold; California lawmakers passed a similar measure\nonly hours earlier on Thursday. The movement began in earnest in New York City\nin late 2012, when fast-food workers began the so-called Fight for $15, which\nbecame a nationwide effort to increase wages and support unions.The wage issue\nwas one of the final obstacles to reaching a timely accord on the next state\nbudget, estimated to be more than $150 billion, which mixes high-profile\npolicy measures with nuts-and-bolts infrastructure spending and aid to\nschools.With the minimum wage deal and another hard-fought measure — one that\nwould eventually provide employees across the state 12 weeks of paid time off\nto care for newborns or sick relatives and for families dealing with military\ndeployments — the governor was able to claim victory on two signature\nissues.Nonetheless, the wage agreement fell short of the sweeping statewide\nvision the governor had laid out in his State of the State address in January\nand championed in a subsequent labor-backed campaign named in honor of his\nfather: the Mario Cuomo Campaign for Economic Justice.Still, Mr. Cuomo, who\nhad fought hard for the higher wage, cast the increase as a major\naccomplishment on Thursday, both for working people and for his own political\nbrand.“We’re leaders,” he said, “in economic justice.”The governor, a\nDemocrat, also announced a plan for billions in income tax cuts beginning in\n2018 — affecting families earning less than $300,000 — and to end the Gap\nElimination Adjustment, which had drained money from local school districts\nfor state uses.Mr. Cuomo also backed off two plans adamantly opposed by fellow\nDemocrats in the State Assembly: one asking New York City to shoulder $485\nmillion in funding for the City University of New York, and another seeking\nhundreds of millions of dollars more in Medicaid savings, largely drawn from\nthe city.The budget was still being debated and voted on by legislators even\nas Thursday’s midnight deadline passed, officially making for a late budget.\nBut work was expected to be completed Friday — the first day of the fiscal\nyear — close enough to the fiscal target protect Mr. Cuomo’s reputation for\nefficient governing. (He has passed five previous budgets more or less on time\n.)On-time budgets have become such a point of pride for the governor that\nlawmakers could not resist needling him once midnight came and went. “Just so\nyou know,” State Senator Rubén Díaz rose on the Senate floor to say at 12:12\na.m., “the budget is late.”The 11th-hour nature of the announcement prompted\nsome concerns from lawmakers who were expected to review and vote on the bills\nwith little time to read them. “Despite a lot of a good content in the budget,\nthe process at arriving at the conclusion left a lot to be desired,” said\nState Senator Michael Gianaris, a Queens Democrat.And if the budget\naccomplished two cherished liberal goals — higher wages and paid leave — it\nwas still notable for what it left out. Mere months after the former\nlegislative leaders of both the Assembly and Senate were convicted on\ncorruption charges in what government watchdogs have taken to calling a\n“Watergate moment” for New York, there was no hint of ethics reform in the\ndeal on Thursday.On the wage issue, in areas north of Westchester, the minimum\nwage — now $9 — will rise by 70 cents a year over the next five years,\neventually hitting $12.50 by the end of 2020, though the governor said it\nwould continue to rise toward $15, depending on its economic impact. Indeed,\nin announcing the wage increase and brokering a deal with Senate Republicans,\nMr. Cuomo seemed to be treading a fine line between confidence that $15 would\neventually be reached statewide and cautioning that the wage could be\nsuspended if it was determined to be hurting the economy.The plan also\nincluded other caveats: Businesses with 10 or fewer employees will have nearly\nfour years to institute the wage increase in New York City.In describing a so-\ncalled safety valve, the governor explained how the wage’s move toward the $15\nbenchmark upstate would be determined by state labor and budget analysts —\nboth parts of the executive branch — who would review the wage’s economic\nimpact using studies conducted beginning in 2019. The state would then use\nthat information to plan increases in the upstate wage — or to suspend the\nincrease temporarily, statewide, depending on economic data.“This is the\nsmartest, safest way to go about it, in my opinion,” he said.Senator Catharine\nYoung, a Republican and chairwoman of the Finance Committee, described the\nidea of different rates for different regions as “very helpful,” adding that\ninitially limiting the rate to $12.50 upstate would allow “a pause, for\nstudy,” after five years.Public-school spending accounted for nearly $25\nbillion of the budget agreement, which, after several failed attempts in past\nyears, eliminates the deeply unpopular Gap Elimination Adjustment that the\nstate first used in 2010 to cover a huge budget deficit at public schools’\nexpense. Both Republicans and Democrats supported restoring the funding. The\nbudget also boosted funding for charter schools across the state by roughly\n$430 per student.But CUNY and its statewide counterpart, the State University\nof New York, were unable to persuade lawmakers to allow them to raise tuition\nover the next few years.As city leaders have grappled with a homelessness and\naffordable housing crisis, the governor has repeatedly promised bold\ninterventions from the state. He delivered $20 billion toward that effort in\nthe budget, though details of the plan remain scarce three months after he\nfirst announced it.Both upstate and downstate areas received roughly $27\nbillion in transportation investments, restoring about $500 million for the\nsecond phase of the Second Avenue subway in the Metropolitan Transportation\nAuthority’s 2015-19 capital plan.Under the family leave plan, agreed to by\nSenator John J. Flanagan, the Long Island Republican who serves as the\nmajority leader, and Carl E. Heastie, the speaker of the Democrat-dominated\nAssembly, state residents will be eligible for such leave starting in 2018\nafter working for six months at a job. The leave would eventually be extended\nto 12 weeks, and would be funded by deductions from employees’ pay.Republicans\nlike Ms. Young were excited about Mr. Cuomo’s tax cut, which will reduce state\nrevenue by more than $4 billion annually by 2025. But Mr. Cuomo presented\nrelief as long overdue for taxpayers in New York.“Economically, I believe, it\nwill be a net plus,” he said.Mr. Cuomo said he felt no competitiveness with\nCalifornia, where legislators approved the wage increase on Thursday, sending\nit to Gov. Jerry Brown. New York’s governor was magnanimous, saying working\npeople “need a raise” everywhere. But he did note that New York City residents\nwould see that raise quicker than those in Los Angeles, where the wage will\nrise by 2022.Asked whether he worried whether future governors might undo his\nwage proposal — Mr. Cuomo is up for re-election in 2018 — the governor\nsmiled.“I plan to be governor,” he said.\n\n","title":"New York Budget Deal With Higher Minimum Wage Is Reached - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"New York budget deal with higher minimum wage is reached https://t.co/ZFpquKVWO5","date":"Fri Apr 01 01:16:40 +0000 2016","favs":127,"id":{"$numberLong":"715709432861224960"},"retweets":106},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VWAOI8"}

He was a patrol\nofficer before transferring to the terrorism and criminal interdiction unit\nfor which he was undergoing the training.“This has been a tough evening,” said\nCol. W. Steven Flaherty, the superintendent of the Virginia State Police,\nspeaking at a news conference on Thursday night. “It was quite a tragedy for\nall of us.”Colonel Flaherty said that Trooper Dermyer had been with about a\ndozen other State Police troopers participating in specialized training that\nincluded classroom instruction and “field practicals” at the bus\nstation.Trooper Dermyer had approached a man and started talking to him around\n2:40 p.m., an encounter that was part of the training, Colonel Flaherty said.\n“The training encompasses looking for suspicious activity,” he said, adding,\n“that was what was taking place here.”Colonel Flaherty said he believed the\nconversation had lasted about 30 seconds before the man shot Trooper Dermyer\nmultiple times. Two troopers who were nearby returned fire, officials said, as\nthe gunman moved into the terminal’s restaurant.“The shooter continued to be\ncombative once E.M.S. crews arrived on the scene to render him aid,” Colonel\nFlaherty said. The gunman was taken to VCU Medical Center, where he died, the\nauthorities said. They did not specify the nature of his injuries.Two women at\nthe bus terminal were also injured in the shootout and were receiving\ntreatment at VCU Medical Center for non-life-threatening injuries, the colonel\nsaid.Agents from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and\nExplosives, the F.B.I., the United States Marshals Service and the Department\nof Homeland Security were assisting the Virginia State Police in the\ninvestigation.The police said they had identified the gunman but did not\nrelease his name pending notification of his family.“He has a history of\ncharges, but we haven’t been able to sort through what convictions he had,”\nColonel Flaherty said. “There’s not much we’ve ruled out, but certainly\nthere’s no indication of terrorism.”Originally from Jackson, Mich., Trooper\nDermyer is survived by his wife and two children, Colonel Flaherty said. He\nhad previously worked with the police departments in Jackson and in Newport\nNews, Va.He had recently been featured in a television story on 13NewsNow, a\nlocal ABC affiliate, in which he and another trooper chased down a runaway dog\non an interstate.The Greyhound station was evacuated and closed after the\nshooting, the company said.Gov. Terry McAuliffe said he was “heartbroken” by\nthe death of Trooper Dermyer.“Trooper Dermyer put on a uniform and risked his\nlife every day to keep us safe, first as a U.S. Marine and then as a police\nofficer,” he said in a statement. “This is a loss that impacts us all.”\n\n","title":"Virginia State Trooper Killed in Bus Station Shooting - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Virginia officer killed and 2 wounded in bus station shooting\nhttps://t.co/lQhzl1aJEw https://t.co/pLDx0iHiLY","date":"Fri Apr 01 01:06:06 +0000 2016","favs":128,"id":{"$numberLong":"715706771185278978"},"retweets":112},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VWzd58"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01444"},"content":"THE HAGUE — A United Nations tribunal on Thursday acquitted a Serbian\nnationalist, Vojislav Seselj, of war crimes and of crimes against humanity for\nhis role in the Balkan wars of the 1990s, igniting a celebration by his\nfollowers and outrage among relatives of the victims.“It was the only possible\nverdict,” Mr. Seselj said in a defiant news conference in Belgrade, where he\nhad gone for cancer treatment in 2014 and stayed on. “When I went to The\nHague, I knew they could not prove any crime. There, I broke all the false\naccusations.”To those representing the victims, the acquittal was as gut-\nwrenching as it was surprising. “This verdict is offensive and shocking, and\nthe process of reconciliation among people and neighboring countries will be\ndevastated,” said the Croatian foreign minister, Miro Kovac, in a statement.\n“All those in the world who incite war, calling for ethnic cleansing and a\npolicy of forced changes to internationally recognized borders were given a\nmoral blank check with this verdict.”The acquittal by a three-judge panel came\none week after the same court, the International Criminal Tribunal for the\nformer Yugoslavia, convicted the former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic\nof genocide and 10 other counts of grave crimes.Serge Brammertz, the chief\nprosecutor, who had asked for a 28-year sentence, sounded shocked. “Of course,\nwe and many victims are absolutely not satisfied with this outcome,” he said\nby telephone. An appeal was likely, he said.Mr. Seselj, 61, a lawyer famous\nfor his fiery and irreverent speeches, during the war mobilized a well-known\ngroup of volunteer fighters known as Seselj’s Men. Although not a military\nleader, as the head of Serbia’s ultranationalist Radical Party he was accused\nof inciting his followers to kill and commit other crimes as they joined the\nfighting and ethnic cleansing campaigns in Croatia, Bosnia and the Serbian\nprovince of Vojvodina between 1991 and 1993.At the height of the campaigns, in\n1992, more than 45,000 people died, a large part of the more than 100,000\nkilled in the former Yugoslavia in the early ’90s.Mr. Seselj was charged with\nthree counts of crimes against humanity and six of war crimes in the ethnic\ncleansing for his role in mobilizing and motivating his followers. The charges\nincluded participating in a “joint criminal enterprise” to create a so-called\nGreater Serbia that led to the forcible transfer of tens of thousands of\ncivilians; torture, sexual assaults, beatings and other physical abuse of\ndetained non-Serbs; the destruction of homes, religious sites and cultural\ninstitutions; and hate speech.But the majority on the three-judge bench found\nthat Mr. Seselj, who acted as his own lawyer, was primarily pursuing a\npolitical project and was not an accomplice to any of those crimes. Even\nthough he provided money and weapons to his volunteer fighters, the judges\nsaid he had not ordered, aided or abetted crimes because the fighters were\nunder the command of Serbian military and police forces.The presiding judge,\nJean-Claude Antonetti of France, who during the trial was often a target of\ntaunts and insults from Mr. Seselj, said that the defendant’s incendiary\nspeeches, calling for killing and revenge against his enemies, were “meant to\nboost the morale” of his followers, but were not crimes.Another judge, Flavia\nLattanzi of Italy, issued a lengthy dissent, taking issue with the majority on\nnearly all the counts. She said Mr. Seselj had aided and abetted the crimes as\ncharged, because he provided moral and material support to his volunteer\nforce.Prime Minister Tihomir Oreskovic of Croatia denounced the acquittal as\n“a shameful slap to the victims.”He said Mr. Seselj “did not show remorse for\nthe wrongs committed against the victims in Vukovar,” referring to a city in\neastern Croatia, along the border with Serbia, that was decimated during the\n1990s war. He added that the tribunal’s failure to “recognize the criminal\nenterprise in Croatia” means that “the fascist politics of Greater Serbia went\nunpunished.”After the prime minister spoke, the Croatian government barred Mr.\nSeselj from entering the country, news agencies reported.William Schabas, a\nprofessor of international law at Middlesex University, said: “The judgment\ntells us that it is not the extreme nationalism of Serbia that was on trial.\nIt presents Seselj as an ideologue and a demagogue, but he is a secondary\nfigure. He is not commanding the troops.”Mr. Seselj, a former deputy prime\nminister of Serbia and onetime ally of the former Serbian president, Slobodan\nMilosevic, surrendered to the tribunal in The Hague in 2003. He quickly became\nnotorious for his loutish outbursts, going on a long hunger strike at one\npoint and disrupting the proceedings with exceptional demands and long\nspeeches.The long delays in Mr. Seselj’s case, to a large extent the result of\nhis machinations, caused profound embarrassment for the tribunal. In addition\nto his obstructions, however, there was also a lengthy dispute among the\njudges that led one of them to be removed, for apparent bias, further delaying\nhis trial.During his 11 years in detention, he was tried and convicted three\ntimes for contempt of court, for writing about protected prosecution\nwitnesses. An arrest warrant is still pending for three of his associates, who\nare accused of intimidating and bribing witnesses who later retracted or\nchanged their statements.He was not present in the courtroom on Thursday. In\nSerbia, Mr. Seselj and his followers celebrated the acquittal and expected it\nwould be a boost for his Serbian Radical Party in next month’s elections. But\nanalysts do not expect the party to fare well, as the appeal of nationalism\nhas faded and many people want to join the European Union.As a lawyer and\npolitician, Mr. Seselj became known for his fierce intelligence. He was jailed\nfor two years, in 1984, for advocating that Yugoslavia be replaced by a Serb-\ndominated entity. He helped establish the Serbian Radical Party in 1990, as\nYugoslavia was falling apart, and resisted moves by Bosnia and Herzegovina,\nCroatia and Slovenia to declare independence. He was seen in many quarters as\neven more extreme, and a more skilled demagogue, than Mr. Milosevic, who died\nin prison in The Hague in 2006.On Thursday, Mr. Seselj said he would charge\nthe tribunal $16 million in lawyer’s fees and damages. The tribunal has said\nthere is no provision for reimbursement.\n\n","title":"Vojislav Seselj, Serbian Nationalist, Is Acquitted of War Crimes by Hague Tribunal - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @sewellchan: Croatians are outraged over ICTY's acquittal of Vojislav #Seselj of war crimes, crimes against humanity: https://t.co/SvMFN…","date":"Fri Apr 01 00:56:03 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715704242548383744"},"retweets":31},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22RGdWr"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01445"},"content":"California is on the verge of making itself a guinea pig in a bold economics\nexperiment.By moving toward a plan to raise the statewide minimum wage to $15\nan hour by 2022, the state could raise living standards for millions of\nworkers. But it could also increase unemployment among some of the very same\neconomically marginal workers the wage increase is intended to help.Many\neconomists, even some on the left, worry that a potential loss of jobs in a\nnumber of cities where wages are comparatively low could largely offset, and\nperhaps even more than offset, the boon of higher incomes at the bottom of the\nwage scale.“Just as the benefits of this policy are likely to be greater\nbecause it covers a greater share of the work force than for past minimum wage\nincreases, the risk of these costs is also higher,” said Ben Zipperer, an\nexpert on the minimum wage at the liberal Washington Center for Equitable\nGrowth. “It’s very unclear how that’s going to stack up.”San Francisco and San\nJose, both high-wage cities that have benefited from the tech boom, are likely\nto weather the increase without so much as a ripple. The negative consequences\nof the minimum wage increase in Los Angeles and San Diego — large cities where\nwages are lower — are likely to be more pronounced, though they could remain\nmodest on balance.But in lower-wage, inland cities like Bakersfield and\nFresno, the effects could play out in much less predictable ways. That’s\nbecause the rise of the minimum wage to $15 over the next six years would push\nthe wage floor much closer to the expected pay for a worker in the middle of\nthe wage scale, affecting a much higher proportion of employees and employers\nthere than in high-wage cities.“This is a big experiment,” said Arindrajit\nDube, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst\nwhose work has shown that modest minimum wage increases typically have limited\neffects on employment. “In areas like Fresno, a majority of workers are likely\nto be directly or indirectly affected.”Gov. Jerry Brown, announcing details of\nthe proposed legislation at a news conference on Monday, acknowledged the\npotential hardships of giving California the highest minimum wage of any state\nin the country.“If you took the wages down and cut them in half, it would make\nit easier for certain businesses,” he said. “But you can’t function that way,\nbecause we’re a community.”Mr. Brown, who worked out the deal with top\nlegislators and labor leaders, said the risks were worth it. “It’s a matter of\neconomic justice,” he said, “and it makes sense.”The legislation would delay\nby one year the schedule of wage increases for businesses with 25 workers or\nfewer, and would allow the governor to pause an increase for one year if the\neconomy weakened or the state’s budget deteriorated.Craig Scharton, the owner\nof a farm-to-table restaurant called Peeve’s Public House in downtown Fresno,\nsaid he was still smarting from a recent increase in the minimum wage from $9\nto $10 an hour. He said the increase had forced him to close on Mondays and\nTuesdays and played a role in reducing his staffing to a dozen today from 18\ntwo and a half years ago.Mr. Scharton was at a loss to explain how he would\nabsorb the new increase. “We’re trying our best to revitalize downtown,” he\nsaid. “This just kind of kicks our legs out from under us.”The Fresno example\nillustrates the challenge of raising the minimum wage to the same level across\ncities that, in economic terms, have little in common beyond the same state\ngovernment. Cities with high real estate prices are typically better able to\nwithstand minimum wage increases than cities with low prices, because wages\nrepresent a smaller fraction of a business’s overall cost in those cities and\ntherefore have a smaller effect on the bottom line.But in Fresno, real estate\nis cheap and wages are by far the biggest cost for the typical service sector\nbusiness. Mr. Scharton estimates that labor is about 40 percent of his costs,\nversus about 6 percent for real estate.Likewise, businesses in cities with\nlarge tourist industries often find it easier to pass along higher costs to\ncustomers, as tourists tend to be less price-sensitive than locals. But\nFresno, unlike Los Angeles or San Francisco, is not a tourist hub.“I don’t\nthink we have anything over $14 for an entree,” he said. “We can’t do $32 an\nentree like some high-end fancy New York restaurant.”The adverse effects from\na sharp increase in the minimum wage may not be as severe as some opponents\nfear, however. Michael Reich, an economics professor at the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley — whose work policy makers in Los Angeles and New York\nState have relied on to analyze their recent efforts to raise the minimum wage\n— said that, in his models, the overall economic effect of a $15 minimum wage\nwas roughly neutral, even when it amounted to 60 percent of the median\nwage.The reason, he said, is that the negative economic consequences of a\nhigher wage — namely, lower employment, partly because of greater automation,\nand declining sales because of price increases — were offset by greater\npurchasing power on the part of workers, which would lift economic activity in\nan area.As for low-cost cities where the impact could be even larger, Mr.\nReich said low-wage workers in places like Fresno were not so differently paid\nfrom low-wage workers in higher-cost cities — despite the fact that typical\nwages in those cities are far apart.“Even if the average wage differential\nbetween Fresno and the rest of the state is about 25 percent,” Mr. Reich said,\n“just within retail and restaurants you find that the wage differential is\nmore like 5 percent.”Moreover, the benefits of the higher wage may be more\nthan purely economic.Dave Regan is president of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers\nWest, which represents more than 85,000 hospital workers in California and\ndeployed more than 2,500 members to collect hundreds of thousands of\nsignatures to qualify a minimum wage ballot initiative. He said that even if\nthere were potential economic downsides, the effect of empowering workers to\ninfluence their own fates could be transformative politically.“There’s so much\ncynicism, anger,” Mr. Regan said. “To have the governor and legislature\nresponding in a positive and constructive way to our members is really\nimportant. It shows, ‘Wow, what we do really does matter.’”Cities in other\nstates, like Seattle and Chicago, recently enacted significant wage increases,\nand Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York is pressing a plan to increase the\nminimum wage to $15 in New York City by 2019 and statewide by 2021.Skeptics\nargue that the California policy is reckless, given that there were already a\nvariety of localized experiments underway that would have given insight into\nthe effects of a substantial minimum wage increase before thrusting the\ncountry’s most populous state into unknown territory.“We just passed minimum\nwage laws in some cities: San Francisco is a high-wage one, Los Angeles is not\nsuch a high-wage one,” said David Neumark, an economics professor at the\nUniversity of California, Irvine, who has done work suggesting that even\nrelatively moderate minimum wage increases can lead to a more than trivial\nrise in unemployment. “Given that there’s some risk of adverse effects,\npossibly bad effects, let’s do a little study and see what happens.”\n\n","title":"$15-an-Hour Minimum Wage in California?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01446"},"content":"The kakapo — a large flightless parrot that can live 95 years and perhaps\nlonger — is dangerously close to extinction. Once found throughout New\nZealand, the population has dwindled to fewer than 150.Conservation biologists\nare doing everything they can to keep the kakapo from vanishing. And so, when\nthey discovered a few years ago that a pair of captive kakapos were infected\nwith tapeworms, they did the obvious thing. They dewormed the birds.Hamish G.\nSpencer, a geneticist at the University of Otago in New Zealand, thinks that\nwas unwise. If endangered species are going to escape extinction, he argues,\nthey may need parasites to survive.“Some of these parasites may turn out to be\nquite good for their hosts,” Dr. Spencer said.We tend to think of species that\nlive inside hosts as disease-causing enemies. That may be true — but only up\nto a point. Medical studies have shown that humans have evolved an intimate,\nperhaps even necessary, relationship with many of these lodgers.Five decades\nago, researchers first began to find evidence of an upside to parasites. In\n1968, for example, Brian M. Greenwood of the London School of Hygiene and\nTropical Medicine observed that people in Nigeria had lower levels of\narthritis and other immune-related diseases than people in Britain. He\nsuggested that chronic infection with intestinal worms or other parasites\nmoderated the immune system in Nigerians, reducing the risk that the body’s\nown tissues would be attacked.Evidence accumulated over the decades for what\ncame to be known as the hygiene hypothesis. Supporters argued that over the\npast two centuries, modern civilization has radically changed our relationship\nwith our inner residents.For millions of years, our evolving bodies had to\nstrike a tricky balance. We depended on a powerful immune system to fend off\ndeadly infections. But if the immune system were to attack indiscriminately,\nit could destroy the body’s beneficial bacteria, for example, or damage its\ntissues with relentless inflammation.According to the hygiene hypothesis, our\nancestors came to tolerate low levels of infection. They even came to depend\non parasites to help the immune system develop properly.That’s not to say that\nparasites became an unalloyed good. Our relationship with them is instead a\ncomplicated trade-off.“Having worms can mean you have fewer allergies when you\ngrow up, but it could also stunt your growth,” said Marlene Zuk, an\nevolutionary biologist at the University of Minnesota. “Nobody promised you\nthis was going to work out really well.”In the 19th century, this ancient\nrelationship changed. Thanks to clean food and water, a growing number of\npeople were freed from parasites. The Industrial Revolution also took people\naway from farms, so they came into less contact with dirt and parasite-bearing\nlivestock. They experienced fewer infections with viruses, bacteria and\nintestinal worms.Proponents of the hygiene hypothesis argue that it’s no\ncoincidence that people in industrialized countries also began experiencing\nmore allergies, asthma, Crohn’s disease and other immune-related\ndisorders.Writing in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution, Dr. Spencer\nand Dr. Zuk point out that what’s true for humans may well be true for other\nanimals, too. Conservation biologists, they say, may be unwittingly running an\nexperiment on species they’re trying to save from extinction.In the wild, a\nhealthy animal may be rife with intestinal worms and other inhabitants.\n“Everything has parasites, and usually multiple species of parasites that live\nin all sorts of places,” Dr. Spencer said.To care for captive breeding\npopulations, biologists will typically treat infections with aggressive\nmedication. While those treatments may save the lives of some animals, they\nmay also have a downside. Aggressive medicine may endanger captive animals by\nremoving parasites that help their immune systems develop normally. And, Dr.\nSpencer and Dr. Zuk argue, these animals may end up unprepared for the\ndiseases they may encounter should they be returned to the wild.Human history\nhas shown how dangerous this can be: European colonists, for example,\nintroduced smallpox and other diseases to far-flung populations.In the wild, a\nspecies may regain the old relationship with its parasites. But aggressive\nhuman intervention may also forever sever some links between hosts and\nparasites.“It turns out that if you look at organisms, you discover that a\nsurprising number of them have parasites that only occur on that species or\nperhaps that species and a couple of close relatives, and that’s it,” Dr.\nSpencer said.Treating captive animals for infections may help hasten these\nparasites into oblivion and, with them, the mechanism the endangered species\nneeded to fine-tune its immune system.Parasitic extinction isn’t just a\ntheoretical possibility. When California biologists brought all the surviving\nCalifornia condors into captivity in the 1980s, they ended up eradicating\nColpocephalum californici, a species of feather louse found only on those\nbirds.Dr. Spencer suspects we have wiped out other parasites without realizing\nit. No one knows what species of tapeworm was infecting the kakapos, but\ndeworming them may have driven it extinct.It’s possible, Dr. Spencer said,\nthat the lack of parasites may help explain why some species restoration\nprojects have been disappointing. “There are a number of cases where\nreintroduced populations haven’t done very well,” he said. “It might be that\ntheir immune systems are not very good.”Albrecht I. Schulte-Hostedde, the\ndirector of the Center for Evolutionary Ecology and Ethical Conservation at\nLaurentian University in Sudbury, Ontario, said it was important for\nconservation biologists and veterinarians to appreciate this evolutionary\nperspective. But he expected it would be difficult to change their\nattitudes.“It’s going to be a hard sell,” he said.Even if those attitudes\nchange, researchers still need to learn a lot more about parasites to manage\nthem.“I freely admit this is a daunting prospect, but we have to start\nsomewhere,” Dr. Zuk said.A first step, Dr. Spencer said, would be to stop\nmedicating captive animals so freely. “We are arguing against the idea that\nyou just dose the hell out of everything before you put animals back in the\nwild,” he said.\n\n","title":"Tapeworms and Other Parasites Can Make Good Guests - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTScience: We tend to think of parasites as disease-causing enemies.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01447"},"content":"Ever since a group led by the acquisitive — and secretive — Chinese firm\nAnbang Insurance Group raised its bid for Starwood Hotels and Resorts,\nadvisers to the American hotel company were a little wary that its new suitor\nmight not be able to follow through.And then early Thursday morning, Starwood\nand its advisers began to learn that Anbang was likely to walk away, just\nweeks after first emerging to challenge Marriott International in a highly\nvisible merger contest.By Thursday afternoon, Anbang and its partners formally\nwithdrew their $14 billion takeover offer for Starwood, ceding the operator of\nthe Westin and Sheraton chains to Marriott in a puzzling turn of events.So\nends what had been poised to become one of the big merger battles of 2016, as\nthe century-old Marriott faced losing to a consortium whose leader boasted\nclose ties to the Chinese government.But after being topped twice in bidding\nby the group — which included Anbang, the American private equity firm J.C.\nFlowers \u0026amp; Company and Primavera Capital, an investment firm led by a\nformer chairman of Goldman Sachs for Asia — Marriott decided earlier this week\nnot to immediately raise its latest offer beyond roughly $13.25 billion,\nbetting that something would befall the consortium’s efforts.That wager paid\noff. Combining Starwood with Marriott will create the biggest hotel company in\nthe world, with more than 5,500 owned or franchised hotels and 1.1 million\nrooms.Starwood said in a statement on Thursday that it had still managed to\nextract more money for the company’s investors and looked forward to combining\nwith Marriott.“Throughout this process, we have been focused on maximizing\nstockholder value now and in the future,” Bruce Duncan, Starwood’s chairman,\nsaid. “Our board is confident this transaction offers superior value for\nStarwood’s stockholders, can close quickly and provides value-creation\npotential that will enable both sets of stockholders to benefit from future\nfinancial performance.”Shares in Starwood fell more than 4 percent in after-\nhours trading after Anbang’s disclosure, to $79.92. Shares in Marriott fell 5\npercent, to $67.61.What happened to Anbang’s takeover effort is unclear. In a\nstatement on Thursday, the insurer’s consortium blamed unspecified “various\nmarket considerations” for its need to withdraw.The abrupt withdrawal of the\noffer raised new questions, including whether the Chinese government, which\nhas close ties with Anbang, had blocked the proposed transaction, or whether\nthe insurer and its fellow bidders had run into issues with the financing for\nthe deal.It is a mysterious end to the pursuit by Anbang, a huge insurer that\nhas risen to prominence in recent years, in part through audacious deal-\nmaking. The Chinese firm, which has assets of more than $291 billion, became a\nforce in the luxury hotel business in less than two years after buying the\nlikes of the Waldorf Astoria and the JW Marriott Essex House.Its chairman, Wu\nXiaohui, had begun to gain a reputation as a Chinese counterpart to Warren E.\nBuffett, his wealth compounding rapidly since founding the insurer in\n2004.Still, the company he oversees has been criticized for its unusually\nopaque corporate structure: Thirty-seven interlocking holding companies\ncontrol over 93 percent of Anbang’s shares, while two government-owned\ncompanies own the remainder.Had Anbang won Starwood, its deal would have been\nthe biggest takeover of an American target by a Chinese buyer, according to\ndata from Dealogic.Yet from the time Anbang publicly bid for the hotel chain,\ninvestors and analysts questioned whether the Chinese-led group could actually\nclose on its offer.Anbang sought to break up Starwood’s first deal with\nMarriott by offering $76 a share in cash, going up to $78 a share, a proposal\nthat people briefed on the discussions said was fully documented, meaning the\nfinancing was in place.Marriott countered with a new cash-and-stock proposal\non March 21 valued then at $79.53 a share, raising the prospect that the\nChinese-led group would come back with an even higher bid.Anbang and its\npartners indeed responded, by offering $81 a share and then $82.75 a share in\ncash. But the latest offer, which came last weekend, seemed on shakier grounds\nwith its financing, according to people briefed on the matter.Analysts said\nthat Marriott would be hard-pressed to beat that price, since doing so could\nhurt its earnings per share.But Marriott publicly questioned whether Anbang\nand its partners truly had the financing needed to close their offer, as well\nas how long American government regulators would take to bless the\ndeal.Another particular concern was whether a government panel focused on the\nnational security aspects of mergers would require selling off Starwood\nproperties near sensitive locations. The St. Regis Washington D.C., for\nexample, is only blocks away from the White House, while a W hotel is near the\nTreasury Department.Starwood and its advisers pressed the consortium for more\ninformation about financing and whether the Chinese government would bless the\nnew proposal, these people said, requesting anonymity to discuss confidential\nnegotiations.People involved in the transaction spoke on the condition of\nanonymity.Publicly, Starwood noted on March 28 that while its board had\ndetermined that Anbang’s second bid was “reasonably likely to lead to a\n‘superior proposal,’” the new proposal was nonbinding and that the two sides\nneeded to hammer out “nonprice terms.”The hotelier had been waiting several\ndays for a response from the Chinese-led group when word first began to filter\nin early Thursday that Anbang and its partners were preparing to walk away,\naccording to the people briefed on the matter.Then around midafternoon on\nThursday, Anbang’s consortium sent Starwood’s board a letter thanking them for\ntheir work but stating that it needed to walk away for unspecified market\nreasons.No further reason was given.\n\n","title":"Starwood Bidding War Ends Abruptly, Yielding a Merger and a Puzzle - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Marriott is said to have won a bid for the rival Starwood Hotels after a Chinese-led consortium backed out https://t.co/GBkqgVa4SI","date":"Thu Mar 31 22:07:02 +0000 2016","favs":117,"id":{"$numberLong":"715661708258357248"},"retweets":95},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25za9Fw"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01448"},"content":"A new round of testing has found high levels of lead in water at more schools\nin Newark, including at least two charter schools, according to results the\nschool district released on Thursday.Nearly a quarter of the water samples\ncollected in the school buildings tested last week had lead concentrations\nabove 15 parts per billion, which is the federal Environmental Protection\nAgency’s threshold for taking action. The Newark school district said on\nThursday that 76 of the 324 samples were above that agency’s action level, but\nthat only 16 — or about 5 percent — came from water fountains or other sources\nof drinking water.Ten of the 16 sources of tainted drinking water were in a\nbuilding that houses Newark Legacy Charter School, which enrolls children from\nkindergarten through eighth grade, the new data show. A building that houses\nthe Paulo Freire Charter School had 12 samples over the federal limit, but\nonly one came from a drinking fountain.In some instances, the samples of\ndrinking water from the charter schools had concentrations of lead more than\n10 times the federal threshold.The other tainted samples came from sinks used\nfor cleaning or washing hands, which experts say are not cause for as much\nconcern.Ingesting lead can be especially dangerous for young children and can\naffect their behavior and ability to learn.The Newark school district hired\nseveral water-testing labs to collect samples from every source of water for\ndrinking or cooking in every school building, after the district said on March\n9 that an annual program of spot testing had found high levels of lead in some\nschools.The district superintendent, Christopher Cerf, ordered that all water\nfountains and kitchen faucets be shut off in 30 schools where at least one in\n10 samples showed lead levels above the federal threshold. The district is now\nhaving hundreds of other sources of water in its buildings tested and has\noffered to test children’s blood for signs of lead poisoning. The blood-\ntesting results have not been made public.The results released on Thursday\ncame from eight buildings that were not included in the annual sampling of\nwater that the district has voluntarily conducted for over a decade. They\ninclude transportation hubs and athletic facilities, as well as the two\ncharter schools. District officials offered the leaders of those schools the\noption of switching to bottled water after high lead levels were discovered in\nother city schools.Last week, after seeing the first results of the tests, the\nofficials ordered the charter schools not to use their drinking fountains. Ken\nSchultz, the executive director of Newark Legacy, said the school had hired\nits own environmental consultant to check the water but the results did not\nmatch the district’s. Now, he said, the school plans to continue using bottled\nwater until it can obtain reverse-osmosis water coolers.The newly released\ndata are from the first of three sets of additional tests ordered after the\ndiscovery of elevated lead in the district. The next group of tests will be\nconducted in the 30 schools where fountains have been turned off, with samples\ntaken from every fountain and tap. After that, the water in the remaining 37\nschools will be retested.Mr. Cerf, who was appointed superintendent in July by\nthe state, which controls the schools in Newark, said drinking water would be\ncut off in any school where at least a fifth of sources showed lead above the\nfederal limit. Elsewhere, he said, individual sources that tested above the\nthreshold would be turned off until the problem could be resolved.“We’re going\nto make sure that the use points are not accessible,” Mr. Cerf said in an\ninterview this week. “We will shut it off until it is remediated.”The district\nhas released results of annual tests going back to 2012. In each year, the\nsampling found high levels of lead in water coming from various fountains and\nfaucets in different schools.Mr. Cerf said he did not know why his\npredecessors had not responded as forcefully as he did. But he said the water\ncrisis in Flint, Mich., had focused national attention on the peril posed by\nlead in drinking water.“I am hopeful that, whether by design or not, that this\nhas been a catalyzing event,” he said. “I don’t think there’s any question but\nthat legislative leaders — state and federal — need to treat this as a wake-up\ncall.”\n\n","title":"High Lead Levels Found at More Newark Schools - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"New testing at Newark schools, including charters, found unsafe lead levels in nearly a quarter of samples https://t.co/aEApb1hSsE","date":"Thu Mar 31 21:56:45 +0000 2016","favs":104,"id":{"$numberLong":"715659122771931136"},"retweets":207},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22SWyu2"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01449"},"content":"WASHINGTON — President Obama gathered more than 50 world leaders here on\nThursday to discuss one of his favorite topics: locking down nuclear weapons.\nBut it was Mr. Obama’s meeting with one of the less friendly of those leaders,\nPresident Xi Jinping of China, that captured most of the attention.The leaders\nannounced that the United States and China would sign a climate change accord\nlater in April, a show of unity on an issue that has become a bright spot in\nthe tangled relationship between the two countries. But they quickly moved on\nto more contentious issues, with Mr. Obama pressing Mr. Xi on China’s\nconstruction of military facilities in the South China Sea, actions that a\nWhite House official said belied a pledge the Chinese president had made last\nfall not to militarize those waters.“Like China and other countries, the\nUnited States has significant interests in the Asia-Pacific region,” Mr. Obama\nsaid to Mr. Xi before the meeting, his only extended encounter with a visiting\nleader at the Nuclear Security Summit, which will conclude on Friday.“Our two\ncountries have some disputes and disagreements,” Mr. Xi replied. He called for\nboth sides to “avoid misunderstanding and misperceptions,” and to respect each\nother’s core interests — a polite warning not to meddle in the South China\nSea, which Beijing regards as a core interest.China’s neighbors dispute its\nclaims to reefs and shoals, and fear that it is colonizing one of the world’s\nmost strategic waterways. The United States has dispatched Navy ships to\nguarantee that the sea lanes remain unobstructed, but that has raised the risk\nof a confrontation with Chinese warships.During a visit to Washington in\nSeptember, Mr. Xi declared that China would not “pursue militarization” of the\nSouth China Sea. But since then, it has installed surface-to-air missile\nbatteries and military radar on reefs and newly reclaimed islands hundreds of\nmiles from the Chinese mainland.“We have seen developments and reports that\nare not consistent with the commitment not to militarize the South China Sea,”\nsaid Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser.Mr. Xi and Mr.\nObama found more common ground on confronting the nuclear threat posed by\nNorth Korea. China supported a new round of United Nations sanctions against\nthe Pyongyang government after it tested a nuclear device and fired ballistic\nmissiles.To reassure America’s allies in the face of their rogue neighbor, Mr.\nObama also met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and South Korea’s\npresident, Park Geun-hye.Those countries were thrust into the American\npolitical campaign in recent days after the Republican front-runner, Donald J.\nTrump, proposed they acquire nuclear weapons to deter the threat from North\nKorea. A senior Japanese official quickly reaffirmed Japan’s commitment to\nremain nuclear-free.Mr. Trump’s comments did not come up in the three-way\nmeeting with Mr. Obama, according to American officials. But Mr. Rhodes issued\na withering response to the proposal, saying it would undercut decades of\nnonproliferation policy.“It would be catastrophic were the United States to\nshift its position and indicate that we somehow support the proliferation of\nnuclear weapons,” he said.“The entire premise of American foreign policy as it\nrelates to nuclear weapons for the last 70 years has been focused on\npreventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons,” he continued. “That has been\nthe position of bipartisan administrations, of everybody who has occupied the\nOval Office.”Domestic politics and regional concerns both seemed to crowd out\nany discussion of global efforts to secure nuclear materials. And for all the\nhubbub — the intense security; the motorcades snarling traffic in downtown\nWashington — the meeting opened on a subdued note.Russia’s president, Vladimir\nV. Putin, was a no-show, which made breakthroughs on security unlikely, given\nhis country’s vast nuclear stockpile. The terrorist attack in Belgium last\nweek also cast a shadow over the gathering, particularly after reports that\nfighters for the Islamic State were seeking to penetrate a nuclear facility to\nobtain material for a so-called radioactive dirty bomb.Mr. Obama has added a\nsession to discuss the campaign against the Islamic State, in which the\nadministration continues to claim gains. He met on Thursday with President\nFrançois Hollande of France, his only one-on-one session with a leader aside\nfrom Mr. Xi. Mr. Obama praised Mr. Hollande for “galvanizing the European\ncommunity” in the fight against terrorism.The president’s refusal to meet with\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey roiled the diplomatic waters,\nsuggesting that Mr. Obama was displeased with Mr. Erdogan’s authoritarian\nbent. But the White House said Mr. Obama met briefly with him on Thursday\nevening.Mr. Putin’s snub was not unexpected, given the rift between Russia and\nthe United States over Syria and Ukraine. But the White House pointed out that\nRussia has nevertheless cooperated on nuclear issues, not least its role in\nthe talks with Iran over curbing its nuclear program. (Iran was not invited to\nattend the summit meeting.)“You want Russia at the table on issues of nuclear\nsecurity,” Mr. Rhodes said. “They only isolate themselves by not attending\nsummits like this.”This was the fourth and final Nuclear Security Summit of\nMr. Obama’s presidency, and with Mr. Obama — who conceived and championed\nthese meetings — leaving office next year, several experts said this was\nlikely to be the last.When Mr. Obama departs in January, it is not clear who\nwill keep the momentum going. While the Democratic front-runner, Hillary\nClinton, supports Mr. Obama’s nonproliferation policies, she has evinced\nlittle of his fervor for a nuclear-free world.But as the leaders arrived for a\ndinner at the White House past an honor guard lined up along the South Lawn,\nMr. Obama could claim one achievement: An amendment to a treaty that stiffens\nstandards for protecting nuclear materials was signed by 102 nations.The\noriginal protection agreement dates to 1987, but it has long been considered\nweak. The amendment, proposed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, specifies\nminimum requirements for physical protection of civilian nuclear stocks, and\nfor securing them when they are transported.As part of an effort to be more\nopen about its nuclear inventory, the United States announced that its\nstockpile of highly enriched uranium declined 20 percent, to 585.6 metric tons\nin 2013 from 740.7 metric tons in 1996. The decline was modest, but it was the\nfirst time in 15 years that the government released these numbers.A senior\nadministration official, who declined to speak on the record ahead of the\npresident’s announcement, said that the amendments to the physical protection\nagreement are “the closest thing we have to legally binding standards for\nnuclear security.”\n\n","title":"As Obama Hosts Nuclear Security Summit, the Focus Is on China - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"World leaders met to try to reduce the threat from nuclear weapons.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0144a"},"content":"Ben Platt is bent at the waist, his face reddening as his head nears his white\nConverse All-Stars, while his voice teacher thumps him on the back with a\nsquishy blue ball.It’s nearly noon, but Mr. Platt, the 22-year-old star of the\nnew musical “Dear Evan Hansen,” hasn’t used his voice much yet (did that bit\nof singing in the shower count?), and his vocal coach, Liz Caplan, is worried\nthat the scrunched-up posture of his high-anxiety character is tempering his\ntenor.So he’s opening everything up: inhaling peppermint oil, making a wing\nformation with his hands around his larynx, working his tongue around his\nteeth. He drinks water, bites down on his pinkie, makes a snoring sound,\nswivels his hips. He drinks more water. And, puh-kee, ee, ee, ooh, wah, he\nworks his voice up the musical scale, until, ultimately, he finds his lost\nfalsetto.The rituals are familiar to Mr. Platt. He’s already been in films\n(including as Benji, the singing, sideburned, magic-obsessed dork in the smash\n“Pitch Perfect” films) and on Broadway. And he grew up with an up-close view\nof the entertainment industry: His father is one of the lead producers of\n“Wicked.”Mr. Platt has already done enough musicals to make a revue. He\nstarted at 6, as the prince in an amateur “Cinderella,” and has not stopped —\nWinthrop in “The Music Man,” Patrick in “Mame,” the Baker in “Into the Woods,”\nStine in “City of Angels,” Pippin in, well, “Pippin.” He has starred in “Guys\nand Dolls” four times, three as Sky Masterson (once in Hebrew) and one as\nNathan Detroit.When he was just 11, he played Noah in the national tour of\n“Caroline, or Change,” and his performance as Elder Cunningham in the Chicago\nproduction of “The Book of Mormon” was so distinctive that he was snagged for\nthe Broadway cast. (“Sensational,” declared Ben Brantley in The New York\nTimes. A “true revelation,” said Chris Jones in The Chicago Tribune.)Now Mr.\nPlatt is poised for a different kind of breakthrough. For the first time, he\nis originating a stage role, as the title character in “Dear Evan Hansen,” a\ndarkly poignant show about an awkward high school student whose social\nstanding is transformed by a mushrooming lie. The musical is in previews Off\nBroadway, at Second Stage, where it is scheduled to open May 1; its backers\nhope that next season it will make the leap to Broadway.The show has a\npromising creative team: The director is Michael Greif, who directed “Rent”\nand “Next to Normal” on Broadway, and the music and lyrics are by Benj Pasek\nand Justin Paul, a young, already Tony-nominated songwriting pair. But the\nstory deals with themes that could make it a tough sell in the commercial\nmarketplace: bullying, teenage suicide and the perils of social media.The\nchallenge for Mr. Platt is in making sympathetic a protagonist who exploits a\nfamily’s grief to bolster his own popularity. It is a challenge that, by early\naccounts, Mr. Platt has met: During a pre-New York production, at Arena Stage,\nThe Washington Post critic Peter Marks called his performance “an achievement\nbordering on heroic.”In the show, Mr. Platt delivers a master class in the\nphysicalization of adolescent discomfort. He twitches his eyes and his mouth,\ntugs on his sleeve, scratches a wrist, picks at a nail, grabs his back\npockets, fidgets with a pencil. His voice is halting and soft, punctuated with\ndoubt.His character was developed through trial and error — many of the verbal\ntics were scripted by the book writer, Steven Levenson, while the physical\ngestures were honed by Mr. Platt in rehearsal.“I thought back to a lot of kids\nin my high school who I think of as more socially awkward, or anxious, or\nworried about how they’re being perceived,” Mr. Platt said over mint tea after\nwrapping up his recent voice lesson. “They are similar to Evan in the way that\nthey would carry themselves, or sit at lunch tables, and walk around school\nwith their heads down looking at their feet and blinking.”He has transformed\nhis physique for the role, dropping 35 pounds from his Elder Cunningham body\nby eliminating dairy and gluten from his diet. “I’d never want to make myself\nunhealthy in any way for a role, but I also felt like he’s not a kid that can\nstand to eat very much,” he said.Mr. Platt has been with the show since its\nfirst reading, nearly two years ago, and he has shaped the character, and it\nhas shaped him, in ways that are now difficult to disentangle. Even out of\ncharacter, he tugs on his sleeves and toys with a jacket zipper.“At first I\nfelt very separate from most of the things I endowed Evan with, but now that\nI’ve lived with him for so long, it’s kind of bled through,” Mr. Platt\nsaid.But he says Evan’s social anxiety is significantly more pronounced than\nhis own.“I have had a struggle with anxiety, always, and as a proud Jew,\nthat’s not a surprising thing,” he said. “But I don’t think I have as much\ntrouble as he does connecting with people generally — I think I’m pretty good\nat that, and that’s his biggest challenge.”The Platt family — Ben is the\nfourth of five children — takes its musical theater so seriously that friends\nsometimes refer to the “Von Platt family singers” (an allusion to the Von\nTrapps of “The Sound of Music”). The family lives in Los Angeles, and at key\nmilestones, they perform adapted show tunes in honor of the celebrants; at\nBen’s bar mitzvah, the family performed a rewritten version of a number from\nStephen Sondheim and George Furth’s “Company.” (“Another Hundred People”\nbecame “Another Hundred Playbills.”)“Most kids, when they’re young, want\ncomputer games and Power Rangers and Ninja Turtles,” Ben’s father, Marc Platt,\nsaid in a telephone interview. “Ben always wanted a clip-on microphone, so he\ncould perform in the backyard, and one year he wanted a fog machine.”Growing\nup as Marc Platt’s son provided Ben with obvious advantages (as well as\nintimate knowledge of “Wicked” — he’s seen the musical 27 times, and can sing\nevery track; his brother, Jonah, is now playing Fiyero in the show’s Broadway\ncast). But it has also given Ben something to prove.“We’ve done as best a job\nas we can making it clear that I’m earning what I’m earning because of me, and\nnot because of who my father is,” Ben Platt said. “But at the same time, I’m\nnot ignoring things that would be dumb to ignore, like people that I can know\nthrough him, and experiences I can have through him, and things that I can\nlearn from him.”His role in “Dear Evan Hansen” began with a series of\nfortuitous rejections. When he was 16, he auditioned for the role of Henry, a\nhigh school student, in “Next to Normal,” and when he was 18, he auditioned\nfor the role of Bernstein, a young Marine, in “Dogfight.”He was deemed too\nyoung for either part, but the director of “Normal,” Mr. Greif, and the\nwriters of “Dogfight,” Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul, were impressed by Mr. Platt’s\ncombination of strong voice, comic timing and emotional intelligence.“I had\nnever seen anything quite like it with someone that young — I didn’t know who\nthis person was, but I knew he was going to be someone,” Mr. Paul recalled.\nMr. Pasek was so struck that, after rejecting Mr. Platt for the role, he\nreached out to him on Facebook, thinking “we have to work with this actor.”In\nthe meantime, Mr. Platt had finished high school (Harvard-Westlake, a prep\nschool in Los Angeles) and had been admitted to college (Columbia University).\nBut a few weeks before the start of his freshman year, he was offered the role\nin “Pitch Perfect.” (“I’d never really played the nerdier, outcastier,\nmarginalized guy before, but I really liked the character and I wanted to try\nmy hand at it.”) Instead of moving to New York, he headed to Baton Rouge, La.,\nwhere the film, a comedy about college a cappella competitions, was shot.“He\nreally just felt like he was in that exact place between being a boy and being\na man — ‘Pitch Perfect’ was about that transitional time in people’s lives,\nand he completely embodied that,” said Elizabeth Banks, who produced and\nperformed in the film (and directed the sequel, also featuring Mr. Platt).\n“He’s very lovable — he’s like a little brother that you don’t mind having\naround.”In the fall of 2012, Mr. Platt began his studies at Columbia. But he\nonly lasted six weeks before being cast in the Chicago company of “Mormon.”\nThat was the end of his college career (at least for now — his parents, while\nfully supportive of his acting career, also still hope he’ll find a way to\npursue an education).Then came Evan Hansen. Inspired in part by the death of a\nstudent at Mr. Pasek’s high school, the composers had been exploring the idea\nof a musical about how collective grief plays out in the era of social media.\nA producer, Stacey Mindich, introduced them to Mr. Levenson, who wrote the\nmusical’s book. And in 2014 they called Mr. Platt for a reading; he has been\nbound up with the character since, so much that dialogue and songs have been\nwritten for his voice.By now, actor and character are almost like friends.“He\nhas the fears that all of us are afraid to talk about,” he said. “He’s a brave\nkid, and he does what he thinks is best. Sometimes he’s selfish, but we can\nall be selfish sometimes. I just like how imperfect he is.”\n\n","title":"Ben Platt, From ‘Pitch Perfect’ to an Anxious Teen on Stage - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @MichaelPaulson: Who is @BenSPLATT?

Any\ntwo teams but those. Any.The organization must be cringing because while a Tar\nHeels-Orange national semifinal features two classic programs in a classic\nmatchup, it also guarantees that an unwanted guest — academic fraud — will be\nfront and center on its biggest stage.Is that unfair? Probably, for this\nyear’s teams.After all, the North Carolina players, led by their a cademic a\nll-American, Marcus Paige, were not involved in the biggest academic scandal\nin their university’s history. That story continues to unfold at North\nCarolina’s muddied feet, but essentially it is this: Over an 18-year period,\nending in 2011, Tar Heels athletes in revenue sports were steered to bogus\nclasses for which they earned grades that were artificially high so those\nplayers could meet eligibility requirements.As punishment for those sins, the\nN.C.A.A. could impose penalties on North Carolina any time it’s ready. Well,\nany time but during Final Four week, at least.Rest assured, that announcement\nwill come much later, after the confetti falls. What’s another few days or\nweeks when it has taken the N.C.A.A.’s investigative team years to figure out\nthat some North Carolina athletes were taking courses that didn’t really\nexist?In reality, that slow-motion timeline is par for the N.C.A.A. course. It\ntook the organization eight  years to determine that the Syracuse men’s\nbasketball program had broken a whole other set of rules. The Orange spent so\nmuch time waiting for the other sneaker to drop that they flagellated\nthemselves before the N.C.A.A. could do it, pre-emptively barring themselves\nfrom the postseason last year before any ruling was handed down.Coach Jim\nBoeheim said his current players “weren’t involved in anything” regarding\nSyracuse’s past academic misconduct, its drug-policy violations and its doling\nout of improper benefits. For those broken rules, the basketball program\nforfeited more than $1 million in postseason revenue, lost scholarships\n(although it won one back per year on appeal) and had its off-campus\nrecruiting privileges limited. Boeheim was suspended for nine games and docked\n101 victories.Those penalties affected Syracuse so deeply that it took only\none season for it to return to the Final Four. So much for the lesson that\nN.C.A.A. violations don’t pay.In waiting on a punishment, North Carolina is\nsurely hoping it is similarly short term.But the truly unfair part is what it\nmeans for the current Tar Heels players. Just as they should be celebrating,\nand being celebrated, for a great season, they are under a shadow that’s not\nof their own making.Paige Ladisic, the editor in chief of The Daily Tar Heel,\ntold me Tuesday that most students on campus were thrilled for the basketball\nteam but that the looming N.C.A.A. sanctions were threatening to ruin the\nparty.“We feel a little conflicted here,” she said.People back home in Oak\nIsland, N.C., and elsewhere who know that she attends North Carolina have\njoked with her, asking if she has taken any fake classes, she said. But it’s\nnot funny, and should be an embarrassment to all students and alumni, that for\nnearly two decades the university offered classes that were a sham.“It does\nkind of hurt a little because this whole thing could have been resolved\nalready,” Ladisic said. She explained that, as a journalist, she saw the\nbenefit of the N.C.A.A.’s taking its time to get things right. But as a\nbasketball fan, she said, she wished the N.C.A.A. would have hurried up and\nsanctioned North Carolina already so the program and its players could move\non, the way Syracuse did.On a conference call Monday, Boeheim bristled when a\nreporter asked him how hard it was to run “a clean team” and be successful at\nthe same time.“There’s certain words that I object to,” Boeheim said. “\n‘Clean’ is one of them. Things can happen in a program. That doesn’t mean\nsomething’s dirty.”His North Carolina counterpart, Roy Williams, keeps saying\nhow happy he is that basketball hasn’t been implicated in the university’s\nscandal.“I’m very proud of the fact that we have no allegations against\nbasketball,” he said again this week. “I like that part.”But the fact is,\nbasketball players were among the first North Carolina players to take the\nphantom classes. That’s the truth, even if Williams seems to want to keep\ntweaking it.“To say they’re not involved, I just don’t know how you get\nthere,” said Dan Kane, the Raleigh News \u0026amp; Observer reporter who helped\nbreak the academic scandal story. Kane, who continues to cover the story, took\npains to note that he had no position on North Carolina’s eventual punishment\nor its presence in this year’s tournament.It is clear how college basketball\nhas gotten here, though. These aren’t two aberrations, two programs that have\ndone bad things in a clean, unbroken system. If two of the country’s best\nteams have these dirty pasts — apologies, Coach Boeheim, for use of the word —\nwhat is the deterrent for others not to follow their lead?In the back of their\nmind, N.C.A.A. officials probably worry about that, too.\n\n","title":"In an Unfortunate Final Four Matchup, No Lessons Learned - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @JulietMacur: Spot-on comment from reader: \"Whoever said, 'Cheaters never prosper' knew absolutely nothing about NCAA basketball.\" https…","date":"Thu Mar 31 19:50:06 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715627250322948097"},"retweets":50},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/232Cj9H"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0144c"},"content":"Imre Kertesz, a Nobel laureate who was acclaimed for his semi-autobiographical\nnovels on surviving the Holocaust and its aftermath, died on Thursday at his\nhome in Budapest. He was 86.His death was confirmed by Krisztian Nyary, the\nhead of Magveto Publishing, which publishes Mr. Kertesz’s works in his native\nHungary. Mr. Nyary said Mr. Kertesz had been struggling with a chronic\nillness.What set Mr. Kertesz apart from other writers on the Holocaust was his\ninsistence on describing the death camps at Auschwitz and Buchenwald without\noutrage, especially in his definitive work, “Fateless,” first published in\n1975.“The novel uses the alienating device of taking the reality of the camp\ncompletely for granted, an everyday existence like any other,” the Swedish\nNobel committee said in awarding him its 2002 prize in literature.Mr. Kertesz\nseemed dumbfounded by his Nobel Prize, which came after he had spent decades\nin near anonymity, even in Hungary. He had a small but intensely loyal\nfollowing in Germany, France and Scandinavia, but only two of his novels,\n“Fateless” and “Kaddish for an Unborn Child” (1990), had been published in\nEnglish when he received the award.Imre Kertesz (roughly pronounced EEM-er-eh\nCARE-tiss) was born in Budapest on Nov. 9, 1929, to secular Jewish parents and\ngrew up as a nonobservant Jew. His death camp internment, however, “obliged me\nto be Jewish,” he said in a 2001 interview with the Spanish newspaper El\nPaís.“I accept it,” he added, “but to a large extent it is also true that it\nwas imposed on me.”While Mr. Kertesz urged readers and critics not to assume\nthat the events recounted in “Fateless” were autobiographical, the novel\ncontains strong parallels to his own experiences. At age 14, on his way to\nschool, he was — like Gyuri Koves, the teenage protagonist of “Fateless’’ —\ncaught in a Hungarian police dragnet in 1944 and deported along with thousands\nof other Budapest Jews, first to Auschwitz and then to Buchenwald.Following\nthe advice of older camp inmates, the young Kertesz, also like the fictional\nKoves, claimed to be a 16-year-old worker rather than a student. That made him\nold enough to qualify for forced labor, saving him from immediate\nextermination as a child.A macabre reminder of this successful ruse surfaced\nwhen Mr. Kertész was preparing his Nobel acceptance speech. He received a\nlarge brown envelope in the mail from the director of the Buchenwald Memorial\nCenter. Enclosed, besides a congratulatory note, was a routine report,\ncompiled by the Buchenwald camp authorities and dated Feb. 18, 1945, listing\nthe names of inmates who had died that day. One notation read: “Imre Kertesz,\nfactory worker, born in 1927.”“In short,” Mr. Kertész said in his Nobel\nspeech, “I died once, so I could live.”When the United States Army liberated\nBuchenwald in May 1945, several American soldiers urged Mr. Kertesz to\nemigrate to the United States. But he declined. “I couldn’t imagine going\nanywhere except home,” he told The New York Times in 2006. “I was like a stray\ndog.”Mr. Kertesz returned to a country that was under Soviet occupation and\nrising Communist influence. He began working as a journalist for a Budapest\nnewspaper but was fired in 1951, two years after the Communists seized power\nin Hungary, because he refused to lionize the new regime.He then became a\ntranslator of German-language authors, including Nietzche, Freud and\nWittgenstein, but lost this income source when he decided to write fiction. “I\ncould not take up a career as a novelist because I would be considered\nunemployed and sent to a labor camp,” he said in a 2005 interview with\nSmithsonian magazine. “Instead, I became a blue-collar laborer and wrote at\nnight.”Mr. Kertesz took 13 years to complete “Fateless,” his first novel, in\n1965, but it was not published until a decade later. (A new English\ntranslation was published in 2004 as “Fatelessness.”) While it received\nattention in West Germany, it was virtually ignored in Hungary.More nuanced —\nand for that reason often more disturbing — than previous Holocaust\nliterature, “Fateless” describes a concentration camp atmosphere in which\ninmates are shockingly detached and complacent, preoccupied with resolving\npractical problems rather than venting anger or plotting resistance.“I\nexperienced my most radical moments of happiness in the concentration camp,”\nMr. Kertesz said in a 2002 interview with Newsweek. “You cannot imagine what\nit’s like to be allowed to lie in the camp’s hospital, or to have a 10-minute\nbreak from indescribable labor. To be very close to death is also a kind of\nhappiness. Just surviving becomes the greatest freedom of all.”In “Kaddish for\nan Unborn Child,” Mr. Kertesz continued his semi-autobiograpical reflections\non the impact of the death camps on his life.“Auschwitz has been hanging\naround in the air since long ago,” he wrote (as translated by Tim Wilkinson),\n“who knows, perhaps for centuries, like dark fruit ripening in the sparkling\nrays of innumerable disgraces, waiting for the moment when it may at last drop\non mankind’s head.”The novel is addressed to the child the narrator refused to\nhave because “what happened to me, my childhood, must never happen to another\nchild.”In “Liquidation” (2003), his first novel published after the Nobel\nceremony, a Budapest book publisher and editor seeks the lost masterpiece of a\nman, identified only as B., who, like Mr. Kertesz, was a writer, translator\nand Holocaust survivor, and who committed suicide. The novel revealed a warm,\nsensual side largely absent from the rest of Mr. Kertesz’s work.In a vignette\nin Budapest’s cavernous Central Market Hall, B. waits his turn to buy\nvegetables. His former lover, Sarah, shopping nearby, sees him with his hands\nclasped behind his back. “She sneaked up behind him and suddenly slipped her\nhand into B.’s open palm,” Mr. Kertesz wrote. “Instead of turning around (as\nSarah had intended), B. had folded the woman’s hand tenderly, like an\nunexpected secret gift, in his warm, bare hand, and Sarah had felt a sudden\nthrill of passion from that grip.”Reviewing “Liquidation” in The New York\nTimes Book Review in 2004, the critic Ruth Franklin wrote, “Not since Kafka\nand Beckett … has a writer packed so much metaphysics into so tight a\nspace.”From the 1990s until his death, Mr. Kertesz divided his time between\nBudapest and Berlin, where he had resumed making a living as a translator\nbefore achieving literary success. His second wife, Magda, who survives him,\nis Hungarian but lived in Chicago for 33 years and often served as his\ntranslator in interviews with the foreign press.A year after winning the Nobel\nPrize, Mr. Kertesz finally attained recognition in Hungary, with his books\nselling some 500,000 copies altogether — about one for every 20 Hungarians.\n“But at the same time, there were many protest letters from Hungarians to the\nNobel committee in Sweden,” he said. “Most objections were about my being\nJewish.”Literary recognition also led to the publication in English of three\nearlier novels. In “Detective Story” (1977), rather than take the victim’s\npoint of view, Mr. Kertesz recounts the prison confessions of a secret police\ntorturer. “The Pathseeker” (1977) tells the story of an unnamed “commissioner”\nin an unnamed Central European country who interrogates inhabitants of a\ncommunity with no clear purpose except to seed terror. “The Union Jack” (1991)\nrevolves around an incident linked to a British flag during the failed 1956\nHungarian uprising against Communist rule.But all his novels, Mr. Kertesz\nacknowledged, were inspired either directly or indirectly by the insanities\nand cruelties of the concentration camps.“It is often said of me — some intend\nit as a compliment, others as a complaint — that I write about a single\nsubject: the Holocaust,” he said in his Nobel acceptance speech. “What I\ndiscovered in Auschwitz is the human condition, the end point of a great\nadventure, where the European traveler arrived after his 2,000-year-old moral\nand cultural history.”\n\n","title":"Imre Kertesz, Nobel Laureate Who Survived Holocaust, Dies at 86 - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The NYT obituary for Imre Kertesz, a Nobel Laureate who survived the Holocaust https://t.co/SodZUe1RAw https://t.co/J1Xa2QLQSV","date":"Thu Mar 31 19:40:07 +0000 2016","favs":166,"id":{"$numberLong":"715624736487776256"},"retweets":119},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25ySSfJ"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0144d"},"content":"LONDON — The suicide attacks at Brussels Airport have led to intensified\nscrutiny of hiring, security and the lack of standardized procedures at\nairports across Europe, amid questions about whether the bombings last week\ncould have been prevented.The head of the largest police union in Belgium\nwarned on Thursday of a serious security problem at Brussels Airport, citing\nsystematic security flaws, bureaucratic incompetence and the employment of\nbaggage handlers with criminal records.His remarks came as the airport police\nwrote an open letter, cited in several Belgian newspapers, expressing deep\nconcern about the level of security at the airport, echoing worries about\nprocedures, staffing and the potential for infiltration by terrorists at Paris\nCharles de Gaulle Airport after the deadly attacks in and near Paris in\nNovember.Since 2001, the European Union has adopted a uniform set of rules and\nprocedures for protecting the areas of any airport that are behind security\ncheckpoints. But the methods for safeguarding of areas accessible to the\ngeneral public are established at a national level and therefore vary among\nmember states.Vincent Gilles, president of SLFP Police, the largest police\nunion in Belgium, with 22,000 members, said in a telephone interview that he\nwas disturbed after hearing colleagues say that some baggage handlers had\napplauded the attacks in Paris that killed 130 people.“This is what I have\nheard from fellow police,” he said. “Obviously, one needs to be prudent and we\nare checking this out.”Mr. Gilles said there was a notable and worrying number\nof employees working at Brussels Airport in baggage handling and on the tarmac\nwho had criminal records, but he did not provide an estimate.Many of the\nterrorists involved in the Brussels and Paris attacks have links to the\npoorer, immigrant parts in the Belgian capital, and Mr. Gilles appeared to\ndraw a connection between those areas and the security of the airport. Mr.\nGilles suggested that the recruitment policy employed by the Brussels Airport\nCompany, which manages the facility, appeared to favor people from those\nareas.Anke Fransen, a Brussels Airport spokeswoman, said the company was aware\nof the various concerns raised by the police union but had no immediate\ncomment.The Brussels Airport Company said in a statement Thursday that it was\n“operationally ready” to reopen and that the Belgian Civil Aviation Authority\nhad granted approval for a partial restart of passenger flights. The\nauthorities had not made a formal decision on when they could resume, however,\nand there will be no flights before Friday evening, the statement\nsaid.Concerns about security and the potential risk of infiltration by radical\ngroups has been a concern at airports around Europe. In the days after the\nattacks in France, the police raided about 4,000 employee lockers at Charles\nde Gaulle, Europe’s second-largest airport, in search of evidence potentially\nlinking staff to the attackers or other Islamist groups.According to police\nand union officials, those searches yielded little more than a small cache of\nQurans and other Islamic literature. (The searches led to the dismissal of\nabout a dozen employees, who were found in possession of food or other goods\nstolen from airport vendors.)Nonetheless, the airport’s chief of police,\nPhilippe Riffaut, has used the threat of terrorism to justify a review of the\nroughly 87,000 airport employees who have badges giving them access to secure\nareas that include the tarmac, baggage handling and cargo storage.Those\nbadges, issued after a background check by the police, are normally renewed\nevery three to five years. Since January 2015, the police said, the badges of\nmore than 80 workers at Charles de Gaulle have been revoked for security\nreasons.In Brussels, Mr. Gilles said that while traffic at the airport had\nincreased tenfold over the past 15 years, his repeated requests to augment\nsecurity had been ignored. He said that was because the federal police, who\nare responsible for the airport, saw it as unnecessary and failed to send the\nrequest up the chain of command to the Interior Ministry.Mr. Gilles suggested\nthat bureaucratic entropy and a lack of responsibility among the political\nclass were undermining security at the airport.Belgium, a politically\nfragmented and linguistically divided country, has come under heavy criticism\nin recent days after a number of astonishing law enforcement and intelligence\nerrors leading up to the deadly attacks at the airport and the Maelbeek subway\nstation in Brussels.Mr. Gilles accused the Brussels Airport Company of placing\nan excessive focus on economic considerations, and he said a request made in\nDecember to install a security check outside the entrance to airport terminal\nhad been rebuffed.He said he was told that such a checkpoint would be too\nexpensive, and that company officials defended the decision by noting that no\nother airport in the European Union’s open-border Schengen Area had such\nsecurity measures.In the open letter by the airport police, as reported on\nThursday by Het Belang van Limburg, a Flemish newspaper, the officers said\nthey were not satisfied with security.They complained that employees of all\nranks had access throughout the airport, and that there were insufficient\nchecks on passengers before they entered the terminal to check in for\nflights.Mr. Gilles told RTL, the Belgian broadcaster, that the letter was not\na negotiating tactic but a cry for help, and that security workers had been\ncomplaining about conditions for more than a year.In the interview with RTL,\nhe said that fatigue among airport staff members extended to those involved in\ncounterterrorism. He said the police were enraged about the targeting of\nBrussels. “There is anger for not having prevented the attacks,” he said.\n\n","title":"Brussels Attacks Renew Criticism of Security at Europe’s Airports - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Head of Belgium's largest police union warns of a worrying number of Brussels Airport workers with criminal records https://t.co/3qFFSbWWxF","date":"Thu Mar 31 19:15:03 +0000 2016","favs":101,"id":{"$numberLong":"715618429861015554"},"retweets":152},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25yUupG"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0144e"},"content":"“The North Water,” Ian McGuire’s savage new novel about a 19th-century Arctic\nwhaling expedition, is a great white shark of a book — swift, terrifying,\nrelentless and unstoppable.It is also as epically bloody as a Jacobean drama\nor a Cormac McCarthy novel. One man has his head bashed with a brick, and\n“there is a fine spray of blood and a noise like a wet stick snapping.”\nAnother is bludgeoned with a piece of whalebone. A sailor is nearly\ndecapitated with a saw blade. Two boys are raped and murdered. Two Eskimo\nhunters are killed while they sleep. And an oarsman’s arm is ripped off by a\npolar bear.These events are described in gruesome detail worthy of a horror\nmovie, as is the slaughter of whales and seals — shot, harpooned, clubbed,\ngutted and cut into oozing, greasy pieces. All of which is served up to us not\njust with gory visuals, but with sick-making sounds and smells too.Mr. McGuire\nis not reveling in such Sweeney Todd splatter effects simply to be\nsensational; rather, he puts them in the service of a Hobbesian view of life\nas nasty, brutish and short, and plagued by fear and violent death. His vision\nand his story owe a lot to Mr. McCarthy’s operatic masterpiece “Blood\nMeridian,” and his villain Henry Drax often comes across as a combination of\nthe demonic Judge Holden in “Meridian” and the sadistic bully Wolf Larsen in\nJack London’s 1904 classic, “The Sea-Wolf.”Drax is a monster, perhaps the\nDevil himself, who “grasps on to the world like a dog biting into bone —\nnothing is obscure to him, nothing is separate from his fierce and sullen\nappetites.” He is an unrepentant killer who asserts that “the law is just a\nname they give to what a certain kind of men prefer.”These are only the most\nobvious influences on “The North Water” — the tip of the iceberg, as it were.\nMr. McGuire, who is a founder and a director of the University of Manchester’s\nCenter for New Writing, in England, hasn’t written a postmodern or self-\nconsciously literary novel here; rather, he’s exhaled his knowledge of\nliterature into a gripping thriller that pulses with echoes of countless\nclassics, from Melville’s “Moby-Dick” (an ill-fated whaling expedition, a\nfascination with evil and the destructive element in nature and in man) to\nPoe’s “The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket” (a hallucinatory\njourney to the South Pole, where extremes of weather fuel existential\nquestions of identity and death).As for the novel’s hero and Drax’s chief\nadversary, Patrick Sumner, he’s clearly a descendant of Melville’s Ishmael and\nConrad’s Lord Jim. Like Jim, we learn, he is hiding a shameful secret from his\npast — which is how he’s ended up taking an ill-paying job as a whaling ship’s\ndoctor.In the hands of a less gifted writer, all this might have turned into a\nweak stew of borrowed plot points and motifs, but Mr. McGuire is such a\nnatural storyteller — and recounts his tale here with such authority and verve\n— that “The North Water” swiftly immerses the reader in a fully imagined\nworld. Though the novel is pockmarked with overly portentous teasers of the\naction to come, it is also genuinely suspenseful, its plot catapulting\ndangerously toward a fateful confrontation between Drax and Sumner.Sumner was\na surgeon with the British Army in India, ministering to wounded troops during\nthe bloody siege of Delhi, and to suppress his memories of what happened\nthere, he has become addicted to laudanum. He hopes that the whaling journey\nto the far reaches of the Arctic north will be an antidote to the heat and\nstench he remembers from India, that the voyage represents a second chance for\nhim. Instead, he finds himself sucked into yet another maelstrom of violence\nand betrayal and depravity.The beastly Drax — who has ferreted out the truth\nof what happened to Sumner in India — is not the only one aboard the whaler\nVolunteer who is up to no good. The captain, Brownlee, who lost his last ship\n(“crushed to matchwood by a berg” — “eight men drownded and 10 more perished\nof the cold”), seems to be involved in some kind of insurance scam with the\nship’s owner. And the surly first mate, Cavendish, appears to be in cahoots\nwith Drax, plotting to steal Sumner’s most cherished possession, a ring that\nis a token of his experiences and losses in India.Mr. McGuire nimbly folds all\nthese melodramatic developments into his story as it hurtles toward its\nconclusion. He has written an allusion-filled novel that still manages to feel\noriginal, a violent tale of struggle and survival in a cinematically beautiful\nlandscape reminiscent of the movie “The Revenant” but rendered with far more\nimmediacy and considerably less self-importance.\n\n","title":"Review: In ‘The North Water,’ a Journey to the Arctic Turns Cutthroat - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @michikokakutani: My review of \"The North Water\" - a harrowing literary thriller with echoes of Melville, Poe \u0026amp; Cormac McCCarthy: https:…","date":"Thu Mar 31 18:33:16 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715607912735965184"},"retweets":29},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/books/review-in-the-north-water-a-journey-to-the-arctic-turns-cutthroat.html"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0144f"},"content":"LOS ANGELES — In a midcareer self-portrait, Robert Mapplethorpe depicted\nhimself as a devil, with a bullwhip for a tail. But he ended up on the side of\nthe angels. In 1989, a traveling survey of his work, with pictures of extreme\nhomosexual acts, pushed the American culture wars into high gear. Religious\ngroups raged. An indignant Congress cut federal money to artists. The Corcoran\nGallery of Art in Washington, set to host the show, dropped it like a\nshot.Mapplethorpe knew nothing of any of this. He was three months dead of\nAIDS at 42. Yet he was present by proxy. After the show’s cancellation, anti-\ncensorship demonstrators gathered outside the Corcoran and projected his\nimages on its facade, including another self-portrait, this one of a leather-\nclad punk with a pompadour and a disdainful snarl. The crowd viewed the images\nin mournful silence. A new Mapplethorpe, Saint Robert, was born.A quarter-\ncentury later, canonization is complete. In Los Angeles, a doubleheader\nretrospective, “Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Medium,” is on view at both\nthe J. Paul Getty Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. A\ndocumentary film, “Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures,” will have its debut\nMonday on HBO. Rumor has it that a biopic is in the works. An artist once\nreviled as a pariah and embraced as a martyr has been thoroughly absorbed into\nmainstream. He’s now a classic, with auction prices to match. The question is,\nhow does the work, cleaned of the grit of controversy, hold up?Mapplethorpe\nhad his own ideas of what makes art valuable. One was its role as witness.\n“Art is an accurate statement of the time in which it is made,” he said. And\nthe Los Angeles survey is most persuasive when seen in that light, not as a\n“masterpiece” show — it runs into trouble there for me — but as a record of a\nradical personal and cultural history that retains some hint of what once made\nit provocative.Born in 1946, in Floral Park, Queens, Mapplethorpe grew up a\nwhite, middle-class Roman Catholic kid in the conservative, homophobic,\nracially divided America of the 1950s. And the 1960s, with its protests and\nliberations, remade him. He went to art school to study advertising, but\nswitched to painting and sculpture. He took drugs, dressed weird, and in 1969,\ndropped out to live in bohemian poverty with a girlfriend, the future poet and\nperformer Patti Smith. (Her award-winning 2010 memoir, “Just Kids,” is about\ntheir time together in New York.) A year later he took up with a man and\nclarified the erotic direction of his life.Eroticism, specifically\nhomoeroticism, was at the center of that life. You can see it dawning and\ncoalescing in work from the late 1960s and early 1970s, most of it unfamiliar,\ndrawn from the artist’s archives, jointly acquired in 2011 by the Getty and\nthe Los Angeles County Museum of Art, also known as Lacma. A series of\ncirca-1970 collages in the Lacma installation that combine geometric\nabstraction with clips from gay skin magazines are early evidence that\nMapplethorpe found modernist aesthetics and pornography completely compatible.\nArt was a turn-on in every sense.For an artist with ambitions for big-time\nsuccess in a still-closeted art world, this was an unusual direction to take,\nand Mapplethorpe took it even further. In 1971, he adopted photography as his\nprimary medium, a decision that coincided with his immersion in a subculture\nof sadomasochistic gay sex. That culture in the early 1970s became, for a\nwhile, a focus of his art, in images of homoerotic bondage and discipline,\nfetishism and anatomical penetration. (In his bullwhip-tail self-portrait, the\nwhip handle is inserted in his rectum.) He published those pictures in 1978 as\nthe “X Portfolio” — it’s on display at the Getty — and they are by far his\nmost subversive work.No other artist was doing anything like them, at least\nnot publicly. With their combination of startling content and formal care —\nbalanced compositions, sculptural lighting — they took photography across a\npolitical line that was very much part of that post-lib, pre-AIDS 1970s moment\nof gay baths, leather bars and straight swinger clubs, a line that more\nmarket-favored media like painting and sculpture had barely touched.Around the\ntime he was starting this series, Mapplethorpe’s fortunes changed. In 1972, he\nmet the curator and soon-to-be photography collector Samuel J. Wagstaff Jr.,\nwho became his lover, supporter and promoter. Wagstaff gave him a studio, an\nexpensive camera and uptown social connections, and encouraged him to\nprofessionalize his practice.Mapplethorpe hired expert printers. He perfected\nthe deluxe tonal style — soft white-grays, velvety darks — that became his\nbrand. He balanced his portfolio. Portraits of high-paying clientele were his\nbread and butter now, along with stylized floral still lifes, which people\nfound sexy but safe, and beautiful. A collaboration with the bodybuilder and\nperformance artist Lisa Lyon added an assertive female component to his male-\ndominant art, and was in line with then-popular notions of female empowerment.\n(“Wonder Woman” grabbed attention on TV.)Some memorable images emerged from\nall of this, but too many let style do the work of content. They pull you in\nbut leave your eyes sliding off the surface. The sight of Ms. Lyon pumping\niron is formidable and startling. But too many of her enactments of female\n“types” seem to be less about agency than about parody.The most interesting\n1980s work is a series of studio shots of black men, published under the title\n“Black Book” in 1986. Like the early sex pictures, they are the product of\nerotic fixation, Mapplethorpe’s late-blooming attraction to muscular black\nmales. And as a group, they generate a concentrated heat, but they also raise\nquestions about the exoticizing of racial blackness. The best-known image,\n“Man in a Polyester Suit,” encapsulates the problem: It’s a close-up of a\nblack penis emerging from an unzipped fly. No face, no name, no person, just\nan anatomical fragment that translates into race=sex.On the whole,\nMapplethorpe’s “Black Book” images, some of them portraits, don’t feel cynical\nor opportunistic. He had intimate and continuing personal relationships with\nseveral of his models, as he did with men in the sex pictures. But his view of\nthem is stuck in a time warp. It’s little different from the alternately\nclassicizing and primitivizing take on the black figure in photographs by the\nBoston artist F. Holland Day at the end of the 19th century.And how does that\nview of the black body — a body nude, invasively scrutinized, sexualized,\npacified, directed to sit, stand, be silent — come across in the present, when\nsome of the most visible black bodies are dead ones? In the America of Trayvon\nMartin, Michael Brown and Eric Garner, in the Los Angeles of Rodney King,\nMapplethorpe’s “Black Book” cannot, like so much of the rest of his art, be\nmainstreamed, seen coolly through an aesthetics-only lens.Nor can the “X\nPortfolio” be received neutrally; its contents, too, for somewhat different\nreasons, are hot. They probably don’t shock as they may once have. Time has\nseen to that. The Getty posts cautionary signs near its display of “X\nPortfolio” prints, but there’s nothing depicted in them that can’t be easily\nfound, accessible to all, on the Internet. Some of the potentially most\noffensive scenes turn up, uncensored, in the mild-mannered HBO film.Yet there\nare still places — this newspaper is among them — where these pictures are\nstill considered too transgressive for reproduction. Mapplethorpe is one of\nthe most popular photographers of the second half of the 20th century. His\nstylistic influence is widespread, particularly on advertising, a field he\nreturned to late in his career. He made news when a print of “Man in a\nPolyester Suit” sold for close to a half-million dollars at Sotheby’s last\nyear. But in many outlets, reports of the sale were published without a\nphoto.This refusal to show his art — this exercise of discretion, let’s call\nit — points to the most interesting thing about it, and about him: It\nreasserts his status as a radical. This is a crucial status for a gay artist\nto maintain at a time when “gay” is being domesticated and normalized, its\npotential for political resistance smoothed away.At one time, early on, in an\nentirely unsaintly way — “I’m not attempting to make a social statement,” he\nonce said — he challenged the sexual mores of his time, and ideas of what art\ncould and could not be. Much of his subsequent work will keep him popular: the\nflowers, the portraits, the beautiful bodies. But the pictures that kept him\nout of the Corcoran are the ones that will keep him in history.\n\n","title":"Why Mapplethorpe Still Matters - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Why Mapplethorpe matters: Because there are still places that refuse to reproduce his sexually charged photos https://t.co/XlKF89rA3P","date":"Thu Mar 31 18:15:03 +0000 2016","favs":178,"id":{"$numberLong":"715603326776307713"},"retweets":122},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SpwkVc"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01450"},"content":"Just when you thought Donald Trump couldn’t say anything more shocking, he\nsuggested that women who get abortions should be punished.On MSNBC, he said\nabortion must be banned and then “there has to be some form of punishment” for\nwomen who manage to get abortions.He declined to say what the punishment\nshould be, dodging a question about whether it should be “10 years” in prison\nor something milder. But his comment raised the possibility of following the\nlead of countries like El Salvador, where women can be dragged off from a\nhospital to prison for getting an abortion. Indeed, rights groups say that\nwomen were wrongly imprisoned in El Salvador simply for having\nmiscarriages.Trump doesn’t seem to have thought deeply about the issue — what\na surprise! — and he departed from the mainstream anti-abortion position of\ntargeting not women but abortion providers. As one person said on Twitter:\n“He’s a walking cartoon parody of every leftist accusation against\nRepublicans.”After the TV interview was over and the backlash had begun, Trump\ntried to back off his comment, saying in a statement, “The doctor or any other\nperson performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally\nresponsible, not the woman.”Who knows where that leaves us!One lesson is that\nTrump is an uninformed opportunist, but the episode does highlight two basic\nproblems for the anti-abortion movement.First, as long as the focus is on the\nfetus or on the claim of “protecting women,” many in the public are\nsympathetic to the anti-abortion view. The moment the focus shifts to\ncriminalizing women, sympathy shifts.Anti-abortion activists have generally\ntaken a savvy approach over the years by concentrating on extreme situations —\nsuch as late-term so-called partial-birth abortions — and on legislating\nobstacles that in practice reduce access: Of the 1,074 state restrictions on\nabortion put in place after Roe v. Wade in 1973, more than one-quarter were\nenacted since 2010, according to the Guttmacher Institute.Many Americans are\nambivalent on abortion. But Trump has now turned the attention back from the\nfetus to the woman. And remember that three in 10 American women get an\nabortion at some point in their lives.Second, the data suggests that one of\nthe most effective ways to reduce the number of abortions would be to increase\nthe availability of publicly funded family planning. In 2013, publicly funded\nfamily planning prevented two million unintended pregnancies, including almost\n700,000 abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute.Yet Republicans try\nto defund Title X, the traditional family planning program in the United\nStates. After inflation, its funding level is less than one-third what it was\nin 1980.In truth, Trump’s stance — whatever it is — would matter only if a\nmore conservative Supreme Court revisited Roe v. Wade and some states were\nallowed to ban abortion altogether.Moreover, medical abortion, achieved by\ntaking two kinds of pills, is gaining ground on surgical abortion and is much\nmore difficult to stop. In particular, one of the pills, misoprostol, is very\ncheap, has other uses and is at least 80 percent effective on its own in\ninducing an abortion early in pregnancy. The upshot is that early abortions\nwill be increasingly difficult to prevent.Trump’s comments about punishing\nwomen are worth pondering because they reflect the logical conclusion of\nequating a fetus with any other human being.This penalizing approach has been\ntried before and failed. A dozen years ago, I went to Portugal to cover such\nan effort. The police staked out women’s health clinics, looking to arrest\nwomen who appeared likely to have just had abortions based on being pale or\nseeming upset. Some 48 women and a 16-year-old girl were prosecuted, along\nwith accomplices such as husbands, boyfriends, parents and even a taxi driver\nwho drove a woman to a clinic.The women were humiliated on trial, their most\nintimate gynecological history revealed to the public. And the public was\nrevolted. The women were all acquitted, and the public turned decisively in\nfavor of abortion rights, by a majority of 79 percent to 14\npercent.“Forbidding abortion doesn’t save anyone or anything,” Sonia\nFertuzinhos, a member of the Portuguese Parliament, told me at the time. “It\njust gets women arrested and humiliated in the public arena.”The episode left\nmany Portuguese both anti-abortion and pro-choice. They were distressed by\nabortion, especially late in pregnancies, but they were aghast at the idea of\nprosecuting young women for making wrenching personal choices. I think many\nAmericans feel the same way.So maybe Trump, in his flip-flopping wavering\nabout women’s issues, can at least remind us of a larger truth. Whatever one\nthinks of abortion, criminalizing it would be worse.\n\n","title":"Trump and Abortion - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytopinion: .@NickKristof: Whatever one thinks of abortion, criminalizing it would be worse. https://t.co/92OPAQcAJ4 https://t.co/wWQAz…","date":"Thu Mar 31 18:05:05 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715600819098353664"},"retweets":78},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VazZuR"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01452"},"content":"DURHAM, N.C. — The onslaught of criticism, economic sanctions and a lawsuit\nbeing leveled at Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina grew on Tuesday, as the\nlargest corporation in his state joined the fight against a new law that\neliminated anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and\ntransgender people.Bank of America, which has its headquarters in Charlotte,\nN.C., announced late Tuesday on Twitter that its leadership was joining over\n80 chief executives, including Timothy D. Cook of Apple and Mark Zuckerberg of\nFacebook, in objecting to the new law. Earlier in the day, the chief\nexecutives published a letter, addressed to Mr. McCrory, on the Human Rights\nCampaign website, saying, “Such laws are bad for our employees and bad for\nbusiness.”Mr. McCrory, a Republican, signed the law last Wednesday to create a\nmandatory statewide anti-discrimination policy that excludes protections based\non sexual orientation and gender identity. The bill, created by Republican\nlegislators in an emergency session that same day, was intended to overrule a\nnew municipal ordinance in Charlotte, the state’s largest city, that provided\nsuch protections, including allowing transgender people to use bathrooms\naccording to the gender they identify with. It was set to take effect\nFriday.Condemnation rained down in response. The governors of New York,\nWashington and Vermont issued bans on most official state travel to North\nCarolina, as did the mayors of San Francisco, Seattle and New York. The\nNational Basketball Association implied it might move the 2017 All-Star Game\nfrom Charlotte. The White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, called the law\n“meanspirited.”On Monday, Lambda Legal, the American Civil Liberties Union,\nthe A.C.L.U. of North Carolina and Equality North Carolina filed a federal\nlawsuit against Mr. McCrory; the state’s attorney general, Roy Cooper; and the\nUniversity of North Carolina, challenging the law on behalf of two transgender\nNorth Carolinians.Mr. McCrory defended his signature in a testy news\nconference on Monday, insisting that the new law did not take away existing\nprotections. Fact-checkers at Raleigh’s WRAL-TV rated that statement\nfalse.Then on Tuesday, Mr. Cooper, a Democrat who plans to run for governor\nagainst Mr. McCrory this fall, held a news conference saying he refused to\ndefend the new law in court, despite being named in the case. “Not only is\nthis new law a national embarrassment, it will set North Carolina’s economy\nback,” he said.Mr. McCrory accused Mr. Cooper and other critics, including the\nWhite House, of taking part in a “vicious nationwide smear campaign” against\nhis state.In a video released by his press office on Tuesday, Mr. McCrory\naccused the critics of “disregarding the facts.”“Other politicians, from the\nWhite House to mayors and City Council members and, yes, our attorney general,\nhave initiated and promoted conflict to advance their political agenda,” he\nsaid.In a separate statement provided to The New York Times, Mr. McCrory’s\ncommunications director, Josh Ellis, lashed out at Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New\nYork, accusing him of hypocrisy.“Syracuse is playing the Final Four in\nHouston, where voters overwhelmingly rejected a bathroom ordinance that was\nalso rejected by the State of North Carolina. Is Governor Cuomo going to ask\nthe Syracuse team to boycott the game in Houston? It’s total hypocrisy and\ndemagoguery.”Mr. Cuomo’s chief counsel, Alphonso David, rejected that\ncomparison, noting that Syracuse University is private and that the Houston\nmeasure was rejected in a referendum, not voided by a state legislature.“They\ncannot hide behind what we perceive as nothing more than sheer discrimination\nand bigotry,” Mr. David said by phone from Albany.Mr. McCrory ran for office\nas a pro-business moderate but has often gone along with a staunchly\nconservative Republican legislature whose supporters he needs to win a second\nterm.Bank of America was one of the largest contributors to Mr. McCrory’s 2012\ncampaign and is a major supporter of North Carolina’s Republican and\nDemocratic Parties, according to the National Institute on Money in State\nPolitics.In the video, Mr. McCrory said the law was meant to “protect men,\nwomen and children when they use a public restroom, shower or locker room.”\nThat is a reference to its best-known requirement: that people use bathrooms\nthat correspond with the gender on their birth certificate, rather than their\ngender identity. Lawmakers had focused their opposition to Charlotte’s anti-\ndiscrimination ordinance on the contention that it might allow men dressed as\nwomen to enter bathrooms and commit assaults.The law’s critics say there is no\nevidence that has happened elsewhere.Threats of boycotts stemming from\ndiscriminatory laws have forced governors in Indiana and, this week, Georgia\nto reject similar laws in those states.The economic pressure is building on\nNorth Carolina as well.Another of the signatories on the letter signed by Bank\nof America was the president and chief executive of PayPal, Dan Schulman, who\nhad announced plans for a $3.6 million global operations center in Charlotte\nthis month.\n\n","title":"Major Companies Press North Carolina on Law Curbing Protections From Bias - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTNational: North Carolina's governor defends new law that wipes out anti-discrimination protections for LGBT people https://t.co/kf1E…","date":"Thu Mar 31 17:35:03 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715593261923115008"},"retweets":41},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25vgban"}

Ms. Paraschos said Mr. Mustafa had been indifferent to his daughter’s\ndeath and had not attended the funeral.As the hijacking unfolded on Tuesday,\nthe revelations that Mr. Mustafa was asking to contact Ms. Paraschos, among\nother demands, eased fears of a terrorist attack. The president of Cyprus,\nNicos Anastasiades, even joked about Mr. Mustafa’s motives: “Always, there is\na woman.”The woman at the center of this episode, Ms. Paraschos, said that Mr.\nMustafa’s hijacking of the plane — he wore a fake explosive belt — was not\npart of a “love story.” Rather, it was an opportunistic act by Mr. Mustafa,\nwho had offered his family only “pain, horror and misery,” she said.“The man\nused my name as an excuse to come to Cyprus and seek asylum,” she said in an\ninterview with the Cypriot daily Politis. “Why did he remember us now?”Ms.\nParaschos said she had not talked to Mr. Mustafa at the airport; Cypriot\nofficials initially said she had helped negotiate an end to the crisis. Ms.\nParaschos only helped the authorities identify his voice, she said.She and Mr.\nMustafa were married in 1985, and divorced five years later, she said, telling\nthe daily Phileleftheros newspaper that the divorce was like “liberation.” She\nsaid that Mr. Mustafa had used drugs and that when he did not have enough\nmoney to buy them, he used to beat her and the children.Mr. Mustafa is in\ncustody in Cyprus and could not respond to the accusations. Egyptian\nauthorities have said that Mr. Mustafa has a long criminal history in Egypt\nand that they are seeking his extradition from Cyprus.In Cairo, officials\noffered further details about Mr. Mustafa’s history with Egyptian law\nenforcement.Maj. Gen. Abu Bakr Abdel Karim, an Interior Ministry spokesman,\nsaid that Mr. Mustafa was convicted and imprisoned on charges of fraud and\nforgery in late 2010, only to escape months later during the tumult around the\nouster of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011.Mr. Mustafa surrendered to the\npolice in 2014 to serve the remainder of his sentence. He was released in 2015\nand was later sought by the police for questioning in relation to other\ninstances of theft, fraud and forgery. He was considered to have fled at the\ntime of the hijacking, General Abdel Karim said.A Cypriot government\nspokesman, Nicos Christodoulides, told The Guardian that Mr. Mustafa had been\ndeported from Cyprus on three occasions on charges of harassing Ms. Paraschos.\nAt least one of those times, he entered Cyprus using a fake passport, Mr.\nChristodoulides said.Ms. Paraschos also said that Mr. Mustafa served time in\njail in Damascus, Syria.She has since remarried, and had another child, she\nsaid. Mr. Mustafa’s startling act, she said, has “managed to upset our lives\nonce more.”“We demand that he respect our family, our privacy and our lives,”\nshe said.\n\n","title":"Love Story?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01455"},"content":"If you believe the Silicon Valley sloganeers, we are in a “gig economy,” where\nwork consists of a series of short-term jobs coordinated through a mobile app.\nThat, anyway, is both the prediction of tech executives and futurists and the\ngreat fear of labor activists.But anyone who cares about the future of work in\nthe United States shouldn’t focus too narrowly on the novelty of people making\nextra money using their mobile phones. There’s a bigger shift underway. That’s\na key implication of new research that indicates the proportion of American\nworkers who don’t have traditional jobs — who instead work as independent\ncontractors, through temporary services or on-call — has soared in the last\ndecade. They account for vastly more American workers than the likes of Uber\nalone.Most remarkably, the number of Americans using these alternate work\narrangements rose 9.4 million from 2005 to 2015. That was greater than the\nrise in overall employment, meaning there was a small net decline in the\nnumber of workers with conventional jobs.That, in turn, raises still bigger\nquestions about how employers have succeeded at shifting much the burden of\nproviding social insurance onto workers, and what technological and economic\nforces are driving the shift.The labor economists Lawrence F. Katz of Harvard\nand Alan B. Krueger of Princeton found that the percentage of workers in\n“alternative work arrangements” — including working for temporary help\nagencies, as independent contractors, for contract firms or on-call — was 15.8\npercent in the fall of 2015, up from 10.1 percent a decade earlier. (Only 0.5\npercent of all workers did so through “online intermediaries,” and most of\nthose appear to have been Uber drivers.)And the shift away from conventional\njobs and into these more distant employer-employee relationships accelerated\nin the last decade. By contrast, from 1995 to 2005, the proportion had edged\nup only slightly, to 10.1 percent from 9.3 percent. (The data are based on a\nperson’s main job, so someone with a full-time position who does freelance\nwork on the side would count as a conventional employee.)This change in\nbehavior has profound implications on social insurance. More so than in many\nadvanced countries, employers in the United States carry a lot of the burden\nof protecting their workers from the things that can go wrong in life. They\nfrequently provide health insurance, and paid medical leave for employees who\nbecome ill.They pay for workers’ compensation insurance for people who are\ninjured on the job, and unemployment insurance benefits for those who are laid\noff. They help fund their workers’ existence after retirement, at one time\nthrough pensions, now more commonly through 401(k) plans.Perhaps most\nsignificant of all, the implicit contract between an employer and an employee\nis that there is a relatively high bar for firing the employee if business\nslumps. If the economy turns down or business slows, a contract worker is, as\na rule, far more likely to be out of a job than a conventional employee.It’s\ntrue that the Affordable Care Act has made health insurance more easily within\nreach for independent contractors, for example, and temporary services firms\ncan offer retirement benefits and workers’ comp. But over all, there’s little\ndoubt that workers in these nonconventional work arrangements carry some of\nthe burden of protecting themselves from misfortune that employers\ntraditionally have carried.That makes the question of why the shift has\nhappened particularly important.You could imagine a world in which more\nworkers become independent contractors voluntarily, trading the social\ninsurance functions of traditional employers for higher pay and greater\nflexibility. If the period from 2005 to 2015 had been one when workers had a\nlot of power in the job market, that might even be plausible.It wasn’t. The\nunemployment rate was above 7 percent for nearly half of the period, from the\nend of 2008 to late 2013. Employers had the upper hand. That suggests it’s\nmore likely that employers were driving the shift to these alternate\narrangements.But Mr. Katz and Mr. Krueger raise the possibility that something\nhas changed beyond the weak job market of the last several years. And that’s\ntechnology.When people working as a team need extensive experience working\ntogether, it can be tricky to contract out the work. But when there are clear,\nsimple measurements of how successful each person is, and a company can\nmonitor it, the employer now has flexibility.“New technologies may allow some\nthings to be shipped out and standardized and easily monitored,” Mr. Katz\nsaid. “Call center workers can be at home. Independent truck drivers can be\nmonitored for the efficiency of their routes. Monitoring makes contracting\nmore feasible.”So Uber alone may not be a major force reshaping the nature of\nwork. But the same technologies that made it possible could be making\nemployers more interested in building a work force of nonemployees. A weak job\nmarket has probably given them more ability to make it a reality.A big\nquestion for the next decade is whether this was a one-time shift or whether\nit will continue in the years ahead, even with a tighter labor market.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01456"},"content":"NAYPYIDAW, Myanmar — The governing party of Myanmar’s democracy leader Daw\nAung San Suu Kyi took a step to formalize her role as the country’s leader on\nThursday, circumventing a stricture in the Constitution that prevents her from\nbeing president.Her party, which won  elections in a landslide last fall,\nintroduced a bill in Parliament to create a new post for her as “state\ncounselor,” which some analysts are comparing to prime minister.The position\nwould cement her influence over the executive and legislative branches, which\nare already controlled by her allies, and would cap a remarkable rise for a\nwoman who was a political prisoner for 15 years.Along with the four cabinet\npositions she was sworn into on Wednesday, including foreign minister, and her\nleadership of the majority party in Parliament, the array of titles will\nofficially make her the most powerful person in the government.“If Daw Suu\nbecomes the counselor of the state, it is clear she would be guiding both the\ngovernment and the Parliament,” said U Yan Myo Thein, a political analyst in\nYangon, the largest city in Myanmar.Myanmar’s Constitution, drafted by the\nmilitary that ruled for 53 years, prohibits Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi from becoming\npresident because her children are British citizens, as was her husband.She\nvowed during the election campaign last year that she would be “above” the\npresident, at least until she could achieve her goal of amending the\nConstitution. For the first time, her party, the National League for\nDemocracy, is making it clear how that will happen.The state counselor bill\nwas introduced in the upper house of Parliament on Thursday. The National\nLeague for Democracy controls large majorities in both houses of Parliament,\nensuring the bill will easily become law.Richard Horsey, a political analyst\nand former United Nations official in Yangon, said the main point of creating\nthe position was not to give the democracy leader more power but to allow her\nto use the power she already had more effectively.“Most important, I think, is\nthat it allows her to meet any person, and report to the legislature, which\nmeans she can advise the speakers with less risk of being accused of violating\nthe strict separation of powers in the Constitution,” he said, referring to\nthe speakers of each house of Parliament.But members of the Union Solidarity\nand Development Party, the military-aligned party that governed this country\nuntil this week, denounced the move as a power grab.“It seems she wants to\nhold as many posts as she can,” said U Hla Swe, a former lawmaker with Union\nSolidarity and Development. “Using her hands, feet and her teeth, she is\nholding those posts. I want to say she is crazy for power.”He said that under\nthe existing laws, the post of minister of the president’s office — one of her\nfour ministerial positions — would give her all the authority she needs to be\ninvolved in any issue.U Aung Kyi Nyunt, a member of her party who helped draft\nthe bill, described the position as “coordinator between the government and\nthe Parliament.”Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s longtime ally, U Htin Kyaw, was sworn\nin as president on Wednesday and is openly seen as her proxy. On Wednesday, he\nasked the public to be patient as the country’s first predominantly civilian\ngovernment took over after decades of military rule.It is a sign of Ms. Aung\nSan Suu Kyi’s dominance over her party and Parliament that the first bill\nintroduced to the legislature was the state counselor bill. The bill not only\ncreates the position but designates her to fill it.In addition to her post as\nminister of the president’s office, she was sworn in as minister of foreign\naffairs, education, and electric power and energy.The Constitution gives the\narmed forces chief the authority to appoint the ministers of defense, home\naffairs and border affairs. The division of power means that Ms. Aung San Suu\nKyi’s party will have to negotiate with the military in matters of national\nsecurity, ethnic issues and major foreign policy.After the November election,\nMs. Aung San Suu Kyi negotiated with the military to try to waive the\nconstitutional restriction that bars her from the presidency, but without\nsuccess. The military’s control of a quarter of the seats in Parliament gives\nit enough votes to block any constitutional amendments.Mr. Aung Kyi Nyunt said\nthat the advisory position would give her the authority to weigh in with top\nofficials in Parliament and the government on the most important issues facing\nthe nation.“With the adviser to the state role, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi can\nadvise two house speakers on important matters of the country such as peace,\ndemocratization and development,” he said.\n\n","title":"Myanmar to Create New Post for Aung San Suu Kyi, Cementing Her Power - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesworld: Myanmar parliament considers new title for Aung San Suu Kyi, adding to 5 she already has. https://t.co/TUtjlMUsun https:/…","date":"Thu Mar 31 15:50:04 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715566843700883456"},"retweets":57},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PHtDML"}

Bryant is shooting a career low .355.Things looked\nparticularly bad on Monday night when the Lakers managed to lose by 48 to the\nJazz. Bryant was 1 for 11 and had a plus/minus of minus-43. Russell, a rare\nbright spot for the team this season, was also atrocious, going 2 for 11.The\nabysmal performance may have been related to locker room turmoil of an unusual\nsort.As first reported by ESPN, Russell, who has a reputation as being a\nprankster and immature even for his 20 years, had videotaped Young talking\nabout women he had dated. Unfortunately for Young, he is engaged, to the\nrapper Iggy Azalea. Unfortunately for everyone, the video somehow found its\nway to the website Fameolous.com and was posted on the Internet for all to\nsee.Young is watching television during the video and seems to be unaware he\nis being filmed. After discussing an unnamed 19-year-old, Russell asks about\nthe model and performer Amber Rose, but Young denies an assignation, noting\nthat “She knows my girl.”At the end, Russell cackles, “I’m glad you told my\nvideo all that.” Young responds with a priceless “Huh?” and the video\nends.Young, who goes by the colorful sobriquet Swaggy P, has been awful this\nyear and has not been playing of late. But that did not prevent a rift in the\nlocker room over the video, according to reports, with Russell being shunned\nby teammates who felt he had broken an omerta.Iggy Azalea certainly\nnoticed:Young has not had much to say on Twitter lately; his most recent post,\nfrom Monday, merely says “What’s going on in 2016.” (To which one commenter\nreplies, “Not your wedding.”) Russell’s latest post is a cryptic, “Let’s be\nreal!”Before Wednesday night’s game, the Lakers held a news conference at\nwhich no one seemed happy to be. Russell apologized repeatedly for making the\nvideo. “I feel as sick as possible,” he said. “I wish I could make things\nbetter right away, but I can’t.” He said he had no idea how the video wound up\non the Internet.“What happened is what happened,” said a terse Young.Asked if\nhe felt he had put Young’s impending marriage in jeopardy, Russell said,\n“Honestly, I do.”Young said, “I don’t want to get into my personal life right\nnow.”There was no shortage of opinions from others. The former N.B.A. player\nStephen Jackson, known for punching a fan during a 2004 donnybrook in Detroit,\ntold ESPN: “Snitches get stitches. Old rule. Snitches get stitches.”Though\nAzalea seemed to appreciate Russell’s undercover reporting, Lakers fans did\nnot, and he was roundly booed during Wednesday’s game.The odd thing is, the\nLakers actually won, beating the Heat, 102-100, in overtime. Bryant was just 1\nfor 7, but Jordan Clarkson had 26 points and Russell shook off the boos to\nscore 16.Perhaps the Lakers have taken the first steps back to happiness.\n\n","title":"D’Angelo Russell Video Sends Lakers to a New Low - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTSports: D'Angelo Russell's secret tape of Nick Young admitting to cheating on Iggy Azalea sinks Lakers to new low. https://t.co/LDCy…","date":"Thu Mar 31 14:05:28 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715540517279375361"},"retweets":65},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PHvelr"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01459"},"content":"SEATTLE — Aaron Horn, an information technology director for the Iowa\nInterstate Railroad, recently decided to take convenience in his home to the\nnext level.Instead of running out to the store whenever he and his family\nneeded Tide laundry soap, he installed a wireless button on the back of a\ncabinet door in his house in Swisher, Iowa. With one press of that button —\ncalled an Amazon Dash Button and made by the giant e-commerce company — Mr.\nHorn could reorder Tide anytime he needed, and the online retailer would ship\nhim detergent.Getting the button was about “90 percent convenience,” said Mr.\nHorn, adding that 10 percent of the motivation was “wanting to play with\ninnovative new tech.”Now, Amazon is about to make ordering a box of Trojan\ncondoms — as well as Slim Jims, Doritos and more than 100 other consumer\nproducts — as unchallenging as Mr. Horn getting that Tide.A year ago, Amazon,\nwhich is perpetually inventing new ways to buy things while using the fewest\ncalories possible, introduced the Dash Button with a single purpose: to let\ncustomers order mundane products like garbage bags and toothpaste by pushing a\nbutton. At first, many people thought the Dash Button — which is a plastic\nwidget the size of a car key remote — was a joke, since Amazon introduced it\njust before April Fool’s Day. The idea behind a device that lets shoppers buy\none thing, and one thing only, also seemed a little wacky.The Dash Button is\nno joke. On Thursday, Amazon said it was expanding the program from the nearly\n30 brands whose products have been available for ordering through the devices\nto more than 100. Now, Energizer batteries, Stayfree feminine pads and Zico\nPremium Coconut Water will each have their own Dash Buttons. Peet’s Coffee,\nRed Bull beverages and Orville Redenbacher’s Gourmet Popping Corn are joining\nthe club too, as is Arm \u0026amp; Hammer cat litter.“What we’ve heard from\ncustomers is they want more,” said Daniel Rausch, director of Dash at Amazon.\n“Brands have been clamoring to be in the program.”Mr. Rausch said the use of\nDash Buttons had been growing at a steady clip. The number of orders customers\nmade with the devices jumped 75 percent during a week in mid-March compared\nwith a week in mid-December, he said, without disclosing the underlying sales\nnumbers. Dash Buttons are now pressed more than once a minute in total by\nAmazon customers, Mr. Rausch said.Amazon charges its customers $4.99 per Dash\nButton, but refunds that same amount after their first order using the device,\nalmost guaranteeing that customers use it at least once. The device is\navailable only to people who pay for Amazon’s $99-a-year Prime service, and\nitems are delivered to customers with Prime’s two-day free shipping.Each Dash\nButton has a strip of adhesive for sticking it somewhere around the house, and\na colorful logo for Tide, Orbit gum or whatever brand the button exists to\nserve. The widgets are effectively in-home advertisements for the brands,\nleading some analysts to believe that the brands are subsidizing the cost of\nthe Dash Buttons bearing their names — something Amazon will not\nconfirm.Amazon’s founder and chief executive, Jeffrey P. Bezos, has been on a\nmission to eradicate every conceivable obstacle to shopping online since the\n1990s, when he patented Internet ordering with a single mouse click. With the\nDash Button, Amazon is removing the headache of one-click ordering on a PC or\nsmartphone — as questionable as that burden may seem — and putting the button\non a pantry wall, countertop or medicine cabinet.Scott Galloway, a professor\nof marketing at New York University’s Stern School of Business, said Amazon\nwould one day go even further by analyzing customer shopping patterns and\nproactively sending people replenishments of common household items.“I think\nthat’s where this is all headed,” he said. “I will get a box once a week with\nstuff they figure I need.”Amazon, based in Seattle, received a patent a few\nyears ago for “anticipatory package shipping,” a method of speculatively\nsending goods to customers before they have actually ordered them. And the\ncompany is also helping makers of washing machines, pet food dispensers and\nother products design them so that the products themselves can automatically\norder replenishments on their own.To some, the Dash Button is another symptom\nof a creeping societal laziness, though Mr. Galloway says he sees the device\nas no more insidious than a television remote control.One obvious risk of\nmaking online shopping so easy is inadvertent ordering. By default, the Dash\nButton won’t allow a repeat order of a product until after an earlier order of\nthe same item is delivered, a rule intended to prevent situations in which,\nsay, a husband orders pet food right after his wife.But a child with a Dash\nButton can be a dangerous thing. Before Mr. Horn recently installed his Dash\nButton for Tide, one of his children got hold of it.“When our 6-year-old\npicked it up, my wife and I both yelled ‘Don’t push the button!’” Mr. Horn\nsaid. He was just in time: No unwanted shipment of Tide has shown up at his\ndoor.\n\n","title":"More Brands Mean Many More Buttons for Quirky Amazon Service - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesbusiness: You'll now be able to order condoms (and lots more) with a push of Amazon's Dash Button https://t.co/se4r449V54 https:…","date":"Thu Mar 31 13:10:06 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715526585735102464"},"retweets":66},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1onXkfs"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0145b"},"content":"In the late 1960s, an undergraduate psychology student at Wellesley College\nnamed Martha McClintock noticed something interesting: Women who spent a\nmajority of their time together tended to get their periods around the same\ntime. She suspected that menstruating bodies could influence one another\nsomehow, but it was just a hunch. So she asked 135 of her fellow students to\nkeep track of their cycles. Three times that year, she quizzed them about\ntheir period start and which women they socialized with the most.Initially, it\nseemed McClintock was right: Close-knit groups of friends tended to start\ntheir periods together. The phenomenon of menstrual synchrony was nicknamed\nthe “McClintock effect,” and her work was lauded as one of the first\nmainstream studies to demonstrate how one person’s body chemistry can trigger\nresponses in another’s. But McClintock’s results have been difficult to\nreplicate; now, the scientific consensus is that cycles probably don’t sync up\n— a claim that rings untrue to anyone who menstruates. My friends and I joke\nthat we even seem to sync up digitally, thanks to constant contact via\niMessage, Snapchat and Twitter.The unresolved nature of McClintock’s\ninvestigation, now almost 50 years old, underscores the unnerving amount of\nopacity that still surrounds women’s health. Even today, it’s difficult for\nwomen to get a sense of what’s normal and what isn’t. When my friends and I\ntalk about our bodies, we compare feedback from physicians, all of which seems\nto be slightly different; we warn one another about conditions like uterine\nfibroids and share horror stories about different methods of contraception.\nThere still seems to be a combination of prudishness and ignorance around the\nunique, and sometimes idiosyncratic, functions of the female body — which is\nshocking, considering half the world is born with one.But in recent years,\nmobile technology has granted me and countless others the ability to collect\nan unprecedented amount of information about our habits and well-being. Our\nphones don’t just keep us in touch with the world; they’re also diaries,\nconfessional booths, repositories for our deepest secrets. Which is why\nresearchers are leaping at the chance to work with the oceans of data we are\ngenerating, hoping that within them might be the answers to questions medicine\nhas overlooked or ignored.**In March, **I sat in a conference room with\nJasmine McDonald, an assistant professor at the Mailman School of Public\nHealth at Columbia University, and Lauren Houghton, an associate research\nscientist at the same school. The scientists, who are in their 30s, have been\nstudying puberty patterns in adolescent girls, particularly how various\naspects of a girl’s menstrual cycle correlate with the development of certain\ndiseases later in life. Because McDonald and Houghton often work with girls in\ntheir teens or younger, they’ve struggled over the years with data-collection\nmethods. They had, until recently, used paper questionnaires and calendars.\nBut they found that their teenage subjects had hazy recollections of\ndates.McDonald and Houghton asked a high-school intern they worked with how\nshe kept track of her period. She said that she used apps, and she eventually\nled them to one named Clue. First they were stunned, and then delighted. Of\ncourse: Asking young people to use a paper calendar was like assigning\nhomework. Invariably, it would be completed at the last minute, sloppily. It\nmade much more sense to use an app, especially one already available.The\nresearchers found the data collected via Clue to be more detailed — and more\naccurate. “The data is as close to real time as we can get,” McDonald said.\nThey hope their young participants will be more comfortable telling a faceless\napp about personal health matters — a slump of depression, gross blood clots,\nirritated bowels — than telling a doctor. And it’s not just teenagers; most of\nus are willing to be much more honest with our phones than with professionals,\nor even with our spouses and partners. We look up weird symptoms and\nhumiliating questions on Google with the same ease that we search for the name\nof a vaguely familiar character actor. For many of us, our smartphones have\nbecome extensions of our brains — we outsource essential cognitive functions,\nlike memory, to them, which means they soak up much more information than we\nrealize. When we hand over this information willingly, the effect is even\ngreater.Both scientists say that the app has opened up endless possibilities\nfor their research, because it offers a way to rethink — and potentially\noverhaul — how women’s health is studied. “We think we know about menarche,\nbecause we’ve been looking at it for decades,” Houghton said. “But there’s\nstill so much to study.” Clue can collect more than just period start dates.\nIt can also gather data on things like bleeding and pain patterns, energy\nlevels and sexual activity, allowing researchers to put old wives’ tales to\nthe test of scientific rigor.Women’s health isn’t the only area where app-\nenabled data collection is creating new avenues for research. Grindr, a dating\napp for gay men, routinely conducts surveys among its users about various\nhealth-related issues, like pre-exposure prophylactic drugs (PrEP) that\nprevent the transmission of H.I.V. In December, Grindr partnered with the San\nFrancisco AIDS Foundation to collect information from willing users about\nPrEP. The study came across some fascinating, if troubling, findings. Many\nusers were interested in the drug but did not have access to L.G.B.T.-friendly\ndoctors or counselors; many who asked their doctors about it experienced\npushback; others simply found the drugs too expensive.Ida Tin, a founder of\nClue, hopes that the app will eventually be able to do its own studies,\npublish findings and loop them back into the app. For example, Clue could\nrecommend users who report high menstrual irregularity to talk to their\nphysicians about polycystic-ovary syndrome, a common (but often hard to\ndetect) disorder that can contribute to obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure\nand heart disease.It wasn’t until a friend introduced me to period-tracking\napps in my 20s that my body became something I understood intimately, that it\nwas more familiar than foreign. Initially, I was skeptical, but the apps were\npassword-protected, which made me feel comfortable being honest about what I\nwas actually feeling and with whom I was actually sleeping. After a few\nmonths, the apps weren’t just a repository of daily facts; they had become a\nlegible map to my body. My period no longer caught me off guard, and I\neventually learned to connect the arc of my cycle to changes in mood,\nappetite, fatigue and sex life, and adjust my routines accordingly. By now, I\nhave years of data about my periods and an extremely accurate understanding of\nhow my body works: when I’m likely to experience cramps and breast pain, when\nto skip yoga and social outings because I’ll need more sleep. All my life, my\ndoctors tended to be vague, making my bodily functions seem ultramysterious,\nwhen in fact they are just individualized, and easily understood with the\nassistance of software.By divulging every last detail to these apps, we make\nthem incredibly valuable — but also potentially ruinous, if our most sensitive\nrecords were to fall into the wrong hands.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0145c"},"content":"JOHANNESBURG — For years, President Jacob G. Zuma of South Africa had derided\ndemands that he repay the state for upgrades to his homestead in Nkandla,\nabout 300 miles southeast of Johannesburg.The president maintained that the\nhome improvements — including a chicken coop, a cattle enclosure, an\namphitheater, a swimming pool, a visitor center and a helipad — were necessary\nto ensure his safety and that the cost should be borne by\ntaxpayers.“Nkaaaandla!” Mr. Zuma said in Parliament last year, drawing out the\na’s in Nkandla to mock opposition lawmakers’ pronunciation of the town’s\nname.On Thursday, South Africa’s highest court ruled that Mr. Zuma had\nviolated the Constitution by refusing to pay back some of the millions of\ndollars in public funds spent on the improvements, saying he flouted laws\nmeant to safeguard the country’s young democracy.Dealing a humiliating rebuke\nto Mr. Zuma, the Constitutional Court’s 11 justices ruled unanimously that the\npresident had “failed to uphold, defend and respect the Constitution as the\nsupreme law of the land.”The court ordered Mr. Zuma to reimburse the state for\nsome of the upgrades once the national treasury determined the appropriate\namounts. The improvements cost 246 million rand, or about $16.7 million at\ncurrent exchange rates.The ruling is significant, experts said, because it\nchecks the conduct of an executive who has been accused of disregarding the\nnation’s democratic institutions. It also affirmed the constitutional\nauthority of the Office of the Public Protector, which has faced unrelenting\nattacks from Mr. Zuma’s party, the African National Congress, since ordering\nMr. Zuma to reimburse the state in 2014.In practice, however, the ruling may\nhave little lasting effect beyond embarrassing Mr. Zuma and forcing him to pay\nback some of the money.The Constitutional Court has ruled against all three\npost-apartheid presidents in cases involving technical, legal matters, said\nPierre de Vos, a constitutional scholar at the University of Cape Town.“What\nmakes this different is that it is about personal benefits accruing to the\npresident and his family, and the failure of the president to put a stop to\nit,” he said. “But how significant this is will depend on how the governing\nparty responds. It’s a political issue now.”The ruling was the final legal\nverdict in a long-running scandal that, to many South Africans, has come to\nsymbolize the corruption and arrogance in Mr. Zuma’s administration and the\nA.N.C., which has governed South Africa since the end of apartheid in\n1994.“The Constitution of South Africa has been upheld today, and Zuma must\nsubject himself to that,” said Mmusi Maimane, the leader of the main\nopposition party, the Democratic Alliance, which started impeachment\nproceedings against the president on Thursday. “If I was him, I’d be drafting\na resignation letter.”It was unclear how A.N.C. members, who control the\nNational Assembly, would react to the judgment against Mr. Zuma. In a\nstatement, the government said Mr. Zuma “will reflect on the judgment and its\nimplications on the state and government, and will in consultation with other\nimpacted institutions of state determine the appropriate action.”Aubrey\nMatshiqi, a political analyst at the Helen Suzman Foundation, an independent\npro-democracy group, said that in order to protect their own interests A.N.C.\nmembers would probably stand by Mr. Zuma, especially with critical municipal\nelections scheduled for this year.“The A.N.C. will use its parliamentary\nmajority to quash any impeachment motion,” he said. “It’s not going to happen\nin an election year. It’s not in the interests of the A.N.C. even if it’s the\nright thing to do.”Some high-ranking A.N.C. members recently criticized Mr.\nZuma in another episode involving the Guptas, three brothers who are\nbusinessmen with close ties to Mr. Zuma and are accused of influencing\ngovernment affairs.But the party’s National Executive Committee, stacked with\nthe president’s allies, said two weeks ago that it had full confidence in\nhim.In 2014, South Africa’s public protector’s office, whose duties are to\ninvestigate official corruption and misconduct, concluded that Mr. Zuma had\nmisused public funds for his Nkandla home and directed him to repay a\n“reasonable proportion,” without specifying an amount.In the court ruling,\nChief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng described the public protector’s office, which\nwas set up after the end of apartheid, as a vital part of South Africa’s\ndemocracy and a “gift” to the nation.In a country with vast poverty, he said\nthe office defended the voiceless against the powerful and described it as\n“the embodiment of a biblical David, that the public is, who fights the most\npowerful and very well-resourced Goliath, that impropriety and corruption by\ngovernment officials are.”But Mr. Zuma ignored the directive from the public\nprotector’s office, and the A.N.C. fiercely attacked the public protector,\nThulisile Madonsela, who otherwise has been praised for aggressively carrying\nout her duties during her seven-year term, which ends later this year.In\nFebruary, after two years of steadfastly refusing to repay the government, Mr.\nZuma surprised opponents and allies by offering to reimburse some of the\ncosts. The offer, made by his lawyers in the Constitutional Court,\nacknowledged that he had been bound to follow the public protector’s\ndirective.The court affirmed on Thursday that the public protector’s order had\na “binding effect” on the president, a judgment that experts say clarifies and\nstrengthens the role of the public protector’s office.\n\n","title":"Jacob Zuma’s Home Improvements Violated South Africa’s Constitution, Court Finds - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Jacob Zuma Violated Constitution, South African Court Rules https://t.co/ITyn0WMo6l","date":"Thu Mar 31 12:14:46 +0000 2016","favs":113,"id":{"$numberLong":"715512662189277184"},"retweets":164},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22RtT8E"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0145d"},"content":"DANDONG, China — Before he drives the beat-up taxi into North Korea, Mr. Qin\ndoes two things. He packs a bribe, often something as simple as fresh apples\nor bananas, or sometimes as much as $200. And he snips the car’s radio\nwires.“They always want the wires to the car radio cut so the North Koreans\ncan’t listen to the Chinese programs,” he said.Then, as he does on many\nmornings, he drives the car over a single-lane iron bridge across the border,\nwhere there is steady demand for secondhand taxis.When the United Nations\nadopted tougher sanctions against North Korea last month to punish it for its\nnuclear weapons program, it was understood that they would have little effect\nwithout strong cooperation from China, North Korea’s largest trading\npartner.If recent trade here is any indication, that cooperation has been\nspotty at best.Cross-border trade, legal and illegal, flows pretty much as\nusual, and seems to be largely unhindered by the new rules, traders and local\nofficials said.One of the toughest components, a requirement that countries\ninspect all cargo entering or leaving North Korea for banned goods, is not\nenforced here.On many days, Mr. Qin’s secondhand taxis cross the bridge in a\nconvoy of more than 100 vehicles, including trucks loaded with containers\ndraped in shabby tarpaulins and secondhand minibuses for North Korea’s rickety\ntransportation system. Few are ever inspected by the Chinese authorities.China\naccounts for about 90 percent of North Korea’s trade. Half of that business is\nestimated to flow through Dandong, a boom-and-bust city whose fortunes are\ntied to trade with North Korea.Virtually everything that keeps the North\nKorean economy afloat passes through here: Coal and iron ore come in,\nviolating the sanctions, and crude oil flows out, exempted from them.Smuggling\nis rampant. The export of North Korean rare earth minerals and gold, banned\nunder the new rule, is one of the more lucrative revenue sources for the North\nKorean government, traders said. That business continues on privately owned\n200-ton ships belonging to Chinese smugglers based here, they said.The United\nNations rules put the onus on customs inspectors here to judge which goods may\nhelp the nuclear program or the military, which are banned, and which are\nintended for civilians, which are allowed.On a recent day, the customs\ncheckpoint, a large outdoor parking area adjacent to the bridge, held a\ncollection of China’s castoffs: cheap four-wheel-drive Haval passenger\nvehicles, discount medicines for hepatitis and tuberculosis, old solar panels\nto brighten dark houses.But the customs office here lacks the staff to open\nall the containers, a local government official said. Like most people\ninterviewed for this article, he spoke on condition of anonymity since there\nare risks to speaking candidly to foreign media about trade with North\nKorea.At peak times, up to 200 trucks a day cross the Yalu River to Sinuiju,\nNorth Korea. Before departing, only about 5 percent of the containers they\ncarry are inspected, the official said.China and the United States worked\nclosely on the new sanctions, and both countries said ridding North Korea of\nnuclear weapons was a shared concern. When President Obama and the Chinese\nleader, Xi Jinping, meet in Washington on Thursday, Mr. Obama is likely to\npress China to enforce the new measures.But if China is exasperated with the\nNorth Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, it is even more worried about political\ninstability, and the possibility that economic deprivation could send millions\nof North Koreans fleeing into China.So China insisted on an exemption\nstipulating that the “livelihood” of ordinary North Koreans must not suffer, a\nloophole that sanctions experts say is big enough to drive an 18-wheeler\nthrough.That exemption left the oil pipeline from Dandong to North Korea open,\nbut seems to have been applied to a wide variety of merchandise.One salesroom\nhere boasted a brisk business in secondhand Japanese pianos, selling for\n$1,500 to $8,000 for fastidious, well-off North Koreans who sneer at the sound\nof Chinese instruments. North Koreans like Yamaha pianos, a salesman\nsaid.Smuggling along the nearly 900-mile border, perfected through methods\nranging from tucking wads of cash into truck drivers’ seats to operating small\nboats in the dead of night, is winked at for the same reason.“We don’t want\nthe North Korean regime to collapse,” explained Mr. Wang, a government\nofficial.Demand has fallen for some items, traders said, but that was more a\nfunction of North Korea’s increasingly feeble economy and a lack of cash, than\nthe sanctions.There is, however, evidence of some enforcement in one important\narea: North Korea’s sale of coal and iron ore, two of its most important\nexports.Port authorities here have been fairly vigilant in enforcing the new\nban on North Korea’s ragged fleet of more than two dozen cargo ships, two\nlocal officials said. The coal they carry earns North Korea as much as $1\nbillion a year, according to the United States Treasury.But that ban has been\ncircumvented by smuggling ships and by the transfer of 12 North Korean ships\nto Chinese ownership, allowing them to dock at Chinese and other ports, a\nlongtime trader, Mr. Yu, said.A few traders interviewed here said the new\nrules had crimped their business.Mr. Zhang, a trader who does tens of millions\nof dollars a year in business with North Korea, said customs officials had\njust impounded a big secondhand excavator he had bought from a coal mine in\nShanxi Province and sold to a North Korean coal mine for more than\n$60,000.Customs inspectors asked how he knew the equipment would not be\ntransferred to the North Korean military. “We didn’t know how to answer,” he\nsaid.But traders and officials expect that after some initial minor squeezing,\nwhatever enforcement there is will be relaxed. Liaoning Province, where\nDandong is a prominent city, ranked at the bottom of China’s 31 provinces for\neconomic growth last year, and there was political pressure not to weaken the\neconomy further.“Whenever there are provocations, the traders say that the\nhigher-ups call for enforcement, and then a few months later there is no\nsystematic implementation,” said Andrea Berger, a proliferation expert at the\nRoyal United Services Institute in London.For many of the Chinese businessmen\nhere, deals with North Korea still offer a chance to make good money, both\nquickly and quietly. Their offices are tucked away in a grubby complex of two-\nstory buildings near the waterfront.On the street, North Korean men are\nubiquitous, walking in pairs or in groups — never alone — and wearing severe\nblack jackets and pants, the signature uniform of government officials. They\nare North Korean trade officials who were sent to Dandong as purchasing\nagents, and whose jobs were largely untouched by the new United Nations\nrestrictions.Their presence has created tensions with the Chinese, many of\nwhom regard their needy neighbors with contempt.Just as the new sanctions were\nimposed, a new North Korean trader came to work at Mr. Zhang’s company, where\nhe would earn kickbacks on each purchase and then pay some of that money to\nhis government, Mr. Zhang said.The trader expected to be treated to a plush\napartment for him and his family, schooling for his son, an imported car, and\na loan of more than $50,000, Mr. Zhang complained. “How they spend money is\nway too extravagant,” he said.\n\n","title":"A Hole in North Korean Sanctions Big Enough for Coal, Oil and Used Pianos - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Tougher sanctions on North Korea have a hole big enough for coal, oil and used pianos https://t.co/PxpZ30xnB3 https://t.co/9udP69RLnO","date":"Thu Mar 31 11:21:05 +0000 2016","favs":155,"id":{"$numberLong":"715499150889103361"},"retweets":107},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1MDxujb"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0145e"},"content":"THE HAGUE, Netherlands — In a rare courtroom victory for a Serb defendant, a\nU.N. war crimes tribunal on Thursday acquitted ultranationalist politician\nVojislav Seselj of atrocities and pronounced him a free man. The decision\ninflamed simmering tensions in the Balkans, sparking joy in Serbia and horror\nand deep anger in Bosnia and Croatia.Prosecutors had charged Seselj, 61, with\ncrimes including persecution, murder and torture and had demanded a 28-year\nsentence for his support of Serb paramilitaries during the region's bitter,\nbloody wars in the early 1990s.But in a majority decision, the three-judge\npanel said there was insufficient evidence linking the politician himself to\nthe crimes. A dissenting opinion shredded that logic, providing grist for\npossible future appeals.\"After so many proceedings in which innocent Serbs\nwere given draconian punishments, this time two honest judges showed they\nvalued honor more than political pressure,\" Seselj declared at a press\nconference at his Serbian Radical Party headquarters in Belgrade.Others\nheatedly disagreed.\"This is a defeat of The Hague tribunal,\" Croatian Prime\nMinister Tihomir Oreskovic said in Vukovar, an eastern Croatian town destroyed\nby Serbian troops, including Seselj's paramilitaries, during the war for\nindependence in the 1990s. \"I am in Vukovar today, and we all know that this\nman has done evil to this town. He showed no remorse whatsoever.\"Most of the\npeople indicted and convicted by the court have been Serbs as the\ninternational community blamed them for most of the war's worst atrocities,\nincluding the deadly siege of Sarajevo and 1995 massacre of 8,000 Muslim men\nin Srebrenica.Seselj, who repeatedly branded the International Criminal\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia an anti-Serb court, was not in The Hague\nfor the ruling. He was allowed to return home in late 2014 on compassionate\ngrounds due to ill health.Once home, the firebrand ultranationalist, who once\nsaid he would like to gouge out the eyes of rival Croats with a rusty spoon,\nrekindled a political career that was put on hold when he surrendered to the\ntribunal in 2003.Now he could become a key political powerbroker after\nSerbia's April 24 general election. With a surge in pro-Russian and right-wing\nsentiments ahead of the vote, Seselj's Serbian Radical Party has a good chance\nto return to parliament after missing out two years ago.Seselj has campaigned\non the platform that Serbia must never enter the 28-nation European Union or\nNATO and should forge closer ties with Moscow. He has burned EU, NATO and\nCroatian flags during pre-election rallies, and said he would join a coalition\ngovernment with the incumbent populists, his former allies, only if they give\nup their goal of EU accession.The ruling could also further deteriorate\nrelations between the two main Balkan rivals, Serbia and Croatia.Oreskovic,\nthe prime minister described the acquittal as \"shameful\" and demanded a\nSerbian government \"reaction\" as a proof that Belgrade adheres to EU values as\nit seeks membership in the bloc.In Bosnia, which also saw mass killings by\nSerb forces, the acquittal sparked disbelief and anger.\"An absolutely shocking\ndecision,\" said lawyer and publicist Senad Pecanin. \"This is the lowest point\nof The Hague tribunal.\"Ismar Jamakovic, 23, a student of political science\nfrom Sarajevo, said judges ruled that \"advocating the creation of Greater\nSerbia was a political and not a criminal act. Does this mean I can now\nadvocate the creation of an Islamic State without facing any consequences?\nYou've got to be kidding me.\"Jamakovic was referring to one of the most\ncontroversial aspects of Thursday's ruling. Prosecutors have long cast wartime\nplans by Serb leaders including Slobodan Milosevic and Radovan Karadzic as a\ncriminal plot to create a \"Greater Serbia\" by forcefully expelling non-Serbs\nfrom their homes and thus redrawing the Balkan borders. Reading out a summary\nof the judgment, Presiding Judge Jean-Claude Antonetti characterized the plan\nas a political goal, not a criminal act.The ruling called operations in which\nnon-Serbs were bussed out of territory as a \"humanitarian mission.\"\nProsecutors had branded it a forcible displacement of the civilian\npopulation.\"The reading of the conflict by the trial chamber is very, very\ndifferent to what we are used to,\" Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz told\nreporters, adding that Seselj's trial was beset by allegations of interference\nwith witnesses and evidence.Brammertz almost certainly will appeal, but said\nThursday he first has to study the ruling, which runs to some 100 pages, and\nits dissenting opinion.Antonetti also distanced Seselj from the crimes of the\nSerb paramilitaries he helped to establish, saying that although Seselj \"may\nhave had a certain amount of moral authority over his party's volunteers, they\nwere not his subordinates\" when they went into combat.In a dissenting opinion,\nJudge Flavia Lattanzi sounded appalled at the findings of the other two\njudges, saying they had set aside \"all the rules of international humanitarian\nlaw that existed before the creation of the Tribunal and all the applicable\nlaw established since the inception of the Tribunal in order to acquit\nVojislav Seselj.\"Serbian political analyst Djordje Subotic said the ruling\nlegitimizes the \"Greater Serbia\" project, which could have grave consequences\nfor future stability in the Balkans.\"This means that the idea of redrawing the\nborders in the Balkans is revived,\" he said.Seselj said he now expects to win\n20-25 percent of the vote for his far-right radicals in April.\"The most\nimportant is that we get more than the progressives,\" he said, referring to\nthe ruling Serbian Progressive Party, his former allies-turned-\nfoes.____Associated Press writers Jovana Gec in Belgrade, Aida Cerkez in\nSarajevo and Nataliya Vasilyeva in Moscow contributed to this report.\n\n","title":"UN Court Acquits Serb Nationalist Seselj; Croatia Shocked - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"UN Court Acquits Serb Ultranationalist Seselj of All Counts https://t.co/tURHXpA46W","date":"Thu Mar 31 11:20:43 +0000 2016","favs":41,"id":{"$numberLong":"715499056550846464"},"retweets":46},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22RlB0q"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0145f"},"content":"House Republicans released a draft of a rescue plan for Puerto Rico on Tuesday\nthat they hoped could quickly garner bipartisan support and win over skeptics\non the island, on Wall Street and in Congress.The plan, being drafted by\nRepublicans on the House Natural Resources Committee, in consultation with\nDemocrats in Congress and the Treasury Department, calls for putting Puerto\nRico’s finances under a presidentially appointed oversight board — a bitter\npill to many on the island.“This discussion draft will change,” said\nRepresentative Rob Bishop, Republican of Utah, who has been leading the\ndrafting process. “We are releasing it now to encourage feedback.”The plan\nwould also establish guidelines for restructuring some portion of Puerto\nRico’s $72 billion of debt, “where necessary.” While Puerto Rico would not be\ngranted standing to seek relief in bankruptcy — something its leaders wanted —\nit could get some of the legal tools found in bankruptcy as long as it first\njumps through a number of hoops.Creditors’ demands for immediate payment would\nbe halted for 18 months, for example, much as creditor lawsuits are\nautomatically stayed in bankruptcy cases. Under certain circumstances Puerto\nRico would also have the authority to impose losses on unwilling creditors —\nan extraordinary power that is normally available only in bankruptcy. The\noversight board’s duties would include keeping Puerto Rico from abusing that\npower.To some on the island, any federal oversight board at all is a deal-\nbreaker.Shortly after a summary of the committee’s approach began to circulate\nlate last week, the governor of Puerto Rico, Alejandro García Padilla,\ndenounced it as “shameful and degrading,” and something that would deprive the\nisland “of its own government.”The president of the Puerto Rican Senate,\nEduardo Bhatia, said upon reading the proposal that he was deeply offended by\nthe way it was written, which he said “was from the 18th century,” evoking\n“the worst colonial subjugations.”Congressional staff must work at a pace\nseldom seen in Washington these days, because between May 1 and July 1 Puerto\nRico owes debt payments totaling around $2.4 billion. By setting up a legal\nframework before that, Congress may be able to prevent the chaos and\ndevastation of a disorderly default.That means devising a package acceptable\nboth to Democrats, who tend to support debt relief for Puerto Rico, and to\nconservative Republicans, who see debt relief as a bailout that would\nunacceptably reward profligacy.Getting a bill onto President Obama’s desk for\nsignature would also mean finding common ground with Senate Republicans, who\nhave seemed less willing to assist Puerto Rico, citing its failure to make\nrequired financial disclosures.Given the need to act quickly, House aides\nsaid, lawmakers were trying not to be “overly prescriptive,” and were leaving\nmany details of the rescue plan for the five appointed and two ex-officio\noversight board members to sort out. They said they hoped to have a bill ready\nto be introduced when Congress returns from Easter recess in April.Mr. García\nPadilla has been calling Puerto Rico’s $72 billion of debt “unpayable” for\nalmost a year, and asking Congress for extraordinary powers to reduce it. If\nthere had to be an oversight board in the process, the governor had envisioned\nit made up primarily of people from Puerto Rico.On Saturday, he called for\ncandidates for governor from all parties on the island to form a united front\nto block the package as written.Mr. Bhatia said that as Senate president, he\nknew enough about the legislative process to know the package would be\nrevised. “It has to be amended, because as written it is not going to pass,”\nhe said.All over the island, people have been taking on the airwaves and\nsocial media to hash out their thoughts about the rescue plan, even though\nalmost none of them had seen a copy of it.Large numbers seemed to disagree\nwith the governor, saying they would accept a federal oversight board. Some\nsaid they expected federal oversight to be like surgery — painful, but\nnecessary to Puerto Rico’s recovery.The small but well-regarded Puerto Rico\nIndependence Party rejected outright the governor’s calls for unified\nopposition, saying his longstanding support for Puerto Rico’s territorial\nstatus made unity impossible.And in Washington, Puerto Rico’s nonvoting member\nof Congress, Pedro Pierluisi, said that the governor’s position was\n“completely unrealistic.” He said that if Puerto Rico expected Washington to\nhelp it reduce its debts, then it should not be surprised when Washington\nwanted a closer look.Mr. Pierluisi, a Democrat, also said that he had found\ndozens of things in the draft proposal that he thought should be changed, and\nthat he planned to keep working with the Republicans.Investors were less\nvociferous than critics on the island, but they still found fault with certain\nparts of the rescue package.The Mainstreet Bondholders, an organization\nseeking to represent small investors, expressed concern about the idea of\nhalting creditor lawsuits. The group said it wanted reassurances that no one\nwould get preferential treatment.Steve Spencer, a financial adviser to\ncreditor groups, said the most troubling aspect he could see was the rescue\nplan’s “broad ‘cramdown’ provision.”Cramdowns can happen when companies\ndeclare bankruptcy under Chapter 11. They are not, in general, controversial\nbecause Chapter 11 also gives creditors legal tools to fight them. But Chapter\n9 municipal bankruptcy also provides for cramdowns, and during the recent\nflurry of bankruptcies in places like Detroit and Stockton, Calif., creditors\ndiscovered that the law gave them no way to protect themselves.Now, Mr.\nSpencer said, creditors see the same risk in the Puerto Rico rescue plan.“The\nbill would retroactively eliminate an important investor protection, relied\nupon by millions of individual investors throughout the U.S. mainland and\nPuerto Rico,” he said in a statement on Tuesday. “As a result, the bill would\ntransfer billions of dollars from retail investors and retirees to pay for\nPuerto Rico’s mismanagement and reckless spending.”He said he hoped the people\nshaping the rescue plan would “remain open to stakeholder input — and we look\nforward to being a constructive part of that process.”Mr. Pierluisi said\neverybody had a stake in getting a restructuring framework in place before the\nbig defaults expected in May and July.“If a bill does not become law, Puerto\nRico and its creditors will almost certainly go over a cliff — together — this\nsummer,” he said.\n\n","title":"Latest Plan to Rescue Puerto Rico Is Met With Disdain on Island - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"A Republican plan to rescue Puerto Rico has been called “shameful,\" \"degrading” and \"from the 18th century\" https://t.co/AwkhAndXeT","date":"Thu Mar 31 11:15:31 +0000 2016","favs":134,"id":{"$numberLong":"715497751564402688"},"retweets":114},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SnUIq6"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01460"},"content":"RUSSELLVILLE, Ala. — The governor of Alabama wanted to talk about\nbroadband.But because the governor was Robert Bentley, who is confronting a\ndeepening political morass after acknowledging last week that he had sexually\ncharged conversations with a top aide, that was hardly how a news conference\ncould unfold in this northwest Alabama city. Instead, he had to start by\ndiscussing whether he would be able to keep his job.“I have no intentions of\nresigning,” said Mr. Bentley, a Republican in his second term. “My intentions\nare to try to make this state better. My intentions are to try to work through\nall the difficulties that we’re going through.”Within hours, Rebekah C. Mason,\nthe governor’s senior political adviser and the woman with whom he engaged in\nsuggestive conversations, captured on tape, said she had quit. And by day’s\nend, it was uncertain whether it would be politically feasible for Mr.\nBentley, 73, to remain in office in this state, which has a gaudy history of\nscandal but has been in something of a morals-driven meltdown since the\ngovernor’s admission last Wednesday.Some lawmakers are talking of impeaching\nMr. Bentley. The governor’s former pastor spoke of “church discipline” and\nsaid that Mr. Bentley was no longer a member of the Tuscaloosa congregation\nwhere he was once a deacon. And as audio recordings of the governor’s\nconversations with Ms. Mason were replayed and dissected across the Internet,\neven Mr. Bentley’s proficiency at phone sex has been a subject of\nconversation.“As far as my situation is concerned, it is really just a shock\nto people, and, you know, I understand that,” Mr. Bentley said on Wednesday in\nan interview, his first since he acknowledged the nature of his behavior with\nMs. Mason. Mr. Bentley, who complained about “a lot of errors and\nmisconceptions and opinions” on social media, said a fuller account would\nsomeday put his behavior in a better light. “I still feel that, in time, all\nof this will come out, and everything will be exposed.”Mr. Bentley, who was\nelected statewide in part because of his reputation as a churchgoing, squeaky-\nclean public official,  said that his conduct had not been “all that\negregious,” but also said, “All I can say is that I think I let people down,\nand that disturbs me more than anything else.”People here have been hearing\nplenty about what happened.According to the monitoring service TV Eyes,\nAlabama television stations have mentioned Mr. Bentley, whose wife of 50 years\nfiled for divorce last year, more than 700 times since last Wednesday. In the\nentire month leading to Mr. Bentley’s news conference, the stations had\nreferred to him on fewer than 650 occasions.“It’s totally humiliating,” said\nState Representative Allen Farley, a Republican who last year spoke with Mr.\nBentley about rumors of sexual impropriety. “This man has got to understand\nthat every day he’s in the governor’s office, this circus will go on.”Alabama\nwas mired in scandal well before Ms. Mason became a household name. A former\ngovernor is serving a prison term for corruption, and the speaker of the State\nHouse of Representatives is to stand trial this year on charges of ethics\nviolations.“We’ve bottomed out,” Mr. Farley said. “We’ve got a speaker of the\nHouse that’s got 23 felony violations for using his office for personal gain,\nand now we’ve got a governor who’s using his office for God knows what.”The\nState Ethics Commission said this week that it would investigate whether Mr.\nBentley and Ms. Mason had committed wrongdoing. The state attorney general’s\noffice has declined to say whether it has opened an inquiry.Mr. Bentley has\ndenied a physical relationship with Ms. Mason, despite recordings in which the\ngovernor refers to “when I stand behind you and I put my arms around you and I\nput my hands on your breasts.” In an excerpt published by the Alabama Media\nGroup, he also said, “If we’re going to do what we did the other day, we’re\ngoing to have to start locking the door.”On Wednesday, Mr. Bentley has not\nsaid how long the inappropriate phase of his relationship with Ms. Mason\nlasted. Referring to that controversial period, he said, “We understood at\nthat time the boundaries, I should say, and we still do.”It was not clear\nwhether Ms. Mason’s resignation would help Mr. Bentley to regain his political\nfooting and whether a scheduled appearance at a prison in Wetumpka on Thursday\nmight carry a semblance of normalcy. In a statement released by Mr. Bentley’s\noffice, Ms. Mason said, “My only plans are to focus my full attention on my\nprecious children and my husband who I love dearly.”Before Ms. Mason’s\ndeparture, speculation about Mr. Bentley rained down on the governor’s\noffice.In the interview, when he referred to last week’s news conference as “a\nfiring squad,” Mr. Bentley confirmed some details of a report by Yellowhammer\nNews, which said Tuesday that he and Ms. Mason had shared a safe deposit box\nat a bank in Montgomery.He denied that Ms. Mason owned the box, but said that\nshe was designated to have access to it if he died.“I couldn’t ask my attorney\nto come down and sign for it,” said Mr. Bentley, who added he would release a\nvideo message in the coming days to “get my message out unfiltered.”“I want\nthem to hear from my lips because when I was in the press conference the other\nday, that’s kind of a shock thing,” he said. “I can’t answer everything, and\nin fact, I couldn’t answer everything that day because I didn’t know what was\ncoming out. I really didn’t. I had never heard any of this stuff. I didn’t\nknow.”But there are doubts that the scandal will fade from view anytime soon.\n“It’s not football season,” said Paul DeMarco, a Republican former member of\nthe Legislature.And around the state, there are questions of what more might\ncome — or, as State Senator Dick Brewbaker put it, whether “this gets any\nweirder.”“I really hate that this happened to the governor, but he did it to\nhimself,” Mr. Brewbaker, a Republican, said. “It just shows that any governor\nwho serves two terms and can leave office without scandal has really\naccomplished something in Alabama.”\n\n","title":"Governor of Alabama, Robert Bentley, Says He Won’t Quit - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Sex scandal ensnares Alabama’s governor and its capital https://t.co/K5ig7K4r43 https://t.co/fisDHEwX8g","date":"Thu Mar 31 11:01:03 +0000 2016","favs":96,"id":{"$numberLong":"715494108383588352"},"retweets":55},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VUvANf"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01461"},"content":"A stately colonial home recently listed for sale in Westfield, N.J., comes\nwith six bedrooms, wood flooring and a disturbing back story that left its\nlast owners living in fear of a stalker who sent them a series of cryptic,\nthreatening letters.The house was considered a dream home by Derek and Maria\nBroaddus when they purchased it for themselves and their three small children\nin 2014. But three days after they closed, a letter arrived signed by someone\nwho went by the name “The Watcher,” according to the couple’s lawyer, Lee\nLevitt.The writer claimed that the house was a family obsession: “My\ngrandfather watched the house in the 1920s and my father watched it in the\n1960s. It is now my time.”More correspondence followed that grew increasingly\nthreatening, and specific, according to a lawsuit filed by the Broadduses\nagainst the former owners.The writer wanted to know whose bedroom faced the\nstreet, and criticized changes that made the home more “fancy.” The letters\nhinted that the writer had identified the children: “I am pleased to know your\nnames now and the name of the young blood you have brought me.”Fearing for\ntheir safety, the Broadduses never moved into the home in Westfield, a town of\n30,000 located about 45 minutes from New York City. Instead, they hired an\nF.B.I. profiler, who deduced from the handwriting on the envelope that “The\nWatcher” was likely an older person.The couple sent the letters to the\nWestfield police, who found the DNA of a woman on one envelope but never\nlanded on a suspect.Finally, they brought a lawsuit against the former owners,\nJohn and Andrea Woods, that said the sellers had also received an anonymous\nletter but had kept that information secret.The Broadduses are seeking the\nnullification of their contract, punitive damages and a refund of the purchase\nprice, with interest. A lawyer for the Woodses declined to comment, but the\ncouple has filed a lawsuit of its own against the Broadduses, accusing the new\nowners of frivolus litigation and defamation. They have also requested that\nthe case go to trial.The danger-in-suburbia story was picked up by local\nbroadcasters and soon grew into a media circus for the Broadduses. The\nidentity of “The Watcher” became a subject of intense curiosity on Internet\nforums dedicated to unsolved mysteries.Theories abound, but none have panned\nout:• Was “The Watcher” a disgruntled potential buyer who balked at the $1.3\nmillion price tag? (There was no bidding war, according to the couple’s\nlawyer.)• Was it masterminded by the Broadduses themselves, to get more money\nout of the previous owners? (“These are the nicest people. They wanted to buy\ntheir dream home and move into it,” Mr. Levitt said.)• The Hollywood theory\nhas had perhaps the most subscribers. (“I wouldn’t be surprised if we found\nout the new owners are screenwriters/authors,” one Reddit theorist\nwrote.)Indeed, “The Watcher” is now being developed by the executive producer\nof “Homeland” and was bought preemptively by NBC, Deadline Hollywood\nreported.For some armchair investigators, the “Watcher” case has evoked\nmemories of a brush with suburban horror in Westfield back in 1971, when John\nE. List shot and killed his wife, three children and 85-year-old mother. He\nleft the lights on in the house and organ music on an intercom system before\nhe left town. The bodies weren’t discovered for weeks, and Mr. List was not\ncaught until 1989.The Broadduses, who temporarily moved away to escape the\nmedia attention, have since settled back in New Jersey, but their lawyer won’t\nsay where. “Put it this way: How would you feel if you haven’t slept in your\nown bed for 20 months?” Mr. Levitt said.Mr. Levitt thinks the case has\ninspired such intense interest partly because it can’t be solved easily,\ndespite technological advances. “We can crack iPhones to get to terrorist\ntexts and things of that nature,” he said, but we can’t figure out who wrote a\nletter.Michael C. Buccola, who is selling the home on behalf of Westfield\nRealty Service, said he would not comment on whether the home, whose price was\ndropped to $1.2 million, has attracted any serious interest.Mr. Levitt said\nthat the new buyers would get a house that has been improved and maintained by\nthe Broadduses. But he also acknowledged that the identity of whoever sent\nthose letters was still the target of an active police\ninvestigation.“Someone’s going to get a great house,” Mr. Levitt said, before\nadding, “How do you get over the dichotomy of whether it’s a real threat or a\nperceived threat?”\n\n","title":"‘The Watcher’ Makes Eerie Threats That Complicate a New Jersey Home Sale - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Eerie threats complicate a home’s sale in New Jersey suburb https://t.co/KkkOvw5N0h https://t.co/GQIEO4ukux","date":"Thu Mar 31 10:21:07 +0000 2016","favs":169,"id":{"$numberLong":"715484058021535746"},"retweets":83},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VUvCo9"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01462"},"content":"JOHANNESBURG — For two years, South Africa's president brushed off a scandal\nover state spending on his private home, even when critics scoffed at the\nnotion that a swimming pool and a chicken run were necessary security\nfeatures. It took the country's highest court to bring him to account.South\nAfrican President Jacob Zuma \"failed to uphold\" the constitution when he\ndidn't pay back some of the more than $20 million in state funds used to\nupgrade his rural home, South Africa's Constitutional Court ruled unanimously\non Thursday.The ruling could significantly weaken the leader, who is fending\noff multiple accusations of alleged misconduct at the highest levels of\ngovernment, though he still retained the support of powerful factions in his\nparty, the African National Congress.Until now, Zuma's political career has\nsurvived a string of scandals — from his acquittal for rape in 2006 to the\nmost recent allegation that his friends have the freedom to appoint cabinet\nministers. Still, he has enjoyed the public support of the African National\nCongress, with the party's lawmakers repeatedly coming to his defense in\nparliament and at political rallies.The main opposition party, the Democratic\nAlliance, said it would immediately begin impeachment proceedings against\nZuma. The second largest opposition party, the Economic Freedom Fighters,\ncalled on South Africans to protest if parliament failed to remove the\npresident.While parliament has the power to remove him, the ANC holds most of\nthe seats, and ruling party lawmakers defeated a no-confidence vote against\nZuma earlier this year. With 248 of the 400 seats in South Africa's\nparliament, according to the country's Independent Electoral Commission, the\nANC's parliamentary majority is more than all the opposition parties'\ncombined, meaning another vote against Zuma is unlikely to\nsucceed.Constitutional Court Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng also said that\nparliament had failed in its obligations by not holding Zuma to account in the\nspending scandal.Mogoeng said Zuma should not have ignored a state watchdog's\nrecommendations that he reimburse state funds spent on his rural home, known\nas Nkandla. The national treasury must calculate costs of upgrades unrelated\nto security at Zuma's home within 60 days, and the president must repay that\namount within 45 days thereafter, the court said.The police minister had\npreviously compiled a report arguing that features like a large swimming pool\nand a chicken run contributed to the security of Zuma's compound. The police\nminister's presentation even included a video of firefighters displaying how\nthe large swimming pool could be utilized in the event of an emergency.Zuma\n\"failed to uphold, defend, and respect the constitution as the supreme law of\nthe land,\" Mogoeng said.In a statement, the ANC said it respects the judgment\nby the Constitutional Court and that it has \"full confidence in the judiciary\"\nand the rule of law in South Africa. In a separate statement, the South\nAfrican government said Zuma also respects the ruling and \"will in\nconsultation with other impacted institutions of state determine the\nappropriate action.\"Zuma is already under scrutiny because of allegedly\nimproper links to the Guptas, a wealthy business family in South Africa.\nQuestions about the extent of the Gupta's influence have exposed some\ndivisions within the ruling party, particularly after the country's deputy\nfinance minister said the Gupta family directly offered him the finance\nminister job in December, around the time that the incumbent, Nhlanhla Nene,\nwas sacked in a move that rattled markets.Much of the Nkandla case hinged on\nwhether the findings of the state watchdog, the Public Protector's office,\nwere legally binding. The court said the watchdog's office, established in\nline with South Africa's post-apartheid constitution, was designed to be a\nchampion of good governance.\"The Public Protector is thus one of the most\ninvaluable constitutional gifts to our nation in the fight against\ncorruption,\" Mogoeng said, comparing the office to David fighting on behalf of\nthe citizenry against the \"most powerful and very well resourced Goliath.\"The\nConstitutional Court also ruled that the president must reprimand ministers\ninvolved in the matter. In 2014, a parliamentary committee, boycotted by\nopposition party lawmakers, had cleared the president.---Follow Lynsey Chutel\non Twitter at www.twitter.com/lynseychutel .\n\n","title":"South Africa's Top Court Rules Against President in Scandal - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"South Africa's Top Court Rules Against President in Scandal https://t.co/oYfUDzNFe4","date":"Thu Mar 31 09:55:15 +0000 2016","favs":65,"id":{"$numberLong":"715477551083196418"},"retweets":70},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1MVo0us"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01463"},"content":"BERLIN — If President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey had hoped that summoning\nthe German ambassador would get a video poking fun at him by a German satire\nprogram removed from the Internet, he was wrong.Instead, the move had any\nnumber of consequences, including provoking a diplomatic dust-up with Germany\nand a fresh round of ridicule of Mr. Erdogan for playing to type.After all,\nthe video, by the comedy show “extra3,” was a song satirizing the Turkish\npresident as a thin-skinned authoritarian who cracks down on journalists, the\nnews media and opponents he does not like.Not least, Mr. Erdogan’s move\nspurred a surge of online interest in the video, which by Thursday had\nattracted more than four million views — tenfold the program’s usual\naudience.“Nobody could avoid him,” the show boasted in a Twitter post on\nMonday.But Mr. Erdogan was not the only one who did not find the whole thing\nfunny. German commentators pointed to the spat as a demonstration of the\ndangers of making deals with a leader who has shown an increasingly\nantidemocratic streak even as he has sought broader recognition and favors\nfrom the European Union for agreeing to stem the flow of migrants to Europe.In\nthe video, the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, also comes in for mockery as\ncozying up to a leader who has been increasingly criticized for flouting the\nbloc’s democratic ideals.On Wednesday, the German government did not find much\nto laugh at in the matter.Christiane Wirtz, a spokeswoman for Ms. Merkel,\nconfirmed that the German ambassador to Ankara, Martin Erdmann, had been\nsummoned on March 22 over the video, and again on Tuesday for attending the\nopening of a trial on Friday of two opposition journalists charged with\nespionage.The trial was abruptly closed to the public, and Mr. Erdogan\ncriticized the German and other foreign diplomats in the courtroom.Sawsan\nChebli, a spokeswoman for Germany’s Foreign Ministry, said that “the\nambassador made clear the position of the German government that the rule of\nlaw, the independence of the judiciary and protection of basic rights, which\ninclude freedom of the press and freedom of expression, are values that must\nbe protected.”German officials would not confirm reports that the Turkish side\nhad requested that the video be taken down from the Internet.But Ms. Chebli\nsaid the ambassador and a deputy foreign minister, who called his Turkish\ncounterpart on Tuesday, had “made clear that political satire in Germany is,\nof course, protected and therefore there is neither a necessity, nor a\npossibility, for the government to take action.”The show’s reaction to the\ndispute was tongue-in-cheek. It posted a political cartoon showing a figure\nresembling Mr. Erdogan brandishing a fire extinguisher at a laptop, while\nthreatening, “Either you erase this video, or I will extinguish the\nInternet.”The cartoon was in keeping with the tone of the video, which derides\nMr. Erdogan’s treatment of journalists, the opposition and his country’s\nKurdish minority.“He’s living in grand style; Big boss from Bosporus,” begins\nthe song in the two-minute clip, initially broadcast on March 17 and sung to\nthe melody of a 1980s hit by the German punk-pop diva Nena, of “99 Red\nBalloons” fame.The music is set against a mix of actual and digitally altered\nfootage of the Turkish leader and recent events in his country, including the\nuse of water cannons on demonstrators after the closing of the opposition\nnewspaper Zaman.“When a journalist writes a piece that Erdogan doesn’t like,\nhe quickly ends up in jail,” the song continues, showing images of opposition\njournalists being taken away by the police and protesters clashing with\nofficers in riot gear.“Newspaper offices closed down, he doesn’t think twice,”\nthe lyrics add. “With tear gas and water cannons he is riding through the\nnight.”The flap is not the first time Germany and Turkey have clashed over\nfreedom of expression, as Mr. Erdogan’s government has cracked down on the\npress in recent years.Dozens of journalists and columnists have lost their\njobs, and the authorities, acting on court orders, have seized two opposition\nmedia companies. Insulting the president is a crime under Turkish law, and\nmore than 1,800 cases have been filed.Recently, the Turkish leader appears to\nhave extended his battle against freedom of expression to include the foreign\npress. Earlier this year, a correspondent for the German newsmagazine Der\nSpiegel was forced to leave the country after being denied accreditation as a\njournalist.The Turkish leader’s attempt to silence German satire “is an\nindication of a clear misunderstanding of Western press freedoms,” wrote\nKlaus-Dieter Frankenberger in the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper.“Apparently\nthe president is under the impression that the German Foreign Ministry can\ncensor German media outlets,” Mr. Frankenberger wrote. “Experienced Turkish\ndiplomats know this is of course untrue, yet Turkey is not like it was under\nthe ‘old’ Erdogan. It has become a more authoritarian country. Erdogan now\nreacts hysterically to any criticism. This is a woeful state of\naffairs.”Andreas Lange, the editor of “extra3,” told the public broadcaster\nNDR that no one from the show or the broadcaster had been contacted by either\nthe Turkish or German government over the controversy.He said his team first\nhad heard about it through social media over the holiday weekend.“We were\nsitting over our Easter eggs and were pretty puzzled about the whole thing,”\nMr. Lange said, later adding that his team had been “shocked” to learn that\nthe reports were true.Mr. Lange said he could not deny a certain pleasure at\nthe international attention the video has drawn to the show, which has been\npoking fun at domestic and international leaders for 40 years.The week after\nthe disputed video ran, “extra3” took on President Obama’s visit to Cuba\nthrough a spoof titled “Better Call Raul,” in a nod to the American television\nseries “Better Call Saul.”“We don’t do this just to be funny. We do it because\nthese are things that we believe need to be addressed,” Mr. Lange said. “Our\nmotto is, if we shoot and someone yells ‘ouch!’ then we have hit the mark.”\n\n","title":"Erdogan’s Attempt to Suppress German Satire Has the Opposite Effect - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesworld: Turkey's president gets bent out of shape over satire, spurring more satire https://t.co/ALOA8XXsI2 https://t.co/eFdsG3DY…","date":"Thu Mar 31 09:35:25 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715472560566042624"},"retweets":118},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1TjKDzk"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01464"},"content":"Donald J. Trump said on Wednesday that women who seek abortions should be\nsubject to “some form of punishment” if the procedure is banned in the United\nStates, further elevating Republican concerns that his explosive remarks about\nwomen could doom the party in the fall.The comment, which Mr. Trump later\nrecanted, attracted instant, bipartisan criticism — the latest in a series of\nhigh-profile episodes that have shined a light on Mr. Trump’s feeble approval\nratings among women nationally.In this case, Mr. Trump also ran afoul of\nconservative doctrine, with opponents of abortion rights immediately\ncastigating him for suggesting that those who receive abortions — and not\nmerely those who perform them — should be punished if the practice is\noutlawed.The statement came as Mr. Trump appeared at a town-hall-style forum\nwith Chris Matthews of MSNBC, recorded for broadcast on Wednesday night. Mr.\nMatthews pressed Mr. Trump, who once supported abortion rights, on his calls\nto ban the procedure, asking how he might enforce such a restriction.“You go\nback to a position like they had where they would perhaps go to illegal\nplaces,” Mr. Trump said, after initially deflecting questions. “But you have\nto ban it.”He added, after a bit more prodding, “There has to be some form of\npunishment.”Hours later, Mr. Trump recanted his remarks, essentially in full,\na rare and remarkable shift for a candidate who proudly extols his\nunwillingness to apologize or bow to “political correctness.”If abortion were\ndisallowed, he said in a statement, “the doctor or any other person performing\nthis illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible, not the\nwoman.”“The woman is a victim in this case, as is the life in her womb,” he\ncontinued.Mr. Trump’s Republican rivals moved quickly to distance themselves\nfrom his initial comments as well. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio said, “Of course\nwomen shouldn’t be punished.”“I don’t think that’s an appropriate response,”\nhe told MSNBC. “It’s a difficult enough situation.”The campaign of Senator Ted\nCruz of Texas said attention should be focused on providers of abortion, not\nthe women who receive them.“Once again, Donald Trump has demonstrated that he\nhasn’t seriously thought through the issues, and he’ll say anything just to\nget attention,” Mr. Cruz said in a statement, adding, “Of course we shouldn’t\nbe talking about punishing women; we should affirm their dignity and the\nincredible gift they have to bring life into the world.”For Republicans, the\nchaos felt something like a recurring nightmare. After the defeat of Mitt\nRomney in 2012, party leaders had hoped to move beyond a reputation for\noffensive comments on women’s issues, emblematized by Todd Akin, a Senate\ncandidate in Missouri who posited that victims of “legitimate rape” were\nsomehow able to prevent pregnancy.Mr. Trump’s comments came as many\nRepublicans are confronting, with escalating despair, the specter of a Trump\nnomination — and the electoral difficulties he would face.Last week, Mr. Trump\nthreatened to “spill the beans” on Mr. Cruz’s wife, Heidi, and posted an\nunflattering image of her on Twitter. On Tuesday, he forcefully defended his\ncampaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who was charged with battery over\nallegations that he grabbed a female reporter who had tried to question Mr.\nTrump earlier this month.A New York Times/CBS News poll this month had already\ndemonstrated Mr. Trump’s weakness with female voters, who favored the\nDemocratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, 55 percent to 35 percent.On\nWednesday, Mrs. Clinton called Mr. Trump’s comments “horrific and\ntelling.”Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the chairwoman of the Democratic National\nCommittee, sought to tie Mr. Trump to the rest of his party, noting that Mr.\nCruz opposed exceptions for abortion in cases of rape or incest. Mr. Kasich,\nshe added, has moved to defund Planned Parenthood in Ohio.“All three\nRepublicans would drag the country back to the days when women were forced to\nseek illegal procedures from unlicensed providers out of sheer desperation,”\nshe said.Yet with his statement on Wednesday, and the scramble to clarify it,\nMr. Trump also exacerbated concerns among Republicans who have questioned the\nauthenticity of his late-in-life conversions to conservative social\npositions.Mr. Trump is already facing a difficult test in Wisconsin, where the\nRepublican primary will take place Tuesday, and where those looking to stop\nhis march to the nomination see a critical opportunity. A Marquette University\nLaw School poll released just before the MSNBC interview showed Mr. Cruz in\nfirst place in the state, leading Mr. Trump by 10 points.Wisconsin’s governor,\nScott Walker, who is deeply popular with Republicans, has taken a hard line\nagainst abortions. Last year, he signed a bill banning abortions after 20\nweeks of pregnancy, just as he was gearing up to run for president. He bowed\nout of the race last September after failing to gain traction, and this week\nendorsed Mr. Cruz.Mr. Cruz has long attacked Mr. Trump for supporting abortion\nrights in the past, highlighting clips from a 1999 interview in which Mr.\nTrump called himself “very pro-choice” and condemning his positive comments\nabout Planned Parenthood at a debate last month.Mr. Trump said the group did\n“wonderful things” for women’s health, even as he criticized its abortion\nservices.There does not appear to be any record of Mr. Trump’s shift on\nabortion rights before February 2011, the month he spoke at a conservative\nconclave and made clear he was considering running for president the next\nyear.Bruce Haynes, a Republican strategist, said he could not recall “any\ncredible corner of the movement” calling for criminal sanctions against women\nwho sought abortions.Jeanne Mancini, the president of the March for Life\nEducation and Defense Fund, said efforts to punish individual women were\n“completely out of touch with the pro-life movement.”“No pro-lifer would ever\nwant to punish a woman who has chosen abortion,” she said. “We invite a woman\nwho has gone down this route to consider paths to healing, not\npunishment.”Others worried that Mr. Trump had helped fulfill a stereotype of\nthe anti-abortion movement.“He doesn’t understand pro-life people or the life\nissue,” said Penny Nance, the head of the conservative group Concerned Women\nfor America and a supporter of Mr. Cruz. “He instead became the caricature\nthat the left tries to paint us to be.”In Mr. Trump’s struggles, his\nRepublican opponents seem to have sensed an opportunity. Even before the\nlatest controversy, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Kasich had invoked their daughters while\ndiscussing Mr. Trump’s treatment of women.Earlier on Wednesday, Mr. Cruz\nappeared in Madison, Wis., to introduce a “Women for Cruz” coalition. He was\njoined by his wife, Heidi; his mother, Eleanor Darragh, who is seldom seen on\nthe campaign trail; and Carly Fiorina, a high-profile supporter.For much of\nthe event, Mr. Cruz sat quietly behind a modest floral arrangement, allowing\nthe women to speak on his behalf during a forum that seemed aimed at a rival\nwhose name was scarcely mentioned.“I just wanted to say one thing about Ted,”\nHeidi Cruz said near the end. “I want all of the women here in Wisconsin and\nacross this country to know how supportive Ted has always been of all the\nwomen in his life.”\n\n","title":"Donald Trump, Abortion Foe, Eyes ‘Punishment’ for Women, Then Recants - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Donald Trump, under fire, revises comments on abortion \"punishment\" https://t.co/T9Xk0nKflc","date":"Thu Mar 31 09:21:05 +0000 2016","favs":114,"id":{"$numberLong":"715468950474100736"},"retweets":114},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PGO1gV"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01465"},"content":"GENEVA — The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, on Wednesday\nexhorted countries around the world to step up to their responsibilities and\ntake in half a million Syrian refugees, rebuking political leaders who he said\nhad instead resorted to demonizing asylum seekers.Opening a one-day\nministerial conference in Geneva convened by the United Nations refugee\nagency, Mr. Ban called for “an exponential increase in global solidarity” in\nurging countries to accept about 480,000 Syrians over the next three\nyears.“Neighboring countries have done far more than their share,” Mr. Ban\nsaid, alluding to the nearly five million refugees received by Turkey,\nLebanon, Jordan and Iraq. “Others must now step up.”Demonizing refugees and\nmigrants was “not only demeaning, offensive and counterproductive but\nfactually wrong,” Mr. Ban said, emphasizing the skills and other resources\nthey brought to host countries. “I call on leaders to counter fearmongering\nwith reassurance, and to fight inaccurate information with the truth.”The\n480,000 Syrian refugees amount to about 10 percent of those registered in\nsurrounding countries. Counting pledges to resettle 179,000 refugees the\nUnited Nations refugee agency has received since 2013, that meant it was\nlooking for commitments to take an additional 300,000 people.That target\nproved far beyond the scope of the meeting. Mr. Ban’s appeal elicited many\npledges of support and solidarity but adding up the commitments made on\nWednesday, Filippo Grandi, head of the refugee agency, said the meeting had\nraised the number of places pledged for Syrians by some six thousand, although\nother promises could open the way for tens of thousands more.United Nations\nofficials had expected little else, stressing the Geneva meeting marked the\nstart of a longer term process aimed at recalibrating the global response to a\ncrisis that has generated the highest levels of displacement since World War\nII.“Within all the gloom and doom of Syria it was a positive meeting; I come\nout of it with a lot of confidence,” Volker Turk, assistant high commissioner\nof the refugee agency, said. “It has generated a positive momentum for the\nyear.”That is expected to become clear in a series of high level meetings\nlater this year, starting with the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul in\nMay; a summit on the refugee crisis at the General Assembly in New York in\nSeptember; and a summit meeting that President Obama will convene the next\nday, which is intended to generate firm commitments on humanitarian financing\nand refugee resettlement.Still, the studiously general comments ministers and\nofficials delivered in Geneva on Wednesday underscored the gap between the\nhumanitarian needs in what Mr. Ban called the greatest refugee crisis since\n1945 and what governments were prepared to offer.International donors meeting\nin London in February had pledged $12 billion in humanitarian aid for Syrian\nrefugees and the countries receiving them, but Mr. Grandi said less than half\nthe funds had been allocated so far, calling for speedier disbursement.“Much\nmore is needed,” Mr. Grandi told the meeting. European Union countries had not\nshown “the required solidarity” to share the resettlement of refugees, he\nsaid. “We cannot respond to a global refugee crisis by closing doors and\nbuilding fences.”More than a million migrants reached European shores last\nyear, and the European Union has struggled to come up with a coherent and\neffective response.Europe was “ready to take its fair share,” the European\nUnion’s commissioner for migration, Dimitris Avramopoulos, told the\nconference, but he sketched opportunities for resettlement that appeared to\nfall well short of what the United Nations was seeking. Eleven European Union\ncountries had agreed to accept 4,555 refugees under a program established in\nJuly, which would eventually bring in a total of 22,504 people, he said.Mr.\nAvramopoulos also proposed that union member states accept 54,000 Syrians\nunder another program agreed upon last September that provided for relocating\na total of 160,000 refugees.Six months later, that program has relocated just\nseveral hundred people, but Mr. Turk said the European Union statement would\nincrease pressure on Europe to fulfill its commitments. “There is a high\nexpectation this is now going to be delivered in real terms and it’s not just\na fiction,” he said.For the United States, Deputy Secretary of State Heather\nA. Higginbottom said the Obama administration had increased the number of\ninterviewing officials at refugee processing centers in the region so that it\ncould resettle at least 10,000 Syrian refugees by the end of September.The\nRussian deputy foreign minister, Gennady Gatilov, calling on European\ncountries to show more responsibility in dealing with the refugee crisis, said\nMoscow had doubled the number of places for Syrians to receive free university\neducation — to 300.\n\n","title":"U.N.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01466"},"content":"Whether or not New York State’s minimum wage is raised to $15, Steven Alvarado\nwill still see that increase in his paycheck.His employer, Nebraskaland, a\nmeat distribution company in the Bronx, has been voluntarily phasing in the\nhigher wage floor. Mr. Alvarado, a shipping receiver, went from earning $12.50\nto $14 an hour last summer. This July his salary will increase again, to\n$15.“It really makes a big difference,” said Mr. Alvarado, 29, who plans to\nuse the money to buy clothes for his 11-year-old son. “I think everybody needs\nthat extra money.”As Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo pushes for a $15 minimum wage in\nAlbany budget negotiations, the experience of one business in the Bronx\nillustrates the impact that such an increase could have on many companies.\nWhen Nebraskaland decided last year to begin raising its minimum wage to $15\nfrom $10 an hour, more than half of its 234 employees benefited (the rest were\nalready making more). As a result, the company expects to spend an additional\n$350,000 annually on salaries.Richard Romanoff, the owner of Nebraskaland,\nsays he could afford the wage increases, and believes it is the right thing to\ndo for his employees. He also hoped that it would increase employee morale and\nhelp tamp down the turnover among the company’s truck drivers and nighttime\n“selectors,” men who wear insulated suits to protect against the cold working\nconditions and spend hours on their feet lifting boxes to put together\norders.“I’d like us to have an environment here where people like to come to\nwork,” Mr. Romanoff said. “How are you going to sugarcoat working in a freezer\nat night?”If approved by state lawmakers, Mr. Cuomo’s proposal to increase the\nstatewide minimum wage to $15, from $9, could benefit an estimated 2.3 million\nworkers, according to state data. The figure is more than double the federal\nminimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has made it a\ncenterpiece of his agenda and has been touring the state promoting the plan,\nwhich would make New York and California the only states in the country poised\nto make a $15-an-hour minimum wage mandatory.The proposal would extend to\nprivate sector workers the higher wage already given to government and State\nUniversity of New York employees through executive actions by the governor in\nthe past year. A state administrative board appointed by Mr. Cuomo also set a\n$15 hourly wage for fast-food workers last summer.“Raising the minimum wage\nempowers workers with a fair salary, helps them support their families with\ndignity, and grows the economy for all,” Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. “The\nstaff at Nebraskaland joins fast-food workers as well as state and SUNY\nemployees who experience the transformative impact of a living wage, and I\ncommend the company for leading by example.”Supporters of the increase,\nincluding leaders in the Democratically controlled Assembly and labor unions,\nsay that it would benefit workers and local economies. Opponents, including\nmany in the Republican-controlled Senate, counter that it would harm many\nbusinesses, particularly in struggling communities in upstate New York, and\ncould force them to lay off workers, reduce hours and benefits, raise the\nprices of their goods and services, and even relocate to another state, or\nclose altogether.“There’s a big difference between being able to do it because\nthe revenues are there and having it mandated by the state,” said Heather\nBriccetti, president and chief executive of the Business Council of New York\nState, a trade association that represents 2,600 employers, including many\nsmall businesses with fewer than 100 workers.She said many employers around\nthe state already paid their employees significantly more than the minimum\nwage, because market forces dictated higher compensation.Ms. Briccetti, citing\neconomic studies, said that raising the minimum wage could result in more than\n200,000 lost jobs statewide. Instead of an across-the-board wage increase, her\ngroup has called on state leaders to focus their efforts on developing a\ntrained work force for fields that involve science, technology, engineering\nand math, where the demand for better-paying jobs is strong.In response to\nsuch criticisms, the governor’s aides counter that almost every time the state\nhas raised the minimum wage in recent years, there has been a net gain in\njobs. For instance, they said, when the minimum wage was raised to $8.75 from\n$8 an hour in December 2014, there was an overall gain of 115,900 private\nsector jobs in the state from December 2014 to December 2015.The debate over a\n$15 minimum wage has reached Nebraskaland, where workers have argued for and\nagainst it on their lunch breaks. When the company announced that it was\nintroducing the higher wage floor, many new employees were elated, but many\nveterans were not.“I was a little bit upset because I think they should have\nworked a little bit more time like I did,” said Luis Quiles, 40, who started\nat $10 an hour as a forklift driver in 2001. Today, he earns $19 an hour, as a\nshipping receiver. He added, “I opened the doors for them.”Still, Mr. Quiles,\nwho has two teenage sons, said he had come to support the $15 minimum wage for\nboth his company and the rest of the state because it would give his sons a\nbetter start than he had. “If it benefits them, it benefits me, because\nthey’re going to be helping me with the bills,” he said.Mr. Romanoff said that\nbecause of resistance from some employees, the company had decided to phase in\nthe wage increase. Workers who already earned $15 an hour or more received\ntheir regular annual raises, but did not receive any additional bonuses.Mr.\nRomanoff, who got his start dealing in oxtails, beef livers, cow’s feet and\nother cheap meat parts that no one else wanted, rings up more than $450\nmillion a year, in sales to supermarkets, stores and wholesale companies in\neight states. The company is based in a 100,000-square-foot warehouse in Hunts\nPoint, where animal heads are mounted on the walls and nearly every aspect of\nthe operation has been computerized to improve efficiency while moving an\naverage of two million pounds of meat a day.Since new workers have to be\ntrained to use the technology, retention of employees is important; the\ncompany loses time and money when they leave, Mr. Romanoff said. He has taken\nother steps to show his employees that they are appreciated, he said,\nincluding providing generous health and retirement benefits, annual raises,\nclean bathrooms, and free turkeys and pork shoulders at Christmas.The wage\nincrease, at least so far, has not had a measurable impact on retention for\nthe company’s hardest-to-fill jobs. In the first quarter of this year, 35\npeople, including 16 night selectors and 11 drivers, left the company, up from\n27 during the same period last year.Alissa Marcus, Nebraskaland’s human\nresources manager, attributed the higher turnover, in part, to more people\nbeing fired for safety violations and other infractions.In addition, she said,\nthe wage increase has helped attract more potential employees, some of whom\nearned $2 to $3 less per hour doing the same job elsewhere. Last year, she had\nso few applicants for night selectors that she had to recruit at job fairs and\nhand out fliers in the community. This year, she has 48 applicants for six\nopen positions.Mr. Romanoff said he had no regrets about raising the minimum\nwage at his company, but stopped short of saying there should be an increase\nstatewide.“For me it’s good, but I’m in no position to judge other companies,”\nhe said. “I know people who are happy to have a job for $10 an hour.”\n\n","title":"As New York Debates $15 Minimum Wage, a Bronx Company Makes It a Reality - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTMetro: As New York debates $15 minimum wage, a company in the Bronx has made it a reality: https://t.co/SSnnRBW7np https://t.co/9m0T…","date":"Thu Mar 31 08:17:25 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715452928891424768"},"retweets":60},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PFLWBH"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01467"},"content":"BUDAPEST, Hungary — Imre Kertesz, the Hungarian writer who won the 2002 Nobel\nPrize for Literature for a body of fiction largely drawn from his experience\nas a teenage prisoner in Nazi concentration camps, died Thursday. He was\n86.Book publishing firm Magveto Kiado said Kertesz died at 4 a.m. at his\nBudapest home after a long illness.Hungarian President Janos Ader said\nKertesz's life was a \"gift\" to all those who loved, knew, read and understood\nhim.\"Like no one else, he saw so sharply and made others see so exactly the\nnature of dictatorships, 'the age of irrationality,'\" Ader said in a letter to\nthe writer's family. \"He knew that the lack of external freedom can be endured\nonly with the freedom of spirit.\"He taught us that we should not forget\nanything about our past because it all belongs to our common fate, our common\nfatelessness,\" Ader said.Prime Minister Viktor Orban praised Kertesz's\n\"timeless\" literary oeuvre.\"With his world-famous writing, he showed that\nman's will to live and desire for freedom cannot be defeated by any tyranny,\"\nOrban said.Tribute was also paid to Kertesz in Germany, where he lived for a\nlong time before returning to Hungary a few years ago.\"Through his work, Imre\nKertesz brought a new tone to the remembrance of the darkest years of our\nhistory,\" said Germany's culture minister, Monika Gruetters. \"As a witness, he\nwrote with great literary mastery of his harrowing experiences at the\nconcentration camp. His books ... are his legacy and will remain unforgotten\nand haunting history books for future generations.\"In a statement, Gruetters\nnoted \"the esteem that he showed for Germans despite his bitter experiences,\"\nwhich she said found \"noble expression\" in his decision to entrust his archive\nto the Academy of Arts in Berlin.Born in Budapest on Nov. 9, 1929, Kertesz,\nwas 14 when he was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp in German-\noccupied Poland in June 1944. He later was transferred to the Buchenwald camp\nfrom where he was liberated in 1945.\"As a child you have a certain trust in\nlife. But when something like Auschwitz happens, everything falls apart,\" he\nonce said.Yet Kertesz made a startling confession that he experienced \"my most\nradical moments of happiness\" at Auschwitz.\"You cannot imagine what it's like\nto be allowed to lie in the camp's hospital, or to have a 10-minute break from\nindescribable labor,\" he told Newsweek magazine in a 2002 interview. \"To be\nvery close to death is also a kind of happiness. Just surviving becomes the\ngreatest freedom of all.\"After returning to his native Budapest, Kertesz eked\nout a living as a journalist and translator.Distrusted by the communist\nauthorities who ruled Hungary after World War II, he spent his time\ntranslating into Hungarian the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud,\nLudwig Wittgenstein and Elias Canetti in a small apartment overlooking the\nDanube River.Influenced by the existentialist novels of Albert Camus and Jean-\nPaul Sartre, Kertesz was fascinated by the fate of the individual in an often\ntotalitarian environment, where others decided his destiny.\"I am a non-\nbelieving Jew,\" Kertesz once said in an interview. \"Yet as a Jew I was taken\nto Auschwitz. I belong to those Jews whom Auschwitz turned into\nJews.\"\"Fateless,\" the novel that together with other works brought him the\n2002 Nobel, finally appeared in 1975 after a decade-long struggle to have it\npublished.It was largely ignored, both by the communist authorities and the\npublic, in a country where awareness of the Holocaust remained negligible,\ndespite the murder of around 500,000 Hungarian Jews by the Nazis and their\nHungarian henchmen.According to Kertesz, the quasi-taboo status suffered by\n\"Fateless\" for so long may have been because the book also reflected Hungary's\ntotalitarian communist system.\"I wrote 'Fateless' about the Kadar regime,\"\nKertesz said in an interview with the Hungarian weekly Elet es Irodalom,\nreferring to communist dictator Janos Kadar, who ruled Hungary until shortly\nbefore the democratic changes of 1990.\"Whoever lived in the Hungary of the\n1970s had to notice immediately that the author (of \"Fateless\") knew the\npresent and despised it,\" Kertesz said.To Kertesz, the process of adaptaing to\nthe Holocaust described in his book could as well be applied to what happened\nto people in Hungary after the failed anti-communist revolution of 1956. In\nits citation for the Nobel Prize, the Swedish Academy also recognized this\nelement of Kertesz's writing.\"Kertesz's message is that to live is to\nconform,\" the academy said. \"Individual experience seems useless as soon as it\nis considered in the light of the needs and interests of the human\ncollective.\"Others said Kertesz's work could be seen as a study of all\nrepressive regimes.\"Kertesz's significance was that in some sense he\nformulated the essence of totalitarianism,\" said Gabor T. Szanto, a writer and\neditor of Szombat, a Jewish cultural magazine.Numerous other novels,\ncontinuing the themes of the Holocaust, dictatorship and personal freedom,\nappeared throughout the 1980s and 1990s, winning Kertesz professional respect\nbut not a wider audience.That changed when he won the Nobel, which suddenly\npropelled him to domestic and international fame.His infrequent personal\nappearances in Hungary in wake of the Nobel Prize were a massive success, with\nhundreds of people standing in line for hours to get his autograph on their\ncopies of his books.In his Nobel acceptance speech, Kertesz claimed with\ntypical self-irony that he wrote only for himself. \"I didn't have an audience\nand didn't want to influence anyone,\" he said.In literary circles, he was\nregarded as a jovial companion, with a harsh, no-nonsense critical eye. A\ntypical gesture was his refusal to support a statue being raised in his honor\nalongside that of other Hungarian Nobel winners.Still, Kertesz's Nobel\nvictory, making him the first Hungarian to win the literature prize, caused\ngreat resentment among some Hungarians who would have preferred that a non-\nJewish countryman get the honor instead.\"Fateless,\" however, was later\nincorporated into Hungary's high school curriculum and Kertesz was awarded\nseveral state honors.Kertesz described \"Liquidation,\" published in 2003, as\nhis \"last novel about the Holocaust.\"Set during Hungary's transition from\ncommunism to democracy in 1989, he said it was about \"people who did not\nexperience the Holocaust directly — the second generation, who still have to\ndeal with the Holocaust.\"Among his other books were \"Fiasco\" (1988) and\n\"Kaddish for a Child Not Born\" (1990) — which formed a trilogy with \"Fateless\"\n— \"Someone Else\" (1997), \"The K File\" (2006), an autobiographical novel, and\n\"Europe's Depressing Heritage\" (2008).Magveto Kiado said that during the last\nmonths of his life, even while ill, Kertesz helped prepare \"The Viewer,\" a\nselection of his diary entries between 1991 and 2001 which was published this\nmonth in Hungary.A film version of \"Fateless,\" directed by Lajos Koltai and\nfor which Kertesz wrote the screenplay, premiered in Hungary in 2005.He is\nsurvived by his second wife, Magda.___Geir Moulson in Berlin contributed to\nthis report.\n\n","title":"Nobel Literature Laureate Imre Kertesz Dies at 86 - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Nobel Literature Laureate Imre Kertesz Dies at 86 https://t.co/ReoDk3XIJi","date":"Thu Mar 31 08:05:02 +0000 2016","favs":102,"id":{"$numberLong":"715449812406181888"},"retweets":100},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22QXTRW"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01468"},"content":"For some buyers confronted with the high cost of New York City real estate,\nmoving to the suburbs is a no-brainer. The prospect of more space for the\nmoney, a grassy yard and a less crowded public school outweighs the longer\ncommute, the need for a car (or two) and the limited food-delivery options.\nOther buyers, however, would rather squeeze their growing family into a studio\nthan abandon city life.For those on the fence, there are a host of new real\nestate services to help with the decision.Some New York City real estate\nagents have teamed up with their counterparts outside the five boroughs for\norganized seminars and “immersive tours” of the suburbs. The city agents get a\ncut of the commission if their clients decide to buy a house in the suburbs.\nThe services, which reside somewhere between shrink session and sales pitch,\nintend to address the concerns of families unsure about leaving the city and\nguide them to suburbia, step by step.“I’ve been referring to these people as\nreluctant urban defectors, because they don’t want to leave,” said Oliver\nGold, a salesman at Douglas Elliman who, along with his business partner,\nHelen Arden, has been creating custom tours of the suburbs for city clients.\n“It is a real weighing of the pros and cons: ‘Can I live in that three-\nbedroom, fourth-floor walk-up with one bathroom, or do I want to make the\nmove?’ ” he said, summing up the debate. “I tell everyone that brings this up\nto me, ‘We don’t revoke your citizenship when you go to the suburbs. You’re\nallowed back.’ ”Suburban Jungle, a real estate advisory firm that works with\ncity dwellers to find the right suburb for their lifestyle, is offering a\nseries of “Suburb Stroller Tours” over the next three months, introducing them\nto popular towns in Westchester County, Connecticut, Long Island and New\nJersey. For $35 a person, participants tour the downtown area and learn about\nthe “personality of the town” from locals over a three-course lunch at a\n“stroller-friendly” restaurant.On May 25, Jessica Fields and Alexandra Foucard\nof Warren Lewis Sotheby’s International Realty in Park Slope, Brooklyn, will\nhost “Beyond Brooklyn,” their third event in a series aimed at clients who are\npriced out of Brownstone Brooklyn but are not sure where to begin looking\nbeyond the city. “With our agency connections to real estate agents all over\nthe region, we wanted to bring the realtor’s insight into the other local\noptions to our neighbors here,” said Ms. Fields, who offered a similar seminar\nin October for roughly 50 home searchers, after having to turn people away at\na previous talk in June. “It was clear we hit a nerve.”At the October event,\nfour agents who had made the move from the city to the suburbs themselves\npresented overviews of real estate options in Long Island, Westchester County,\nFairfield County, Conn., and Essex County, N.J., to a mix of couples in\nbusiness suits and parents with babies in slings and toddlers on iPads. The\noverall message: Life isn’t so terrible in the ‘burbs.In addition to\nhighlighting the better real estate values, each broker emphasized the\ncultural attractions, farmers’ markets and culinary options of their\nrespective neighborhoods, often drawing comparisons to New York City.“The\nParamount draws huge headliner acts from around the country,” said Cindy\nHammerquist, an agent who moved from Park Slope to Huntington, N.Y., on the\nnorth shore of Long Island, in 2010. “The Cinema Arts Center is an Angelika\ntheater-type place, and they have organic popcorn with real butter.” Ms.\nHammerquist also pointed out that she still shops at Fairway, this time in\nnearby Plainview, just as she did in Red Hook, Brooklyn, and buys house-\nroasted coffee “served by a guy with a big beard in a plaid shirt,” which drew\na laugh from the crowd.While some families moving to the suburbs want to\nreplicate a semblance of their former urban lifestyle, many are happy to\nescape the excruciating process of securing a spot in a good New York City\nschool. Joan O’Rourke Tuckman had no intention of leaving the city. After all,\nshe and her husband, Joe Tuckman, an advertising sales executive, rented a\n$4,200-a-month two-bedroom on the Upper West Side just two doors down from a\ntop public school. “In my eyes, we had the best deal in the world and we never\nneeded to leave,” said Ms. Tuckman, who had worked in advertising sales before\ntaking time off to be with her son, Ryan.Circumstances changed last year when\nRyan was wait-listed for kindergarten because the school did not have enough\nopen seats. So the couple began looking outside the city and, working with\nLois Lehman, a real estate agent at William Raveis, closed in January on a\n$1.06 million four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath in Fairfield, Conn.“It was\nvery hard for me to leave,” Ms. Tuckman said, noting that she had an enlarged\nphotograph of the noisy city corner where they had lived hanging in a central\nspot in their new suburban living room. But she admits she was glad when she\nfinally moved. “I was the happiest person this summer,” she said.Ms. Tuckman’s\ntransformation is common for New York City expats in suburbia, according to\nMs. Lehman, the Tuckmans’ broker. “There’s a certain resistance to the white\npicket fence and the suburban lifestyle,” she said. “Joan dealt with that.”To\nreach more families like the Tuckmans, the New York City office of William\nRaveis held an event in November, called “City or Suburbs: Should I Stay or\nShould I Go?” They invited as a speaker Clara Hemphill, the editor of\nInsideschools.org, a project at the New School that offers profiles of city\nschools. Her advice: Move to the suburbs because you want to live there, not\nbecause you think it will be good for your children. By the time they are 11,\nthey will want to be back in the city anyway.William Raveis offers to connect\nprospective buyers with agents at the firm’s suburban offices. “It’s almost\nlike a personal shopping concierge for your real estate experience outside of\nNew York City,” said Kathy Braddock, a managing director of the New York City\noffice. “We oversee the whole process with their input. We get a sense of who\nthey are and know the matches to make vis-à-vis the community.”Brokerage firms\nsee an opportunity right now, as prices in leafy suburban communities look\nincreasingly attractive compared with the skyrocketing expense of buying in\nthe city. “While the Manhattan market has soared in the last few years, the\nsuburban markets remained relatively unchanged, so a lot of people are saying,\n‘Is it time to at least think about moving out to the suburbs?’ ” said Mr.\nGold of Douglas Elliman.In the fourth quarter of 2015, the median price in\nManhattan was $1.15 million, up 36.1 percent from $845,000 in the same period\nin 2010, according to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm\nMiller Samuel. The median in Brooklyn was $650,000, up 36.8 percent over the\nsame five-year span. By contrast the median fourth-quarter prices remained\nrelatively unchanged during the same period in Westchester ($425,000 versus\n$450,000), Fairfield ($385,000 versus $380,000), and Nassau Counties ($435,000\nversus $405,000).Business has been so successful for Suburban Jungle  that the\nseven-year-old firm opened offices in San Francisco and Chicago last year.\nClients fill out a probing questionnaire: Where did each of you grow up and\nwhat did you love/hate about each place? Tell us about your ideal commute.\nWhat are the things most important to you in a town/community? Describe your\n“ideal school setting.”Afterward, they are assigned a “suburb strategist” —\nwho is not a real estate agent and therefore, the company says, is more\nobjective — to suggest some towns to explore. “They don’t care if you end up\nin Everett, N.J., or Rye,” said Alison Bernstein, the founder of Suburban\nJungle. Instead of trying to sell you a piece of property, she said, the\nstrategist focuses on the bigger picture: “How do you want to raise your\nfamily?”There is no fee for this service. Clients are later referred to\noutside real estate agents in their chosen towns who have been vetted by\nSuburban Jungle, which gets a cut of the commission if the agent sells a\nhome.“We weren’t sure where we wanted to live, and they were really helpful in\nnarrowing it down,” said Amanda Allen, 33. Ms. Allen moved to Old Greenwich,\nConn., from Manhattan earlier this month with her husband, Edward, 42, who\nworks in finance, and Grayson, their 2-year-old son.After selling their one-\nbedroom co-op in Greenwich Village about a year ago, the Allens, who are\nexpecting their second child in May, had hoped to use the profit to buy a\nlarger apartment in the city. “About a year ago we put in a bid for a two-\nbedroom,” said Mr. Allen. “It went for $350,000 over ask.” In the meantime,\nthey rented a two-bedroom near Lincoln Center.“Neither of us really wanted to\nlive in the suburbs,” he said. They came across Suburban Jungle while\nattending a baby industry event last May and spent an hour and a half on the\nphone with a consultant who sent them town reports on Harrison and Rye in\nWestchester County and Darien and Greenwich in Fairfield County.“They could\ntell us more than a broker is legally allowed to tell us,” Mr. Allen said.\n“Because they were moms living there with their kids,” he added, the\nstrategists not only knew which areas were zoned for good public middle\nschools, “they knew which roads you don’t want to live on because the traffic\nis heavy.” He added, “It was like getting an insider’s perspective.”After\nruling out Westchester because of high taxes, they narrowed their search to\nOld Greenwich for its “proper Main Street,” good schools and proximity to the\nwater.In January, they closed on a five-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath for about\n$2 million. Owning the house, which is on a quarter acre that backs onto\nGreenwich Cove, “is far cheaper than renting the two-bedroom in the city,” Mr.\nAllen pointed out. After they moved in last month, neighbors started showing\nup with gifts. “They brought us flowers. We had a welcome book,” said Mrs.\nAllen. “When we moved into our Ninth Street co-op we certainly did not get\nthat — just a list of what our hours of construction would be.”\n\n","title":"From the City to the ‘Burbs, Step-by-Step - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Moving from the city to the 'burbs, step-by-step https://t.co/K7JCK3Hldx via @nytrealestate https://t.co/Uu6tF5UYDB","date":"Thu Mar 31 08:01:17 +0000 2016","favs":137,"id":{"$numberLong":"715448867806908416"},"retweets":58},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21Tm10o"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01469"},"content":"**PART 1**YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio — Numbered balls of chance rattle and rise two nights a week down at the cavernous community hall of Sts. Peter and Paul Ukrainian Orthodox Church. It’s called a good bingo when your number comes up.But that last Saturday before Christmas offered no good bingos. The night was reserved for a boxing event billed as Season’s Beatings, which had prompted a newspaper deliveryman named Anthony Taylor to pull up in his clattering Dodge Caravan. Twenty-four years old, 5 feet tall, 115 pounds, about to turn pro.A fist of nerves, he walked down the glazed-tile stairwell to the finished basement, a space used for church dances and wedding banquets, but now an open locker room. Chandeliers glittered above the fighters trying to warm up and calm down, while the crowds upstairs cheered on the amateurs, including a sleepy-eyed 11-year-old who would knock out his grade-school opponent.Taylor had longed for this moment. All those years of being picked on because of his size, all those street fights, all that anger needing redirection toward something constructive — all down to this. He had his hair in ropy dreadlocks and his tiger-patterned shorts, custom-made for $300, pulled high on his hardened torso.Portable curtains in the basement separated the hometown favorites from the out-of-towners, the A’s from the B’s. Someone smart about boxing could walk in cold and tell which side was which. The local fighters are usually a notch above, in better shape, expected to win.But Taylor’s been-around trainer, Jack Loew, heard this hammering sound, a _whap, whap, whap-whap_, from the curtain’s other side. He peeked and saw a sinewy teenager in red-and-white shorts pounding the outstretched mitts of his trainer with uncommon discipline. _Whap-whap._“We got a fighter,” Loew said to somebody.Taylor was on his own side of the divide, warming up, when the curtain briefly parted to reveal his opponent. They made eye contact.“Nothing like anger,” Taylor recalled. “Both nervous. Just looking at each other.”The curtain closed._**A Life of Taking Punches and Unleashing His Own**_“Five foot even.” That’s how Anthony Taylor describes his height. Not a half-inch higher or lower. Five foot even.When you’re 9 inches shorter than the average man, abuse will find you. But Taylor was determined from an early age to prove his true stature the only way he knew. “Street fighting,” he says.His mother, an assembly-line factory worker, and his father, a handyman, split up before he was in kindergarten, so he bounced around a little. Moving from the small Ohio city of Warren to Youngstown, then down to Jackson, Tenn., he learned that broken families were tough on children, and that bullies were ubiquitous.“I was always the smallest guy in the neighborhood, so I had a lot of people picking on me,” Taylor said. “I really didn’t go around looking for trouble. It just seemed to find me because I was so small.”“And I had a bad attitude,” he added.One day the manager of a gym in Jackson saw this small angry kid giving as good as he got, and invited him to do something with those quick hands and quicker rage. The kid began to learn.“Somebody hit you, hit you really hard, and you want to do something back,” Taylor said. “But when you think about it, you can’t fight when you’re angry. Boxing is a thinking game.”Taylor followed the amateur circuit — Florida, Alabama, Arkansas, Nevada — earning a reputation as a boxer who kept on coming. At a fight one night in Little Rock, his trainer called out, “Go get him, Tiger.” The nickname stuck.He tried a semester of community college, but higher education wasn’t for him, at least not yet. Sometimes the classes would run over time, and he’d be late to the gym. College could wait, he figured; boxing could not. He had his career goals.“To be at the top of the ladder,” he said. “Number one. Champion.”Missing his family back north, Taylor returned to Ohio. He lives with his fiancée, Tiera Glover, their 3-year-old daughter and her two sons in Warren, in a worn house with green plastic furniture planted under the porch’s sagging roof.They cover the $600 monthly rent by delivering 250 copies of The Tribune Chronicle, a Warren newspaper, every morning. And every afternoon, except on days when he can’t afford the gas, Taylor drives his knocking Dodge Caravan, with its car seat and little girl toys, the 20 miles to Youngstown — to Jack Loew’s South Side Boxing Club, his cinder-block sanctuary, where boxing gloves hang from nails like holiday ornaments.The club stands out along a beat-up stretch of Market Street. Some years ago, its owner, Jack Loew, hired a resident of a nearby halfway house for convicts to paint the exterior red and black. The artist also painted a pair of boxing gloves, enveloped in a wreath of stars that can convey dreamlike glory or a concussive haze.Loew is 56, Youngstown-born, and as squat and solid as his building. He boxed as an amateur before focusing on a college football career that ended after several knee operations. He became a Teamster, lost the warehouse job he thought would last to retirement, worked construction and started his own asphalt-sealing company.He also opened this club in 1989, as if in homage to what his hometown had once been. Youngstown was a pugnacious steel city of 167,000 when Loew was born, with boxing clubs anchored in many neighborhoods. This is where his childhood friend Ray Mancini — Boom Boom — learned how to become a world lightweight champion.A half-century later, Youngstown is down to a population of 65,000, a hemorrhaging of 100,000 people caused by steel-plant closings, a failure to diversify and the absence, so far, of a sustainable second act. Lost in the exodus were some signature parts of the Youngstown culture, including many boxing clubs.But Loew took a shot. He opened his gym on Southern Boulevard, moved to an ancient brick building on Erie Street, then settled here, on the city’s tough south side. No problems so far, save for that time someone removed a massive tractor tire from the gym and rolled it like a determined Sisyphus up and down the hilly neighborhood — only to return the tire the next day. His excuse was simple: Just wanted to see if I could do it, Coach.Two decades ago, a scrappy 9-year-old kid from the south side’s Slovak neighborhood came to Loew’s gym looking to learn how to box. This kid, Kelly Pavlik, went on to become the Ghost, an electrifying, dominant boxer with a drinking problem. He abruptly quit in 2013, saying he feared the long-term medical impact of his chosen career.“Kelly picked my door to come through,” said Loew, who is called Coach Jack by his boxers. “We were always crowded, but when we won middleweight champion of the world. …”No need to finish the sentence: Pavlik’s success was good for Jack Loew’s South Side Boxing Club. It attracted a lot of locals looking to make their mark, including a superflyweight named Anthony Taylor.“A 115-pound Joe Frazier,” Loew said. This is boxing code for saying that Taylor keeps coming at you, takes a punch to give a punch, and has fists that hit like anvils.Taylor couldn’t remain an amateur forever. Loew needed to find him a professional opponent, maybe for the Season’s Beatings event that he had set up for the week before Christmas at the Ukrainian hall. But flyweights and bantamweights — who weigh less than half the reigning heavyweight champion, Tyson Fury — are hard to come by in this part of the country.A couple of weeks before Christmas, though, a trainer from Detroit who was bringing in two amateurs for the boxing night offered a solution. He said that he could supply a flyweight who, like Taylor, was itching to turn pro._**Two Partners Engaging in a Dangerous Dance**_The ding of a bell in a church hall transformed two slight young men into professional fighters, hired to withstand blows to body and head while trying to pound each other out of consciousness. Their pay for the four-round fight: $300 for Taylor and $500 for his 19-year-old opponent, since he was coming in from 200 miles away.Moments earlier they had stood with heads bowed, their coaches massaging their backs as the referee went over final details. Then they had tapped gloves, a gesture conveying good-luck solidarity between strangers, known to each other only through a stolen glance across that parted curtain.Anthony Taylor danced the cautionary dance with his partner, head bobbing, looking for a moment to strike. He prided himself on his patience. But when the opponent tested with a tentative, catlike thrust, Taylor responded with a wild swing that punched only air, betraying his overeagerness.Then came a split-second scrum, left right left right. Violent contact made. The crowd aahed in approval.More than 700 people had turned out. Loew, the promoter as well as Taylor’s trainer, had charged $20 for general admission and $50 for ringside, while also managing to sell more than two dozen corporate tables. But after covering expenses that included the referee, the hall and ring rentals, and the hotel rooms for out-of-town boxers, Loew would take in just $382 for his eight weeks of work.At least his choice of location and timing — a Ukrainian church hall in late December — ensured a festive touch to the boxing event. A decorated Christmas tree sparkled in the corner. A blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flag hung over the water fountain. A Christmas wreath and bright lights hung beside signs that said, “Valid Bingo Is Ball Called — Not Off Monitor” and “Early Bird Winner Take All.”Instead of calls of “B-14” and “O-66,” though, there arose the grunts of boxers, the whacks of leather against flesh, the cries and sighs of spectators in thrall. Some of the loudest shouts came from Taylor’s friends and family members.“Come on, Ant’! You got this!”Taylor crouched as he stalked, making his 5-foot frame even smaller before springing like a jack-in-the-box. He connected with a left that sent his opponent back, and kept on coming.He ducked under a swing, came over the top and delivered another left that knocked the fighter in red and white down into the ropes. As Taylor retreated to his corner, fans were shouting: “He’s done, he’s done! Stop the fight!”Seconds later, Taylor struck again. “His guard came down, and I hit him with a straight left hand,” he recalled. A second knockdown, although this time his opponent got up quickly, adjusting his trunks as if the fall had been nothing more than a wardrobe malfunction.Then Taylor found himself reeling backward, almost comically, after taking a hard left to the head. He responded with a punch that he thought connected for a delayed knockdown; others saw more of a phantom punch and stumble.Still, Loew recalled, “If the ref had stopped the fight, I don’t think anyone would have complained.”The bell clanged. Taylor slumped to his corner, exhausted from all that he had expended trying to end the fight. He drank some water and listened to encouraging words from Loew, who struggled to be heard over the _boom-boom-hiss_ music pounding out of the sound system. Then, again, came the bell’s beckoning.Taylor found his opponent waiting for him at the center of the ring, as if awakened by the knockdowns of the previous round. Soon there came a left that bounced Taylor off the ring’s blue-and-red ropes.“Anthony!” someone pleaded.But Taylor could not yet find the wind or strength. “I threw out a lot of gas in the first round by me trying to finish him off,” he said later. “You’re trying to hurry up and get done with the fight. And that’s where the turnaround was in the second round.”“Knock him out,” someone in Taylor’s corner shouted.Then: “Get him! Get him!”And: “Let’s go, Tiger!”And: “Put him down, Ant’!”Taylor took quick rights to the jaw, another hard right that rocked him, then a left and a right. Gloved fists pounded his many tattoos: the “R.I.P.” on his right shoulder that honors a brother shot to death (“Wrong place, wrong time,” he says); the skull-and-diamond on his left shoulder that reminds him he’s a jewel in the rough; the dice and playing cards adorning his chest, along with the inscription:“Life A Gamble.”_**Tension and Triumph, Confusion and Dread**_The bell.Another squirt of water. More of Coach Jack’s encouragement, only now sounding urgent. The passing blur of a young woman holding aloft a placard announcing Round 3.The bell.And there was Taylor’s opponent again, at the center of the ring, waiting.Taylor connected with a roundhouse left, but his opponent returned with a hard-right insult to the chin. Taylor seemed flat-footed, almost disengaged, as if exhaustion had displaced his purpose.“Let’s go, little man!” someone called out. But Taylor’s coach was more concrete. “Breathe, breathe!” Loew was shouting. “You gotta push it, Anthony!”Taylor did revive, holding his own until the bell. He was convinced the round was a tossup, but his coach knew otherwise. “Anthony was gassed in the third round, and took an ass-whipping,” Loew said.Now it was the fourth and last round, the final three minutes, and there again was his opponent, waiting. Taylor knew this was it — “an all-or-nothing thing,” he called it.His dreadlocks swayed as he danced and dodged, as he punched and received punches. It went this way, a study in mundane violence, for most of the first two minutes. Toe to toe.But then Taylor suddenly had his opponent near the ropes. He threw a right that either glanced off the boxer or missed him entirely. The opponent fell backward to all but sit on the apron.Trying to capitalize, Taylor threw a left. But the opponent ducked to his right and stumbled forward, head sweeping briefly against Taylor’s chest, arms outstretched, looking for something to hold on to, as if the blue mat had been pulled from beneath him. He looped his left arm around Taylor’s torso as he fell onto his right knee, his lower body gone limp, his black gloves down in sudden vulnerability.The referee waved his arms. Fight over! He bent down to help the opponent, who reached up with his right hand. Halfway to his feet, the boxer wobbled and fell back down.The sudden uncertainty disrupted the order in the ring. The opponent’s coach had slipped through the ropes and was now trying to help his fighter, who struggled again to rise, only to sway and fall back against his coach’s shins._My knee_, he was saying. _My knee_.Loew was also in the ring, yelling to Bernie Profato, the director of the Ohio Athletic Commission, sitting at ringside, that the round hadn’t ended, and you can’t have people coming into the ring, and that was a knockdown. …“Your kid’s gotta hit him for a knockdown,” Profato called back.Mere noise. The fight was over.The opponent lay on his back as some people hovered over him, including the ringside doctor — a dermatologist — now slipping on a pair of surgical gloves. Taylor, meanwhile, knew only that he had won. He raised an arm and took a few courtly bows.But a shadow of dread was settling over this decorated bingo hall masquerading as a boxing arena. A fallen man was not rising, not rising, still not rising. His eyes were closed. Medics were climbing into the ring.“You knew,” Loew said. “You knew right then and there.”You knew right then and there. The loser, this kid from Michigan named Hamzah Aljahmi, now 0-1, was unconscious. And the winner, Anthony Taylor, now 1-0, was sobbing.**PART 2**DEARBORN, Mich. — The amateur boxer slept. Huddled in the passenger seat of his family’s sport utility vehicle, he rocked in slumber as his father drove out of Dearborn, then south and east around Lake Erie, verses from the Quran intoning softly from the speakers.Now and then the boxer would rouse long enough for a snatch of small talk. But soon his eyes would close again, and he would sleep through the December blur of Rust Belt towns and rust-colored fields, right to the edge of the Ohio city where he was to fight his first professional fight.Youngstown.This was Hamzah Aljahmi, 19, the oldest child and best friend of the man behind the wheel, Ali Aljahmi. The disabled-parking permit dangling from the rearview mirror hinted of the father’s middle-age worries, but no matter how bad things got, he knew that he could always confide in this beautiful man-child beside him, sleeping now to the rutted-road rhythms.How could he deny his son’s passionate dream to box his way to fame and fortune? To become the pride of Dearborn? Of Yemeni people everywhere? This was Hamzah’s destiny: to make his professional debut at a Christmastime boxing event called Season’s Beatings.Hamzah’s father had followed a different path. Born in Yemen, he had immigrated to Brooklyn, left high school without graduating — joked around too much, he says — and begun a life of manual labor. Store work. Factory work. Lifting and moving.He gravitated to Dearborn, the world headquarters of the Ford Motor Company, where two-fifths of the nearly 100,000 residents are Arab-American: Lebanese, Syrian, Iraqi, Palestinian, Yemeni. Here are the Henry Ford museum and the Arab American National Museum, plants that make the F-150 truck and restaurants that make fahsa, a seasoned lamb stew that is shared with others and scooped with torn pieces of flatbread.Now Ali Aljahmi was the married father of five, disabled by a job-related injury and living in a working-class neighborhood, a block from a massive factory. But he was an Aljahmi, a member of a fiercely proud extended Yemeni family with deep roots in two cultures. The Aljahmis, the Eljahmis, the Algahmis, the Aljahims — all there for him, and he for them.Above all, he was there for Hamzah, his elder son, the boxer.Years earlier, when the family was living in Detroit, three kids ganged up on skinny young Hamzah Aljahmi. The boy held his own in the mismatch, prompting an onlooker to give grudging respect: Your son is one tough character.Sensing a purpose in life, Hamzah began training with one of his idols, Brian Mihtar, a prominent Yemeni-American middleweight boxer known as Brian the Lion, who compiled a 13-1 record, with 10 knockouts, before suspending his career in 2010. He took a liking to this fledgling boxer, who showed both talent and heart.“Like a brother,” Mihtar said.When Mihtar closed his gym, Aljahmi and his father searched the Detroit area for someone who could make the boy pro-worthy someday. They eventually chose Mohamed Hamood, or Coach Mo, a muscular former Marine with a shaved head who builds houses to support his family and his boxing fix.The amateur’s determination and focus impressed Hamood. The boy had phenomenal hand speed, an ability to slip punches, and surprising pop for a flyweight. But his tendency to fight with his chin up often left him dangerously exposed; it was almost as if he were daring to be hit.Still, Hamood said, “a very hard worker — very hard.”Hamzah Aljahmi fought more than a score of amateur matches, winning most and learning from all. Turning pro became his obsession, his father said: “All the time, his mind go to the boxing.”He admired the ferocious boxers of Yemeni blood. Sadam Ali, the tough welterweight from Brooklyn. Mohamed Adam, the young superfeatherweight from Dearborn. His former coach, the Lion, Brian Mihtar. And, of course, Prince Naseem, whose image even served for a while as the wallpaper on Aljahmi’s smartphone.True, the young man had other interests. He attended prayer services. Doted on his mother and younger siblings. Abided high school, barely. Kept girls at a safe but friendly distance. Worked at a Tim Horton’s doughnut shop and then at the American Coney Island restaurant, serving hot dogs smothered in chili and onions.But it was boxing that defined him. He craved cranberry juice, shunned bread and spent most of his spare time in Hamood’s gym, in Dearborn Heights, working out, sparring with heavier partners, itching to fight for a living.“He was bugging me to go pro when he was 17,” Hamood, 55, recalled. “And I’d say, ‘Let’s take our time.’ ”Some friends and relatives approached the inherent violence of Aljahmi’s passion delicately, occasionally suggesting that he give up the ring. Others accepted that he knew who he was, and admired him for it. He talked of becoming champion and parlaying his hard-won fame in a way that would help others in need — in war-ravaged Yemen and beyond.Remember when he helped to collect clothes for Syrian refugees? And somehow persuaded his father to donate his three favorite coats?Remember that saying he used to repeat? “You laugh at me because I’m different; I laugh at you because you’re all the same.”Mohammad Yacoubi, 19, a classmate of Aljahmi’s and one of his closest friends, shrugged in mock surrender while trying to explain the young man’s charms. He had no enemies, he was respectful to his mother and father, he loved his siblings, and he was loyal to his friends.“Just a special kid,” Yacoubi said.Opportunity came in early December, when Coach Mo Hamood struck a deal to have Aljahmi fight in Youngstown against another amateur who was also turning pro. “He was ready,” Hamood said of his young flyweight.Aljahmi girded for the day. After telling his father that a door had opened, he posted a photograph on Instagram of his application for a Michigan boxing license, along with a note sharing the date of his debut fight — “DECEMBER 19th” — and asking people to come support him.“Alhamdulillah.” Praise be to God._**Making Final Preparations and Planning to Celebrate**_As the S.U.V. approached the outskirts of Youngstown, some three hours after leaving Dearborn, Hamzah Aljahmi stirred into consciousness. Looking around, he said that it was his turn to drive.His father laughed but surrendered the wheel.Father and son headed to the prefight weigh-in at a government building in downtown Youngstown. The younger Aljahmi’s yes-sir-no-sir manner impressed the director of the Ohio Athletic Commission, a retired police officer and former referee named Bernie Profato — so much so that Profato told him, win or lose, “You’ll be welcome back in Ohio anytime.”After the weigh-in, Aljahmi joined his coach and the two amateurs from Dearborn, including an 11-year-old with a preternatural punching ability, for some carbo-loading at a Carrabba’s Italian restaurant, not far from their rooms at the Red Roof Inn. Aljahmi had pasta with cream sauce.Before the night was over, the eager boxer posted one last photograph of himself on Instagram. Big smile. Throwing a right fist at the camera. “Ready for 2mrw fight night everyone keep me in ur prayers inshallah,” he wrote.If Allah wills it.The next morning, Aljahmi and his father ate breakfast at an IHOP — eggs and turkey sausage for more weight gain — then returned to the hotel for a short rest and the long wait. Since the next day would be the father’s 51st birthday, the two Aljahmis talked about getting a cake.“Win and we’ll celebrate twice,” the father promised.With the time drawing near, they drove with Coach Mo and his two young amateurs to the half-century-old community hall of Sts. Peter and Paul Ukrainian Orthodox Church, on Youngstown’s west side. Joining them were four friends who had driven from Dearborn in a cramped two-door Toyota.Down in the hall’s chandeliered basement, where curtains separated boxers from the opponents they were about to meet, young Aljahmi chatted away as his coach prepared him for his debut.While Aljahmi sat with his arms propped on a white towel draped over a chair back, Coach Mo wrapped his boxer’s hands in protective gauze, carefully, almost clinically. He then slipped eight-ounce gloves over those hands and tied the strings. Finally, to cut down on the rudeness of leather against skin, he applied petroleum jelly with his fingertips to the unlined brow, the fresh cheeks, and the chin too often left exposed in the rashness of youth.There was one last detail. With his first professional fight just moments away, Aljahmi still had no nickname. But if his opponent — a short fighter he had seen when the curtain between them suddenly opened — was calling himself the Tiger, then how about something just as feral? How about the Lion?Agreed.A protective entourage — his father, his coach, a few friends — escorted Aljahmi up the basement steps and into the parquet-floored auditorium, a Christmas-decorated bingo hall set up for a boxing event. Now here he was, for the night’s first professional fight, a four-rounder in the superflyweight division.In red-and-white shorts with matching red shoes, the dynamo from Dearborn. The pride of the Yemeni-American community. His father’s best friend.Hamzah “the Lion” Aljahmi._**A Sudden Shift in Mood After the Opening Bell**_Before the first bell, Aljahmi had told Coach Mo that this was his time. _I’m ready, Coach_, he had said. _Let’s get this thing going._Now it was going, but not well. Aljahmi’s opponent was quick, active, and crouched so small that he made for a difficult target. The sight of their Hamzah being pummeled startled his friends, who had been harboring a more abstract understanding of what it meant to box professionally.Then down Aljahmi went, tagged by a powerful left. His opponent had capitalized on the weakness that Coach Mo had been working on: the “boxing no-no,” he called it, of leaving the chin exposed.“It felt like a movie when he went down,” Aljahmi’s friend Mohammad Yacoubi said. “He had gone into that ring like a superhero.”A few seconds later, Aljahmi went down a second time, forcing Coach Mo to make quick assessments. His young boxer was more “wobbly” after the first knockdown, the coach later said, after taking a punch that was “right on the button.” But the second one?“He had a little wobble,” he said. “But he can go.”Aljahmi did bounce up quickly. He adjusted his trunks — as if recalibrating body and mind — and went back to work. Becoming more aggressive, he delivered a hard left that had his opponent backpedaling.Then, while trying to avoid a swing that seemed to hit more air than flesh, Aljahmi fell against the ropes. He might have simply tripped, but it was not an impressive way to end the first round. Two knockdowns and one stumble.He returned to his corner charged with energy._What did I do wrong, Coach?_“Hamzah, your chin is way up in the air,” Hamood recalled saying. “And your right hand is down.”Aljahmi went out to own the second round, exploiting his opponent’s fatigue and blocking out the shouts of a Youngstown crowd eager to see this out-of-towner fall. When the bell rang, he all but ran back to his corner after leaving his weary opponent on the ropes.“Great job,” Coach Mo told Aljahmi. “Let’s keep doing what you’re doing. Use your jab. No need to wrestle with him.”Aljahmi looked at his clutch of friends in the seats, smiled, nodded his head — and returned to the ring to follow his coach’s instructions exactly.Round 3 repeated Round 2. Although his opponent tagged him quickly with a left from nowhere, Aljahmi answered with a hard right to the chin.“There he goes!” Yacoubi, Aljahmi’s friend, shouted.Soon another Aljahmi right found purchase.“There you go! There you go! He’s tired! He’s tired! Hamzah, he’s tired!”This was true. Aljahmi’s opponent was still recovering from having fought so aggressively in the first round. His own coach was shouting for him to push through it — which he did, briefly, during a late-round flurry.The bell rang just as Aljahmi uncorked one more punch. A little late, it seemed, but clearly accidental. He tapped his opponent’s chest in apology.Coach Mo gave Aljahmi water and applied more petroleum jelly, that translucent touch of protection, to his eyebrows, cheeks and nose. “We need this round,” the coach said, as if to make clear to his boxer the tossup closeness of the fight._I got you, Coach._Aljahmi then leaned over, found his father in the crowd, and shook his right glove in a gesture that seemed to say now is the time. Now.He was so jacked up on adrenaline that he hurried to the center of the ring well before the bell. The blue-shirted referee had to nudge him back a step or two, while his coach called after him that he was the toughest kid he knew.“Go get him,” Coach Mo commanded.The two superflyweights gave it their all, each determined not to lose his professional debut, as the crowd urged them on.“Give him one, Hamzah!” Aljahmi’s friends shouted. “There you go! More! More!”“Get him, get him, get him!”“Hamzah, get him! Hamzah, he’s done! He’s done!”“Keep going!”Then — a punch to their friend’s head. “Oooh!”Aljahmi, who had been dominating, was suddenly backed into a corner by his flailing opponent.“Get out of the corner!” a friend yelled. “Get out of the corner!”Too late. Their superhero was squat against the apron, dodging swings, lurching forward, grasping to hold on to something unseen, then falling, drooping, legs not cooperating, arms down.The referee stopped the fight, causing confusion about what had just happened. He tried to help Aljahmi to his feet, but the boxer could not find the strength. Panicking, Coach Mo rushed into the ring.“Good job, Hamzah!” he said, mistakenly thinking the bell had rung. “Get up. You won the fight!”_I can’t. My knee. I twisted my knee._He leaned back, or maybe fell back, onto Coach Mo’s shins.Aljahmi’s father and friends had just been shouting that his opponent was “done”; now they were mute. A moment ago their Hamzah had been controlling the fight; now he was propped against his coach’s legs like a rag doll.A dermatologist serving as the ringside doctor slipped under the ropes and donned surgical gloves. The Lion lay flat on the mat.Then, Coach Mo said, “Hamzah closed his eyes.”**PART 3**YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio — The fearless young boxer feared what he would see, feared how he would be received. He lingered at the threshold of the surgical intensive care unit, unable to take those few short steps to the bedside of his comatose opponent.The boxer, Anthony Taylor, known for his take-a-punch-to-give-a-punch ferocity, froze under the unforgiving lights of crisis care at St. Elizabeth Youngstown Hospital, where a chorus of beeping monitors and exhaling respirators sang of lives at the precipice. He did not want to be here.That is, he wanted to be here, and his coach told him that he _should_ be here, but he was frightened. In his gloveless hands he carried the shield of a bouquet, bright yellow flowers that were like dandelions, only nicer.A nurse asked if he needed help. Soon, a relative of the patient he had come to see invited him into a crowded room. There, in a small bed, with a white bandage wrapped around his head and a blue air tube running from his mouth, was the man Taylor had recently danced and fought with:Hamzah Aljahmi, 19, his eyes still closed.Taylor handed the flowers to someone and sat in a chair near the foot of the bed, stunned. To think that less than 72 hours earlier, he and this person had each been paid a few hundred dollars to fight their first professional fight, a four-rounder in the hall of a Ukrainian church. To think how they had stared into each other’s eyes while engaged in a most violent form of intimacy.It could be 24-year-old Anthony Taylor in that bed, not Hamzah Aljahmi. Now Anthony would be spending the holidays with his family, while Hamzah. …The visitor began to cry.Ali Aljahmi, a first cousin, was moved, even impressed, by the sight of this distraught stranger paying his respects. _For you to step into this room of anger and grief,_ Aljahmi thought to himself. _For you to come to be with us. Takes a lot of strength._The cousin led Taylor into the hall to offer comforting perspective. Whatever was happening in that hospital room was Allah’s will, he said, and do not doubt that you helped Hamzah to realize his dream of becoming a professional boxer.One more thing, Aljahmi said. “You have become family with me forever for this kind of gesture.”Taylor returned to the room and, for the next hour, talked with the father, an uncle and a few cousins of the man laid out before them, the black of his eyebrows enhanced by an enveloping whiteness of bandages and blankets.“They told me they wanted me to keep going,” Taylor recalled. “That he would want me to keep going, and that I have to honor him and keep him alive by continuing to box.”The father, also named Ali Aljahmi, would only vaguely remember Taylor’s visit, so mind-blurring were his waves of grief. He had been at the fight. He had seen his beloved son, a determined fighter, crumple to the blue mat. Not in direct response to any punch, it seemed, but almost as an afterthought.The elder Aljahmi had been here in this chilling, antiseptic environment ever since, save for when nurses would gently tell him it was time to leave for the night. He’d return to a hotel whose name he would not remember and try to avoid the many anxious telephone calls from family members and friends back in their hometown of Dearborn.How is Hamzah? How is Hamzah? How is Hamzah?The father did not want to answer. If he did respond, it was to tell a version of the truth: “Hamzah is sleeping.”Finally, the father telephoned a nephew in Dearborn with the same name as his: Ali Aljahmi, Hamzah’s cousin. _I need you to bring Hamzah’s mother here to Youngstown, Ali. She needs to see him._The nephew understood what his uncle was not saying. He did as he was told. He packed Hamzah’s mother, Jamilah Aljahmi, and other relatives into a borrowed Chevy Cruze and began to drive, listening to them cry because Hamzah had been injured, but knowing that worse news awaited them in Youngstown.The mother saw her child wrapped in white, as if already prepared for the coffin. She held his feet, felt warmth, and in her profound grief exclaimed that he was alive!All this was too much for her health, it was decided. A relative drove Hamzah’s mother and the other women back to Dearborn. To wait for what was to be.But the father clung to hope as his son had clung to the ropes. He arose one morning in that strange hotel feeling as though all would be well. These efficient people in lab coats and nursing outfits would find some high-tech equivalent of smelling salts, and his son’s eyes would open.Finally, though, the father let go. Shedding his stoicism, he collapsed onto his son’s chest and begged between sobs that Hamzah rise and come with him to IHOP for another restorative meal. _Please, Hamzah,_ he implored. _Do not leave your best friend like this._The shaken cousin, Ali Aljahmi, sought out the neurosurgeon and asked to be told straight, so that the family could prepare. “He said in 30 years he hadn’t seen a brain so damaged,” he remembered. “He told me flat-out: Start making arrangements.”By this point, Anthony Taylor the boxer had said his hospital goodbyes and driven his dented Dodge Caravan the 20 miles back to the weathered white house he rented with his fiancée. Exhausted by it all, he fell asleep, only to awake an hour later to a text message aglow on his phone.Hamzah Aljahmi was dead._**A Tribute to a Man Who ‘Was Everything’**_After the autopsy, a Youngstown funeral home arranged to return Hamzah Aljahmi to Michigan, retracing his interstate journey past the deadened brown of a Rust Belt December, to a funeral home in Detroit, close to the Dearborn line.A handful of relatives and friends, all men, prepared the young body for burial. They prayed as they tended to their somber task, while verses of the Quran emanated from a loudspeaker.The dead young man was laid upon a table. Fingernails and toenails were clipped. The body was meticulously cleansed and gently rubbed with a scented oil that made the skin glisten — “The smell was very beautiful,” the cousin Ali Aljahmi said. Then it was wrapped in three sheets of white cloth.The boxer was placed in a cloth-covered coffin made of fiberboard and cardboard, in keeping with an adherence to simplicity. A pleasant perfume was sprinkled over the burial cloth.Late the next morning, a dark blue Dodge Caravan hearse carried the body the seven miles to the American Moslem Society mosque, a tan-brick building topped with a turquoise dome. Hundreds were already gathering in the parking lot.Family members shelved their shoes and carried the modest coffin up the stairs, past the small brown donation boxes and into a sectioned-off area reserved for women, at the far back of the cavernous hall. The sounds of weeping escaped the divide.The coffin, draped in a green-and-yellow cloth, was then moved to one side of the long rectangular hall, where mourners paid their respects to many, many relatives: the extended Aljahmi tribe. The father, Ali Aljahmi, sat in the first chair, and in the second, at the family’s insistence, was Mohamed Hamood — Coach Mo — Hamzah’s grief-shredded trainer.The mourning paused for the afternoon prayer. Long rows of men and boys, including many not before seen at the mosque, stood shoulder to shoulder on the green-and-gold carpet with patterns pointing toward Mecca. They spilled into the downstairs space and out into the parking lot.After the afternoon prayer, relatives carried the coffin to the front of the room. The imam led a short funeral service that included prayers for forgiveness, for Hamzah Aljahmi, for all of humankind, and for mercy upon the family._Allahu __a__kbar_. God is great.It was time for burial. The shoeless pallbearers descended the stairs to meet the December cold and the jostle of thousands. They walked with purpose across the lot, some slipping into shoes as they went, carving a path through a human crush that was affecting traffic along Vernor Highway. Many vied to touch the coffin, while others competed for an honored turn as a pallbearer.But why so many mourners for a 19-year-old man?People explain that Hamzah Aljahmi “died in action”; that he represented the Yemeni embrace of boxing; that he made friends with Arabs and non-Arabs, black, white, male, female; that he embodied an infectious liveliness.“He was everything, to be honest with you,” Ibrahim Aljahim, a cousin and community leader, said. Another cousin, Fayez Algahmi, a former honorary consul of Yemen, agreed. “The way he died, and the thing he died for, touched everyone,” Algahmi said.The funeral procession turned right onto Riverside Drive, along which the rusty chain-link fence of Woodmere Cemetery disappears into the distance. Now and then the undulations in the cemetery’s brown grass revealed the gray-white tops of tombstones.Chanting prayers as they walked, the mourners turned left at a gate to enter the cemetery, many of them forming a protective bubble around the raised coffin. The occasional cold breeze ruffled its drape of green-and-yellow cloth.Near the grave site, relatives opened the coffin one more time, so that the father and a few others could say their final goodbyes. “I gave him a bunch of kisses on the forehead,” his first cousin Ali Aljahmi recalled.In keeping with Islamic ritual, the body was turned on its right side to face Mecca, and some dirt was placed beside it. The coffin was closed, and lowered into its concrete rectangular case. Then mourner after mourner threw dirt three times into the hole, signifying the beginning and end of things._God is great_, they whispered. _To __God we belong, and to him we shall return._The communal grieving did not end at the grave. For weeks afterward, streams of people came to the Aljahmi family’s simple home to offer condolences and distraction. Among them were many young people seeking some token or relic of their friend the boxer, Hamzah the Lion. A T-shirt. A jacket. A shoe. A ribbon. A trophy.Of course, of course, the brokenhearted father would say.“I don’t close the door,” he explained._**A Fighter Finds Comfort in Someone Who Understands**_On the tough south side of Youngstown, in the squat cinder-block refuge called Jack Loew’s South Side Boxing Club, the boxing life continues for Anthony Taylor. He and other would-be champions punch bags and skip rope, spar with partners and obey the sign that says “no weapon of any kind” — other than fists.Taylor had taken some time off after the Hamzah Aljahmi fight to get his body and mind straight. His right hand had been damaged, among other parts.True, the first time Taylor returned to the ring to spar, he froze for a moment. (“I was waiting on him, and he hit me, and hit me again,” he says. “And I was like, O.K.”) But now the Tiger is back, shorn of his dreadlocks and preparing for his second professional fight, which is scheduled to be at the same venue, Sts. Peter and Paul Ukrainian Orthodox Church. He’ll be taking his chances, once again, in a bingo hall.“I can’t walk in there thinking about what happened,” Taylor says, as if trying to convince himself. “You can’t change what’s happened in the past. I wish I could.”As Taylor works out, his coach, Jack Loew, sits in his back office, the walls covered with boxing memorabilia, a broken speed bag on his desk. He was the promoter behind that fatal boxing event, and he has wept over Aljahmi’s death.“You don’t think about stuff like that,” Loew says, voice cracking. “A frigging club show with 115-pounders for four rounds.”A few loose ends from that night remain to be tied. For one thing, the Mahoning County coroner has yet to release the results of his autopsy (although the weakness in Aljahmi’s right leg that night could be suggestive of a left hemispheric brain bleed). This is why Bernie Profato, the Ohio Athletic Commission’s director, has not formally closed the case, although he says his own inquiry found no lapses of protocol by the commission he oversees.Profato is also haunted by the memory of this polite young man, such a model of respect at the weigh-in. But the inherent dangers are made plain in the contracts signed by boxers, including these two first-time pros, Taylor and Aljahmi.“You’re entering a sport where you could be seriously hurt or injured,” Profato says. “They know that. That’s just the nature of the sport.”A childhood friend of Loew’s comes through the boxing club’s door: Ray Mancini, the onetime lightweight world champion, known in Youngstown and far beyond as Boom Boom. Unfairly, he is also known for one fight: Duk-koo Kim, Las Vegas, 1982.Mancini connected with two hard rights to Kim’s head at the start of the 14th round, sending the tenacious South Korean challenger to the canvas and prompting the referee to declare a technical knockout. Incurring a brain bleed known as a subdural hematoma, Kim lapsed into a coma and died four days later. He was 27.Mancini was 21.It took years, but Mancini worked his way through the depression and self-doubt that followed. Even though he eventually forgave himself and made peace with the tragedy, he says, others have shown less grace over the years.“Hey, Boom Boom,” he mimics. “Hey, man, let me ask you something. What’s it like to kill somebody in the ring? I mean, what’s it like to see someone go down and never get up?”Mancini is 54 now, gray-haired and fit, with various business and entertainment interests. He has come to his friend’s club this evening to counsel the young boxer with whom he shares a sorrowful bond. He wants to talk about forgiveness, and loudmouths, and giving up the game if there is even the slightest hesitation in the ring.Loew heads for the door in search of his boxer Taylor, saying, “I don’t even know where this kid is at.”Soon Anthony Taylor, fresh from the stutter of speed bags and the whack of skipped rope, is in the back-office quiet, sitting shyly across from _the_ Boom Boom Mancini like a confessor before a priest.“Really sad for you, man,” Mancini begins. “I never met you before, but. …”\n\n","title":"Fight - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The \"115-pound Joe Frazier\" won the fight, but triumph was quickly followed by dread https://t.co/jeAK1q1n38 https://t.co/xmCvVL4zo5","date":"Thu Mar 31 07:47:32 +0000 2016","favs":124,"id":{"$numberLong":"715445408256958464"},"retweets":59},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1RMcTve"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0146b"},"content":"Late last year, as Mayor Bill de Blasio worked to change zoning codes to\ncompel the creation of more affordable housing, an obscure New York City\nagency quietly lifted all restrictions on the use of a former nursing home on\nthe Lower East Side of Manhattan.For decades, the blocklong property had been\nprotected from the neighborhood’s transformation by its restrictive deed,\nwhich prevented any use for it other than nonprofit residential health care.\nBut the agency, the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, was paid\n$16.15 million in November by the building owner to lift those protections,\nwithout conditions.That move came amid a whirlwind series of transactions: The\nbuilding had been sold months before to Allure Group, a nursing-home operator,\nwhich then flipped it in February to a condominium developer for $116\nmillion.Mr. de Blasio said he was blindsided and angered by the developments.\nBut a review of city records, correspondence and lobbying reports suggests\nthat the city mismanaged the situation, accepting more than $16 million to\npave the way for precisely the type of luxury housing it has sought to\nlimit.Lifting deed restrictions in New York is a rare act in itself: Since Mr.\nde Blasio took office in 2014, there have been at least nine deed restrictions\nmodified or lifted by the city, mostly on vacant lots in areas under\ndevelopment such as First Avenue in Manhattan or areas of the Bronx and\nBrooklyn.Former officials with the Department of Citywide Administrative\nServices could not recall the city’s having received a comparable sum in\nexchange for lifting such a restriction. Indeed, in three instances since\n2014, the city took no money for the change, accepting new restrictions\ninstead. In others, the city received a relative pittance for unused spaces in\nexchange for lifting the restrictions altogether: $44,000 for a property on\nKosciuszko Street in Brooklyn, $86,000 for another on East 137th Street in\nHarlem. A more desirable lot on St. Nicholas Avenue in Harlem fetched\n$875,000.In the case of the former nursing home, the deed restrictions were\noriginally put in place by the city when it sold the property, a red brick\nformer school at 45 Rivington Street, to Village Care, a nonprofit that agreed\nto run an AIDS hospice at the site.“The $72 million question is whether the\ncity’s process was manipulated to give a windfall to a few individuals at the\npublic’s expense and deprive a community of a much-needed health care\nfacility,” said Scott M. Stringer, the city’s comptroller, who has opened an\ninquiry into the matter. The investigation was reported by The Wall Street\nJournal.“It’s alarming to think that the people charged with protecting the\npublic’s interest could have sold a binding deed restriction without a legally\nenforceable guarantee of further community use in return,” he added.For an\nadministration claiming to be bent on curbing gentrification, and a hands-on\nmayor who often demands rigorous multisignature memos for making big\ndecisions, questions remain about how the former nursing home, known as\nRivington House, came to be unprotected by the city and then sold for a steep\nprofit. Questions have also arisen about the role of the city’s leading\nlobbyist, James F. Capalino, who, at different points, came to represent the\ninitial seller and final purchaser of the property.“I’m not happy that it\nhappened,” Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, told reporters on Monday. “I’m not happy\nabout the fact that I didn’t hear about it in advance, before it became\npublic.”On Jan. 27, however, the local community board sent a letter to Mr. de\nBlasio requesting “information as to what transpired as to this transaction.”\nThe letter was remarkably prescient; it warned that Rivington House could be\nconverted into free-market housing, “as has been made possible by the lifting\nof the deed restriction.” The building was sold in February; city officials\nnever responded to the letter, according to the community board, and Mr. de\nBlasio never saw it, said Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for the mayor.Mr. de\nBlasio has since expressed disbelief, saying that city officials had been\n“lied to” by the nursing-home company, Allure Group, which bought Rivington\nHouse in February 2015 from Village Care for $28 million. Allure had promised\nto create a for-profit nursing home that could serve low-income New Yorkers,\ncity officials said. The city has yet to explain why it did not secure that\nassurance in writing.On March 1 of this year, before the mayor said he had\nlearned of the issues at Rivington House, the city put a halt on all new deed\nchanges amid an internal review of procedures. “We are looking to see what\nactions we can take to penalize this company,” the mayor told reporters on\nMonday, “and again, any policy changes that would inhibit this in the\nfuture.”In seeking to secure the deed change, Village Care had a powerful ally\nin its corner: Mr. Capalino, a fund-raiser for Mr. de Blasio whose firm earned\na record $12.9 million lobbying City Hall in 2015.Mr. Capalino had been hired\nin 2013 through October 2014 to push for changes to the Rivington House deed.\nVillage Care had bought the building from the city in 1992 with the permanent\nrestriction on its use, and had cared for patients with H.I.V. and AIDS. In\nrecent years, the nonprofit found that it could no longer support the building\nand sold it to Allure Group.In October 2014, Joel Landau, representing Allure\nGroup, wrote to the city about his company’s plans for the building,\nsuggesting it would become a for-profit nursing home. “We are now ready to do\nwhatever we can to move this project forward,” Mr. Landau wrote. “I would also\nlike to keep the home as it is.”The email, shared by City Hall officials,\nappeared to be the only written assurance from Allure Group that it would\noperate a long-term care center in the building if the deed restriction was\nlifted. Mr. Landau, who also spoke about the building with local officials and\nthe community board, did not respond to a request for comment.“We were just\nshocked when we heard that this Allure Group, that gave us the understanding\nthat they were going to run it as a long-term care facility, turned around and\nsold it,” said Councilwoman Margaret Chin, a Democrat, who advocated keeping\nsome sort of nursing home there.On May 11, 2015, for a single day, a public\nnotice of a hearing on the proposed deed changes appeared in the City Record.\nOn the same day, Allure Group went into contract to sell the property to the\ncondominium developer. “This action is in the best interest of the city,” the\nnotice read, as do all such notices. None of the local advocates and elected\nofficials were alerted.“When we found out about it, it was a done deal,” Susan\nStetzer, the district manager of the local community board, said of the deed\nchanges. “If there had been proper notification, it’s very likely this never\nwould have happened.”The city settled on $16.15 million based on two\nappraisals of the property — one in April 2013, another in December 2014 —\nusing “longstanding valuation practices,” Austin Finan, a spokesman for the\nmayor, said. Current and former city officials said that the sum, though\nsignificant, in fact undervalued the potential resale value of the\nunrestricted property. The deal was approved by the Mayor’s Office of Contract\nServices.In April 2015, before Allure’s sale of the building, Mr. Capalino\nbegan representing Slate Acquisition, the developer that would buy the\nproperty from Allure Group, though its contract did not cover lobbying related\nto 45 Rivington Street.City Hall officials said the deed restriction changes\ndid not come up in the three documented meetings last year between Mr. de\nBlasio and Mr. Capalino. Instead, the mayor and Mr. Capalino, who has bundled\n$44,940 in campaign contributions for Mr. de Blasio’s re-election campaign\nsince October, discussed Chinese tourism, a downtown heliport and rezoning in\nManhattan, the officials said.A spokeswoman for Mr. Capalino said he had\nlimited his lobbying on behalf of Village Care to the administrative agency\nand had had no discussions with the mayor about Rivington House.Nor was the\ndeal a factor, officials said, in the decision to replace the commissioner of\nthe Department of Citywide Administrative Services in January. The former\ncommissioner, Stacey Cumberbatch, declined to discuss the reason for her\nremoval when reached by phone; she currently works for New York City Health\nand Hospitals.“I really don’t want to speak to you, thank you,” she said\nbefore hanging up.\n\n","title":"How New York Allowed Gentrification for $16 Million - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Nursing Home’s Sale to Condo Developer Raises Questions for New York City https://t.co/cnqiv9rZCX","date":"Thu Mar 31 07:19:56 +0000 2016","favs":73,"id":{"$numberLong":"715438464632811520"},"retweets":56},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1MV66bl"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0146c"},"content":"Some of the country’s best-known corporations are nervously grappling with\nwhat role they should play at the Republican National Convention, given the\nlikely nomination of Donald J. Trump, whose divisive candidacy has alienated\nmany women, blacks and Hispanics.An array of activist groups is organizing a\ncampaign to pressure the companies to refuse to sponsor the gathering, which\nmany of the corporations have done for the Republican and the Democratic\nParties for decades.The pressure is emerging as some businesses and trade\ngroups are privately debating whether to scale back their participation,\naccording to interviews with more than a dozen lobbyists, consultants and\nfund-raisers directly involved in the conversations.Apple, Google and Walmart\nare among the companies assessing their plans for the convention, which will\nbe held July 18 to 21 in Cleveland.In addition to Mr. Trump’s divisive\npolitics, there is the possibility that protests, or even violence, will\nbecome a focus of attention at the convention. Mr. Trump has suggested that\nthere will be “riots” if he is not chosen as the party’s nominee, and the city\nof Cleveland recently sought bids for about 2,000 sets of riot gear for its\npolice force.A reduction in support from major corporations would be worrisome\nfor Cleveland, which celebrated the awarding of the convention last year as a\nsymbol of the city’s rebirth. The host committee is seeking to raise about $64\nmillion for the event.“I have talked to several people at companies who have\nsaid, ‘I’ve always gone to the convention, I’ve always participated at some\nlevel, but this year we’re not putting it in our budget, we’re not going,\nwe’re not going to sponsor any of the events going on,’ ” said Carla Eudy, a\nRepublican fund-raising consultant.Walmart, which contributed $150,000 to the\nRepublican convention in 2012, has yet to commit to contributing this year.\n“We haven’t made any decisions,” said Dan Bartlett, executive vice president\nof corporate affairs at Walmart, who emphasized that even before Mr. Trump’s\nrise, the company had been discussing reducing its involvement.Apple and\nGoogle declined to comment.Coca-Cola has declined to match the $660,000 it\ngave for the 2012 Republican convention, donating only $75,000 for this year\nand indicating that it does not plan to provide more.Kent Landers, a Coca-Cola\nspokesman, declined to explain the reduction in support. But officials at the\ncompany are trying to quietly defuse a campaign organized by the civil rights\nadvocacy group Color of Change, which says it has collected more than 100,000\nsignatures on a petition demanding that Coca-Cola and other companies decline\nto sponsor the convention. Donating to the event, the petition states, is akin\nto endorsing Mr. Trump’s “hateful and racist rhetoric.”“These companies have a\nchoice right now, a history-making choice,” said Rashad Robinson, the\nexecutive director of Color of Change. “Do they want riots brought to us by\nCoca-Cola?”The situation is especially delicate for Coca-Cola, which is based\nin Atlanta and has devoted significant resources for decades to appeal to\nminority groups.In the company’s Washington office, executives have been\nlocked in conversations about how to handle the convention, according to two\npeople directly involved in the discussions. In addition to donating cash, the\nbeverage giant usually provides in-kind contributions, including sodas and\nother drinks.In a statement, Mr. Landers, the Coca-Cola spokesman, said the\ncompany had also provided $75,000 to the 2016 Democratic convention, adding,\n“The Coca-Cola Company is a nonpartisan business and does not endorse\npresidential candidates or nominees, nor do we endorse any specific\nparty.”Emily Lauer, a spokeswoman for the Cleveland 2016 Host Committee,\nplayed down any concerns about fund-raising. She said corporations and other\ndonors had already pledged $54 million of the $64 million needed.But a senior\nRepublican official with direct knowledge of convention fund-raising said\nthere was growing worry inside the party about whether donors would follow\nthrough with their pledges if Mr. Trump became the nominee.Asked how much of\nthe $54 million the committee had in hand, Ms. Lauer said, “the majority.” The\nState of Ohio, the City of Cleveland and Cuyahoga County are contributing\ngenerously, she said, along with local businesses.But the question of what to\ndo about the Republican convention is more complex for businesses than simply\ndeciding whether to contribute to the host committee: They are also grappling\nwith whether they should send their executives, whether they can just quietly\ngive to ancillary events benefiting other Republicans, and even whether they\nought to have their names removed from the off-site concerts that are often\nconvention favorites.The issue is a touchy one for American businesses, which\nuntil now have largely avoided the delicate choice between possibly offending\nMr. Trump’s passionate followers by distancing themselves from him, or\nangering the equally vocal constituencies opposed to his candidacy.“These are\nMaalox months for everyone,” said Bruce Haynes, a public-relations consultant\nat Purple Strategies, a Virginia-based bipartisan communications firm. “If\nthis is going to look like 1968, there will be people that say, ‘That’s not\nwhere I want my product placement,’ ” he added, referring to clashes between\nthe police and protesters at the Democratic convention in Chicago.The Color of\nChange campaign is now being joined by Hispanic, Muslim and women’s rights\norganizations. While Coke has been the focus of the convention push so far,\nthe advocacy groups have also been in contact with Google, Cisco and AT\u0026amp;T\nand said the companies would be targeted if they did not withdraw their\ncontributions and vow to give no more.Nita Chaudhary, a founder and executive\ndirector of UltraViolet, a women’s rights group, noted that many Republican\ngovernors had felt pressure from businesses over gay rights, as companies\n“compete with one another to be the most socially progressive.”She added,\n“Well, there’s no greater threat to women and people of color in this country\nthan Donald Trump.”Representatives from Cisco and AT\u0026amp;T issued statements\npointing to their technological support for both parties’ conventions in the\npast. They indicated that they would offer the same in-kind assistance this\nyear, while emphasizing that their support was aimed at benefiting the\ndemocratic process. They declined to comment further.Color of Change has been\neffective in putting pressure on image-conscious companies. After the killing\nin Florida of an unarmed black  teenager, Trayvon Martin, in 2012, for\nexample, it helped persuade corporations like Coca-Cola, McDonald’s and Pepsi\nto leave the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative\norganization that promoted the “Stand Your Ground” gun laws that became\ndivisive after Mr. Martin’s death.In a letter sent to Coca-Cola last month,\nColor of Change implored the company to withdraw its support for the\nRepublican convention, saying the move would be “a sign of corporate\nleadership.”That letter was followed by a provocative online petition with an\nimage of a Coca-Cola bottle labeled “Share a Coke with the K.K.K.,” an\napparent reference to Mr. Trump having initially declined to disavow support\nfrom the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke.The push by Color of Change got\nthe attention of the Coca-Cola executives, who quietly reached out to Mr.\nRobinson, the group’s executive director, and, in a series of previously\nundisclosed telephone calls and email exchanges, sought to mollify the\nactivist group.“We walked them through what a public campaign would look\nlike,” Mr. Robinson recalled, explaining that he described possible protests\noutside Coca-Cola headquarters and in Cleveland against the company.Coca-Cola\nhas not sought a refund of the $75,000 it gave to the Republican convention,\nnor has it agreed to refuse to make in-kind contributions.Other companies are\nhoping to avoid the controversy altogether. Some trade groups, including ones\nrepresenting airlines and broadcasters, say they are planning to take a\nsmaller role at both parties’ conventions this year.In addition to the strong\nfeelings Mr. Trump generates, there are fears that fewer elected officials, to\nwhom sponsors like to gain access at conventions, might attend if Mr. Trump is\nthe nominee.The question of corporate involvement is not the only challenge.\nFor the first time since the Nixon era, federal funds will not be provided to\ndefray the cost of the conventions, putting a greater burden on the parties to\nraise money.Conventions are unwieldy productions that often exceed their\nbudgets. In 2012, Mitt Romney’s national finance team helped raise money to\ncover the costs of the Republican convention in Tampa, Fla., and in 2004, when\nthe Republican Party had its convention in New York, Michael R. Bloomberg,\nthen the mayor, wrote a personal check to cover the host committee’s $2\nmillion shortfall.\n\n","title":"Corporations Grow Nervous About Participating in Republican Convention - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Some of the country's best-known corporations are grappling with what role to play at the RNC https://t.co/mZ7dppSal7","date":"Thu Mar 31 07:15:20 +0000 2016","favs":86,"id":{"$numberLong":"715437305872429056"},"retweets":62},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1qkt6f7"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0146d"},"content":"Late on the night of April 9, 2013, Jeff Walz, coach of the Louisville women’s\nbasketball team, had dinner in a New Orleans restaurant after losing the\nnational championship game. One of his companions was Rick Pitino, in from\nAtlanta after coaching the men’s team to the title the previous night.For\nWalz, the potentially historic occasion had turned into another Connecticut\ncoronation, as well as the introduction to grand-stage veneration for a\ndazzling freshman, Breanna Stewart.From across the table, what do you say that\nis sympathetic but sensible to a coach and university colleague whose team had\njust been dismantled by 33 points?Here is what Pitino offered.“The difference\nbetween your game and our game is that our equivalent of Breanna Stewart is\nnot back in our game next season,” Pitino said. “She’s gone to the N.B.A. to\nmake her millions.”“Yeah,” Walz said mournfully. “And in our game, she’s back\nfor the next three years, doing what she does and getting a degree.”Three\nyears later, with two more titles won and one left to make it a perfect four,\nis this something about women’s basketball to, you know, lament?In a recent\nTwitter post, the longtime Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy wrote,\n“Watch? No thanks,” after a 60-point Connecticut drubbing of Mississippi\nState. This set off a firestorm that was as predictable as a caustic retort\nfrom Connecticut Coach Geno Auriemma (“Don’t watch,” he said).Those playing\nand presiding over women’s sports are rightly sensitive to and sick of the\ndouble standards.As Serena Williams has dominated the women’s tennis field\nwith extraordinary shotmaking, complaints have been heard that many of her\nopponents are frauds. By contrast, when Roger Federer ruled men’s tennis in\nthe pre-Rafael Nadal days, he was supposedly reinventing the sport as modern\ndance.When U.C.L.A. was winning 10 national championships and mixing in an\n88-game winning streak between 1964 and 1975, its coach, John Wooden, was a\nstrategic wizard, an enduring legend. With Auriemma two victories from his\n11th title, after surpassing the U.C.L.A. winning streak six years ago,\nsuddenly a defense must be mounted against Shaughnessy’s assertion about\nConnecticut’s transcendence: “Hate to punish them for being great, but they\nare killing women’s game.”Granted, it was one Twitter post (though one that\nreflected a common male refrain). And Connecticut has had its share of\nopponents in early rounds of the N.C.A.A. tournament that didn’t belong on the\nsame floor.No one has ever made the argument that the women’s game — decades\nbehind the men’s game, developmentally — has more depth. At the very top,\nmen’s programs that have Connecticut’s history, rabid fan base, and great\nrecruiter and coach are much more common.“Things eventually change — next\nyear, they lose three great players and might lose in the Elite Eight, as if\nthat would be horrible,” Walz said in a telephone interview. “But it’s harder\nwhen a Maya Moore stays four years, a Diana Taurasi, a Breanna Stewart.”Just\nimagine, he said, if Anthony Davis and Karl-Anthony Towns (in different time\nframes) had stayed at Kentucky for four years, or if Jahlil Okafor and Justise\nWinslow had parked themselves at Duke for the long haul. How balanced would\nthe men’s game actually be?But even that telling difference isn’t the\nprincipal issue, Auriemma said Wednesday in a teleconference setting up the\nsemifinals Sunday in Indianapolis.“Stop focusing on Connecticut, and start\npaying attention to what a lot of these other schools are doing,” he said.He\nwas referring to Oregon State — the Huskies’ semifinal opponent Sunday night —\nalong with Syracuse and Washington, all first-timers at the Final Four.Those\nare not teams, he added, “that were knocking on the door and finally got\nthere.” In other words, Connecticut aside, the top-seeded teams in three of\nthe regionals — often as reliably Final Four-bound as UConn — were sent home\nby opponents demonstrating a greater depth and a commitment that is gradually\ntaking root.In February, Brian Stewart, Breanna’s father, spoke of taking his\nyoung daughter to hometown Syracuse games in front of 200 spectators. That\nuniversity — like others in the Big East — had a renowned men’s team but\nseemed not to care that its women’s program was a perennial doormat.At\nSyracuse, the women consistently had unsightly records throughout the 1990s\nand several years after the turn of the century. But under Quentin Hillsman,\nnow in his 10th season as coach, the Orange have not won fewer than 22 games\nsince 2008-9.The rising began in the old Big East, as it did for others such\nas Notre Dame, St. John’s and Louisville, where, Walz said, “we’re at the\npoint now where when we lose in the second round, as we did this year, that’s\nunacceptable.”That, he agreed, was in large part due to the influence of\nUConn, which understandably still draws almost all the attention from those\nwith limited interest in the sport.Then come the double standards, the casual\ndismissals that make Auriemma bristle most — the belief that what UConn is\ndoing is easy and not in defiance of the odds and gods that govern the whims\nof 20-year-olds.On the subject of commentary and chance, when Auriemma was\nasked what it might mean that there are four male head coaches in the Final\nFour for the first time (the previous high was two), he found little to\nexpound on, for once.“I think it takes the focus off what the players have\ndone and what the coaches have done and how they’ve earned the right to play\nin the Final Four,” he said. “Whatever the greater meaning, whatever the\nsocial commentary and all that, we can save that for another time and\nplace.”This place — Bankers Life Fieldhouse — should be reserved for the\nlikely historic achievement, and for those teams that have earned the right to\ntry to carve a place on the Mount Rushmore of American sporting\nunderdogs.Washington and Oregon State will have a say, but consider the\npossibility that Stewart will shoot for perfection against the program whose\nunimposing shadow she grew up in.Auriemma noted that he had tried to schedule\na homecoming game this season for the player he calls “Stewie,” but “it didn’t\nseem to fit into Syracuse’s schedule.”The Huskies played in upstate New York\nat Colgate instead. A showdown for the national title would be an even better\nnarrative, even as a blowout. But unwatchable?Last word to Auriemma.I’m not\nasking you to watch, he said. “But don’t demean those that do appreciate it.\nThat’s all.”\n\n","title":"UConn’s Singular Feats Reveal a Double Standard - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTSports: UConn’s singular feats reveal a double standard, writes @HarveyAraton https://t.co/9k7FLIC8QE https://t.co/32VHzuqrAd","date":"Thu Mar 31 07:01:28 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715433814093406208"},"retweets":33},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PGDylB"}

I’ve\nwritten about the privacy minefields of Facebook and other social networks.\nI’ve looked at the hate and bullying that people inflict on Twitter. I’ve seen\nhow the front-facing camera on our smartphones can turn us into\nnarcissists.I’ve also witnessed how technology has enabled terrorists to\nspread their message of hate and incite fear.All these downsides have made me\nwonder whether these technological advances are worth it. Maybe we’re better\noff without smartphones, social media, cloud computing and apps du jour like\nSnapchat that we seemingly can’t live without today.It’s a question I’ve been\nasking myself as I ponder this — my last column for The New York Times after\n14 years working at the newspaper. And it was during this contemplative moment\nthat I gleaned a little piece of advice from an unlikely source: David Carr,\nthe former media columnist here, who died last year.When I seek inspiration or\nsomething to make me smile, I sometimes find myself visiting David’s Twitter\npage (@carr2n) to read his old tweets, which are filled with nuggets of\nwisdom, humorous insights and deft turns of phrase.The last time I did this, I\nalso realized that I was still following him. So were 455,000 other people,\neven though his last tweet was dated Feb. 12, 2015, and was directed at me\nafter a little joke I had played on my dear friend and mentor.\n“\u0026gt;@nickbilton left me a VM because he thought I’m actually ancient enough\nto still listen to them. Took the bait. ouch. #gotyermessage”Is he ever going\nto tweet again? No. And yet, hundreds of thousands of people (and a few bots)\nstill follow him. That’s because technology still connects us (me) to David.In\na sense, that’s what technology has always done. That’s true with planes,\ntrains and automobiles. And that’s true with smartphones, social networks and\nsearch engines. They, and other technologies, connect us to people who are not\nwith us, geographically or physically, and make us feel a little less alone in\nthis big confusing world.David Carr isn’t the only deceased person who\ncontinues to be a guiding light for me. My mother, who died last March, is\nstill saved as a favorite on my iPhone, and I imagine will be there forever.I\nstill follow her on Facebook. Her emails are still saved in my inbox (though I\nfeel guilty for having not replied to some), as is a video she sent me two\nChristmases ago explaining how to make her famous chocolate cake.Thankfully,\nbecause of that front-facing camera, I get to scroll through pictures of her\nthat she sent over the years.In the 1800s, people would photograph the\nrecently deceased, often in a family portrait, as a way of capturing one last\nmoment with a loved one. We now live in an era when, thanks to technology, we\ncan relive countless moments with the people we love after they’re gone or are\nfar away.We do so through the digital footprints left behind on Facebook and\nTwitter, the photos on our smartphones, and all the morsels scooped up by\nsearch engines. Technology allows us to connect.So does the good outweigh the\nbad? For me, yes. And I think it will in the future too, as newer technologies\nforce us to grapple with even bigger ethical quandaries.Take driverless cars,\nwhich I believe will have a huge, unknowable impact on society. When that\ntechnology becomes widely adopted — some say this will happen in two years;\nothers say 20 — many will lament the negatives. Pizza delivery guys, truckers,\ntaxi drivers and countless others could lose their jobs. Hackers and\nterrorists may turn driverless cars into weapons. Teenagers everywhere will no\nlonger experience the joy of getting a driver’s license.And yet, there will be\nmany positives as well. Roads may be converted into parks. Finding parking may\nbecome a thing of the past (as will parking tickets). Driving time may be\nreclaimed for more productive or enjoyable activities, like watching movies,\nexercising or sleeping.To be sure, driverless cars may be safer, potentially\nsaving millions of people’s lives every year. And, perhaps they will connect\nus in ways we haven’t thought of yet.The same pro-and-con situations will play\nout with other technologies, including drones, virtual reality, big data, 3-D\nprinters, medicines, wearable computers and, of course, artificial\nintelligence.We will worry about these new technologies. We will question\nthem. We will demand changes. And we should.But in the end, as people use the\nthings we create for harm, there will be a lot more instances when they are\nused for good. And, most important, when they make us all feel a little more\nconnected, and a little less alone.#gotyermessage.\n\n","title":"The Upside to Technology?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0146f"},"content":"The Unesco Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger is a melancholy document,\ncharting the 3,000 or so languages that experts predict will vanish by the end\nof this century. For the most part, ethnographers and linguists are helpless\nin the face of the gradual erasure of collective memory that goes along with\nthis loss of linguistic diversity.Time to call in the composers?A growing\nnumber of them are turning their attention to languages that are extinct,\nendangered or particular to tiny groups of speakers in far-flung places with\nthe aim of weaving these enigmatic utterances into musical works that\ncelebrate, memorialize or mourn the languages and the cultures that gave birth\nto them. On Saturday, April 9, at the Cologne Opera in Germany, the Australian\ncomposer Liza Lim unveils her opera “Tree of Codes,” which includes snippets\nof a Turkish whistling language from a small mountain village. On her most\nrecent album, “The Stone People,” the pianist Lisa Moore sings and plays\nMartin Bresnick’s hypnotic “Ishi’s Song,” a setting of a chant by the last\nmember of the Yahi, who died in 1916.In February the New York Philharmonic\nperformed Tan Dun’s multimedia symphony “Nu Shu,” the result of the composer’s\nresearch into a language and writing system that was passed down among the\nfemale inhabitants of a small village in Hunan Province in China for 700\nyears. Other composers who have done their own fieldwork include Vivian Fung,\nwho investigated minority cultures in the Chinese province of Yunnan, and\nKevin James, who sought out some of the last native speakers of minority\nlanguages in the Pacific Northwest, Australia and Japan.The aesthetic uses to\nwhich the composers put these rare languages vary. Still, Mr. James, the\nfounder of the Vanishing Languages Project, seemed to speak for most when, in\na recent interview, he said that the goal was “not to set them to music, but\nset them as music.”It’s an important distinction. Classical music has proved\nadept at preserving a language like Latin through liturgical settings that\nexpose listeners to a language they no longer encounter in spoken form. But\nworks like Mozart’s Requiem or Orff’s “Carmina Burana,” with its sections in\nMiddle High German, sprang from the same cultural soil that gave birth to\ntheir texts. By contrast, when composers reach for words that are\nunintelligible to all but a handful of speakers on the planet, the very notion\nof music as a vessel for semantic content is upended. Removed from all context\nand understanding, speech — a constellation of rhythm and melody, resonant\nvowels and percussive consonants — begins to resemble music.In a phone\ninterview, Ms. Lim said that what drew her to out-of-the-way languages in her\ncoming opera and in her dazzlingly polyglot “Mother Tongue” (2005) for soprano\nand ensemble was “not so much ‘Oh, here’s a cool language.’”Rather, she said,\ndifferent languages open up new ways of thinking about the human body as a\n“total mechanism” for vocal expression, “running the whole range from really\nguttural sounds and breaths through resonant tones, all as a really powerful\ncommunicative vehicle that allows us to travel through emotional and\npsychological states.”A whistling language like that quoted in “Tree of\nCodes,” she said, speaks to “how we humans adapt to and interact with our\nenvironment, not being separate, but really being in a merged relationship\nwith everything around us.”That positive attitude sets Ms. Lim apart from some\nof the other musical-linguistic ventures. Most are marked by a sense of loss\nand melancholy. A work like Mr. James’s “Counting in Quileute,” which blends\nhis own field recordings of the last native speakers of an American Indian\nlanguage from western Washington State is like a time capsule shot into space\n— except the meaning was already opaque at the time of its sealing.At a\nperformance of “Counting in Quileute” in 2013 at Roulette in Downtown\nBrooklyn, a set of speakers encircling the audience created an immersive and\ndisorienting experience as torrents of foreign words washed over listeners and\nmerged with breathy and brittle sounds created live by an instrumental\nensemble.The millennial gloom hovering over such a project is surely no\naccident. This fascination with the death throes of minority languages in\nremote regions seems linked to a wider contemporary anxiety over the\ndegradation of the environment. The wane of linguistic diversity is the\ncultural equivalent of the loss of ecological diversity and, as such, a\nnatural source of inspiration.In a phone interview, Mr. Bresnick said it was a\ntelevision documentary about Ishi, the last member of the Yahi tribe, that\ninspired his work for piano and voice. He said he related the story to his\nmother, a fluent Yiddish speaker, who was then 94 years old. “I told her,\n‘You’re my Ishi, you’re the last to speak this language,’” he said. “She\npointedly looked at me and said: ‘No, you are. Because you still care to\nknow.’”His setting begins with the pianist’s simultaneously singing and\nplaying the song, which starts out sounding sunny, and naïve. As the voice\ndrops away and the piano continues to reiterate the melody, it takes on an\nincreasingly forlorn and alien feel, the husk of a tune that has long since\nlost its meaning.When Mr. James flew to Washington to conduct field research\non the Quileute language, he was immediately confronted with its extreme\nfragility. “The day I arrived, the best speaker was airlifted and taken to\nhospital,” he recalled. “And the population of native speakers went four to\nthree. The next-best speaker had dementia. And the remaining two were old\nwomen who had grown up at a time when they were punished for speaking the\nlanguage.”Mr. Tan similarly found himself working against the clock when he\nset out to investigate Nu Shu culture at the prodding of his father who, as a\nnative of Hunan had heard about this centuries-old women’s language. Some of\nthe remaining speakers were over 100 but in no hurry to let a New York-based\ncomposer in on their secret.When Ms. Fung, a Canadian, traveled through rural\nsouthwestern China in 2012 to study the music and language of several mountain\ntribes, she enlisted the help of a guide who helped her gain access to the\nhomes of villagers where she might be regaled with drinking songs and other\nimpromptu performances after dinner. “A lot of them were shy,” she recalled in\na phone interview, “and you’d have to have a meal with them, and drink some\nmoonshine.”That sort of hands-on field work makes Mr. Tan, Ms. Fung and Mr.\nJames the heirs to Bela Bartok, who traveled the countryside of his native\nHungary with an unwieldy Edison phonograph to record and transcribe regional\nfolk songs: the beginning of ethnomusicology. Ethnolinguistics can seem like a\nnatural extension: The last vestiges of some minority languages are preserved\nas song, and a musical ear can be an advantage in studying the kind of tonal\nlanguages prevalent in parts of Asia.But some professional linguists are\nwatching with unease as artists, journalists and other amateur researchers\nenter their field. “A lot of people think they can do linguistics,” said\nGregory D. S. Anderson, the director of the Living Tongues Institute for\nEndangered Languages in Salem, Ore. “A lot of good-intentioned people can\nwreak a lot of havoc when you work with these communities that are doubly\nmarginalized and disenfranchised.”Among his concerns are ethical questions of\noutsiders’ drawing financial benefit or prestige from such expeditions, or\nusing the recorded voices of the dead in cultures where that is taboo. Mr.\nJames said he explained his intentions in conversations with members of the\nQuileute tribal council, making sure to “convince them that this use was a\nmeaningful use of the voices of their ancestors.”Ms. Fung described the\nprocess by which the material she gathered on her travels was translated into\nmusic as one of filtering and sublimation. She said she was particularly\ninterested in the wide melodic leaps and in a certain shrill and nasal vocal\ntone she encountered in the speech and songs she studied. Now she’s looking\nfor ways to translate some of these qualities into instrumental chamber\nmusic.“I don’t want to just state a song,” she said. “It’s about finding the\nparts of the research that speak to me — for example those wide leaps — and\nfiltering it so it becomes mine.”Mr. Tan, meanwhile, embedded his films of Nu\nShu singing into a shimmering orchestral score that features an unusually\nmuscular and assertive solo harp part. “I believe that if a tradition is\nvanishing something else has to take its place,” he said. “If something is\ndying there must be a way to incarnate it into something new.”\n\n","title":"Vanishing Languages, Reincarnated as Music - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTScience: These languages could go extinct.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01470"},"content":"You know a Steve McCurry picture when you see one. His portrait of an Afghan\ngirl with vivid green eyes, printed on the cover of National Geographic in\nJune 1985, is one of the iconic images of the 20th century. McCurry’s work is\nstark and direct, with strong colors, a clear emotional appeal and crisp\ncomposition. His most recent volume of photographs, “India,” is a compendium\nof the pictures he took in that country between 1978 and 2014, and it also\ngives us the essential McCurry. There are Hindu festivals, men in turbans,\nwomen in saris, red-robed monks, long mustaches, large beards, preternaturally\nsoulful children and people in rudimentary canoes against dramatic\nlandscapes.In McCurry’s portraits, the subject looks directly at the camera,\nwide-eyed and usually marked by some peculiar­ity, like pale irises, face\npaint or a snake around the neck. And when he shoots a wider scene, the result\nfeels like a certain ideal of photography: the rule of thirds, a neat\ncounterpoise of foreground and background and an obvious point of primary\ninterest, placed just so. Here’s an old-timer with a dyed beard. Here’s a doe-\neyed child in a head scarf. The pictures are staged or shot to look as if they\nwere. They are astonishingly boring.Boring, but also extremely popular:\nMcCurry’s photographs adorn calendars and books, and command vertiginous\nprices at auction. He has more than a million followers on Instagram. This\npopularity does not come about merely because of the technical finesse of his\npictures. The photographs in “India,” all taken in the last 40 years, are\npopular in part because they evoke an earlier time in Indian history, as well\nas old ideas of what photographs of Indians should look like, what the\naccouterments of their lives should be: umbrellas, looms, sewing machines; not\nlaptops, wireless printers, escalators. In a single photograph, taken in Agra\nin 1983, the Taj Mahal is in the background, a steam train is in the\nforeground and two men ride in front of the engine, one of them crouched,\nwhite-bearded and wearing a white cap, the other in a loosefitting brown\nuniform and a red turban. The men are real, of course, but they have also been\nchosen for how well they work as types.A defender of McCurry’s work might\nsuggest that he is interested in exploring vanishing cultures. After all, even\nin the 21st century, not all Indians go to malls or fly in planes. Should he\nnot be celebrated for seeking out the picturesque and using it to show us\nquintessential India? What is wrong with showing a culture in its most\nauthentic form? The problem is that the uniqueness of any given country is a\nmixture not only of its indigenous practices and borrowed customs but also of\nits past and its present. Any given photograph encloses only a section of the\nworld within its borders. A sequence of photographs, taken over many years and\ncarefully arranged, however, reveals a worldview. To consider a place largely\nfrom the perspective of a permanent anthropological past, to settle on a\nnotion of authenticity that edits out the present day, is not simply to\npresent an alternative truth: It is to indulge in fantasy.What a relief it is\nto move from Steve McCurry’s work to that of someone like Raghubir Singh.\nSingh worked from the late ’60s until his untimely death in 1999, traveling\nall over India to create a series of powerful books about his homeland. His\nwork shares formal content with McCurry’s: the subcontinental terrain, the\neye-popping color, the human presence. Within these shared parameters,\nhowever, Singh gives us photographs charged with life: not only beautiful\nexperiences or painful scenes but also those in-between moments of drift that\nmake up most of our days. Singh had a democratic eye, and he took pictures of\neverything: cities, towns, villages, shops, rivers, worshipers, workers,\nconstruction sites, motorbikes, statues, modern furniture, balconies, suits,\ndresses and, sure, turbans and saris.The power of Singh’s pictures lies in\npart in their capacious content. But it also lies in their composition, which\nrises well beyond mere competence, as he demonstrated in books like “River of\nColour,” “The Ganges” and “Bombay: Gateway of India.” Singh has cited Edgar\nDegas and the American photographer Helen Levitt as influences, and you can\nsee what he has learned from their highly sophisticated approaches (Degas’s\ncasual grace, Levitt’s sympathetic view of urban oddity and the way both of\nthem let in messiness at the edges of their images — a messiness that reminds\nus of the life happening outside the frame as well as within it). A photograph\nlike the one Singh made of a crowded intersection in Kolkata in 1987 draws a\nbreathtaking coherence out of the chaos of the everyday. The image, of which\nthe key elements are a green door, a distant statue, an arm and a bus, is\nslightly surreal. But everything is in its right place. It reads as a moment\nof truth snipped from the flow of life.I love even more a photograph Singh\nmade in Mumbai a couple of years later. Taken in a busy shopping district\ncalled Kemps Corner, this photograph has less-obvious charms. The picture is\ndivided into four vertical parts by the glass frontage of a leather-goods shop\nand its open glass door, and within this grid is a scatter of incident. The\nmain figure, if we can call her that, is a woman past middle age who wears a\nred blouse and a dark floral skirt and carries a cloth bag on a string. She is\nseen in profile and looks tired. Beyond her and behind are various other\nwalkers in the city, going about their serious business. An overpass cuts\nacross the picture horizontally. The foreground, red with dust, is curiously\nopen, a potential space for people not yet in the picture. The glass on the\nleft is a display of handbags for sale, and the peculiar lighting of the bags\nindicates that Singh used flash in taking the shot. The image, unforgettable\nbecause it stretches compositional coherence nearly to its snapping point,\nreminds me of Degas’s painting “Place de la Concorde,” another picture in\nwhich easy, classically balanced composition is jettisoned for something more\nexciting and discomfiting and grounded.How do we know when a photographer\ncaters to life and not to some previous prejudice? One clue is when the\npicture evades compositional cliché. But there is also the question of what\nthe photograph is for, what role it plays within the economic circulation of\nimages. Some photographs, like Singh’s, are freer of the censorship of the\nmarket. Others are taken only to elicit particular conventional responses —\nimages that masquerade as art but fully inhabit the vocabulary of advertising.\nAs Justice Potter Stewart said when pressed to define hard-core pornography in\n1964, “I know it when I see it.”I saw “it” when I recently watched the video\nfor Coldplay’s “Hymn for the Weekend.” The song is typical Coldplay, written\nfor vague uplift but resistant to sense (“You said, ‘Drink from me, drink from\nme’/When I was so thirsty/Poured on a symphony/Now I just can’t get enough”).\nFilmed in India, with a cameo by Beyoncé, the video is a kind of exotification\nbingo, and almost like a live-action version of Steve McCurry’s vision:\npeacocks, holy men, painted children, incense. Almost nothing in the video\nallows true contemporaneity to Indians. They seem to have been placed there as\na colorful backdrop to the fantasies of Western visitors. A fantasy withers in\nthe sunlight of realism. But as long as realism is held at bay, the fantasy\ncan remain satisfying to an enormous audience. More than a hundred million\npeople have watched the Coldplay video since it was posted at the end of\nJanuary.Are we then to cry “appropriation” whenever a Westerner approaches a\nnon-Western subject? Quite the contrary: Some of the most insightful stories\nabout any place can be told by outsiders. I have, for instance, seen few\ndocumentary series as moving and humane as “Phantom India,” released in 1969\nby the French auteur Louis Malle. Mary Ellen Mark, not Indian herself, did\nextraordinary work photographing prostitutes in Mumbai. Non-Indians have made\nimages that capture aspects of the endlessly complicated Indian experience,\njust as have Indian photographers like Ketaki Sheth, Sooni Taraporevala, Raghu\nRai and Richard Bartholomew.Art is always difficult, but it is especially\ndifficult when it comes to telling other people’s stories. And it is\nferociously difficult when those others are tangled up in your history and you\nare tangled up in theirs. What honors those we look at, those whose stories we\ntry to tell, is work that acknowledges their complex sense of their own\nreality. Good photography, regardless of its style, is always emotionally\ngenerous in this way. For this reason, it outlives the moment that occasions\nit. Weaker photography delivers a quick message — sweetness, pathos, humor —\nbut fails to do more. But more is what we are.__\n\n","title":"A Too-Perfect Picture - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTmag: How can we tell when a photograph is giving us the truth about a place and not simply trafficking in fantasy? https://t.co/wV0K…","date":"Thu Mar 31 06:06:14 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715419915327565824"},"retweets":61},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22O6lBt"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01471"},"content":"**You play the defense attorney Johnnie Cochran on the FX series “American Crime Story.” You’ve said that you celebrated the O.J. verdict back in 1995: “I cheered for Emmett Till. I cheered for all the strange fruit that had hung on the trees for three centuries.” Do you think O.J. deserved to benefit from all of those tragedies? **Whether or not he deserved to benefit from it, I don’t know. I mean, is any of us deserving of grace?**Recently, you told ABC News, “I think he did it.” Why do you think that he did it? **It doesn’t matter what I said. How I feel about it, how you feel, or how Johnnie Cochran felt, it doesn’t matter. What matters is what we’re going to do now.**Cochran’s key insight in the O.J. trial was to lean on distrust of the police among African-Americans. Have you personally been on the receiving end of negative assumptions about race by law enforcement? **I was at home late one night, and I heard something at the door and thought, Well, maybe someone threw a script onto the porch, a late delivery. I opened the door, and there were six policemen out front, screaming at the top of their lungs for me to come outside and get on my knees. Apparently they’d been told I was out of town, and a security patrol called in that there was something suspicious happening at my house. If I hadn’t watched a lot of “Law \u0026amp; Order,” I would have been dead. I had been trained to know what to do when there’s a cop: Defuse it. “Yes, sir. Mm-hmm.”**Were you at all tempted to say, “Do you know who I am, I’m the Harvard-educated, Yale-educated — ”** No. The same thing happened to Skip Gates at Harvard.**You have said that the problem with the O.J. trial is that we didn’t resolve enough back then, and it’s coming back to haunt us. What do you think we could have resolved? **The resolution wasn’t the issue, it was the discussion. When you talk things through, you end up coming closer together, because when you sit down at the table, you’re actually near each other.**Well, both the defense and the prosecution were mixed-race teams. Maybe, on a very small level, there was some working out of racial prejudices? **Absolutely not.**But if you’re saying that problems of institutional racism can be solved by people sitting down and talking, why not? **That was work. That was image, that was playing for the camera. And if it hadn’t been on television, I doubt Chris Darden would have been there; Darden coming on the prosecution team was a reaction to O.J. hiring Johnnie Cochran. What I mean is that we never talked about it as a nation.**The TV show highlights Cochran’s efforts to make O.J. more “black” — decorating his home with African art just before jurors visit, for example. It seems he was engaging in a sort of third-party code-switching. You grew up in Detroit and went to Ivy League schools. Are there times that you code-switch? **Absolutely. Around 1969, my family had just bought a house in a lower-middle-class white neighborhood two blocks away from school. Then, all of a sudden, all the white people left the neighborhood and the school. Overnight, our parents pulled us out and sent us to an all-white school in an all-white neighborhood.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01472"},"content":"Securing a table at Gramercy Tavern, the abidingly debonair restaurant on East\n20th Street, can, after 22 years, still feel a matter of tooth and claw. You\nmight imagine that Jesse Tyler Ferguson, a star of ABC’s “Modern Family” and\nfive-time Emmy nominee, need barely lift a pinkie to claim one.But there he\nwas on a snowy February morning, down in the windowless basement, learning\nwhat it’s like to be just another caller without an inside track, gently\ndeflected and offered a consoling “Sorry.”He had come to observe the\nrestaurant’s besieged telephone reservationists in their natural habitat, the\nbetter to channel their woes and wiles in the comedy “Fully Committed,” which\nstarts previews on Friday and opens for a limited run on April 25 at the\nLyceum Theater.Now 40, Mr. Ferguson last appeared on Broadway a decade ago as\nthe paisley-caped 12-year-old Leaf Coneybear in the ensemble musical “The 25th\nAnnual Putnam County Spelling Bee.” (He sewed his own cape when he was\nworkshopping the show in the Berkshires.) His welcome-back role is Sam\nCallahan, a struggling actor who ekes out rent by fielding phone calls,\nparanoiacs and unchecked ids as the gatekeeper at an exalted Manhattan\nrestaurant.The show has a cast of one. Mr. Ferguson plays the paranoiacs and\nunchecked ids, too. In a series of hairpin turns, he must incarnate some three\ndozen personalities — including a peacock of a chef; a gushy supermodel’s\nassistant; a mobster with a very special request; a sufferer of chronic\nlaryngitis; and a New York Times food editor with the icy soul of a Prada-\nsheathed fashion martinet — all in a time span that allots each character less\nthan three minutes.“I was immediately drawn to the challenge,” he said, a hint\nof subversion behind a ready smile. “I thought, ‘How is it possible for an\nactor to do it?’”Under the guidance of a dialect coach, Kate Wilson, who\nteaches at Juilliard, he has come up with a warp and woof of modulating\ntonalities. “I’m using such different parts of my voice for these characters\nthat it’s almost like singing for 90 minutes,” he said. To complicate matters,\na number of characters require accents from other corners of the world: the\nMiddle East, Japan, the Dominican Republic, Kentucky.Mr. Ferguson turned to\nPaul Walsh, Gramercy Tavern’s dapper head of guest relations: “Do you have to\ndeal with language barriers?”Mr. Walsh waved toward a wall. “We have the\nclocks there for a reason,” he said, pointing to three labeled Los Angeles,\nLondon and Singapore. “The chef” — Michael Anthony — “speaks fluent\nJapanese.”When “Fully Committed” debuted Off Broadway in 1999, it was a\nknives-out satire on the rise of cult restaurants in Manhattan and the diners\nbaying at the doors to be let in. Becky Mode wrote the script based on\ncharacters she had developed with the actor Mark Setlock, the show’s initial\nSam and a onetime reservationist at Bouley in its first, febrile decade in\nTriBeCa. (Ms. Mode did a stint there too, checking coats and, it seems,\neavesdropping.)For the Broadway revival, Ms. Mode has updated the script to\nreflect today’s ever more obsessive food culture.“Back in 1999, a wild ramp\nwas extraordinary,” she said. “Now they’re serving them at the corner\ndeli.”The peacocking chef, once a small-scale tyrant, has gained a publicist,\na cookbook and another restaurant in Miami. Prices have gone up, too: A dinner\nthat once elicited gasps at $200 a head now approaches the $325 benchmark set\nby Per Se, Thomas Keller’s temple to the art of the micro-dice near Lincoln\nCenter.The play has been in nearly constant production somewhere in the world\n(“Estonia, Japan, Brazil,” Ms. Mode said) for the past 17 years. But its\nascent to Broadway must in part be credited to Mr. Ferguson’s endearing turn\nas the neurotic half of the groundbreaking gay couple on “Modern Family,” now\nin its seventh season and one of the highest-rated scripted shows on TV.When\nasked what he brought to the play, Mr. Ferguson pointed out that Mr. Setlock\nwas in his late 20s when he originated the role. “I’m a 40-year-old man,” Mr.\nFerguson said. “I can’t pretend not to be.” In Ms. Mode’s revision, Sam is no\nlonger an up-and-comer but a potential has-been who may have missed his last\nshot at breaking through. “People root for the underdog,” Mr. Ferguson\nsaid.And this underdog has a lot on his plate. The number of characters Mr.\nFerguson has to hold in his head is still in flux. “The math changes,” Ms.\nMode said. “We’ve added and subtracted.”Midwestern-bred and still wholesome\ndespite his exposure to New York’s hissiest, Sam remains the play’s anchor.\n“Sam is basically me,” Mr. Ferguson added. “So he’s easy to return to. He’s\nthe most grounded. And the most handsome.”But not necessarily his favorite to\nportray; that shifts daily. “I tend to enjoy playing horrible people the\nmost,” he said. “Maybe because I’m a nice guy in real life. It’s gratifying to\nlash out.”That wasn’t an option as the clock struck 10 a.m. at Gramercy Tavern\nand the lines were officially open. Three phones went off at once.The\nreservationists answered with preternatural calm; negotiations began. Their\ntidy office, with a miniature disco ball hanging from the ceiling and a back\nwall painted robin’s-egg blue, bore only a spiritual resemblance to the shabby\nset (bald pipes, brimming trash cans, broken chair) in which Sam is trapped\nfor almost the entire play.Danny Meyer, the chief executive of Union Square\nHospitality Group, which runs Gramercy Tavern, treated his staff to a\nperformance of “Fully Committed” during its original run. According to Mr.\nWalsh, everyone approved.He showed Mr. Ferguson the color-coded, heavily\nannotated guest lists the reservationists had prepared for that day’s lunch\nand dinner. There were notes on a wife’s name, a favorite dish, a birthday.\n“You could call it Big Brother,” Mr. Walsh said. “Or stalking,” said Mr.\nFerguson.“130,000 people come every year,” Mr. Walsh said. “That’s a lot of\nphone conversations.” Asked how the restaurant accommodates idiosyncratic\nrequests, he recalled a patron who wanted to cue bagpipes when he made his\nentrance. Not a recording; real bagpipes.“Have you had to say no to a lot of\npeople?” Mr. Ferguson said.“We do verbal judo, talking people off the ledge,”\nMr. Walsh said. “We try to find the yes.”Mr. Ferguson has done time in the\nservice industry. At 17, he worked the host stand at Sadie’s, a Mexican\nrestaurant in Albuquerque, where he once seated Neil Patrick Harris, who had\nattended a rival high school and was already famous. Years later, they were\nstarring in back-to-back sitcoms.And before Mr. Ferguson made it to Broadway\nand became a perennial Shakespeare in the Park performer, he toiled at a gift\nshop in Times Square, tantalizingly close to the stages he dreamed of walking.\n“I just wanted to be part of it somehow,” he said.Even after his first big\njob, as the golly-gee sailor Chip in the Public Theater’s production of “On\nthe Town,” he found himself once again behind the gift-shop register, much\nlike Sam slinking back to the basement of the restaurant. For a time he tended\nbar at the Winter Garden Theater. “I saw the first act of ‘Cats’ a lot,” he\nsaid.On Instagram, Mr. Ferguson identifies himself as “aspiring professional\nfood cooker person.” He once told Us magazine that if he had to choose a\ndifferent career, he would be a chef. His mother has photographs of him as a\nkid wearing an apron and helping her make pie crust; he revives her sour\ncream, sugar and candy cane cookie recipe for Christmas every year. Since his\nmarriage to Justin Mikita, a lawyer, in 2013, his arsenal of kitchen tools has\ngrown to include a spiralizer and a tagine.For his last birthday, his husband\ngave him coupons for culinary experiences, such as making pasta with the chef\nNancy Silverton. (He hasn’t had time to take advantage of them yet.) He has a\nfood blog in the works. And he is an investor in the Los Angeles brasserie\nTerrine, whose chef, Kris Morningstar, he describes as “the kindest, gentlest\nperson” — in other words, not a model for the terrorizing narcissist in “Fully\nCommitted.”(Ms. Mode, meanwhile, is further mining contemporary food culture\nwith a TV series about “an alcoholic sommelier and a coke-addicted, just-out-\nof-prison chef who open a restaurant in the Bronx,” set to have its premiere\non AMC in May.)In the past few months, flying back and forth between “Modern\nFamily” shoots in Los Angeles and “Fully Committed” rehearsals in New York,\nMr. Ferguson has returned to Gramercy Tavern to further absorb the scene,\nnoting in particular how diplomatically the staff maneuver around inebriated\nguests.He has dutifully dined at institutions like Daniel and Jean-Georges,\nalthough, he said, “I’m not really drawn to super-structured coursed-out four-\nstar meals.” On a visit to Eleven Madison Park, he said, half in wonder, “We\nnever saw a menu. I had no idea how much it would cost.”Still, he said: “A lot\nof it is theater. If you drop a napkin, it’s folded. If a person’s not here,\nthey put the cloche back over the dish. That’s what I love about these fancy\nrestaurants: They’re performing for you.”\n\n","title":"Jesse Tyler Ferguson Skewers Food Culture on Broadway - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesarts: .@jessetyler skewers food culture on Broadway in \"Fully Committed\" https://t.co/kRqYU957hc https://t.co/s6H7x4fgul","date":"Thu Mar 31 05:39:55 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715413294140563456"},"retweets":33},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SmE6yV"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01473"},"content":"Wildlife officers in Kenya fatally shot one of the country’s best-known lions\non Wednesday after their attempt to capture it alive attracted a crowd, whose\npresence upset the animal and led it to injure a bystander, the Kenya Wildlife\nService said.The lion, a 13-year-old male known as Mohawk for the shape of his\nmane, was a tourist favorite in Nairobi National Park. His death was met with\noutrage online and quickly brought to mind the high-profile killing of Cecil,\na 13-year-old lion shot by an American hunter in Zimbabwe in July.“Some fools\nkilled a lion by the name Mohawk today here in Nairobi,” a Nairobi resident\nwrote on Twitter. “It’s crazy to think about it even for a second.”The\nwildlife service said in a statement posted to Twitter that a veterinary and\nsecurity team had gone to an area outside Isinya, a town 35 miles south of\nNairobi, the capital, at 8 a.m. on Wednesday after they were “alerted to the\npresence of a lion.”The team found Mohawk and stood guard around him while\nthey waited for the arrival of reinforcements who were supposed to tranquilize\nand capture him, the service said.A spokesman for the wildlife service told\nThe Washington Post that the first response team was not equipped with\ntranquilizers, only rifles, and so had no nonlethal way to subdue the lion.\nThe capture team, which left Nairobi at 9:30 a.m., did have tranquilizers. But\nwhile they were on their way, the situation in Isinya spun out of control, and\nwithin an hour, Mohawk was dead.A large group of people gathered to gawk at\nMohawk, the wildlife service said, which “brought about a visible agitation in\nthe lion due to the rowdiness and size of the crowd.”The Associated Press said\nthere were as many as 400 people in the crowd.Mohawk lashed out at one of the\ngawkers when “the public confronted” him, the wildlife service said, leaving\nthe rangers with little choice but to shoot in order to “avert injuries or, at\nworst, deaths.”Video of the lion’s death showed him wandering among cars in a\ngrassy area before breaking into a run and charging at a group of people\nstanding in the back of a pickup truck.The Associated Press said that he\nstruck a 27-year-old man on a motorcycle, who sustained bruises and deep\nlacerations on his back.Mohawk, who was born in Nairobi National Park, had\nbeen involved in territorial feuds with other lions in recent weeks, the\nservice said. Isinya, roughly 20 miles south of the park, lies along a\nseasonal migration route. The service said they believed Mohawk had gone there\nto establish new territory for himself.The wildlife service described the\ndecision to kill him as “a last resort” and sought to reassure the public that\nthey were in the business of protecting, not killing, animals.“We wish to\nassure the public that we remain true and committed to serving and protecting\nour wildlife resources,” it said on Twitter. “Our number-one focus has and\nwill always be conserving our wildlife for Kenyans and the world as a\nwhole.”The uproar over the death of Mohawk mirrored a similar outcry in South\nAfrica, where South African National Parks officials said this week that they\nhad decided to kill a lion known as Sylvester who had escaped on Sunday from\nKaroo National Park, roughly 300 miles northeast of Cape Town.But the parks\nservice appeared to soften its position on Wednesday after outrage flooded\nsocial media under the hashtag #SaveSylvester.South African National Parks\nsaid it would consider a range of options in its response to the lion’s\nescape, including sending Sylvester to another park or donating him to a\nprivate conservation group. But the agency warned that lethal force was still\non the table.“If the animal kills a person it poses an even greater danger as\nit may lose fear for humans and see them as easy prey,” the parks service said\nin a statement.\n\n","title":"Mohawk, a 13-Year-Old Lion, Is Killed by Kenya Wildlife Rangers - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Mohawk, a 13-year-old lion, is killed by Kenya wildlife rangers https://t.co/FOzMwJcxFR","date":"Thu Mar 31 05:25:35 +0000 2016","favs":127,"id":{"$numberLong":"715409685394931712"},"retweets":170},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VUvC7V"}

Trump.These\nblue-collar white Republicans, a mainstay of the conservative coalition for\ndecades, are now vilified by their former right-wing allies as a “non-\nChristian” force “in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture,” corrupted by the\nsame “sense of entitlement” that Democratic minorities were formerly accused\nof.Kevin Williamson, a columnist for National Review, initiated the most\nrecent escalation of this particular Republican-against-Republican power\nstruggle. In a March 13 essay, “The Father-Führer,” Williamson portrays\nTrump’s struggling white supporters as relying on their imaginary victimhood\nwhen, in fact, he contends:Less well-off white voters have only themselves to\nblame, Williamson continues:Not satisfied to stop there, Williamson\nadds:Finally, determined to blow a hole in the Trump hot air balloon, the\ncolumnist hits hard:Williamson’s bitterness over the refusal of Trump’s\nsupporters to get in line behind a more acceptable candidate is echoed across\nthe right.David French, also of National Review, writes:In a March 25 post on\nRedState, Caleb Howe, another frequent conservative commentator, welcomes the\nprospect of the departure of Trump supporters from the Republican Party:GOOD\nNEWS! Buchanan Says If Ted Cruz Wins, An “Awful Lot” of Trump Supporters Will\n“Just Go Home”The “new Trump voters,” Howe writes,If Trump is not nominated\nand his supporters stay home on Election Day, Howe believes that “there’s\nreally only one response: Bye.”Glenn Beck joined the chorus of anti-Trump\nconservatives on March 24, when he told listeners to his radio show that such\nRepublicans were not real Christians:This repudiation of a whole class of\nvoters has become a source of furious debate on the right.In a prescient Jan.\n14 essay, “To Attract Disillusioned Voters, the GOP Must Understand Their\nConcerns,” Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy\nCenter, a conservative think tank, wrote:In Olsen’s view, disparaging Trump’s\nlower-income white supporters “will simply intensify the masses’ rage and\nensure that their political spokesmen become more intransigent and radical.”\nEven worse,Only now are major party leaders and contributors beginning to\nrecognize the full depth of this intraparty conflict.On March 28, my colleague\nNick Confessore documented in crushing detail how Republican leaders, donors\nand strategists disregarded the mounting discontent of white working class\nRepublicans, thus setting the stage for the Trump campaign.The history,\nConfessore wrote, isWhile white voters with a high school degree or less have\nsteadily declined as a share of the electorate — from 82 percent of adults 25\nand older in 1940 to 29 percent in 2007 — they have repeatedly played a\ncrucial role in determining the outcome of elections.In the presidential\nelections of 1960 and 1964 – both Democratic victories – John Kennedy and\nLyndon Baines Johnson each won 55 percent of the votes cast by whites without\ncollege degrees, according to the widely-cited 2008 Brookings paper, “The\nDecline of the White Working Class and the Rise of a Mass Upper Middle\nClass.”In the next two elections, 1968 and 1972, in the wake of the civil\nrights movement, urban riots and a sharp increase in violent crime, white\nworking class support for the Democratic nominees fell by 20 percentage\npoints, to 35 percent, according to the paper’s two authors, Ruy Teixeira and\nAlan Abramowitz. “The Democrats,” they wrote, “were the party of the white\nworking class no longer.”These two elections marked the establishment of a\nconservative majority that produced Republican presidential victories in 1980,\n1984 and 1988 — the only exception being 1976 when Watergate briefly stalled\nthe ascendance of the right.White working class voters were crucial later in\nthe 1994 Republican takeover of the House engineered by Newt Gingrich, now a\nleading Trump supporter. While non-college whites supported Republican\npresidential candidates beginning in 1968, many remained loyal to the\nDemocratic Party in Congressional races until the Contract With America was on\noffer. In 1992, 57 percent of white men without college degrees voted Democrat\nin congressional elections. In 1994, the percentage shrank by 20 points.\nRepublicans captured the House that year and maintained control in 8 of the\nnext 10 elections.The challenges facing the white working class are indeed\nsevere. According to Teixeira and Abramowitz:These setbacks have provided\nfertile recruiting opportunities for Republicans. David Wasserman, writing at\nfivethirtyeight.com in December 2015, found that of five voting groups (whites\nwith college degrees, whites without college degrees, African-Americans,\nLatinos and Asians/others), whites without college degrees are “Republicans’\nbest group by far.” In 2008, John McCain carried these voters by 14 points,\nand in 2012 Mitt Romney won them by “a whopping 26 points.”The virulent\nattacks on less affluent Republican voters by Williamson et al raise the\nquestion: As a matter of practical politics, how can a party that is losing\nground in virtually every growing constituency — Hispanics, Asians, single\nwomen and the young — even consider jettisoning a single voter, much less the\nstruggling white working class?The Republican Party has seen its core —\nmarried white Christians — decline from 62 percent of the population of the\nUnited States to 28 percent in 2015, according to the Public Religion Research\nInstitute.Trump has won his biggest primary margins among less financially\nsecure, less educated voters, turning the traditional winning coalition in\nRepublican primaries upside down. Mitt Romney consistently did best among the\nmost educated and most affluent Republican primary voters. So did John McCain\nin 2008.The accompanying chart, based on an analysis by the Republican firm\nPublic Opinion Strategies, illustrates aggregated exit poll data from the\nRepublican primaries held through March 21. It shows the demographic groups\nthat have provided Trump with relatively high and relatively low levels of\nsupport.The comparatively low levels of support for Trump among college-\neducated Republicans, women, young voters and those with incomes above\n$100,000 suggest that these voters are most likely to sit out the election or\nto vote Democratic if Trump is the nominee. Conversely, groups that gave him\nhigher than average support in the primaries — the less well educated, those\nwith incomes below the median, men and rural voters — are likely to deliver\nhis best margins in the general election.If there are two key themes in the\nelection so far, one is Trump’s ability to enrage; the other is his ability to\nexceed expectations. The disregard of liberal and conservative elites for\nworking and middle class voters has manifested itself in a consistent\nunderestimation of the anger, resentment and pessimism of these voters — and\nhence of their electoral power.A November 2015 WSJ/NBC survey found that 69\npercent of respondents described themselves as “angry because our political\nsystem seems to only be working for the insiders with money and power;” 54\npercent said that both the economic and political systems were “stacked”\nagainst them.The primaries have demonstrated the importance of the primary\nprocess in making unheard voices audible.On March 14, 1968, less than a month\nbefore he was assassinated, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech,\n“The Other America,” in which he contrasted white America with black\nAmerica.In the former,The latter, the “other America,” hasIt is an irony of\nhistory, then, that King’s language perfectly describes the conflict today\nbetween the privileged establishment and the hard pressed rank and file of the\noverwhelmingly white Republican Party — a conflict between haves and have-nots\nthat is taking the Republican Party to a place it has never been.\n\n","title":"Who Are the Angriest Republicans? - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Who are the angriest Republicans? https://t.co/lgNot3m67e via @NYTopinion https://t.co/7knYz82fC8","date":"Thu Mar 31 05:11:25 +0000 2016","favs":171,"id":{"$numberLong":"715406120769052672"},"retweets":94},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PGO4cp"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01475"},"content":"WASHINGTON — The Defense Department has informed Congress that it intends to\ntransfer up to a dozen more prisoners from the military prison at Guantánamo\nBay, Cuba, a United States government official said late Wednesday.The\ntransfers would further whittle the number of prisoners, currently 91, held\nthere, and move the United States closer to President Obama’s long-held\nintention of closing the high-security facility before he leaves office next\nyear. Yet significant challenges remain.The Pentagon is required to give\nCongress 30 days’ notice that security standards have been met to release\nprisoners. The government official provided no details on exactly when they\nwould depart Cuba.The government official was granted anonymity to discuss the\nplan because the administration does not officially confirm the transfers of\nprisoners before they occur.Mr. Obama has sought to close the military prison\nsince his first campaign for the White House eight years ago, but persistent\nopposition in Congress has foiled those plans. And with Mr. Obama in his final\nyear in office, the prison is expected to extend beyond his presidency. His\nlatest proposal to close it, submitted in February, was strongly opposed by\nRepublicans.The plan to transfer the next round of Guantánamo prisoners was\nfirst reported Wednesday by The Washington Post.The Obama administration’s\nmain effort to close the prison has been transferring prisoners — viewed as\nlow-risk — to countries that can meet security conditions, with the rest to be\ntaken to a different prison on domestic soil. Among potential sites that the\nPentagon has studied in the United States are military prisons in Fort\nLeavenworth, Kan., and Charleston, S.C., as well as the federal correctional\ncomplex in Florence, Colo., where a maximum-security prison houses many\nconvicted terrorists.But the fate of the plan is uncertain because of a\nstatute banning the military from taking detainees from Guantánamo to the\nUnited States. The Republican-controlled Congress has shown little interest in\nrevoking that law.In light of that, the administration has moved to speed\ntransfers in recent months as it enters its final year. In January, the\nPentagon transferred 10 lower-level Yemeni prisoners to Oman.When Mr. Obama in\nFebruary announced the latest plan to close the detention facility, he noted\nthat “The politics of this are tough,” adding: “I don’t want to pass this\nproblem on to the next president, whoever it is. And if, as a nation, we don’t\ndeal with this now, when will we deal with it?”\n\n","title":"Pentagon Plans More Prisoner Transfers From Guantánamo - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Pentagon Plans More Prisoner Transfers From Guantánamo https://t.co/DhTzn5lM5O","date":"Thu Mar 31 04:58:06 +0000 2016","favs":92,"id":{"$numberLong":"715402768731668480"},"retweets":69},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1MURFUB"}

That independent\nboutique hotel you love? It may be part of a program you’ve never heard of\nthat could earn you free stays. From receiving early check-in at your hotel,\nto spending a layover in a lounge with a glass of wine instead of with a crowd\nat an airport gate, here are some lesser-known programs that deserve a closer\nlook.**Leaders Club** This membership program for the Leading Hotels of the\nWorld, which is made up of over 375 luxury hotels in 75 countries, comes at a\nprice: $150 a year for the introductory level membership. But that includes\nbreakfast for two each day of your stay, Internet access, a room upgrade\n(depending on availability at check-in), early check-in and late checkout\n(depending on availability), a welcome gift, exclusive rates on Leading\nHotels, and the ability to earn one free night at participating hotels for\nevery five stays. There are some knockout luxury hotels in the program, such\nas Le Bristol Paris and the Ciragan Palace Kempinsky in Istanbul. The\nprogram’s highest membership tier, Unlimited Level, $1,200 a year, allows you\nto earn free nights faster (every four stays instead of five), and it includes\nall of the above as well as free airport transfers (in certain cities) to your\nhotel, three free one-year Leaders Club memberships to share with family\nmembers, a free Priority Pass membership (see below for details about the\nprogram) and guaranteed late checkout at 4 p.m. Lhw.com/leaders-club.**Stash\nHotel Rewards** This program is much smaller and includes a range of\nindependent hotels in the United States, including Hawaii, the Caribbean and\nPanama, such as Beach House in Turks and Caicos and the Honua Kai Resort \u0026amp;\nSpa in Hawaii. But it’s free to join and members earn five points per dollar\nspent, which can then be used toward free nights at participating hotels. And\nthere are no blackout or expiration dates. A recent search found that a\nstandard room at the Sunset Marquis in Los Angeles on a Saturday in May was\n$315, or 29,166 Stash points. Another search found a “classic room” midweek in\nJune at the Kennebunkport Inn in Maine for $209 a night or 16,362 Stash\npoints. Stashrewards.com.**iPrefer** Members of this program for Preferred\nHotels and Resorts receive perks at the brand’s more than 600 hotels,\nincluding a number of luxury properties, in more than 85 countries, be it the\nStafford London; the Ohla Ciutat Vella in Barcelona, Spain; or the Royal Palm\nHotel Galapagos. It’s one of the largest such programs and it’s free to join.\nBenefits include free Internet, a room upgrade when available, early check-in\nand late checkout when available, and points for stays. Members receive 10\npoints for each dollar spent for a stay; Elite members (those who earn 50,000\npoints within one year of their membership anniversary date) receive 15 points\nfor each dollar spent for a stay as well as a welcome gift such as a bottle of\nwine, chocolates or a resort credit. Points can be redeemed not only for free\nstays, but also for spa services and dining.\nPreferredhotels.com/iprefer.**Hotels.com Rewards** When it comes to online\nbooking rewards programs, many travelers think of Expedia and Priceline.\nHotels.com also has a program, which includes some 235,000 hotels. It’s free\nto join and members receive one “rewards night” for each night they stay. Once\nthey amass 10 rewards nights, they receive a free night at an eligible hotel.\nThe value of that free night is equal to the average rate of the 10 nights you\nstayed to earn it — in other words, if you stay 10 nights at a hotel akin to a\nBest Western, don’t expect to get a free night at the likes of a Park Hyatt.\nIf a hotel you want to book costs more per night than your free night, you can\nstill use it toward the more expensive room and pay the difference. If you\nredeem for a night of lesser value, however, you forfeit the difference.\nHotels.com.**Priority Pass** This isn’t a loyalty program, but it’s worth\nconsidering if you’re a lounge lover without elite status on a particular\nairline, or if you fly a lot but tend to use different airlines. Priority Pass\nis an independent airport lounge program that gives members access to more\nthan 850 lounges around the world — no matter which airline they happen to be\nflying. You’ll find the lounges in major airports, including Chicago O’Hare\nInternational Airport, Narita International Airport in Tokyo, and Heathrow\nAirport in London. The standard membership is $99 a year plus $27 for each\nvisit; “standard plus” membership is $249, which includes 10 free visits a\nyear and then costs $27 a visit thereafter; and “prestige” membership is $399\na year for unlimited free visits. You may bring a guest into the lounge, but\nthe fee is $27, regardless of your membership level. While that may sound\npricey to those who don’t use lounges, the $399 membership is a good buy\ncompared with the cost of membership in just one major airline’s club. For\ninstance, an individual membership to Delta Sky Club is $450 a year (plus $29\nif you want to bring in a guest). An “executive membership,” which includes\nunlimited visits for the member and up to two guests per visit, is $695 a\nyear. Note: American Express Platinum card members can receive a free Priority\nPass membership.

Rather than making\nus wait for a resolution to the murder attempt against Andre Lyon’s wife,\nRhonda, Episode 11 immediately reveals that she survived but her baby\ndidn’t.Rhonda’s suffering would be the central tragedy of any other series,\nbut for “Empire,” a whirl of high stakes and desperate measures, it’s just one\nof many subplots. In the main plot, Lucious Lyon has been ousted as chief\nexecutive of the company he created by an impulsive, traitorous vote from his\nown son Hakeem.We quickly find out that Hakeem doesn’t have a plan beyond\nsimple revenge against his father for meddling in his work and love lives.\nIt’s possible he’s made more enemies than he can handle. Cookie camps out\ninside his home just to beat him with a broomstick — in an echo of the show’s\npilot. Lucious takes him to the spot where Bunkie died to reveal himself as\nhis best friend’s killer and offer Hakeem a clean shot at his head before he\nsets about plotting to murder his own offspring.The most endearing trait of\nthe Lyon family, even in darkness, has been how closely everyone huddles\ntogether when a threat to the livelihood of the family business presents\nitself. But now that the threat is from within, we see that the lust for power\nruns deeper than blood.A series of dizzying plot negotiations land Cookie’s\nrogue start-up, Lyon Dynasty, back under the Empire umbrella, with the\nmatriarch as head of A\u0026amp;R and Hakeem as chief executive of Empire proper.\nIt’s not yet clear how this will net everyone what they want, but if it means\nmore juicy scenes between Taraji P. Henson and Naomi Campbell as Hakeem’s\ncunning ex Camilla — like the one where Cookie walks out of Camilla’s office\nwith a handful of gumballs from the candy dish, scattering them pettily across\nthe floor at every step — then I’ll consider it a win. Camilla’s motives are\nstill foggy: She once took a payout from Lucious to walk out of Hakeem’s life\nforever, but has since resurfaced as the angel investor Mimi’s girlfriend, and\nnow she wants to steal Hakeem from his R\u0026amp;B protégé and girlfriend Laura.\nThat said, Camilla’s warning about bringing Cookie back into the fold was this\nepisode’s sole bit of sound business advice.The fact that Hakeem finally finds\nlove only to suffer for it privately and professionally is a cruel twist he’s\nhad coming for ages. We’ve watched him bulldoze a few women’s lives without\nmany consequences, so there’s very little sympathy for the stress he feels in\nchoosing between Camilla and Laura. Let’s hope Hakeem choosing Laura won’t\nturn Camilla into the one-dimensional agent of vengeance Anika became\nthroughout the first half of the season.Speaking of Anika, did she push Rhonda\ndown the stairs? If she did, she is very cold for showing up at the hospital\nafterward to ask about the baby. Whatever the case, Anika is now the mother of\nthe child of Empire’s CEO, and that fact is bound to have some unforeseen\nconsequences. Is Hakeem sharp enough to keep the power he just snatched or\nwill his reign be bright and brief like Joffrey from “Game of Thrones?”**Here\nare four jarring musical moments from Episode 11**• Jamal singing “Heavy” as\nbackground music for the scene in which Rhonda loses her baby was extreme even\nfor this show. That said, Rhonda and Andre haven’t been likable at all this\nseason and if there’s anything rewarding to be gleaned from this random\ntragedy, it’ll be the warmth of their bond. Here’s hoping the strain doesn’t\npush Andre back over the edge.• It was a devilish touch to pair Lucious’s\nsomber piano ballad with a montage of exploding cars, murdered pets and broken\nribs. Theatrical revenge is Empire’s not so secret strong suit.• Jamal’s song\nabout the freedom to sleep with whomever he likes proves “Empire” can be sharp\non sexuality when it wants. It’s hard to think of the last time a television\nshow cared enough to explain the finer points of sexual fluidity to a national\naudience.• Laura’s NPR Tiny Desk Concert was hilarious because the idea of the\nNPR video series is for the artist to perform acoustically, but here was the\nsinger — sans her group, who are long overdue for a breakup — belting out a\ntune to an busy, invisible backing track. This is not the first time that\nmusic has magically manifested itself when Laura started to sing. It’s fine,\neven necessary, for “Empire” to be a little goofy, but a show about music —\nespecially one with clever, knowing real life music industry flourishes like\nHakeem hopping up on the Empire board room desk like the ill-fated rapper\nBobby Shmurda did at his signing — could stand to be more sensitive to the\nfiner points of the actual business.\n\n","title":"‘Empire’ Season 2, Episode 11: Hakeem Rises - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesarts: In typical \"Empire\" fashion, the midseason premiere quickly resolved a cliffhanger https://t.co/0n1HFGZCHk https://t.co/Dd…","date":"Thu Mar 31 04:09:05 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715390433833066497"},"retweets":40},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1RKTdou"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01479"},"content":"PARIS — A suspected Islamic State operative who was arrested last week had\namassed a trove of guns and bomb-making equipment, including the type of\nexplosive used in terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels, the French\nauthorities announced on Wednesday, reinforcing fears that militants are\nplanning additional assaults on Europe.The suspect, Reda Kriket, a 34-year-old\nFrenchman, was arrested on Thursday afternoon in Boulogne-Billancourt, a\nwestern suburb of Paris. That evening, the authorities raided a fourth-floor\napartment Mr. Kriket had rented under a fake name in Argenteuil, a\nnorthwestern suburb that was once a popular weekend getaway and a subject for\nImpressionist painters.Inside the apartment, the authorities found “an arsenal\nof weapons and explosives of an unprecedented size,” which led them to believe\nMr. Kriket had been planning an “imminent attack,” the Paris prosecutor,\nFrançois Molins, said at a news conference on Wednesday evening, describing\nfor the first time the scope of the plot.The arsenal included explosive\nmaterials — among them TATP, which was used in suicide bombs that were set off\nin Paris on Nov. 13 and in Brussels on March 22 — along with Kalashnikov\nassault rifles, a submachine gun, pistols, ammunition, four boxes containing\nthousands of small steel balls, stolen French passports, brand-new cellphones,\na tear-gas canister and two computers with instructions to make explosives.A\njudge who focuses on terrorism cases charged Mr. Kriket on Wednesday with\nterrorist conspiracy, possession of weapons and explosives, and falsification\nof documents, among other offenses, Mr. Molins said.Mr. Kriket had an\nextensive criminal record, with multiple convictions for robbery, possession\nof stolen goods and acts of violence, Mr. Molins added.More recently,\naccording to court records, Mr. Kriket raised money for a network of militants\nin 2012 and 2013. He and an accomplice, Anis Bahri, 32, are believed to have\nvisited Syria between late 2014 and early 2015, Mr. Molins said. After\nreturning to Europe, he said, they traveled back and forth among France,\nBelgium and the Netherlands.On July 29, a Belgian court convicted Mr. Kriket\nin absentia of financing a jihadist recruitment network with proceeds from\nrobberies and other crimes. Abdelhamid Abaaoud, believed to have been the\nchief on-the-ground planner of the Paris attacks, was named in the same\nproceeding.Mr. Molins said that investigators had not uncovered a specific\ntarget or date for the planned attack and were trying to identify other\naccomplices. Under questioning, he said, Mr. Kriket denied being a terrorist,\nsaid he had rented the Argenteuil apartment on behalf of someone whom he would\nnot name, and said the unidentified man and an accomplice were the bomb\nmakers.Three men have been held in other countries on suspicion of working\nwith Mr. Kriket. One is Mr. Bahri, whom the Dutch police arrested in the port\ncity of Rotterdam on Sunday at the request of the French authorities. The\nother two are Algerians who were arrested in Brussels on Friday: Abderahmane\nAmeroud, 38, and a man identified only as Rabah M., 34. (He was previously\nidentified as Rabah N. and Salah A.)Mr. Ameroud had been convicted of\nproviding logistical support to two Tunisian suicide bombers who assassinated\nAhmed Shah Massoud, an Afghan opposition leader, two days before the Sept. 11,\n2001, attacks in the United States. In 2005, Mr. Ameroud was found guilty of\ncomplicity in the murder.Mr. Ameroud was also linked to an Afghan and\nPakistani network suspected of training would-be jihadists in a forest near\nParis and in the French Alps. He was convicted of participation in a terrorist\nenterprise in 2007 and was thought to have been deported to Algeria after\nserving his sentence.On Wednesday, a court in Brussels delayed proceedings\nagainst him and Rabah M. to April 7, at the request of their lawyers.Also on\nWednesday, a government official said that a file with the floor plan and\nphotographs of the office of the Belgian prime minister had been found on a\nlaptop computer discarded in a garbage can last week by one of the terrorists\nlinked to the Brussels attacks. It was found during a raid in the Schaerbeek\nneighborhood hours after the attacks.Several Belgian newspapers, including\nL’Echo, De Tijd and De Morgen, reported that the information about the prime\nminister’s office, the site of regular meetings of cabinet ministers, had been\nfound on the laptop.On the same computer, investigators found a statement,\ndescribed by the authorities as a will, by Ibrahim el-Bakraoui, one of three\nsuicide bombers in the attacks. In that statement, Mr. Bakraoui described\nhimself as increasingly desperate and fearful of ending up in prison.He and\nanother man, Najim Laachraoui, blew themselves up at Brussels Airport, and Mr.\nBakraoui’s younger brother, Khalid, detonated a suicide bomb at the Maelbeek\nsubway station. The attacks killed 32 people, a lower toll than previously\nreported, having been revised downward on Tuesday as the authorities finished\nidentifying victims.Officials are seeking a third airport attacker and,\naccording to Belgian reports, another person involved in the subway\nblast.Local news reports said the discarded computer also contained precise\ninformation about the prime minister’s residence on the Rue de la Loi, steps\nfrom the United States Embassy. Secretary of State John Kerry met with Prime\nMinister Charles Michel at the residence on Friday.European nations have come\nunder increasing scrutiny for their response to terrorism. On Wednesday,\nPresident Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser, Lisa O. Monaco, criticized\nallies, including France and Belgium, for failing to reduce barriers to the\nsharing of intelligence among agencies, as the United States did after the\nSept. 11 attacks.Ms. Monaco’s remarks, at a security conference at the\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, were one of the Obama administration’s sternest\nrebukes of its European partners since the Paris and Brussels attacks.“It’s\nfair to say that they have not had the same reaction that we did after we had\n9/11,” which was “to share information amongst ourselves and to get into a\nposition to share it very rapidly with our international partners,” Ms. Monaco\nsaid.Hours before Ms. Monaco spoke, Ard van der Steur, the Dutch minister for\nsecurity and justice, said it had been the intelligence division of the New\nYork Police Department, not the F.B.I., that warned the Netherlands on March\n16 that the Bakraoui brothers had links to terrorism.Mr. van der Steur had\npreviously testified before Dutch lawmakers that the warning came from the\nF.B.I., but in a statement on Wednesday, he said he had misspoken. It was not\nclear how the police in New York had become aware of the brothers.The Turkish\ngovernment arrested Ibrahim el-Bakraoui near the Turkish border with Syria in\nJune. Officials there alerted the Belgian government and then deported Mr.\nBakraoui to the Netherlands at his request.\n\n","title":"Frenchman Plotting ‘Imminent’ Attack Is Charged With Terrorism - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Frenchman plotting \"imminent\" attack with a trove of guns charged with terrorism in France https://t.co/3jlwGMFOQF","date":"Thu Mar 31 03:07:01 +0000 2016","favs":126,"id":{"$numberLong":"715374816702963712"},"retweets":97},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1So48lo"}

For most people, that is untrue.“Despite the rumors, no feed\nchanges are being implemented right now — we still have weeks, or even months,\nof testing to go,” an Instagram spokesman said in a statement. “Currently the\ntest groups are very small. When we roll it out broadly, we will definitely\nlet the community know.”By turning on notifications for an individual account,\nyou would allow Instagram to send you the equivalent of a text message every\ntime that account has a new post.That might be O.K. for your favorite\naccounts, but it is likely to become tiresome if used too often. Your favorite\nfriends, brands and celebrities may essentially be asking to overwhelm you\nwith notifications.The panic is based on a fear that once the algorithm takes\nover, posts you would otherwise see in a reverse chronological presentation\nmay soon be hidden. That is true: Instagram is likely to present photos and\nvideos based on how inclined you are to be interested in them, your history of\ninteraction with the user and how timely the posts are. If you rarely like or\ncomment on an account’s photo, those photos might be less likely to show\nup.But you may see more of an account if you interact often with it. If you\nlike every one of your friend’s photos of her cat, you would more likely see\nher photos, even if they were posted many hours before you logged in.\nInstagram is betting that you probably won’t scroll down too far and that you\nwould rather see your friend’s cat than whatever was posted five minutes\nago.“On average, people miss about 70 percent of the posts in their Instagram\nfeed,” Kevin Systrom, co-founder and chief executive of Instagram, said in an\ninterview in March. “What this is about is making sure that the 30 percent you\nsee is the best 30 percent possible.”A similar concern has risen each time a\nmajor social network has switched to an algorithmic approach. Facebook faced\ncriticism in 2009, and Twitter heard a similar uproar last month when it began\nputting older tweets at the top of user timelines.Nonprofit groups, news\norganizations and brands have long expressed frustration with their\ndiminishing reach on Facebook. Many users, including celebrities, appear to be\nbracing for a similar result on Instagram.\n\n","title":"Instagram Is Changing Its Feed, but (Calm Down) Not Yet - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Yes, Instagram is changing its feed, but not quite yet https://t.co/DK0bIvEpFt","date":"Thu Mar 31 02:16:24 +0000 2016","favs":131,"id":{"$numberLong":"715362075518885889"},"retweets":134},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1qkt6f9"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0147b"},"content":"For half a century, climate scientists have seen the West Antarctic ice sheet,\na remnant of the last ice age, as a sword of Damocles hanging over human\ncivilization.The great ice sheet, larger than Mexico, is thought to be\npotentially vulnerable to disintegration from a relatively small amount of\nglobal warming, and capable of raising the sea level by 12 feet or more should\nit break up. But researchers long assumed the worst effects would take\nhundreds — if not thousands — of years to occur.Now, new research suggests the\ndisaster scenario could play out much sooner.Continued high emissions of heat-\ntrapping gases could launch a disintegration of the ice sheet within decades,\naccording to a study published Wednesday, heaving enough water into the ocean\nto raise the sea level as much as three feet by the end of this century.With\nice melting in other regions, too, the total rise of the sea could reach five\nor six feet by 2100, the researchers found. That is roughly twice the increase\nreported as a plausible worst-case scenario by a United Nations panel just\nthree years ago, and so high it would likely provoke a profound crisis within\nthe lifetimes of children being born today.The situation would grow far worse\nbeyond 2100, the researchers found, with the rise of the sea exceeding a pace\nof a foot per decade by the middle of the 22nd century. Scientists had\ndocumented such rates of increase in the geologic past, when far larger ice\nsheets were collapsing, but most of them had long assumed it would be\nimpossible to reach rates so extreme with the smaller ice sheets of today.“We\nare not saying this is definitely going to happen,” said David Pollard, a\nresearcher at Pennsylvania State University and a co-author of the new paper.\n“But I think we are pointing out that there’s a danger, and it should receive\na lot more attention.”The long-term effect would likely be to drown the\nworld’s coastlines, including many of its great cities.New York City is nearly\n400 years old; in the worst-case scenario conjured by the research, its\nchances of surviving another 400 years in anything like its present form would\nappear to be remote. Miami, New Orleans, London, Venice, Shanghai, Hong Kong\nand Sydney, Australia, are all just as vulnerable as New York, or more so.In\nprinciple, coastal defenses could be built to protect the densest cities, but\nexperts believe it will be impossible to do that along all 95,000 miles of the\nAmerican coastline, meaning that immense areas will most likely have to be\nabandoned to the rising sea.The new research, published by the journal Nature,\nis based on improvements in a computerized model of Antarctica and its complex\nlandscape of rocks and glaciers, meant to capture factors newly recognized as\nimperiling the stability of the ice.The new version of the model allowed the\nscientists, for the first time, to reproduce high sea levels of the past, such\nas a climatic period about 125,000 years ago when the seas rose to levels 20\nto 30 feet higher than today.That gave them greater confidence in the model’s\nability to project the future sea level, though they acknowledged that they do\nnot yet have an answer that could be called definitive.“You could think of all\nsorts of ways that we might duck this one,” said Richard B. Alley, a leading\nexpert on glacial ice at Pennsylvania State University. “I’m hopeful that will\nhappen. But given what we know, I don’t think we can tell people that we’re\nconfident of that.”Dr. Alley was not an author of the new paper, though it is\nbased in part on his ideas about the stability of glacial ice. Several other\nscientists not involved in the paper described it as significant, with some of\nthem characterizing it as a milestone in the analysis of huge ice sheets and\nthe risks they pose in a warming world.But those same scientists emphasized\nthat it was a single paper, and unlikely to be the last word on the fate of\nWest Antarctica. The effort to include the newly recognized factors imperiling\nthe ice is still crude, with years of work likely needed to improve the\nmodels.Peter U. Clark of Oregon State University helped lead the last effort\nby a United Nations panel to assess the risks of sea level rise; he was not\ninvolved in the new paper. He emphasized that the research, like much previous\nwork, highlighted the urgency of bringing emissions of carbon dioxide and\nother greenhouse gases under control.Dr. Clark described the new work as “a\nreally important paper that adds to the growing recognition that in the\nabsence of rapid and strong mitigation of carbon emissions, we are in store\nfor a large sea level rise at rates that may be even faster than has been\nconsidered.”It was his panel that had estimated an upper limit of three feet\nor so on the likely sea level rise in the 21st century, while specifically\nwarning that a better understanding of the vulnerability of Antarctic ice\ncould change that estimate.The new research is the work of two scientists who\nhave been at the forefront of ice-sheet modeling for years. They are Robert M.\nDeConto of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Dr. Pollard, who is a\ncolleague of Dr. Alley’s at Penn State.In a lengthy interview on Monday, Dr.\nDeConto recounted years of frustration. The computer program he had built in a\nlong-running collaboration with Dr. Pollard showed increasing sophistication\nin its ability to explain the behavior of ice sheets, but it had some trouble\nanalyzing the past.Unless global temperatures were raised to unrealistic\nlevels, the model would not melt enough ice to reproduce the high sea levels\nknown to have occurred in previous periods when either the atmosphere or the\nocean was warmer. The ability to reproduce past events is considered a\nstringent test of the merits of any geological model.“We knew something was\nmissing,” Dr. DeConto said.The new idea came from Dr. Alley. He urged his\ncolleagues to consider what would happen as a warming climate attacked huge\nshelves of floating ice that help to protect and buttress the West Antarctic\nice sheet.Smaller, nearby ice shelves have already started to disintegrate,\nmost spectacularly in 2002, when an ice shelf the size of Rhode Island, the\nLarsen B shelf, broke apart in two weeks.The West Antarctic ice sheet sits in\na sort of deep bowl that extends far below sea level, and if it loses its\nprotective fringes of floating ice, the result is likely to be the formation\nof vast, sheer cliffs of ice facing the sea. These will be so high they will\nbecome unstable in places, Dr. Alley said in an interview, and the warming\natmosphere is likely to encourage melting on their surface in the summer that\nwould weaken them further.The result, Dr. Alley suspected, might be a rapid\nshrinkage as the unstable cliffs collapsed into the water. Something like this\nseems to be happening already at several glaciers, including at least two in\nGreenland, but on a far smaller scale than may be possible in West\nAntarctica.When Dr. DeConto and Dr. Pollard, drawing on prior work by J. N.\nBassis and C. C. Walker, devised some equations to capture this “ice-cliff\ninstability,” their model produced striking results. In contrast to many prior\nattempts, it suddenly had no difficulty recreating the high sea levels of past\nwarm periods.The obvious next step was to ask the model what might happen if\nhuman society continues to warm the planet by pouring huge amounts of\ngreenhouse gases into the atmosphere.The answer the scientists got is\ndescribed in their paper in the dry language of science, but it could easily\nserve as the plot device of a Hollywood disaster movie. They found that West\nAntarctica, which is already showing disturbing signs of instability, would\nstart to break apart by the 2050s.Vulnerable parts of the higher, colder ice\nsheet of East Antarctica would eventually fall apart, too, and the result by\nthe year 2500 would be 43 feet of sea level rise from Antarctica alone, with\nstill more water coming from elsewhere, the computer estimated. In some areas,\nthe shoreline would be likely to move inland by miles.The paper published\nWednesday does contain some good news. A far more stringent effort to limit\nemissions of greenhouse gases would stand a fairly good chance of saving West\nAntarctica from collapse, the scientists found. That aspect of their paper\ncontrasts with other recent studies postulating that a gradual disintegration\nof West Antarctica may have already become unstoppable.But the recent climate\ndeal negotiated in Paris would not reduce emissions nearly enough to achieve\nthat goal. That deal is to be formally signed by world leaders in a ceremony\nin New York next month, in a United Nations building that stands directly by\nthe rising water.\n\n","title":"Climate Model Predicts West Antarctic Ice Sheet Could Melt Rapidly - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"New study sees risk of climate disaster: up to 6 feet of sea-level rise by 2100 https://t.co/4aaT7Ta204 https://t.co/XQkGVMwOaf","date":"Thu Mar 31 01:36:04 +0000 2016","favs":488,"id":{"$numberLong":"715351924594368512"},"retweets":525},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1MCA0pU"}

They were early to digital serialization. Booksellers, too, now\ncrowdsource ideas to find fresh writers. And if you want to explore a virtual\nrelationship, you can try a romance-novel app.How hot are romance novels? Over\nall, annual sales totaled $1.08 billion in 2013, according to the Romance\nWriters of America, which tracks sales. And their popularity is expected to\ngrow. Last year Scribd, an e-book subscription service, sharply reduced the\nnumber of romance and erotica novels it offered because it couldn’t afford to\nkeep up with readers’ appetites. (Scribd pays publishers every time a book is\nread and loses money if a book is too popular.)Despite the perception that\nblockbusters like “Fifty Shades of Grey” drive sales, self-publishing has\nproved a boon for this particular genre. E-books make up nearly 40 percent of\nall purchases, according to the writers group. And there are categories for\nevery reader’s taste, among them, adventure, Christian, multicultural,\nL.G.B.T. and paranormal.Enter Mr. Baca. Authors and publishers require a\nrevolving door of new faces, which, while hard to estimate, tally somewhere in\nthe hundreds each year.“I never thought I would say this,” said Liz Pelletier,\nthe chief executive of the romance novel company Entangled Publishing. “But I\nam so tired of looking at men’s abs. I don’t know if these ones are sexier\nthan those other ones.”“It used to be that everyone wanted Fabio,” she added.\nToday, though, individualism prevails. “Readers don’t want every book to have\nthe same face.”It was January and Ms. Pelletier was bemoaning how tough the\nsearch for a perfect cover model can be. Entangled Publishing is five years\nold, one of the newer entrants to an industry whose identity is synonymous\nwith Harlequin, the Canadian publisher, which in the early 1950s started\npublishing chaste romance stories set in hospitals and medical\noffices.Harlequin reached its zenith in the United States in the 1970s when\nreader appetite shifted to more sexually explicit fare, known as “bodice\nrippers” or “sweet and savages.”Sexy still sells. At Brazen, Entangled’s more\nrisqué fiction line, Ms. Pelletier said book covers with male models sold\nthree times as much as with a woman alone. And for new authors in particular,\n“the cover is really critical,” said Dianne Moggy, vice president for romance\nfiction at Harlequin.Unlike the Fabio era, when covers were painted by hand,\ntoday they are more assembly line than art. Consider Daemon Black, a space\nalien with dark curls and emerald green eyes who is the hero of Entangled’s\nLux series, written by the New York Times best-selling author Jennifer L.\nArmentrout. In 2011, Pepe Toth saw a photograph of himself and his then model\ngirlfriend, Sztella Tziotziosz, on the cover of “Obsidian,” the first in the\nLux series, published that December.Mr. Toth, 26, then living in his native\nHungary, had been transformed into Daemon Black without his knowledge. “I\nthought, what kind of book is this?” he said in a recent interview.Mr. Toth, a\nprofessional soccer player, learned that Ms. Armentrout had used a stock photo\ntaken from a shoot he and his girlfriend had done three years earlier in\nBudapest. So, he emailed the author. “I’m the guy on your book,” he said he\nwrote. Ms. Armentrout invited him to visit the United States.In June 2012, Mr.\nToth and his girlfriend flew to Atlanta after Entangled organized\n“#DaemonInvasion,” a promotion for Lux fans. “When I landed, I said to\nJennifer, ‘I don’t know you,’” he recalled. “She said, ‘But you have a lot of\nfans.’”He and his girlfriend filmed trailers to promote the series and\naccompanied the writer on a book tour. At the FoxTale Book Shoppe in\nWoodstock, Ga., one afternoon, Mr. Toth found himself surrounded by almost 50\ncheering women. “People called out to me, ‘Oh, Daemon is here!’” he said. One\nwoman started crying. “She didn’t want to step up to have a book signed\nbecause she was so happy,” he said. “It was really weird.”Today, he posts book\nsignings on his Twitter account, @Daemon_Black, and he reads excerpts on\nYouTube. And when Entangled considered dropping him from the cover after he\nsplit up with his girlfriend, Ms. Pelletier said, “There was a revolt from\nreaders.”Now Mr. Toth is featured alone.If covers were hand-painted in acrylic\nback in the Fabio era, the tool of the trade today is Photoshop. Heads are cut\noff midface if a model is overexposed. Parts of different photos can be pieced\ntogether like a Picasso portrait. Toes, too, are deleted if they clash with\nthe book’s title.For Mr. Baca’s helicopter-pilot shoot in Santa Cruz, Eileen\nNauman, a writer better known by her pseudonym, Lindsay McKenna, emailed a\nseries of guidelines. She wanted to see him looking alert, with a “slight,\nplayful, teasing smile” and, she wrote, with his “flight suit open to sternum,\nshowing off your great body, but nothing too flagrant or obvious.”“The cover\nof an e-book is the size of a postage stamp,” she said. “Everyone has about\nthree seconds to peruse, and the first hook is going to be that cover.”Few\nromance models, if any, make enough money to eke out a living. Mr. Baca, for\nexample, works at the Housing Authority of the Santa Clara County, Calif., as\na customer-service clerk. And although he has an agent, he said he earned only\n$20,000 in his best year. This, despite the fact that he is a tireless self-\npromoter who fancies himself the next Fabio. Industry executives say it will\nbe difficult to topple the king. “Nobody did it better than Fabio,” said\nAllison Kelley, executive director of the romance writers group. “He really\ndid create the brand.”Mr. Baca’s dream had always been to be on the cover of\nPlaygirl. In his 2004 book, “Journey of a Male Model,” Mr. Baca wrote that a\nSeattle photographer once shot him nude for a possible Playgirl spread.\nInstead, those photos landed on the cover of gay men’s magazines under a\npseudonym. Mr. Baca said he did not know then to secure the rights to his\nphotographs. (For the curious, he finally made Playgirl in 2004.) And he\nmaintains he doesn’t do it for the money. Instead, cover modeling gives him a\ntaste of fame in an otherwise low-key life. “Nobody else knows this secret\nlife,” he said. “They just think I’m Jason.”For more than a decade, Jimmy\nThomas, a fitness model with the swarthy physique of a gladiator or lusty\npirate, has been a romance cover model and estimates he has been on thousands\nof covers. In 2008, he decided to start his own full-service stock-image\nwebsite, called Romance Novel Covers, which he hoped would become a\nclearinghouse for not only his own photographs but also those of other\nmodels.Given the interest in romance, the idea seemed like a good one. But as\nself-publishing took off, a wave of new models stepped in, and the price of\nstock images plummeted. At the same time, self-published authors couldn’t\nafford the prices paid by established companies.Today, a stock image of Mr.\nThomas for an online book sells for about $10. A premade cover costs $45.\nSpecial orders tally about $300.“My stock site basically pays my bills,” said\nMr. Thomas, who is 45.In 2013, with his photo business slowing, Mr. Thomas had\na new idea: start his own convention. Fan conventions have long been a prized\nsource of revenue for publishers, the granddaddy hosted by RT Book Reviews, a\nmagazine for and by romance-book lovers who want to connect with authors.\nConventions attract a steamy knot of admiring fans, and they want to meet the\nmodels. Next month, at the RT Booklovers Convention in Las Vegas, activities\ninclude “America’s Next Top Cover Model” and “Kickass Cowboys, Cops \u0026amp;\nKisses,” where fans can take photos with their favorite models.Mr. Thomas’s\nmore practical approach plays up sessions like taxes and self-publishing, and\nhe concedes it hasn’t actually taken off. But he knows his audience. This\nyear, he has added a cover model search and “The World’s Best Male Exotic\nDancer Competition.”\n\n","title":"With Romance Novels Booming, Beefcake Sells, but It Doesn’t Pay - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"With romance novels booming, beefcake sells, but it doesn’t pay https://t.co/ezSsiOFVsC https://t.co/QI36rgORtO","date":"Thu Mar 31 00:46:02 +0000 2016","favs":144,"id":{"$numberLong":"715339334841458692"},"retweets":71},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1MCuEea"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0147d"},"content":"A documentary about the widely discredited link between autism and vaccines,\nwhich was pulled from the Tribeca Film Festival, will now be released in a New\nYork City theater on Friday, its distributors have said.The film, “Vaxxed:\nFrom Cover-Up to Catastrophe,” was removed from the Tribeca program last week\nafter the festival’s co-founder Robert De Niro — who at first supported its\nscreening — reversed course, saying the documentary would not contribute to a\npositive discussion about medical and public health issues.The film’s\ndistributor, Cinema Libre Studio, a small Burbank, Calif., company, said the\nfilm’s message had been misconstrued. Cinema Libre said that after the film’s\npremiere at the Angelika Film Center on Friday, the company was planning a\nwider release in other cities.Philippe Diaz, chairman of Cinema Libre, said in\na telephone interview on Wednesday that his company had decided to rush the\nfilm to theaters to counter the impression that it or its filmmaker was anti-\nvaccine. “Nobody in their normal mind today could be anti-vaccine. That’s\nabsurd,” he said. Instead, Mr. Diaz said, the film’s backers hope to provide\nan outlet to discuss its claims that the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention covered up information about autism research, accusations they say\nhave been brought by a former center employee, William Thompson.“Our main goal\nis to bring William Thompson to Congress, to testify” and spur further\ninvestigation, Mr. Diaz said. (A Republican Congressman from Florida, Bill\nPosey, appears in the film and is sympathetic to the anti-vaccine cause.)But\nalong with other health organizations, the C.D.C. has already stated\nunequivocally that “vaccines do not cause autism” and has made data from some\nof its research, which Mr. Thompson contested, public and available for peer\nreview.When the Tribeca Film Festival, which begins on April 13, initially\nadded the film to its schedule, doctors and public health professionals\ndenounced the screening, calling it damaging and an irresponsible use of a\nrespected festival’s platform.The director and co-writer of “Vaxxed” is Andrew\nWakefield, an author of a small 1998 study about autism and vaccination that\nwas published in the British medical journal The Lancet and then retracted in\n2010. The study has been widely and frequently debunked.Mr. Wakefield has also\nhad his medical license revoked over ethics violations and his failure to\ndisclose financial conflicts of interest. But he has become a prominent figure\nin the anti-vaccination movement, which has led to an increase in outbreaks of\npreventable diseases like measles.A statement on Cinema Libre’s website,\nposted late Tuesday, said the company had been involved with “Vaxxed” since\nfall 2015, and a spokeswoman said that it had originally planned to release\nthe film in June. But the new release date, first reported by Variety, was\nquickly put into effect after the film was pulled from the Tribeca slate over\nthe weekend.Mr. Diaz said that in working on “Vaxxed” — which was brought to\nCinema Libre by Del Bigtree, a producer and writer of the film who also\nappears in it — his company asked to see the filmmakers’ research, although he\nacknowledged that “none of us are scientists.”“We cannot be convinced by: Is\nit true or not true?” Mr. Diaz said. “There are also tons of studies that show\nthere is no link” between autism and vaccines. Ultimately, the idea of a\ngovernment cover-up seemed a convincingly meaty topic for a film, Mr. Diaz\nsaid. It was his idea to submit it to Tribeca, and he did so through official\nchannels, he said, adding that Mr. De Niro and his wife, Grace Hightower De\nNiro, who have an autistic son, also screened it.“They had, like, months to\nstudy the movie,” Mr. Diaz said, referring to festival programmers. “They told\nus from very early on that it was accepted.” It was only after its place in\nthe lineup was made public and drew negative attention, despite Mr. De Niro’s\nsupport, that the festival leadership rescinded its screening, partly because,\nMr. Diaz said, its sponsors were unhappy.A festival spokeswoman said there was\nno further comment, beyond the festival’s initial reason for canceling the\nmovie, which was articulated by Mr. De Niro.Mr. Diaz and others involved with\n“Vaxxed” have called the festival’s decision to remove it censorship. (A\nChange.org petition to return it to the program has more than 30,000\nsupporters.)But David Wilson, a founder of the True/False Film Fest, a\nrespected annual documentary showcase in Missouri, said censorship was an off-\nthe-mark charge, when the film still had many other outlets. (It will have\nseven screenings per day at the Angelika, versus the sole showing that was\nplanned at Tribeca.)”Censorship is denying a voice,” Mr. Wilson said. “That\nfilm has been denied a platform, but it certainly hasn’t been denied a voice.”\n\n","title":"Pulled From Festival, Anti-Vaccination Film Will Run in Theater - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Anti-vaccination film will run in theater after being pulled from Tribeca Film Festival https://t.co/12o0cCQ2VE","date":"Thu Mar 31 00:36:01 +0000 2016","favs":105,"id":{"$numberLong":"715336816061063168"},"retweets":73},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1Sz14Wb"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0147e"},"content":"A German historian said in new research that The Associated Press, the\ninternational news organization based in New York, formally cooperated with\nNazi Germany in the 1930s, including the employment of a photographer who\nworked for a Nazi propaganda division.The research by Harriet Scharnberg, of\nMartin Luther University, argued that The A.P. was complicit in allowing the\nNazis to “portray a war of extermination as a conventional war.” Her research\nwas reported Wednesday in The Guardian.The Nazi regime cracked down on local\nand international press with a restrictive law in 1933, but The A.P. was able\nto report in Germany until 1941, when the United States joined the war. In a\nstatement, The A.P. said that until Ms. Scharnberg’s research, it “had no\nknowledge of any accusation that material may have been directly produced and\nselected by Nazi propaganda ministries.”“A.P. rejects the suggestion that it\ncollaborated with the Nazi regime at any time,” the company said. “Rather, The\nA.P. was subjected to pressure from the Nazi regime from the period of\nHitler’s coming to power in 1932 until the A.P.’s expulsion from Germany in\n1941. A.P. staff resisted the pressure while doing its best to gather\naccurate, vital and objective news for the world in a dark and dangerous\ntime.”The A.P. said Ms. Scharnberg’s research addressed a German photo agency\nsubsidiary of A.P. Britain. The photographer, Franz Roth, was part of the S.S.\npropaganda division whose photographs were personally chosen by Adolf Hitler,\nThe Guardian reported.The A.P. removed his photos from its website after Ms.\nScharnberg’s research was published, according to The Guardian.The A.P. is\nreviewing any photos credited to Mr. Roth in light of Ms. Scharnberg’s “new-\nto-us reference to him,” Paul Colford, an A.P. spokesman, said in an\nemail.“A.P. archivists were unfamiliar with Franz Roth and his activities\nbefore and during World War II,” Mr. Colford said, adding that the archivists\nassisted Ms. Scharnberg in her research. “We have no record of him at all.”Mr.\nColford said The A.P. does not have personnel records of German employees\nduring the 1930s. The records were most likely destroyed by the Russian\nmilitary during an assault on Berlin, he said.Photos that came from the Nazi\ngovernment were labeled in captions or photo credits, The A.P. said. U.S.\nnewspapers would use their own editorial judgment to decide whether or not to\npublish the images.“Images of that time from Germany had legitimate news value\nas editors and the public needed to learn more about the Nazis,” The A.P.\nsaid.It could not immediately be determined if The New York Times used any of\nMr. Roth’s photos because the newspaper did not publish photographers’ names\nin photo credits in the 1930s. The Times had two correspondents in Berlin\nuntil 1941, when Germany expelled all American journalists after Pearl\nHarbor.In 1939, Louis P. Lochner, the A.P. bureau chief, won the Pulitzer\nPrize for his reporting on the Nazi regime. The A.P. said he resisted pressure\nto fire Jewish employees and eventually arranged for them to have A.P. jobs\noutside Germany, perhaps saving their lives.\n\n","title":"Associated Press Denies Cooperating With Nazis - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Associated Press denies historian's claim that it cooperated with Nazi Germany in the 1930s\nhttps://t.co/YaKN1dwRVK","date":"Thu Mar 31 00:11:01 +0000 2016","favs":149,"id":{"$numberLong":"715330522893918209"},"retweets":188},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1on4kJE"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0147f"},"content":"MOSCOW — In the chandeliered ballroom of Pashkov House, an 18th-century\nmansion on a hill overlooking the Kremlin, a chess grandmaster dressed in a\njacket that seemed several sizes too big declined offerings of canapés, vodka\nand wine.Surrounded by Moscow glitterati and well-groomed waiters who looked\nas if they had been borrowed from an expensive nightclub, the grandmaster, 23\n-year-old Fabiano Caruana of the United States, was not having much fun.“This\nis not my favorite thing,” the cerebral Caruana said of the gala, held early\nthis month to celebrate the start of the grueling World Chess Candidates\ntournament. “I just want to go back to my hotel.”His discomfort at having to\nmake small talk over cocktails with strangers who, for the most part, barely\nunderstood the game at which he excels helps explain why, in a sporting world\nfilled with noisy stars and deep-pocketed corporate sponsors, chess remains a\nstruggling also-ran.Many world-class chess players are simply not cut out for\nthe nonstop self-promotion that celebrity culture demands.Still, while perhaps\nnot the most effusive ambassador for his sport, Caruana was the man to whom\nchess aficionados and promoters had been looking to help turn the game into a\nmass-market spectator sport at the World Chess Championship, which is set to\nbegin in New York in November.Those hopes took a big hit on Monday when\nCaruana, considered America’s best hope in decades for a world championship\ntitle, lost his final match in the Moscow tournament, folding to Sergey\nKarjakin of Russia and missing the chance to advance to the event in New\nYork.Karjakin will face the reigning champion, Magnus Carlsen of Norway, for\nthe title.“Didn’t quite work out at the end, but gave it a shot in a tough\nsituation,” Caruana, who entered the match tied for first place with Karjakin,\nwrote on Twitter shortly after his defeat.Caruana also used his Twitter post\nto congratulate Karjakin “on a well deserved victory,” showing the kind of\nmanners that Bobby Fischer, the last American-born player to win the world\nchampionship, in 1972, was not known for.Chess has come a long way since the\ndays of Fischer, who sulked when he lost, gloated when he won and forfeited\nhis title in 1975 when he declined to defend his crown.The economics of chess\nhave also moved on. Fischer’s Cold War showdown with Boris Spassky in 1972 in\nReykjavik, Iceland, was preceded by bitter wrangling over money, with Fischer\nagreeing to play only after he had secured a doubling of the world\nchampionship prize fund, initially set at $125,000 (the equivalent of around\n$700,000 today).Ilya Merenzon, the chief executive of Agon, which holds the\nworldwide licensing and marketing rights to a series of tournaments held every\ntwo years to decide who is the world’s best player, said the prize fund for\nthis year’s title match in New York would be 2 million euros ($2.2\nmillion).The rise of the personable Carlsen, who has been named one of the\nworld’s sexiest men by Cosmopolitan magazine, has provided a dash of glamour\nlong missing from a game often associated with the introverted or the plain\nodd, like the reclusive Fischer, who spent his later years spouting anti-\nSemitic conspiracy theories.“We are selling an elite event that we hope will\nbe part of the global news cycle,” Merenzon said in an interview. He also\nnoted that far more people around the world played chess than played golf,\nwhich he described as “much more boring than chess.”That chess has a\npassionate following was clear from a controversy that erupted during the\nMoscow tournament, which ended on Monday.Merenzon had tried to make sure that\nlive coverage of each move was available exclusively on his company’s website,\nWorldChess.com, and through NRK, the Norwegian state television company, which\nlast year signed a six-year deal for chess rights worth nearly $2 million.That\ncreated an uproar in the chess world, with complaints that Merenzon, by trying\nto enforce exclusivity, would only curb interest in the game and thus\nundermine his goal of pushing chess into the mainstream.Merenzon, whose\ncompany has filed three lawsuits in Moscow seeking damages of nearly $900,000\nfrom websites that violated this exclusivity, said he merely wanted to turn\nchess into a sport like any other by ensuring that sponsors could be sure\nwhere the audience was — just as they know which TV channel will have the\nbroadcast rights to the Super Bowl or the World Cup.Holding chess tournaments\ncosts lots of money, Merenzon said, so there has to be a system of exclusivity\nin place “for monetizing games in each world championship cycle.”For much of\nthe 20th century, tournament funding often came from resort and spa towns —\nlike Carlsbad (in what was then Czechoslovakia) — that sponsored chess events\nas a way to attract attention and business. Iceland put up money for the\nFischer-Spassky championship match for much the same reason.Today, however,\nfunding, including prize money, comes mostly from Merenzon’s company, Agon,\nwhich organizes world championship events for the World Chess Federation,\nknown as FIDE.Agon pays for halls, hotels, travel and a host of other costs\nand, in return, has exclusive rights to license the events, as it did with\nNRK, and to seek out corporate sponsors.But getting big-name companies that\npour billions of dollars into other sports to cough up for chess has been a\nstruggle.The principal sponsor of the Moscow event was a little-known Russia-\nbased developer called Tashir, which plastered its corporate logo around the\nplaying hall in a Soviet-era telegraph building near the Kremlin. Beluga, a\nhigh-end Russian vodka, sponsored a glassed-in V.I.P. room with leather club\nchairs and unlimited drinks.Caruana, although a supremely gifted player, has\ntwo niche sponsors: the Chess Club and Scholastic Center of St. Louis and the\nLiberty Science Center in Jersey City. He has their patches on the baggy\njacket he wears to matches and other public events.Hikaru Nakamura, another\nAmerican who played in Moscow and finished in fifth, is sponsored by Red Bull.\nHe put a can next to the board at each of his 14 matches.The idea of making\nchess able to pay for itself and turn a profit like other sports gained\nprominence with the American entrepreneur Andrew Paulson, who set up Agon and\nin 2011 secured chess marketing rights for 11 years from the world federation.\nBut he gave up trying to create a vibrant chess economy, sold Agon to Merenzon\nfor a symbolic 1 pound and moved on to other ventures in London.Merenzon had\nhoped that a victory in Moscow by either Caruana or Nakamura would prod\ninterest from big American sponsors for the coming world championship.“We\nwould love to have an American be there,” Merenzon, a Russian who was educated\nin the United States, said when it still looked as if an American might win\nthe right to challenge Carlsen. “It would be great for us to get more eyeballs\nin America.”Andrey Filatov, the president of the Russian Chess Federation,\nsaid he was rooting for a Russian to win the world championship but also said\nhe hoped that the United States would embrace the game as a commercial, as\nwell as intellectual, enterprise.To that end, Filatov said, he would like to\nsee the victor in the American presidential election attend the opening of the\nworld championship in New York and help give the sport some cachet.Even\nwithout an American at the table in New York, Merenzon thinks that the number\nof chess players around the world — estimated at more than 600 million — makes\nchess an easy way to reach a vast, committed and often high-earning\npopulation.Chess, Merenzon acknowledged, is often difficult to understand,\nparticularly at the championship level, with games that include inscrutable\nmoves and strategies that can leave even excellent players scratching their\nheads. But unlike other sports, Merenzon said, chess offers sponsors a chance\nto be associated with intelligence, discipline and cunning.“It effectively\nmeans being smart, and this is something everyone wants to be,” he said.To\nhelp non-grandmasters better understand what was actually going on during each\nmatch in Moscow, WorldChess.com posted all the moves as soon as they happened,\nalong with a computer-generated meter that indicated which player had the\nadvantage after each move. Live online commentary by chess masters and\npostmatch interviews with the players also helped make the game more\naccessible.Seeking to add more pizazz to chess, Agon even used the Moscow\nevent to try to rebrand Caruana and his rivals as hip, inviting photographers\nto take pictures of them as they strolled together across Red Square, as if\nthey were members of a cool albeit unusually intelligent boy band.Before the\ngala, the players had their hair done, were fitted for designer clothing and\nselected expensive watches in preparation for a photo shoot by the Russian\nedition of the magazine GQ, part of an effort by a Moscow luxury goods\nmerchandiser that sponsors chess to add some sparkle to the understated\nsport.The competitors all played along gamely, but some chess aficionados\nfound the exercise a bit unsettling.“This is completely abnormal,” Rustam\nKasimdzhanov, a grandmaster from Uzbekistan, said as he waited for Caruana and\nother players to emerge from a high-end clothing boutique in central Moscow.\n“But it is a good thing. Chess needs a little bit of glamour.”\n\n","title":"Masters of Chess, Not Self-Promotion - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Masters of chess? Yes. Masters of self-promotion?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01480"},"content":"The family of an unarmed teenager who was fatally shot by a police officer\nlast year in Seneca, S.C., has agreed to a $2.15 million settlement to drop\ntheir lawsuit against the police, a lawyer for the family said Wednesday.The\nteenager, Zachary Hammond, pulled up to a drive-through window at a Hardee’s\nrestaurant last July in Seneca, where officers were conducting a sting\noperation for a suspected drug deal.A patrol car then moved in to block the\ncar, and an officer who was part of the operation, Lt. Mark Tiller, “felt\nthreatened” as Mr. Hammond drove toward him, according to the coroner’s report\non the shooting. The officer fired two shots through the open window on the\ndriver’s side, striking Mr. Hammond, 19, once in the shoulder and once fatally\nin the chest.The Seneca police chief, John Covington, said after the shooting\nthat the officer fired in self-defense and was a victim of an “attempted\nmurder.” A woman in Mr. Hammond’s car was later found to have a small quantity\nof marijuana.The state said in October it would not file criminal charges\nagainst the officer.But Mr. Hammond’s family filed a lawsuit for wrongful\ndeath against Lieutenant Tiller, the Seneca Police Department and Chief\nCovington. Eric S. Bland, a lawyer for the Hammond family, said Wednesday that\nthe settlement, approved Tuesday, would be drawn from state, city and\nmunicipal insurance funds.“An early resolution will allow a platform for\nhealing for the Hammond family and the City of Seneca that is outside the\nspotlight of litigation,” Mr. Bland said.John M. Mussetto, a lawyer for\nLieutenant Tiller, said the officer was “pleased” that a settlement had been\nreached.“The past few months have been very trying for the City of Seneca,\nLieutenant Mark Tiller and the Hammond family,” Mr. Mussetto said in a\nstatement. “The settlement will hopefully allow everyone to begin the healing\nprocess and close a chapter that has been difficult for all parties\ninvolved.”While the family’s lawsuit will be dropped, Mr. Bland said that a\nfederal grand jury was still reviewing the case for possible civil rights\nviolations.The shooting of Mr. Hammond, who was white, took place at a time of\nintense national debate over race and police behavior, spurred by the choking\ndeath of Eric Garner in New York in July 2014 and the fatal shooting of\nMichael Brown the next month in Ferguson, Mo.At first, Mr. Hammond’s death\ndrew not nearly as much attention. But nearly four months later, a video from\nthe officer’s dashboard camera was released, showing Lieutenant Tiller\napproach Mr. Hammond’s car with his gun drawn, and then fire through the\nwindow as the teenager tried to drive away.Mr. Bland, who had called on the\nnews media to treat Mr. Hammond’s shooting as they had those of unarmed black\nmen, said Wednesday that the settlement “sends a strong signal about what the\ndefendants and the public thought about the shooting.”“It speaks volumes as to\nwhat everybody thought when they saw that video,” he said.\n\n","title":"Family of South Carolina Teenager Shot by Officer Reaches $2.15 Million Settlement - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Family of South Carolina teenager shot by police officer reaches $2.15 million settlement https://t.co/nbcgT26WVS","date":"Wed Mar 30 23:12:08 +0000 2016","favs":138,"id":{"$numberLong":"715315704489189380"},"retweets":117},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SyOeHw"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01482"},"content":"ABOARD THE U.S.S. CHANCELLORSVILLE, in the South China Sea — The Navy cruiser\nwas in disputed waters off the Spratly Islands when the threat warning sounded\nover the ship’s intercom: “Away the Snoopie team. ... Away the Snoopie\nteam.”As the sailors of the “Snoopie team” went on alert and took up positions\nthroughout the ship, a Chinese naval frigate appeared on the horizon, bearing\ndown on the cruiser Chancellorsville last week from the direction of Mischief\nReef. More alarming, a Chinese helicopter that had taken off from the frigate\nwas heading straight for the American cruiser.“This is U.S. Navy warship on\nguard,” Ensign Anthony Giancana said into his radio from the ship’s bridge,\ntrying to contact the helicopter. “Come up on Frequency 121.5 or\n243.”Ominously, there was no response.Here in the hot azure waters off the\nSpratly and Paracel Islands — which encompass reefs, banks and cays — the\nUnited States and China are jockeying for dominance in the Pacific. From\nMischief Reef, where China is building a military base in defiance of claims\nby Vietnam and the Philippines, to Scarborough Shoal, where the Chinese are\nbuilding and equipping outposts on disputed territory far from the mainland,\nthe two naval forces are on an almost continuous state of alert.Although the\nSouth China Sea stretches some 500 miles from mainland China, Beijing has\nclaimed most of it. Tensions have risen sharply, and the topic is expected to\ndominate President Obama’s meeting in Washington this week with the Chinese\npresident, Xi Jinping.America’s goal is to keep the South China Sea, one of\nthe world’s busiest shipping lanes, open to all maritime traffic. But\nadministration officials are increasingly worried that tensions will only\nworsen if an arbitration panel in The Hague rules as expected in the coming\nmonths on a 2013 case brought by the Philippines, which has accused China of\nmaking an “excessive claim” to most of the sea.At the Pentagon two weeks ago,\nthe day before a meeting of Mr. Obama’s national security team to discuss\nChinese expansion in the Pacific, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of\nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, was talking with Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., the\ncommander of the United States Pacific Command, in the reception area of\nDefense Secretary Ashton B. Carter’s office.“Would you go to war over\nScarborough Shoals?” General Dunford asked Admiral Harris, in a conversation\noverheard by a reporter. If Admiral Harris responded, it could not be\nheard.The White House and the Pentagon have made it clear that they do not\nwant a war with China over a group of uninhabited islands.But neither does the\nWhite House want to cede the South China Sea to China, which is what\nadministration officials fear will happen if Beijing continues on its current\ncourse. James R. Clapper, Mr. Obama’s director of national intelligence, told\nthe Senate Armed Services Committee last month that by early next year China\nwould “have significant capacity to quickly project substantial military power\nto the region.”That could mean that other countries might eventually need\nBeijing’s permission to traverse the heavily trafficked sea.And so for the\nmoment, the Obama administration is sending Navy patrols through the Spratlys\nand other disputed island chains in the region, to drive home the message that\nthe sea is free to all. Some 700 American patrols have gone through in the\npast year, Navy officials say. Three weeks ago the aircraft carrier John C.\nStennis and four other American warships sailed into the South China Sea for\nroutine exercises, meant to convey the message, Pentagon officials said, that\nthe United States is the dominant military power in the region.Aboard the\nChancellorsville last week, the minutes — and the tension — stretched out as\nthe Chinese helicopter pilot refused to answer. The helicopter kept circling\nand eventually flew back to the Chinese frigate, which then continued toward\nthe American warship. At the helm, Capt. Curt A. Renshaw, who had skipped his\nmorning shower to race up to the bridge when the Chinese helicopter\napproached, huddled with his officers.The day before, Captain Renshaw had\nwarned the entire ship over the intercom that the Chancellorsville would be\ntransiting through the Spratlys, and told the crew members to be on their toes\nand alert to trouble. He had been expecting the Chinese to show up — Beijing,\nin recent months, has taken to shadowing American warships that have dared to\nenter the South China Sea.On a stand near the captain’s chair, a copy of\n“Jane’s Fighting Ships” was open to Page 144: “China Frigates.”“You’ve ever\nbeen shadowed before?” Captain Renshaw asked Ensign Kristine Mun, a\nnavigations officer. He turned to Ensign Niles Li, one of several officers who\nspeak Chinese, and wondered aloud at the Chinese helicopter’s refusal to\nanswer the radio message.Finally, when the Chinese frigate was six miles away\nand clearly visible to the naked eye on the horizon, the ship-to-ship radio\ncrackled with the sounds of accented English. “U.S. Navy Warship 62. ... This\nis Chinese Warship 575.”And so began an elaborate diplomatic dance.“This is\nU.S. Warship 62. Good morning, sir. It is a pleasant day at sea, over.”No\nresponse.“This is U.S. Warship 62. Good morning, sir. It is a pleasant day to\nbe at sea, over.”Still no response.Captain Renshaw turned to Ensign Li.\n“You’re up,” he said. “They can’t pretend they don’t speak Chinese.”“Chinese\nWarship 575, this is U.S. Warship 62,” Ensign Li said in Chinese. “Today is a\nsunny day for a sea voyage, over.”More minutes ticked by. Ensign Anthony\nGiancana, the junior officer on deck for the morning, was getting antsy. “This\nis like Opening Day,” he said to no one in particular. “We’ve done spring\ntraining.”Suddenly, the radio crackled again as the frigate responded in\nChinese: “U.S. Warship 62, this is Chinese Warship 575. Today’s weather is\ngreat. It is a pleasure to meet you at sea.”Ensign Li responded, also in\nChinese: “This is U.S. Warship 62. The weather is indeed great. It is a\npleasure to meet you, too, over.”Preliminaries dispensed with, the Chinese\nship got down to business, switching to English. “How long have you been since\ndeparting from your home port? Over.”Captain Renshaw was immediately shaking\nhis head. “No, we’re not answering that. I would never ask him that.”Ensign\nGiancana picked up the radio again. “Chinese Warship 575, this is U.S. Navy\nWarship 62. We do not talk about our schedules. But we are enjoying our time\nat sea, over.”And on it went as the two warships, each loaded with missiles,\ntorpedoes and heavy artillery, confronted each other with an exchange of\nweather pleasantries at sea. Testing whether the Chinese were openly\nfollowing, the Chancellorsville made a turn, and its officers stood back and\nwaited.A shout came from another one of Captain Renshaw’s junior officers: “He\njust turned, sir!” The Chancellorsville now had a tail. But for how\nlong?Apparently the Chinese ship wanted an answer to that question as\nwell.“U.S. Navy Warship 62, this is Chinese Navy Warship 575,” came a new\nmessage. “Do you continue to have long-term voyage at sea? Over.”Another no-\nno. Telling the Chinese the intended duration of the trip could be an inherent\nacknowledgment that they had the right to know, Captain Renshaw said. And that\nis not considered freedom of navigation.“This is U.S. Navy Warship 62,”\nCaptain Renshaw responded. “Roger, all of our voyages are short because we\nenjoy our time at sea no matter how long we are away from home. Over.”As it\nhappened, the Chinese ship had a ready answer for that.“U.S. Navy Warship 62,\nthis is Chinese Navy Warship 575,” came the reply. “Copy that I will be\nstaying along with you for the following days. Over.”That was Tuesday. On\nWednesday, the Chinese frigate was replaced by a destroyer, which followed the\nNavy warship until midnight Thursday, when the American vessel exited the\nSouth China Sea.\n\n","title":"Patrolling Disputed Waters, U.S. and China Jockey for Dominance - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Traveling with U.S. Navy patrols in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01483"},"content":"The Food and Drug Administration has relaxed the guidelines for taking a pill\nthat induces abortion, reviving one of the most contentious issues of the\nabortion debate. The change allows women to use the drug further into\npregnancy and with fewer visits to the doctor.The announcement on Wednesday\ncame unexpectedly in the final stretch of the Obama administration and amid an\nelection campaign in which both parties covet the women’s vote. Some abortion\nopponents charged that the new regimen was politically motivated. The F.D.A.\nsaid its actions were based strictly on medical science.The change was an\nunequivocal victory for abortion rights advocates who had been fighting laws\nin Texas, North Dakota and Ohio, among other states, that require doctors\nprescribing the pill to follow the directions on the F.D.A. label for using\nit, which had been more stringent.The change brings the directions for taking\nthe drug, mifepristone, in line with what has become standard medical practice\nin most states: reducing the dosage to 200 milligrams from 600 milligrams,\ndecreasing the number of visits a woman must make to a doctor to two from\nthree, and extending the period when she can take the pill to 10 weeks of\npregnancy from seven weeks.The debate over the drug, formerly known as RU-486,\nhas raged for decades, with abortion rights groups demanding access to it in\nthe United States in the 1990s. Medication-induced abortions have increasingly\nbeen used to terminate pregnancies in recent years, and limiting access to\nthem has become an important front in the anti-abortion movement. They made up\nas much as a quarter of all abortions in 2011, according to the most recent\nfigures from the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks women’s reproductive\nhealth issues. Planned Parenthood said as many as half of eligible women in\nits clinics requested medication-induced abortions.The original label on the\ndrug was based on clinical evidence from the 1990s before the pill was\napproved in 2000. Doctors said that new evidence had emerged supporting lower\ndoses, which have fewer side effects, and a longer period in which women could\ntake the medication safely. In most states, doctors have been following the\nmedically accepted regimen, even though the label advised otherwise, a fairly\ncommon medical practice known as off-label use.“This is a major shift both in\nclosing the gap between science and legal regulation and in enabling women to\nexercise their constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy,” said Suzanne B.\nGoldberg, a law professor at Columbia University who specializes in sexuality\nand gender law.The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said\nin a statement that it was “pleased that the updated F.D.A.-approved regimen\nfor mifepristone reflects the current available scientific evidence and best\npractices.”Anti-abortion groups said that the change did nothing to improve\nsafety for women, and that some women fell ill or died after taking the drug.\n(A spokeswoman for the company that makes the drug, Danco Laboratories, said\nthere was no proof it caused the deaths.)“It appears this has been done for\nthe convenience and the profitability of the abortion industry,” said Randall\nO’Bannon, the director of education and research for the National Right to\nLife Committee.Eric Scheidler, the executive director of the Pro-Life Action\nLeague, an anti-abortion group based in Chicago, said, “My first thought was\nthat this is a bone that the Obama administration was throwing out there to\ntheir friends in the abortion lobby.”** **The drug works by blocking receptors\nof progesterone, an important hormone in pregnancy. Women have to get the drug\nfrom a medical provider. They can also get another drug, misoprostol, in the\nsame first visit to the provider, according to the new label. Together, the\ndrugs induce miscarriage. The label still requires a “follow-up with the\nhealth care provider,” but some abortion rights advocates said that could be\ninterpreted as a lab test or something that did not require a visit to a\ndoctor.Many states have passed laws to restrict the use of mifepristone since\nits F.D.A. approval. Some of them require medical professionals who administer\nthe drug to be licensed physicians, rather than nurses or physician\nassistants. Many states also require the prescribing doctor to be present with\nthe patient, a rule that abortion rights advocates say blocks women in rural\nareas from receiving the medication remotely.Laws requiring physicians to\nadhere to the guidelines on the label have also passed in Arkansas, Oklahoma,\nand Arizona, but have been blocked by court order.It was not immediately clear\nwhat the change would mean for state laws and the future of the legal effort\nby anti-abortion groups. Kristi Hamrick, a spokeswoman for Americans United\nfor Life, an organization that drafts model legislation seeking to regulate\nthe drugs, said, “This is just Day 1, and so our lawyers are looking at it.”\nThe F.D.A. said it had followed regulatory procedure in changing the label.\nDanco submitted an application last May, and the application was subject to a\n10-month review period, which ended March 29, the agency said.“Honestly, I\nthink the timing was based on when the company put in the application for a\nlabel change, not based on election timing,” said Susan Wood, the director of\nthe Jacobs Institute of Women’s Health at the Milken Institute School of\nPublic Health at George Washington University. “The F.D.A. just responded as\npart of their regulatory responsibilities, not on a political time frame.”In\nTexas, abortion providers applauded the change.“This will allow us to do two\nthings immediately: Expand medical abortions up to 10 weeks of pregnancy, and\ncut out the unnecessary additional visit for the second dose of medication,”\nsaid Amy Hagstrom Miller, the president of Whole Woman’s Health, which has\nabortion facilities in five states including Texas and is the lead plaintiff\nin an abortion case before the Supreme Court.More than 40 percent of patients\nat the group’s Texas clinics chose medication abortions before Texas passed a\nlaw in 2013, requiring, among other things, that doctors follow the F.D.A.’s\nprotocol. Since then, only about 5 percent have, she said.Dr. Raegan McDonald-\nMosley, the chief medical officer of Planned Parenthood Federation of America,\nsaid the change would reduce confusion among patients who had to sign two sets\nof consent forms, one with the regimen recommended by much of medical science\nand one that detailed the requirements on the F.D.A. label.“Now those two\nthings are in sync,” she said.\n\n","title":"New F.D.A.

His relatives said they were\nnot told of his detention until March 24, though Chinese law requires that a\ndetainee’s family be notified within 24 hours. A document stating the charge\nagainst Mr. Tashi, which a police officer gave the family, and a photograph of\nwhich was seen by The New York Times, was dated March 4.Before his detention,\nMr. Tashi had written on his microblog that Tibetans needed to protect their\nculture and that Chinese officials should aid them in doing so. He has argued\nfor greater Tibetan autonomy within China, but none of his known writings have\ncalled for Tibetan independence, which he has said he opposes.The family said\nit had not been able to find a local lawyer to represent Mr. Tashi. Officials\nhave not yet announced a trial date.Mr. Tashi’s case has attracted\ninternational attention. Officials at the State Department are aware of his\ndetention, and a representative of Canadian Journalists for Free Expression\nsaid the group was starting a petition to call for his release. President\nObama may raise human rights issues with his Chinese counterpart, President Xi\nJinping, when Mr. Xi visits Washington this week for a summit meeting on\nnuclear issues.As an advocate for Tibetan culture, Mr. Tashi has been most\nvocal about language education, saying that schools should adopt a true system\nof bilingual education so that Tibetan children can become fluent in their\nmother language.Mr. Tashi has said that the dearth of effective Tibetan\nlanguage education, and the fact that the language is not used in government\noffices, violates the Chinese Constitution, which guarantees cultural autonomy\nfor Tibetan and other ethnic regions.Mr. Tashi runs a shop in Yushu and sells\ngoods from the region to buyers across China on Taobao, an online platform run\nby Alibaba, the e-commerce giant. In 2014, Alibaba chose Mr. Tashi to be\nfeatured in a video for the company’s investor roadshow before a high-profile\ninitial public offering.Late last year, Mr. Tashi was quoted in two articles\nin The New York Times on Tibetan language and culture. He was also the main\nsubject of a documentary video by The Times about his attempts to use the\nlegal system to compel officials to improve Tibetan language education.\n\n","title":"China Charges Tibetan Education Advocate With Inciting Separatism - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesworld: A Tibetan champion of bilingual education in China could face years in prison. https://t.co/dyHbjLxw7j https://t.co/TuvAy…","date":"Wed Mar 30 21:10:40 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715285136233857025"},"retweets":113},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VTDUNb"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01485"},"content":"When severe weather passed through the Atlanta area early this month, Brad\nNitz, a meteorologist for a local television station, WSB-TV, fed viewers live\nvideo updates on the station’s website, as he has done for years.But then he\ndid something new: He turned away from the television camera and addressed an\niPhone that was streaming him live — on Facebook. And the station’s social\nmedia manager, Jonathan Anker, watched this new Facebook audience swell.At its\npeak, the stream reached 8,800 viewers at once, and the segment has been\nplayed more than 77,000 times in total, far more than the station’s typical\nonline audience.The numbers, Mr. Anker said, were “seriously out of whack, in\na delightful way.”Experiences like this have media companies swooning over the\npossibilities of posting live video to Facebook, a feature made widely\navailable two months ago. For years, companies have searched for ways to\nunlock three tough questions: How do you attract people to live online videos?\nHow do you reach people on their mobile devices? And how do you get more out\nof Facebook’s 1.6 billion users?Now, they hope, they have found a key for all\nthree. Yet it is also raising some questions inside the companies about if —\nand when — they will see any meaningful money come from the push.Already,\nFacebook users can tune in to a daily celebrity news show produced by E!, with\nanchors sitting behind a broadcast-style desk. TMZ streams daily gossip\nupdates and goes live for breaking news. Local news anchors are broadcasting\nlive from the field and during commercial breaks, or while they apply makeup.\nDr. Sanjay Gupta of CNN fielded questions about the Zika virus.“This feels\nlike a transformative step,” said Liz Heron, the executive editor of The\nHuffington Post, which recently restructured its video production to favor\nsocial media distribution after streaming live video through its website since\n2012. “It’s really the mobile piece that feels different to me.”The\nfascination also dovetails with interest inside Facebook itself. The feature,\ncalled Facebook Live, has largely lived under the radar so far. But it is one\nof the company’s highest-priority projects, according to three people directly\ninvolved with the initiative, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Internally,\nFacebook Live is seen as a way to move beyond hosting conversations about\ntelevision and live events to becoming a venue for both. Mark Zuckerberg, the\ncompany’s chief executive, has made Facebook Live one of his pet projects, two\nof the people said, devoting significant resources and effort to the\ninitiative. Facebook plans to announce a suite of new features and partners in\nearly April and at F8, Facebook’s developer conference in San Francisco later\nin the month.Facebook declined to discuss details about the announcements.The\nshows vary widely. Tastemade, a young food media company, streamed a live\nedition of its “Tiny Kitchen” show, in which it prepared a stamp-size\nhamburger; Martha Stewart spent an hourlong broadcast making pretzels with\nSeth Meyers. In addition, Facebook has urged celebrities and athletes to use\nFacebook Live to interact with fans.The Huffington Post has tested live video\nacross many of its 79 Facebook pages, with broadcasts from the campaign trail,\ncelebrity interviews and live music events.“Nobody came up to me and said,\n‘you should really be using Live,’” said Ms. Heron, who previously worked at\nFacebook. “I knew it was something I wanted The Huffington Post to do.”But\nthere is also some trepidation inside media companies about getting tied so\nclosely to yet another Facebook product. Some of those concerns echo those\nraised last year, when media companies debated whether to participate in\nFacebook’s push to have news articles posted directly on the social\nnetwork.Most of the questions, though, have focused on figuring out how much\nmoney the companies will get for video streams viewed on the social network.\nLive streaming revenue could come from advertising, subscriptions or paid one-\ntime events.Facebook, though, has prioritized getting live video in front of\nas many users as possible. The company has been eager to talk with media\ncompanies about getting started with streaming, but remains vague in\nconversations about revenue sharing or subscription models.It is pushing a\nbuild-first, make-money-later philosophy, one that can be frustrating to media\npartners, particularly those struggling to navigate broader changes in the\nonline media industry. But whatever the frustrations, they are outweighed by\nthe prospect of reaching Facebook’s huge audience.“It’s early days, and as\nwith all products at Facebook we build people-first, but we are committed to\nfinding a sustainable monetization model for partners sharing live video on\nFacebook,” said Fidji Simo, a director of product at Facebook. “It’s something\nthat we’re thinking carefully about, and it’s important to us to create\nsomething that is a good experience for people on Facebook and that works for\nour partners.”Media companies that spent much of last year producing original\nvideo for their Facebook pages have yet to see significant revenue, despite\nassurances from the company. But live online video has largely vexed media\ncompanies for two decades, and any possible path to success is hard to resist,\nespecially one that requires few investments upfront.“The whole thing has been\nreally encouraging,” said Allison Rockey, the director of programming for\nVox.com. She added, “You need an iPhone and a mike, and you just kind of get\nstarted.”One of the appeals for media companies has been a sense of regaining\ncontrol of Facebook’s news feed, the primary source of information on the\nsocial network, where posts are sorted based on an opaque computer program.\nThe lack of control has made reaching users — even those that follow media\nbrands intentionally — more competitive.With Live, though, live broadcasts\ndisplay higher in users’ feeds — a prioritization Facebook has acknowledged\npublicly. The service also notifies users through mobile apps when friends and\npages they follow begin broadcasting.So far, putting video on the service can\nbe done only by using a Facebook app on a mobile device. But Facebook is\nconsidering letting media partners broadcast live video using their own\nprofessional-grade studio recording equipment, according to two of the people\nwith knowledge of the company’s plans. The new efforts could introduce a more\npolished, professional set of live programming to Facebook’s\naudiences.Facebook’s ability to convene large audiences will help Live compete\nwith Twitter’s Periscope, an app that helped popularize mobile live streaming\nlast year. Periscope has been growing briskly, the company says.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01486"},"content":"WASHINGTON — Ismael Rosa, a salsa singer serving a lifetime prison sentence\nfor drug crimes, had often promised his lawyers that he would sing for them if\nhe ever won his freedom.On Wednesday, Mr. Rosa was brought to the warden’s\noffice at the Federal Correctional Institution in Pekin, Ill., and was told\nthat President Obama had granted him clemency. On the phone with his lawyer,\nthe lyrics from a gospel hymn finally slipped past his lips as tears streamed\ndown his face.“I’m free and I’m unbound and there are no shackles on me now,”\nhe sang softly, according to MiAngel Cody, one of his lawyers, who called the\nmoment “beautiful.” Mr. Rosa, 56, who has served 21 years and plans to live\nwith his brother, a sheriff’s deputy in Chicago, when he is released early\nnext year, passed on a message to Mr. Obama.“ ‘Please tell Mr. President that\nI will always represent him and I will not let him down,’ ” Ms. Cody said.Mr.\nRosa’s conviction in 1995 on conspiracy to distribute multiple kilograms of\ncocaine sent him to prison for life. On Wednesday, he was among 61 federal\nprisoners, incarcerated for drug offenses, whose sentences Mr. Obama commuted,\nextending his administration’s efforts to reshape a criminal justice\nsentencing system the president has often described as unduly harsh, unfair to\nminorities and badly outdated.Like Mr. Rosa, more than a third of the\nprisoners who will soon be released were serving life in prison as a result of\nfederal sentencing laws that imposed severe punishments for the distribution\nof cocaine and other drugs. Mr. Obama has now commuted the sentences of 248\nprisoners, more than the total commuted by the last six presidents combined,\nadministration officials said.“Most of them are low-level drug offenders whose\nsentences would have been shorter if they were convicted under today’s laws,”\nMr. Obama said Wednesday on his Facebook page. “I believe America is a nation\nof second chances, and with hard work, responsibility, and better choices,\npeople can change their lives and contribute to our society.”Ms. Cody\ncommended Mr. Obama for his efforts on behalf of people like Mr. Rosa. She\nsaid that someone newly convicted of crimes like his would no longer receive\nlife in prison, but added that broader changes to sentencing laws were still\nneeded.“We are seeing, hopefully, some withdrawal from our own justice\nsystem’s addiction to incarceration,” Ms. Cody said. “Some of this will happen\nwith clemency, but some of it needs to happen with true legislative sentencing\nreform.”For years, Mr. Obama has been pressing for just that, hoping to\nreverse steep penalties put in place in recent decades that sent many African-\nAmerican and Hispanic men to prison for mostly nonviolent offenses. The\npresident has said he is hopeful that he can reach rare agreement with\nRepublicans on broad changes to sentencing laws.Mr. Obama has said he is\nencouraged by expressions of support for a criminal justice overhaul by\nconservative lawmakers and groups. Several Republicans who ran for president\nthis election cycle have said sentencing laws need to be revamped. Liberal\ngroups like the Center for American Progress have teamed up with Koch\nIndustries, the conglomerate owned by the conservative brothers Charles G. and\nDavid H. Koch, to try to shrink prison populations.In brief comments on\nWednesday, Mr. Obama singled out House Speaker Paul D. Ryan for his support on\nthe issue and said he was “still hopeful that criminal justice reform can get\ndone.”But even as Mr. Obama seeks to work with Congress, he has tried to use\nthe power of his office to address the thousands of mostly young men who were\nimprisoned under the stricter laws established during the “war on drugs” of\nthe 1990s.White House officials said the new grants of clemency underscored\nMr. Obama’s commitment to redress. In a blog post, Neil Eggleston, the\npresident’s chief lawyer, said Mr. Obama would remain “committed to continuing\nto issue more grants of clemency as well as to strengthening rehabilitation\nprograms” throughout the rest of his presidency.Marjorie J. Peerce, a partner\nin New York with the law firm Ballard Spahr, praised Mr. Obama for commuting\nthe sentences of people like Kevin County, a low-level drug offender convicted\nof distributing small amounts of heroin and crack cocaine. Because Mr. County\nhad a prior felony, the federal judge was required to impose a 20-year\nsentence, more than four times what would probably be given today.After\nserving 14 years, Mr. County is set to leave the Federal Correctional\nInstitution in Yazoo City, Miss., on July 28, 2016.“The war on drugs from the\n1990s resulted in inordinately harsh and long prison sentences for offenders\nwho did not deserve to serve that length of time,” Ms. Peerce said.Some\nadvocates for those in prison say Mr. Obama’s efforts, while laudable, fall\nfar short of what is needed. They note that his public commitment to using his\nclemency power more frequently has encouraged more than 30,000 federal inmates\nto come forward seeking shorter prison sentences. Many of those will not\nqualify because they committed violent crimes or have not been in prison long\nenough. But Ms. Peerce said there were “hundreds, if not thousands more that\nmeet the criteria.”At his current pace, Mr. Obama will free a small fraction\nof those prisoners by the time his term ends next year. Officials said that\nwas in part because of a lengthy review process that the administration had\nset up to consider clemency applications.“We are deeply gratified that the\npresident has used the power of the Oval Office to give relief to people\nserving unjust sentences for low-level, nonviolent crimes,” said Julie\nStewart, the president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a group\nadvocating changes in sentencing. “Unfortunately, clemency can’t change\npolicy. Congress should be eliminating mandatory minimum sentences so that\nthousands more don’t serve excessive sentences that don’t make Americans\nsafer.”White House officials said Wednesday that the president also wanted to\nhelp those released from prison become more effective members of society. On\nThursday, the White House will host a discussion with advocates and\nadministration officials about how to help those receiving clemency return to\nproductive lives.After the announcement of the new commutations, Mr. Obama met\nwith several federal prisoners whose sentences had previously been commuted to\ndiscuss how effectively they had re-entered society. In a video posted on\nFacebook with his statement, Mr. Obama invited the group to lunch to discuss\nthe issue.Mr. Obama’s motorcade arrived just after noon at Busboys and Poets,\na restaurant and bookstore where the president and the former prisoners talked\nover lunch. Afterward, Mr. Obama noted that several of the former prisoners\nhad become successful members of their communities.“You’ve got folks around\nthis table who are now attorneys,” Mr. Obama said. “They’re raising children,\ngetting married.”\n\n","title":"Obama Commutes Sentences for 61 Convicted of Drug Crimes - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"President Obama commuted the sentences of 61 federal prisoners convicted of drug and firearm crimes https://t.co/tw80WmCOd4","date":"Wed Mar 30 17:52:05 +0000 2016","favs":234,"id":{"$numberLong":"715235161613475841"},"retweets":184},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SxDh92"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01487"},"content":"JERUSALEM — The case of the Israeli soldier who shot a Palestinian assailant\nin the head as he lay wounded and subdued on the ground is whipping up a\npublic and political storm and posing a rare challenge to the military’s high\ncommand, usually the most popular body in the country.In a letter sent to\ncommanders and soldiers on Wednesday, Lt. Gen. Gadi Eisenkot, the chief of\nstaff, underlined the predicament facing the army as it contends with a surge\nin Palestinian violence — and faces a hardened public mood fanned by some\npoliticians who say Palestinian assailants must not be left alive.“The\ncommanders, and I first among them, will continue to give backing to any\nsoldier who errs in the heat of battle against an enemy endangering the lives\nof civilians and soldiers,” General Eisenkot wrote. “That said, we will not\nhesitate to fully implement the law against soldiers and commanders if they\ndeviate from the operational and moral standards according to which we\nwork.”Posters appeared in Tel Aviv soon after the shooting depicting General\nEisenkot, who had swiftly condemned it, as the gullible Persian king who\ninitially went along with a plot to kill all the Jews in the story of Purim,\nthe holiday celebrated last week. Urging the general to resign, along with the\nprime minister and the defense minister, the posters bore the legend: “Jewish\nblood is not to be abandoned. He who rises up to slay you, slay him\nfirst.”After six months of Palestinian stabbing, shooting and vehicular\nattacks against Israelis, a simmering debate has burst into a heated argument\nover what constitutes appropriate use of force and what is excessive. While\nmany Israelis have denounced the shooting last week, which was caught on\nvideo, as a grave breach of proper military conduct, many others call the\naccused soldier a hero. By Wednesday nearly 57,000 Israelis had signed an\nonline petition demanding he be given a merit citation.The education minister,\nNaftali Bennett, has accused the leadership of being “quick to pounce on the\nsoldier.” He and other right-wing politicians, activists and the soldier’s\nfamily are now waging a campaign against the defense minister, Moshe Yaalon,\nand the army’s top officers.Israelis have voiced outrage on social media over\nwhat many see as too hasty a judgment by the political and military leadership\nand by an initial pronouncement by the military prosecutor that the soldier\nwas under investigation on suspicion of murder. Supporters claim he has been\nabandoned by the system that should be backing him. Experts said the emotional\nresponse partly reflected a natural empathy for soldiers in a country where\nmost 18-year-olds are conscripted for up to 32 months.“This is a test,” said\nUdi Dekel, an expert in civil-military relations at the Institute for National\nSecurity Studies at Tel Aviv University.“On the one hand,” he said, “the army\nhas to be attentive to the feelings of the people.” On the other, he said,\n“you cannot run an army based on social networks and relatives.” And the\nmilitary cannot change the rules of engagement because of a political and\npublic onslaught, said Mr. Dekel, a former brigadier general.The episode began\nlast Thursday, when two Palestinian men stabbed and wounded an Israeli soldier\nat a checkpoint in the West Bank city of Hebron. His fellow soldiers shot them\nboth, killing one and wounding the other, who was identified as Abed al-Fatah\nal-Sharif, 21.The accused soldier arrived at the scene about six minutes\nlater, by which time calm appeared to have been restored. The video shows him\ncocking his rifle and shooting Mr. Sharif, this time in the head, as he lay on\nthe road.Lawyers representing the soldier say he acted to save his comrades in\nthe belief that Mr. Sharif, who was still moving, might have been concealing\nan explosive belt under his jacket.The soldier did not warn other soldiers or\nthe medical staff to move away from Mr. Sharif, and had Mr. Sharif been\nwearing explosives, critics noted, the soldier’s shot could have detonated\nthem.An Israeli military court order has banned the use of the soldier’s name\nin all press accounts, including those of foreign news organizations\naccredited in Israel, even though the soldier has a Facebook page and has been\nwidely identified by name in social media.The soldier’s Facebook page suggests\nsympathies with some far-right causes. He told another soldier at the scene\nthat Mr. Sharif had stabbed his friend and “deserved to die,” according to\nIsraeli news reports.At a hearing on Tuesday, a military judge said the\nevidence so far was not clear-cut. Prosecutors would not specify what charges\nthey were considering, appearing to have backed off from the idea of a murder\ncharge.About 30 Israelis, two Americans and a Palestinian bystander have been\nkilled by Palestinians since Oct. 1. Israeli forces or civilians have shot\ndead 180 Palestinians during the same period, most while they were carrying\nout or attempting attacks, according to the Israeli authorities; the rest were\nkilled in clashes with Israeli security forces.Palestinian officials and human\nrights groups have accused Israeli forces of shooting to kill in some other\ninstances captured on video where the threat appeared to have passed. Among\nthem was a case in November in which a teenage Palestinian girl who had tried\nto stab passers-by with scissors was shot by a police officer as she lay on\nthe ground.The military has been clear about its regulations on when soldiers\ncan fire. It says that assailants must be quickly incapacitated, but that once\nneutralized they should not be killed. General Eisenkot told high school\nstudents recently that he would not want a soldier “to empty a magazine at a\n13-year-old girl with scissors.”A February survey conducted by the Israel\nDemocracy Institute, an independent research group, found that 50 percent of\nthe Jewish public disagreed with General Eisenkot’s position while 48 percent\nsupported it.Prof. Tamar Hermann, a political scientist who directs surveys\nfor the institute, said that although the Israeli public had attacked the\nmilitary many times in the past, “I don’t remember ever before a chief of\nstaff being criticized for being too soft.”Now there is growing concern about\nthe mixed messages that may be influencing the soldiers. Speaking in the\nIsraeli Parliament this week Mr. Yaalon, the defense minister, asked: “What do\nyou want here? A brutish army that has lost its moral backbone?”“Later,” he\nsaid, “we will be checking if there is a connection between the aggression on\nthe Internet, all sorts of statements made by politicians, and the fact that a\nsoldier decided to act in a way that breaches the law, our values and the\nopen-fire regulations.”\n\n","title":"Israel Polarized Over Soldier Who Killed Wounded Palestinian - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Israel polarized over soldier who killed a wounded Palestinian https://t.co/X68SeV14cU","date":"Wed Mar 30 17:38:56 +0000 2016","favs":84,"id":{"$numberLong":"715231851808485376"},"retweets":79},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1qjlolr"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01489"},"content":"MINNEAPOLIS — For more than 30 minutes on Wednesday, the prosecutor described\nin exacting detail the fatal shooting in November of an unarmed black man by\nthe police and his reasons for not charging the two officers involved.The\nprosecutor, Mike Freeman, said the unarmed man, Jamar Clark, 24, had assaulted\nhis girlfriend, interfered with paramedics and resisted when the officers\ntried to arrest him. He said Mr. Clark had grabbed one officer’s holstered\ngun, prompting the other officer to shoot. The evidence, he said, did not\nsupport claims by some witnesses that Mr. Clark was handcuffed when shot.As\nsoon as Mr. Freeman finished his presentation, activists who had gathered\nbegan to pepper him with a series of pointed questions. They told Mr. Freeman,\nthe Hennepin County attorney, that he had relied too much on the officers’\naccounts and not enough on neighbors who witnessed the shooting. They\ncriticized aspects of the investigation, and interrupted when Mr. Freeman\ntried to respond.One woman told Mr. Freeman that if there was unrest in the\ncity, it would be his fault.After Mr. Clark’s shooting on Nov. 15, protests\ndisrupted Minneapolis for weeks. Demonstrators occupied the area outside a\npolice station, marched downtown and raised questions about racial disparities\nin Minnesota. The demonstrators sometimes clashed with officers, and one\nnight, the police said, several men who were not part of the demonstration\ncame and shot five people during a protest.After Wednesday’s announcement,\nprotesters gathered at the courthouse, exchanging hugs, crying and vowing to\nreturn to the streets.“An injustice has been done today,” said Nekima Levy-\nPounds, the president of the Minneapolis chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. “I believe\nthey lie to us. I believe they tamper with evidence.”Several hundred\ndemonstrators converged downtown Wednesday night after marching in peacefully\nfrom different parts of the city, singing songs and chanting phrases.Mr.\nFreeman’s presentation offered the fullest description yet of the shooting,\nwhich the police and witnesses portrayed differently last year. Many neighbors\nsaid that Mr. Clark was handcuffed when shot, but Mr. Freeman said D.N.A. and\nother evidence suggested that Mr. Clark’s hands were unrestrained and that he\ntried to gain control over one officer’s gun.“Forensic evidence and video\nevidence both support the belief that Clark was not handcuffed at any time\nthrough the altercation,” said Mr. Freeman, whose office posted a trove of\ninvestigative documents online.He said the officers, Mark Ringgenberg and\nDustin Schwarze, both of whom are white, “did not have a chance to withdraw or\nto negotiate.”Mr. Freeman showed video of the episode, including some taken by\na bystander and images from an ambulance’s camera. One video showed Mr. Clark\njust outside an ambulance that was carrying the woman who had been hurt.\nAnother showed an officer taking Mr. Clark to the ground. Neither provided a\nclear view of the shooting.Unlike prosecutors in past police shootings in his\ncounty, Mr. Freeman made the decision on charges without consulting a grand\njury. Many protesters had requested that Mr. Freeman stop using grand juries\nin such cases, citing fatal police shootings in Cleveland and in Ferguson,\nMo., where grand jurors decided not to indict officers.But even with the\nofficers cleared of state charges, a separate federal civil rights\ninvestigation into Mr. Clark’s death is continuing, a spokesman for the United\nStates attorney in Minnesota said this week. The spokesman, Ben Petok,\ndeclined to offer a timeline on when that investigation might finish.After the\nprosecutor’s announcement, Minneapolis’s mayor and its police chief held a\nnews conference where they pledged to respect protesters but also restrict\ndangerous activity.“Officers will exercise restraint,” said Chief Janee\nHarteau, who was criticized by activists last week after posting a YouTube\nvideo warning against illegal acts and including images of firebombs and\ngraffiti. “Their actions will be based on actions of others.”Mayor Betsy\nHodges said she understood that there was “anger, disappointment, frustration,\nmistrust in a system that has not worked for everyone” and said she supported\npeaceful protests.“There is a tear that has ripped through our community,” Ms.\nHodges said, “one we cannot sew back up.”\n\n","title":"Minneapolis Officers in Jamar Clark Shooting Will Not Face Charges - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Two Minneapolis police officers will not face state criminal charges in the fatal shooting of Jamar Clark https://t.co/Xl0AFp1nES","date":"Wed Mar 30 16:50:41 +0000 2016","favs":102,"id":{"$numberLong":"715219710284050433"},"retweets":125},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VTC1Ab"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0148a"},"content":"PARIS — President François Hollande of France announced on Wednesday that he\nwas withdrawing a proposal to strip French citizenship from dual nationals\nconvicted of terrorism, ending a monthslong debate that convulsed his\ngoverning Socialist Party, dominated political discussion after the November\nterrorist attacks, and led to the resignation of the justice minister.The\nidea, originally endorsed by right-wing parties and adopted by Mr. Hollande\nthree days after the deadly attacks on Nov. 13, drew furious opposition on the\nleft in France, even though all sides agreed it was largely symbolic and would\nhave little practical effect in combating terrorism.But the proposal\nhighlighted a growing split within the Socialist Party, between those who\nfavored a tough law-and-order approach in the wake of the attacks that killed\n130 people, and those worried that the government would be impinging on civil\nliberties.Critics on the left complained that the plan would create two\nclasses of citizens, saying it recalled the dark days of the World War II\ncollaborationist government in France, which rendered hundreds of Jews\nstateless.France is still under a state of emergency imposed after the\nattacks, and the police have conducted thousands of raids and put hundreds of\nsuspects under house arrest.Last week, after the Brussels bombings on March\n22, officials identified a possible terrorist attack in the “advance d stages”\nof planning, according to the French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, and\nannounced the arrest of a suspect with links to one of the November\nattackers.On Wednesday, Mr. Hollande said he was pulling back from the\ncitizenship proposal that had become the most intensely debated measure in a\nbill to overhaul the Constitution. The reversal is likely to reinforce among\nmany voters what pollsters say is Mr. Hollande’s reputation for indecision.Mr.\nHollande blamed members of the right-wing opposition, which controls the\nSenate, for his decision.“I take note that part of the opposition is against\nall constitutional revision,” he said. “I deplore, profoundly, this attitude,\nbecause we must do all we can, under the current serious conditions, to avoid\ndivisions.”Mr. Hollande also abandoned a proposal to create a constitutional\nprovision for declaring a state of emergency, even though it had garnered\nbroad support across the political spectrum.Mr. Hollande’s government had\nslightly backtracked on the citizenship proposal in January, largely to\nmollify his critics on the left, in deciding that the bill would not contain\nany language explicitly referring to dual citizens.The lower house, the\nNational Assembly, where Socialists are in the majority, approved an amended\nbill that extended the measure to all French citizens, regardless of how many\npassports they held.But the Senate insisted on sticking to the original idea\nand restricting the proposal to people with dual citizenship, with its leaders\nsaying that the creation of stateless individuals was a “red line” they would\nnot cross. With a presidential election scheduled next year, analysts\ninterpreted the move as a way of dealing yet another blow to an already\nweakened Mr. Hollande.Under French law, the National Assembly has the last\nword when disagreements arise with the Senate over regular legislation. But\nmodifying the Constitution requires the approval of both houses, on an\nidentical version of a bill, before they can convene as a Congress in\nVersailles to vote on it.\n\n","title":"François Hollande Cancels Plan to Strip French Citizenship in Terrorism Cases - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"François Hollande dropped a proposal to strip citizenship from French-born dual citizens convicted of terrorism https://t.co/BgBITyZNOI","date":"Wed Mar 30 16:15:10 +0000 2016","favs":120,"id":{"$numberLong":"715210769869193216"},"retweets":103},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21THPsP"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0148b"},"content":"After an Upshot article about strategic voting — “You Say You Loathe Ted Cruz?\nYou Still Might Want to Vote for Him”— one reader had a question:“How about\nthe idea of being honest with your vote? Isn’t this strategy another form of\ntelling a lie?”Perhaps Canada can offer neighborly advice, after recently\nliving through a national debate over the ethics of voting for someone other\nthan your first choice, as a means to an end.An article in The National Post\nset the scene last October.“As a Canada obsessed with strategic voting\nprepared to go to the polls, Green Party Leader Elizabeth May appeared on\ntelevision to plead with voters to stop: ‘That’s slaughtering us; it’s\ndisastrous. In a democracy, you should cast your ballot for what you want.’\n”The Green Party did in fact do poorly, and Justin Trudeau seemed to benefit.\nThere was less of the vote-splitting from left-leaning parties (like the Green\nParty) that had helped the Conservative prime minister, Stephen Harper, in the\n2011 election.One Canadian blogger, looking ahead to promised reforms to\neliminate such tactics, wrote a post titled, “I’m Voting Strategically Because\nI Hate Strategic Voting.”Ken Gallinger, the “Ethically Speaking” columnist for\nThe Toronto Star, defended the practice this way:Doubt remains about whether\nstrategic voting was decisive in Mr. Trudeau’s victory, and studies in the\nUnited States have shown that the rates of tactical voting are generally low\nand that promotion of it is usually ineffective.Take the G.O.P. primary in\nMassachusetts. The Boston Globe editorialized that “stopping Donald J. Trump\nis imperative” and urged unenrolled voters to cast a Republican ballot for\nJohn Kasich “instead of voting in the Democratic primary on the same day.”How\ndid that work out? The biggest victory of Mr. Trump’s campaign so far has been\nin Massachusetts.Still, strategic voting has since come to the fore in the\nG.O.P. race. Elaborate schemes have been hatched; Mitt Romney has emerged as\nsomething of a strategist-in-chief, at one point telling voters who want to\nstop Mr. Trump to vote for Mr. Cruz in some states and Mr. Kasich in others,\ndepending on which one has a better chance to win.Liberals also have\nmotivation to vote strategically. One Upshot reader, Brad from NYC, wrote:But\nit’s harder to cause mischief in some states than in others.Matthew Dickinson,\na professor of political science at Middlebury College, who said the ethics of\nstrategic voting are largely in the eye of the beholder, said via email that\n“some forms of strategic voting, such as crossover voting, can be eliminated\nby changing rules to eliminate open primaries,” but that it would “be hard to\nsee how one could prevent all forms.”He noted that Mr. Romney’s efforts to get\nRepublicans to vote for Mr. Cruz in Utah, “without actually endorsing Cruz,”\nmight have been an attempt to increase the chances of a contested convention\n“in which Romney can ride in on his white horse to save the party.”“Is it\nethical?” he said. “For those who believe Trump would be a disaster for the\nRepublican Party, and for the nation, I suspect the answer is, ‘Hell, yes!’\n”Closed primaries generally allow only those registered with the major parties\nto participate. New York chose that system partly to limit strategic voting.\nBut trying to stamp it out may cause other harms, such as excluding\nindependents who would like to participate. (New York’s rules for its April 19\nprimary are so strict that the deadline for changing one’s party was last\nOctober.)Because of the Electoral College, sometimes a strategic vote in a\nprimary can be the most meaningful vote — by far — that an American can cast\nin an election season. With battleground states not shifting much recently, a\ngeneral election vote in Vermont (true blue) or Alabama (faithfully red), for\nexample, has essentially become a formality. Strategic support can be a vote\nagainst someone — more than a vote for someone — but it seems hard to argue\nthat it’s not a democratic act, and seems better than not voting at all.One\nthing strategic voting can’t ensure is that the “strategy” will work.\n“Fortunately, (at least for those who oppose strategic voting), efforts to\ngame the system are fraught with uncertainty, in large part because of the\ndifficulty of coordinating the efforts of many voters toward a single\nobjective,” Mr. Dickinson said.The United States had its own experience with\ndesperate pleading and strategic voting involving the Green Party, in 2000.“I\nrecall that many Ralph Nader Florida supporters tried to ‘trade’ votes with Al\nGore supporters in noncompetitive states, but in the end they weren’t able to\nprevent enough people in Florida from voting for Nader,” Mr. Dickinson said.\n“Presumably many of them would have preferred a President Gore over a Bush.\nWould they have been better off voting for Gore, despite their preference for\nNader? Bush supporters might view that decision calculus as unethical, but I\nsuspect many Nader voters would not, particularly in hindsight.”Some Bernie\nSanders supporters — those who have an intense dislike of Hillary Clinton —\nmay face a similar strategic choice if she wins the Democratic nomination. Do\nthey swallow hard and vote for Mrs. Clinton or, in effect, help Mr. Trump or\nMr. Cruz or another G.O.P. candidate win?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0148c"},"content":"Even Michael Savage had had enough.As the insults and innuendos over\ncandidates’ wives and tabloid reports of suspected affairs dominated the back\nand forth between Senator Ted Cruz and Donald J. Trump, Mr. Savage, one of the\ncountry’s most popular conservative radio hosts and an ardent supporter of Mr.\nTrump, drew a red line last week.“I’ve supported Trump and probably still\nwill, but if he won’t disavow this guy Pecker and this story, I may withdraw\nmy support,” he said on the air on Friday. He was referring to David J.\nPecker, the owner of The National Enquirer, which published the allegations of\nsexual affairs against Mr. Cruz. “I am not going to support anyone who engages\nin assassination by innuendo,” Mr. Savage added.But on Monday, Mr. Trump and\nMr. Savage reconciled in a mostly fawning interview, with no apology from Mr.\nTrump, who nevertheless called The Enquirer’s allegation that Mr. Cruz had\naffairs “garbage.”The momentary rupture, however brief, was emblematic. As the\nfractures in the Republican Party over the candidacy of Mr. Trump grow deeper\nby the day, conservative talk radio is having its own identity crisis.Long a\npowerful and potent agitator of right-wing politics, conservative radio hosts\nare one of the few forces that can sway the opinions of the Trump electorate.\nAnd with Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz now tearing each other — and the party —\napart, the biggest names in the field are delicately navigating how to address\nMr. Trump’s latest provocations without alienating listeners.“Talk radio has a\nreally unique way of being able to penetrate its way into Republican primary\npolitics around the country,” said Doug Heye, a Republican strategist and\ndeputy chief of staff for former Representative Eric Cantor. If leading\nconservative hosts united in opposition to Mr. Trump, Mr. Heye said, “in\ntheory, it could absolutely hurt him, in part because that’s where a lot of\nhis supporters are.”Conservative talk radio is just as divided and conflicted\non Mr. Trump as the Republican electorate. Some advocate. Some criticize. And\nsome try to stay neutral — but that is no longer easy.In December, Rush\nLimbaugh took issue with Mr. Trump’s harsh words about Mr. Cruz and criticisms\nMr. Trump made of Justice Antonin Scalia, saying, “If you’re a conservative\nvoter in the Republican primary, these two things have got to raise some red\nflags for you people.”Later, in February, Mr. Limbaugh heaped praise on Mr.\nCruz. “If conservatism is the dominating factor in how you vote, there is no\nother choice for you in this campaign than Ted Cruz,” he said, before dropping\nthe highest of Republican compliments: “This is the closest in our lifetimes\nwe have ever been to Ronald Reagan.”But just two days later, Mr. Limbaugh\nfound himself explaining to callers that he still had a “no-endorsement\npolicy” in presidential primaries and that his laudatory statements about Mr.\nCruz were just observations. “It doesn’t mean that Trump is no good,” he said,\nrepeatedly pointing to the candidate’s wide appeal.At the same time, Mr.\nLimbaugh has taken heat  for providing cover for Mr. Trump, excusing some of\nhis bombast for “striking a nerve in the country.”Others have gone much\nfurther in their praise of Mr. Cruz. Mark Levin and Glenn Beck endorsed the\nTexas senator, and have been critical of Mr. Trump. Mr. Levin has told him to\n“cut the crap” with his attacks on Mr. Cruz. Of Mr. Trump’s opposition to\ntrade deals, he said, “I’ve never heard such stupid talk in my life.”Mr. Beck\nhas made it his mission to stop Mr. Trump, saying the candidate is not a true\nconservative, nor a true Christian.“No Christian says, ‘I want that guy — that\nguy is the guy for me,’ ” Mr. Beck said on air about Mr. Trump and his\nsupporters. “Nobody, nobody.”Part of the conservative radio divide reflects\nhow Mr. Cruz was the darling of the far right wing of the Republican Party\nbefore Mr. Trump’s unexpected political rise. A frequent guest on talk radio,\nthe senator earned celebrity status for his effort to shut down the\ngovernment, and was showered with effusive praise when he was the first to\njump into the race. Mr. Limbaugh called his presidential announcement speech\n“dazzling” and “masterful.”But Mr. Trump’s candidacy forced a realignment. Mr.\nSavage routinely has Mr. Trump on his show and condemns Mr. Cruz as “an\ninsider.” He sees Mr. Trump as galvanizing disaffected voters who have both\npowered his strong ratings for decades and been ignored by previous Republican\nnominees.“He’s speaking to the demographic of the electorate that has been\nignored and castigated,” Mr. Savage said in an interview. “That’s what I\nsee.”Sean Hannity has not publicly staked out a side, and has said both Mr.\nTrump and Mr. Cruz are conservative choices. He tries to have both on his show\nas often as he can.“Who am I to come in and tell them to vote for this\nperson?” Mr. Hannity asked in an interview, referring to his listeners. “I\ndon’t think I serve them well that way.”But he warned that any effort to deny\nMr. Trump the nomination if he came close to the 1,237 majority of delegates\nwould be the downfall of the Republican Party.“If they try to steal this\nnomination or disenfranchise the voters, it would be the end of the Republican\nParty,” he said. “I guarantee you, it’s over.”“If it’s Trump” who is denied\nthe nomination, he continued, “Trump supporters are walking. If it’s Cruz,\nCruz supporters are walking. And they’re not coming back. And I’ll walk with\nthem.”Laura Ingraham, who also said she would not endorse a candidate, shared\na similar point of view in an interview, calling the stop-Trump effort “a\nlittle juvenile.”“There are a lot of purists out there who, if they don’t get\neverything checked off on their little bucket list,” then they say “take your\npail and go home,” she said. “Come to the real world.”Mr. Beck sees it\ndifferently, calling Mr. Trump “a clown.”Disagreement among conservative radio\nhosts is nothing new. But the searing divisions of this contest pose\nparticular challenges to the hosts as they seek to hold on to their listeners\n— and address their grievances — in such a fractured climate.“The rule of talk\nradio is always ‘Don’t get ahead of your listener,’ ” said Rick Tyler, a\npolitical analyst on MSNBC and former communications director for the Cruz\ncampaign. “You can educate the listener, and you can bring them along.”But Mr.\nBeck argued that the opinion and principles of the host were what drew the\naudience.“Our principles are our only things that have kept us going and going\non our air,” he said. “And if you abandon your principles for interest, you’re\ndone.”But in Mr. Trump, Mr. Beck and Mr. Levin may have found a candidate who\nhas beaten them at their own game. The Manhattan businessman has found a way\naround traditional media, as his rallies and news conferences are often\ncarried live on cable networks and occasionally on broadcast television.And\nthe hosts who rely on access to the candidate seem mindful of his ability to\ncircumvent mainstream media, cozying up to Mr. Trump to maintain a\nrelationship.As Mr. Savage said as he closed his interview with Mr. Trump on\nMonday: “People are going to say I was too nice to you today.”\n\n","title":"Donald Trump vs. Ted Cruz Creates a Headache for Talk Radio Hosts - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"With Trump and Cruz tearing each other apart, conservative talk radio is having an identity crisis https://t.co/cFRkZNrK8X","date":"Wed Mar 30 14:27:58 +0000 2016","favs":165,"id":{"$numberLong":"715183794081411073"},"retweets":107},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21SAbim"}

A 2-0 loss in\nGuatemala City on Friday had seemed to put the United States in peril of not\nqualifying for the 2018 World Cup.There were calls for the dismissal of Coach\nJurgen Klinsmann, questions about selection policy and general\ntrepidation.Even after the big win, the United States stands in second place\nin its qualifying group, only 1 point ahead of Guatemala. With only two teams\nto advance, is there still a real danger of elimination? Was there ever? And\ncould there be signs of trouble ahead for the final qualifying round?In a\nword, no.Both the United States and Guatemala have two games remaining, in\nSeptember. Each should score easy wins over St. Vincent and the Grenadines,\nwhich is 0-4 with a minus-16 goal differential. The other games are against\nthe group leader, Trinidad, but the United States’ game is at home, while\nGuatemala must travel to Port of Spain. The United States also has a huge edge\nin goal differential, the first tiebreaker, plus-7 to plus-1.Once the United\nStates advances to the final round, known as the hexagonal, it should be\nfavored again. Its world ranking is 30th. Only Mexico, at 22nd, is higher\namong the teams from the United States’ region. The other likely participants\nrange from Costa Rica at 33, down to the 80s. And with three or four\nqualifying spots available, there is quite a margin for error. Mexico was\n2-3-5 in the hexagonal and still qualified for the 2014 Cup.Every four years,\nit seems, there comes a time when the United States hits a bad patch in\nqualifying and panic ensues.At the same stage in qualifying for 2014, the\nUnited States started 1-1-1 with a draw in Guatemala and a loss in Jamaica and\nwas tied for second in the group. The Americans went on to win it. Four years\nearlier, the United States lost a game in the final qualifying round at Costa\nRica after drawing at El Salvador. The United States won the group; Costa Rica\nand El Salvador did not make the World Cup.Notice that all of the key American\nsetbacks came on the road. Winning international games in Central America and\nthe Caribbean can be tough; conditions are difficult and refereeing can be\niffy. When the hexagonal begins, expect the United States to lose an away game\nand the hand-wringing to begin again. And expect the United States to qualify\nfor the World Cup.The United States has qualified for every Cup since 1990,\nwhen it sneaked past Trinidad in the final qualifying game. The United States\nqualified automatically in 1994 as the host, and since then has made the Cup\nfive straight times, usually with some ease.But all the news is not good for\nUnited States soccer. While the women’s team breezed into the Olympic Games,\nthe men’s team will not be going after losing, 2-1, to Colombia in Frisco,\nTex., on Tuesday night. The team of under-23 players had lost an earlier\nchance to qualify in October, falling to Honduras in Sandy, Utah. The team\nalso failed to make the 2012 Games.But it is hard to prepare a makeshift team\nof youngsters in a short time. And the Olympic field of 16 is only half the\nsize of the World Cup’s.Though it too will have its stumbles, Coach\nKlinsmann’s World Cup team is not likely to face a similar fate.\n\n","title":"Relax, U.S. Soccer Fans.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0148f"},"content":"With the Zika virus spreading largely unchecked in Latin America and the\nCaribbean by way of a now-notorious insect, some of the nation’s leading\nmosquito researchers are striving to assemble a state-of-the-art DNA map that\nthey say will help them fight the disease with the mosquito’s own genetic\ncode.The quest involves scientists from assorted disciplines who rarely\ncollaborate, often compete for funding and have different ideas about how to\ngenetically manipulate the mosquito, Aedes aegypti.Some want to hunt for genes\nthat, if altered in mosquitoes released into the wild, could drive the species\nto extinction. Others are trying to identify genes that control how mosquitoes\nsense human prey so as to devise better repellents. Still others favor the\nidea of selectively breeding populations of mosquitoes, like corn or cattle,\nfor desirable — or, at least, less undesirable — traits, such as a preference\nfor biting animals other than humans.The project took off after a series of\nfrustrated Twitter posts from Leslie B. Vosshall, a mosquito researcher at\nRockefeller University. Dr. Vosshall issued a plea for advice on constructing\na detailed mosquito DNA map in January, as Brazil began reporting a spike,\napparently related to the Zika virus, in newborns with unusually small\nheads.“I was worried people would be defensive or paranoid or weird,” she said\nin the days leading up to the scientists’ first nine-way videoconference call.\n“For a long time, I think we all thought the map was somebody else’s job.”The\nbid to map the genome of the Aedes mosquito has received little attention,\nperhaps because a map in itself will not yield a fix for Zika, any more than\nthe human genome map has yielded a cure for cancer. It might lead to\nbiological possibilities, moreover, whose ecological consequences are deemed\ntoo serious to risk.But the story of how the Aedes Genome Working Group\nemerged offers a glimpse at the often ad hoc way science lurches forward,\ndriven by self-interest, new technology and pressing social needs. The\npursuits of its members reflect the range of hopes for a new form of genetic\ncombat that may be increasingly called into play as the specter of diseases\nborne by insects grows along with our ability to parse the details of their\nDNA.And the need to control the Aedes mosquito, which also carries yellow\nfever and other viruses, is not likely to end with this outbreak. Despite the\nintroduction of a vaccine against yellow fever that saved millions of lives,\nfor instance, the virus still kills 30,000 people a year.“If we’re going to\ncontrol the creature, we need to know it frontwards and backwards,” said\nJeffrey Powell, a mosquito researcher at Yale University, who was among the\nfirst to join forces with Dr. Vosshall. “Having a complete genome sequence of\nthe beast will give us a fundamental understanding of its biology that you\ncan’t get any other way.”Genome mapping, which first captured the public\nimagination in 2000 with the release of a draft of the human DNA sequence, has\nbecome a fundamental tool of modern molecular biology, used to help study how\nliving things evolve, develop, get sick and behave. An Aedes genome map of\nsorts, too, has existed since 2007, but researchers say it is staggeringly\nimperfect: fragmented into 36,204 pieces, some of which are themselves\nmisassembled, with hundreds of genes known to be missing and others mistakenly\nduplicated.For a long time, cost and sheer difficulty made filling in every\ndetail prohibitive for all but a few genome sequences, including our own and\nthose of a handful of laboratory favorites like mice and fruit flies. Even as\nnew techniques have made it easier and more affordable to create better maps,\nthe task has been seen more as a technical feat than a scientific one, which\nis one reason the Aedes map has remained in its state of disrepair.“There’s\nnot a lot of glory in it,” Dr. Powell conceded.Zika, however, has helped\ngalvanize the small community of researchers who already spend most of their\ntime thinking about the insect. The normally mild virus’s apparent link to\nbrain damage in babies whose mothers were infected while pregnant has stirred\nfears worldwide and led health officials to declare the current pandemic a\npublic health emergency.An Aedes mosquito in the United States could become a\ncarrier for the virus if the insect bit a traveler who had acquired Zika\nabroad. Though the use of air-conditioning and screens is likely to limit\noutbreaks in the United States as the mosquito population swells in the South\nthis summer, stanching Zika’s spread means controlling a mosquito that has\ngrown resistant to previously effective insecticides and requires only minute\namounts of standing water to breed.A few experiments with the mass release of\nbiologically altered mosquitoes, carried out by a biotechnology company and by\nresearchers funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, have reportedly\nhad some success. But researchers say other strategies are virtually certain\nto be needed. With the Obama administration asking for $1.8 billion to combat\nZika, it seemed likely to Dr. Vosshall that the budget for a new map — a few\nhundred thousand dollars, with enough support and volunteer labor from other\nresearchers — could somehow be secured.And on their first videoconference call\nin late January, nine far-flung teams of scientists found common cause in\ntheir discontent with trying to track down which genes control which traits on\na map that often leads them astray.“I can’t tell you how many meetings I’ve\nbeen to where people use four-letter words” to describe the existing map,\nAnthony A. James, a mosquito researcher at the University of California,\nIrvine, observed to the group.Amid different opinions about the best approach\nand who would pay for what, a consensus emerged. The DNA for the new map would\nbe extracted from the offspring of a very particular mating of Aedes\nmosquitoes, from the same line mapped a decade earlier.A few days later,\nresearchers at Virginia Tech shipped the offspring in the form of dried eggs\nto Dr. Vosshall’s laboratory at Rockefeller, where they were hatched and\nreared by a postdoctoral fellow, Ben Matthews. Since females will not lay eggs\nuntil they are fed, Dr. Matthews took a necessary first step. Inside a humid\nchamber, behind an airlock and a third heavy door, he offered up his arm for a\nbite so that the selected Eve could take what is known in the parlance of\nmosquito researchers as “a blood meal.”“It’s kind of amazing,” he said\ncheerfully, “when you think about the amount of money, time and science that’s\ngoing to come downstream of this.”That a genome map for Aedes aegypti, however\nimperfect, was published in 2007 is a testament to the species’ longtime\nstatus as a potent human foe. (Its genus name, bestowed by 18th-century\nnaturalists with a penchant for accuracy, means “unpleasant” in ancient Greek;\n“aegypti” refers to Egypt, where it was first believed to have been\ncollected.)Besides Zika and yellow fever, the insect carries dengue, which\ncauses a severe and sometimes fatal flulike illness, and chikungunya, which\ncan cause intense joint pain that lasts for years.Because Aedes is easier to\nmaintain in laboratories, it is simpler to study than its more lethal cousins,\ncertain Anopheles mosquitoes, which kill some 800,000 people a year by\ninfecting them with malaria. The hope that scientists could blunt the threat\nof both species by learning which genes control what in Aedes was what\npersuaded the National Institutes of Health to underwrite the initial\nsequencing of the mosquito’s genome for about $18 million.The genomes of every\nliving thing consist of four chemical units that function like letters in an\nalphabet, arranged in sequences, or “words,” that tell its cells what to do.\nIn Aedes’s case, each cell nucleus contains 1.3 billion letters of DNA from\neach parent, coiled into three chromosomes. Since the order of the words is\nalso important, in an ideal world, a DNA sequence would consist of those same\nletters, which would then be assembled, or “mapped,” into three long\nstretches.But the technology used for the 2007 Aedes map, and many others,\ncould only read relatively short stretches of DNA at a time, which were then\npieced together by matching up the sections where they overlapped in a process\nthat often left some areas garbled and riddled with gaps. And since more than\nhalf of the Aedes genome consists of sequences that repeat again and again, it\nhas proved more difficult than many genomes to make sense of.“Have you seen\n‘The Shining’?” Dr. Vosshall asked, referring to the classic horror film in\nwhich the psychotic Jack Torrance character, played by Jack Nicholson, appears\nto be writing a novel that turns out to be the same phrase over and over\nagain. “It’s like you have a thousand copies of ‘all work and no play’ and\nthen three sentences of unique text.”Adam M. Phillippy, an expert in\nassembling genome maps at the National Institutes of Health, likened the\nprocess to doing a puzzle for which the pieces have precisely the same shape,\nare tiny, “and you’re missing the cover.”But over the last few years,\ntechnology has emerged that allows the DNA letters to be read in stretches of\ntens of thousands at a time, making for bigger puzzle pieces and prompting\nbiologists to revisit older genome maps.Remapping the supposedly complete\nhuman genome with the new technique has yielded several previously unknown\ngenes active in the brain that scientists say may hold clues to how we differ\nfrom other apes. The United States Agriculture Department is in the process of\nremapping pig, goat and cattle genomes in the expectation of finding genes\nthat make for healthier and more efficient farm animals.Evan E. Eichler, a\nhuman geneticist at the University of Washington who recently led a team in\nassembling a new gorilla genome, called the new information that scientists\nhad been able to glean “mind-blowing.”“There’s a strong case to be made for\ngoing back to the mosquito and redoing it,” he said, “like there is for any\ngenome that still has lots of gaps.”Aware of the new technology, Dr. Vosshall\nfloated the idea of a new Aedes map on Twitter: “The Aedes aegypti mosquito is\ninfecting millions with #Zika and #Dengue,” she wrote on Jan. 28, “but we\nstill haven’t put all the pieces of its genome together.”Ultimately, she\nreceived over a dozen replies from the cast who would make up the group,\nincluding a virologist, a population geneticist, several molecular biologists\nand experts in assorted aspects of the art of genome assembly.One came from\nMark Kunitomi, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, San\nFrancisco. “Hi Leslie,” his email started. “I follow you on Twitter.”Dr.\nKunitomi and his adviser, the virologist Raul Andino, believe that the key to\nwhat makes some populations of Aedes mosquitoes resistant to viruses like Zika\nlies in bits of viral code embedded in their DNA. Such information might allow\nresearchers to predict where in the world outbreaks are most likely to arise\nand, in effect, to vaccinate a mosquito population by releasing mosquitoes\nwith the requisite viral DNA inserted.To pursue the idea, Dr. Andino and Dr.\nKunitomi produced a new version of an Aedes map in collaboration with Pacific\nBiosciences, the company that has pioneered the new sequencing technology.\nThis version yielded many hundreds of genes not found in the 2007 map. But,\nwhile better, it is still short of what scientists are looking for because it\ncomes from an Aedes cell line with many mutations.Dr. Kunitomi mentioned that\nDr. Vosshall might want to reach out to Dr. Powell, the mosquito researcher at\nYale, who Dr. Kunitomi had learned was working with the same company. Dr.\nPowell, too, was in search of the genes that control the mosquito’s ability to\ntransmit viruses. But a truly complete map would require paying for more\nsequencing with the Pacific Biosciences technology, and several other steps\nthat he could not afford.Dr. James of the University of California, Irvine,\nalso voiced support. His interest in the map came from his work on a\ntechnology called gene drive, in which a trait engineered into a few\nindividuals in a species — sterility, say, or an altered immune system — is\nmade to spread rapidly through a population as a result of a trick that\nensures it is transmitted to all descendants, bypassing the normally random\nprocess of inheritance.While that technology might be used to stop the Zika\nvirus, gene drive is controversial because of fears that an altered gene might\n“escape” into another species. Dr. James argued that such concerns could be\nmitigated if the gene were unique to Aedes, or at least to mosquitoes. (“They\ndo something fruit flies don’t do,” he noted. “They feed on blood.”) But to\nhave any hope of that, he needed a map to compare Aedes genes against\nothers.“For me, it’s an extension of the engineering principle that you want\nto be as targeted as you can,” he said.Researchers at Colorado State and at\nthe University of Bristol in England also weighed in. At the University of\nNotre Dame, David W. Severson, who had orchestrated the making of the original\nmap, offered to help. On Twitter, Dr. Phillippy, of the National Institutes of\nHealth, responded with advice on the best approach to creating a new mosquito\nmap and volunteered his services.The N.I.H. came through with a $15,000\nemergency grant, and Eric S. Lander, the director of the Broad Institute of\nM.I.T. and Harvard, called Dr. Vosshall with an offer to devote the\ninstitution’s considerable resources to the project. “It was like getting a\ncall from the pope,” Dr. Vosshall recalled.Though it is still short by some\n$250,000 required for the finishing touches, by late last month, the group had\na plan that involved three types of DNA sequencing and enough funding to\nstart. And so Dr. Matthews extracted the DNA from the pupae that the Eve had\nproduced. It is now being sequenced.\n\n","title":"Team of Rival Scientists Comes Together to Fight Zika - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Mapping a genetic strategy to fight the Zika virus https://t.co/VDs5zYCZaS","date":"Wed Mar 30 13:46:26 +0000 2016","favs":99,"id":{"$numberLong":"715173342836162561"},"retweets":77},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PFjos3"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01490"},"content":"_Several years ago, a friend of mine encouraged her friends, including me, to\nbuy what turned out to be fraudulent securities. This friend believed the\nsecurities were legal, but they were part of a large fraud enterprise\nresulting in a loss of millions to hundreds of investors. As an agent, she\narranged for her friends to buy some $250,000 of these investments. The\nperpetrators of the fraud are being brought to trial this year, but it appears\nthat about half the money is gone.__I believe my friend did not know this was\na scam, but I also believe she did not do due diligence in scoping out the\nbackground of the sellers of the securities, who have a criminal record. She\ndid not do this background check because she received phony stock in return\nfor selling to others and wanted to capitalize on this and become rich\nherself. __I invested an amount I knew I could lose, and many of my friends\ndid the same, so we are O.K. with losing the money, as we knew it carried a\nhigh risk. However, one of our friends invested more than she could safely\nlose and is now unable to retire and faces reduced circumstances.__My question\nis whether the friend who sold the securities has an obligation to help the\nfriend who is in a perilous financial condition. The seller friend is in good\nshape financially, with a paid house and a funded retirement account. She also\nworks part time. __Of course, I hope she would think of helping the other\nfriend herself, but she has not come to this conclusion. May I make this\nsuggestion to her? This is having an impact on my friendship with her, and I\nwill most likely drop the friendship if she does not help the friend in need.\n_Name Withheld**There’s good reason** for the old warning against doing\nbusiness with friends. Your duty to look out for them and your interest in\nlooking out for yourself go together like bread and mold. It’s worse when the\nparties involved lack the relevant expertise and can’t make their own\nassessments.But settling the moral accounts can be tricky. You think that if\nyour “seller friend” had done the right amount of investigation, she would\nhave discovered the fraud. It’s natural to think so after things have gone\nwrong. Yet the success of the fraud suggests that others were taken in, too.\nThe fact that you could have found out about the criminal background of the\nscammers doesn’t mean that she was bound to ask the right questions or know\nwhere to look for answers. The rest of you didn’t, either.Then there’s the\nissue of motivation. You’re concerned that the seller didn’t engage in due\ndiligence because she thought she stood to make a significant profit by\nreceiving stock as payment. Maybe so. But in another respect, this inducement\nspeaks to her sincerity: She wouldn’t have bothered if she knew the stock was\nworth nothing, and she was putting her relationships on the line for it, so\nthere were real costs to being wrong.Yet the fact that she, too, was duped —\nand that the buyers would have been well advised to make their own inquiries —\ndoesn’t mean she bears no moral burden here. She has let you all down. The\nseller’s greed may well have clouded her judgment, as it seems to have clouded\nthe buyers’. Whatever the explanation, a morally responsible person will feel\nbad about what happened — even if she doesn’t think she did anything wrong.The\nphilosopher Bernard Williams dubbed this phenomenon “agent-regret.” His\nexample was the way a truck driver should feel when he runs over a child who\ndarts into the path of his vehicle. If the driver knew that he did everything\nhe could to avoid what happened, he should still feel a special kind of regret\nabout his involvement in the child’s death. It would be natural to want to\nseek forgiveness from the child’s family, for example, and maybe to contribute\nto the funeral expenses. An apology would be in order even if your seller\nfriend was as deceived as the rest of you, and exercised a reasonable level of\ncare.So let’s focus on the idea of apology. You suggest that only one victim\nwas seriously harmed, and that your seller friend has enough resources to\nassist the victim without jeopardizing her own welfare. Even if the seller has\nno obligation to make this victim “whole,” chipping in to help would make that\napology a lot more heartfelt.A final note. Selling fraudulent securities to\nyour friends has to be rare, but something a little like this is pretty common\nin this country: You get involved in a pyramid marketing scheme (the outfit\nprefers the term “multilevel” marketing), and you sell all your friends sales\nkits. They’re your “downline.” You get a share of what they sell, too. People\ndo this with high hopes that everyone will make money; when the reality turns\nout otherwise, it’s bound to lead to bad feelings. Most of the people who do\nthis are acting in good faith. They’re usually just ignorant (and maybe a\nlittle greedy). Still, you might think the endless news stories about these\nschemes would make everyone’s ignorance a little culpable. Sellers should take\ncare, and buyers should, yes, beware._I have a friend who works at a firm that\nprovides its female employees maternity leave. In advance of having her first\nchild (and before using a six-week maternity-leave benefit), she fully\nexpected to leave her job after her leave was over; she was clear about this\nin conversations with friends. Is there an ethical obligation for her to tell\nher employer? I understand that some people may fully intend to return to work\nand change their minds after becoming mothers. In those cases, it would seem\nfine to not return to work ever. However, is it fair to wait until after the\nleave is complete to notify an employer when there was never any intention of\nreturning to desk shackles? _Name Withheld**Maternity leave** is a benefit of\nthe job. While she has the job, she can take the benefit. No doubt there is a\nhope, perhaps even an expectation, that people will return from maternity\nleave, but if she hasn’t misled her employer, she isn’t at fault. (You don’t\nsuggest that your friend has a habit of gaming workplace benefits.) Still,\ngiving two weeks’ notice seems to be a usual norm in workplaces, and she’d do\nwell to give her employer a little time to plan for her permanent departure.\nShe’s entitled to the six-week provision all the same — and were the employer\nto try to deny her that benefit (say, by firing her), the employer would be at\nfault. Bear in mind that the employer could have decided to have a formal\nrequirement of predeparture notice for all employees (whether on maternity\nleave or not), with a reward for compliance or whatever penalties for\nnoncompliance are legally permitted. This might be prudent if many employees\nsee their work in terms of “desk shackles.”_I have been a loyal Volkswagen\ncustomer for 30 years, having purchased seven new VWs during this time. I was\ndisappointed by the news that VW rigged millions of its diesel vehicles to\ndefeat mandatory emissions tests by detecting the tests and adjusting their\nsettings so as to pass. The deceit continued with its marketing of “clean\ndiesel” technology and its new C.E.O.’s declaring during an interview on NPR\nthat VW “didn’t lie” — only to have to retract his statement later. Of course\nthere are many who will suffer for a relative few’s wrongdoing. Please weigh\nin on this morass and help me decide if I can purchase a VW with a clear\nconscience. _Name Withheld**I’d focus on** the future here, not on the\ncontagion of past wrongs. Volkswagen, it’s fair to assume, has learned that\nits “clean diesel” deceptions were bad business — maybe even just plain bad.\nHigh-level executives have been dismissed; VW’s market cap is less than half\nwhat it was last spring; it is facing fines and lawsuits that could amount to\ntens of billions. (The penalties were far, far less when Volvo, Mack and\nseveral other companies got caught cheating diesel-emissions tests in the\n1990s.) It’s your favorite car, and as long as there continues to be reason to\nbelieve that the company is cleaning up its act — so that its new models don’t\nhave any especially negative environmental impact — and you’re confident that\nVW will be around to support servicing when you need it, there’s no reason to\nswitch. How you drive, not what you drive, may prove of greater moral\nweight.__\n\n","title":"What Do You Owe the Friends You Unwittingly Scammed? - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Let's say you unwittingly scammed your friends.

When the plane landed in Larnaca, on the\nsouthern coast of Cyprus, Mr. Mustafa made various demands, including that a\nletter be delivered to his former wife, a Cypriot citizen, they said.“When\nsomeone hasn’t seen his family for 24 years and wants to see his wife and\nchildren, and the Egyptian government won’t let him, what is he supposed to\ndo?” Mr. Mustafa told the authorities, according to a statement by\nprosecutors.Prosecutors requested that Mr. Mustafa remain in detention,\narguing that if freed he might try to influence the testimony of his\npassengers and relatives or he might try to flee. The judge, Maria K. Loizou\nof Larnaca District Court, ordered that Mr. Mustafa remain in custody for\neight more days. The Egyptian authorities have formally requested the\nextradition of Mr. Mustafa, the country’s chief prosecutor said on\nWednesday.The hijacking on Tuesday morning raised the specter of international\nterrorism and seemed to be another devastating blow for Egypt, which has been\ncriticized for lax security at its airports. The mood turned to relief as Mr.\nMustafa released most of the hostages, and the episode eventually gave way to\ndark humor, as officials characterized Mr. Mustafa as a lovelorn, if\ndisturbed, man who insisted on seeing his former wife. A photograph showing\nhim standing next to a grinning passenger spread rapidly on social media,\ncontributing to the sense of levity.But as he appeared in court on Wednesday,\nwearing a black jacket and looking confused and exhausted, with his hair\nmatted and his hands shaking, nothing about the episode seemed funny to Mr.\nMustafa or to the spectators. The charges prosecutors read out — including\npiracy and violations of counterterrorism law — carry life sentences.Mr.\nMustafa spoke only twice during the court appearance, through an Arabic-\nlanguage interpreter, saying that he had no objection to the detention order\nand no questions about the legal proceedings. After the court adjourned, he\nmumbled something about a telephone: A court official later said he had asked\nagain to call his former wife.“She doesn’t want to talk him,” the court\nofficial said.A woman who answered the door at the home of Mr. Mustafa’s\nformer wife said that she did not want to comment and directed inquiries to\nMr. Mustafa. Cypriot news media reported that the couple had five children,\nincluding a daughter who died in a car crash, and that Mr. Mustafa lived in\nCyprus until 1994.According to Egyptian security officials, Mr. Mustafa\nescaped from prison, where he was serving time on charges of forgery and\nfraud, during the 2011 uprising that overthrew President Hosni Mubarak. A\nneighbor said that he had heard Mr. Mustafa, a fugitive, complain of being\ntrapped in Egypt, where he lived in an impoverished neighborhood with his\nwidowed sister and a brother with mental disabilities.In their request for his\ndetention, Cypriot prosecutors said that Mr. Mustafa stood up from his seat\nabout 15 minutes after the flight left Alexandria, bound for Cairo, and showed\na white belt to members of the crew, with cables that led to what he called a\n“remote control.”He gave notes to the crew members for the pilots, demanding\nthat the plane be rerouted and saying that if it landed in Egypt, he would\nblow up the plane. He also demanded the release of 63 “dissident” women from\nEgyptian jails.Most of the passengers returned to Egypt on Tuesday night on a\nplane sent by the Egyptian government, but some remained in Cyprus for travel\nelsewhere.\n\n","title":"EgyptAir Hijacking Suspect Says He Acted Out of Desperation - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @sewellchan: Egyptian man admits hijacking—says he acted out of desperation.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01492"},"content":"SAN FRANCISCO — Now that the United States government has cracked open an\niPhone that belonged to a gunman in the San Bernardino, Calif., mass shooting\nwithout Apple’s help, the tech company is under pressure to find and fix the\nflaw.But unlike other cases where security vulnerabilities have cropped up,\nApple may face a higher set of hurdles in ferreting out and repairing the\nparticular iPhone hole that the government hacked.The challenges start with\nthe lack of information about the method that the law enforcement authorities,\nwith the aid of a third party, used to break into the iPhone of Syed Rizwan\nFarook, an attacker in the San Bernardino rampage last year. Federal officials\nhave refused to identify the person, or organization, who helped crack the\ndevice, and have declined to specify the procedure used to open the iPhone.\nApple also cannot obtain the device to reverse-engineer the problem, the way\nit would in other hacking situations.Making matters trickier, Apple’s security\noperation has been in flux. The operation was reorganized late last year. A\nmanager who had been responsible for handling most of the government’s data\nextraction requests left the team to work in a different part of the company,\naccording to four current and former Apple employees, who spoke on the\ncondition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly\nabout the changes. Other employees, among them one whose tasks included trying\nto hack Apple’s own products, left the company over the last few months, they\nsaid, while new people have joined.The situation is in many ways a\ncontinuation of the cat-and-mouse game Apple is constantly engaged in with\nhackers, but the unusually prominent nature of this hacking — and the fact\nthat the hacker was the United States government — creates a predicament for\nthe company.“Apple is a business, and it has to earn the trust of its\ncustomers,” said Jay Kaplan, chief executive of the tech security company\nSynack and a former National Security Agency analyst. “It needs to be\nperceived as having something that can fix this vulnerability as soon as\npossible.”Apple referred to a statement it made on Monday when the government\nfiled to drop its case demanding that the company help it open Mr. Farook’s\niPhone. “We will continue to increase the security of our products as the\nthreats and attacks on our data become more frequent and more sophisticated,”\nApple said.Apple has been making many long-term moves to increase the security\nof its devices. The company’s chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has told\ncolleagues that he stands by Apple’s road map to encrypt everything stored on\nits devices and services, as well as information stored in Apple’s cloud\nservice iCloud, which customers use to back up the data on their mobile\ndevices. Apple engineers have also begun developing new security measures that\nwould make it tougher for the government to open a locked iPhone.For now, with\nthe dearth of information about the flaw in Mr. Farook’s iPhone 5C, which runs\nApple’s iOS 9 operating system, security experts could only guess at how the\ngovernment broke into the smartphone.Forensics experts said the government\nmight have attacked Apple’s system using a widely discussed method to extract\ninformation from a protected area in the phone by removing a chip and fooling\na mechanism that blocks password guessing, in order to find the user’s\npassword and unlock the data.The authorities may have used a procedure that\nmirrors the phone’s storage chip, called a NAND chip, and then copied it onto\nanother chip. Often referred to as “NAND-mirroring,” this would allow the\nF.B.I. to replace the original NAND chip with one that has a copy of that\ncontent. If the F.B.I. tried 10 passcodes to unlock the phone and failed, it\ncould then generate a new copy of the phone’s content and try another password\nguess.“It’s like trying to play the same level on Super Mario Brothers over\nand over again and just restoring from your saved game every time you kill\nMario,” said Jonathan Zdziarski, an iOS forensics expert.Newer iPhone models\nmay be less susceptible to NAND-mirroring because they have an upgraded chip\nknown as the A7, with a security processor called the Secure Enclave that has\na unique numerical key not known to the company and which is essential to the\nsecuring of information stored in the phone.Security vulnerabilities in Apple\nproducts have become increasingly prized by hackers in recent years, given the\nubiquity of the company’s mobile devices. Yet as interest has grown in\nattacking Apple’s hardware and software, the company’s own security teams have\nbeen in flux.Apple previously had two main security teams — a group called\nCore OS Security Engineering and a product security team. The product security\nteam included a privacy group that examined whether data was properly\nencrypted and anonymized, among other functions, according to three former\nApple employees. The product security team also had people who reacted to\nvulnerabilities found by people outside Apple, as well as a proactive team,\ncalled RedTeam, which worked to actively hack Apple products.Last year, the\nproduct security team was broken up and the privacy group began reporting to a\nnew manager, the former employees said. The rest of product security — the\nproactive and reactive pieces — was absorbed by the Core OS Security\nEngineering team, which itself experienced shifts.The leader of the Core OS\nSecurity Engineering team, Dallas DeAtley, left the security division last\nyear to work in a different part of Apple. Mr. DeAtley was one of the few\nemployees who over the years had taken care of government requests to extract\ndata from iPhones. Mr. DeAtley did not respond to requests for comment.A few\nother members of the team also departed. Others joined Apple as the company\nacquired a handful of security outfits last year, including LegbaCore, which\npreviously found and fixed flaws for Apple.Some of the departures had more to\ndo with market forces, the former Apple employees said. Security professionals\nare some of the most sought-after engineers in the technology sector.Whether\nApple’s security operation will ever obtain information about how the\ngovernment hacked into Mr. Farook’s iPhone remains unclear.It’s possible that\nthe government won’t say how it opened the iPhone because the method is\n“proprietary to the company that helped the F.B.I.,” said Stewart A. Baker, a\nlawyer at Steptoe \u0026amp; Johnson and the Department of Homeland Security’s\nfirst assistant secretary for policy.Within the security community,\nresearchers and professionals said they were incensed that they — and Apple —\nmay not find out how the F.B.I. was able to crack Mr. Farook’s iPhone.“There\nis very little debate that it is in everyone’s best interest that Apple find\nout about this vulnerability and everyone should be asking why that is not the\ncase,” said Alex Rice, the chief technology officer at HackerOne, a security\ncompany in San Francisco that helps coordinate vulnerability disclosure for\ncorporations.\n\n","title":"Apple’s New Challenge: Learning How the U.S. Cracked Its iPhone - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Apple's new challenge: Learning how the U.S. cracked its iPhone https://t.co/9xaw74lOO6","date":"Wed Mar 30 12:43:04 +0000 2016","favs":211,"id":{"$numberLong":"715157394318368768"},"retweets":161},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21Tj1RN"}

Dressed in pajamas and slippers, she stared at the charred rubble\npiled by firefighters at the base of her building.Speaking in Spanish, Ms.\nTubon, 27, who works in a restaurant and had lived in her apartment for three\nyears, said she fled with her 9-month-old son as the fire raged.

They took shelter in Ms.\nGuayllasca’s brother’s home.Ms. Guayllasca, a housekeeper, also spoke in\nSpanish, saying simply, “Very sad.”Early Wednesday morning, a fire chief\nguided Mr. Mayancela back into his home to salvage essentials. Ms. Guayllasca\nwas visibly anguished when he emerged carrying only a small duffel bag, a\nsmall plastic shopping bag, and a few items of clothing.The Red Cross met with\n19 families and registered 12 households, with 30 adults and 12 children, who\nwere in need of emergency housing.

All displaced residents were invited to meet\nwith Red Cross caseworkers in the coming days.Neighbors said they thought the\nfire broke out around 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, in the back of a storefront church on\nthe ground floor of one of the buildings.That church, the Redeemed Christian\nChurch of God Rose of Sharon Assembly, was reduced to a black cavity on\nWednesday morning.The church’s awning was one of the few things to survive,\nadvertising Tuesday bible study from 7 to 9 p.m. with the Revs. E.

He did not have time to grab his\ncats, Bandit and Nala, but he left a window open so they could escape.“The\nwhole street was bathed in this red light and black smoke,” he said. “It was\nlike an inferno.”His upstairs neighbor, Matthew Hughes, 27, a dog walker, also\nleft the building.“I at least thought enough to grab my jacket; by the time I\ngot outside there was too much smoke to get back inside,” he said. “I didn’t\nstick around to watch.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01495"},"content":"WASHINGTON — People newly insured under the Affordable Care Act were sicker,\nused more medical care and had higher medical costs than those who already had\ncoverage, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association said Tuesday in a new\nstudy of its policyholders.Because insurers’ premiums have to cover their\nmedical expenses, the new report helps explain why Blue Cross plans have\nsought, and insurance commissioners have approved, substantial rate increases\nin many states. Another round of rate review is about to begin, with insurers\ngenerally required to file rate requests for 2017 in the next two months.The\nfindings are noteworthy because Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans operate\nacross the country and have the largest share of the individual market in many\nstates, giving them an unrivaled source of claims data.In its report, the Blue\nCross and Blue Shield Association examined the use of medical services by\npeople who enrolled in its plans before and after major provisions of the\nAffordable Care Act took effect in 2014.One of those provisions essentially\nrequired insurers to offer coverage to people who had previously been denied\ncoverage because of their medical problems.People newly enrolled in individual\nBlue Cross health plans in 2014 and 2015 were found to have higher rates of\ncertain diseases and conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes,\ndepression, coronary artery disease, H.I.V. and hepatitis C, than people who\nalready had coverage.Diabetes was nearly twice as common among newly enrolled\nconsumers as among those previously enrolled, the report said. Hepatitis C was\nmore than twice as common, and H.I.V. was more than three times as common, it\nsaid.Likewise, the report said, consumers newly enrolled in Blue Cross plans\nin 2014-15 used more medical services than those who first bought coverage\nbefore 2014. Hospital admission rates were 84 percent higher, it said, and the\nfrequency of visits to doctors and other medical professionals was 26 percent\nhigher.Blue Cross said the study was based on claims for 4.7 million people.\nAbout one-third had been continuously enrolled since 2013; the others signed\nup in 2014 or 2015.Administration officials said the study showed the need for\nthe health care law, signed six years ago by President Obama. “It’s no\nsurprise that people who newly gained access to coverage under the Affordable\nCare Act needed health care,” said Ben Wakana, a spokesman for the Department\nof Health and Human Services. “That’s why they were locked out of coverage\nbefore.”Alissa Fox, a senior vice president for the Blue Cross and Blue Shield\nAssociation, said the differences in the prevalence of disease could narrow as\nnewly insured consumers receive care and medications to prevent and treat\nillnesses. Blue Cross companies have programs to help consumers “get healthy\nfaster and stay healthy longer,” she said.New insurance policies are often\nmore generous and comprehensive than individual policies sold before the\nhealth care law. The new policies must, for example, cover maternity care and\nmental health and substance abuse services.Some of the people buying insurance\nunder the health care law come from states’ “high-risk pools,” created\nspecifically for people with cancer, heart disease or other serious medical\nproblems.In rate requests filed with state regulators in the last two years,\nmany insurers said they had been aware of a pent-up demand for health care,\nbut had underestimated how much care their new customers would\nrequire.Researchers and health policy experts had predicted that people with\nhigher medical costs would enter the market in the first few years of the\npublic insurance exchanges. And the health care law provided special payments\nto insurers with unexpectedly high costs.Federal and state officials and\nconsumer advocates said they hoped that premiums would become more stable and\npredictable in the next couple of years.\n\n","title":"Newest Policyholders Under Health Law Are Sicker and Costlier to Insurers - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The newest Affordable Care Act policyholders are sicker and costlier, a study shows https://t.co/YALPIAiAuB https://t.co/yuupIcxzCw","date":"Wed Mar 30 11:08:10 +0000 2016","favs":210,"id":{"$numberLong":"715133511653580800"},"retweets":119},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1qi1pDr"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01496"},"content":"RIO DE JANEIRO — A crucial part of Brazil’s governing coalition withdrew\nsupport for President Dilma Rousseff on Tuesday, a move that could increase\nthe likelihood of her impeachment and deepen Brazil’s political and economic\ncrises.The leadership of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, or the PMDB,\nwhich has 68 members in the lower house of Congress, the most of any party,\nvoted to split with Ms. Rousseff’s Workers’ Party. That lays the groundwork\nfor more of its members to vote to impeach Ms. Rousseff. That will most likely\nhappen next month.Several of Ms. Rousseff’s ministers, who belong to the PMDB,\nwere asked by their party leaders to step down. They included the health\nminister, Marcelo Castro, who had been leading the country’s efforts to\naddress the Zika virus outbreak, and the civil aviation minister. The request\ncomes just months before the start of the Summer Olympics in Rio de\nJaneiro.Increased government paralysis is seen as one consequence.After the\nPMDB decision, Ms. Rousseff canceled a trip to Washington, where she was\nsupposed to participate in a nuclear security summit meeting this week.In\nBrasília, Romero Jucá, a senator who led Tuesday’s meeting, which lasted less\nthan five minutes, said, “Nobody in the country is authorized to serve in any\nfederal appointment in the name of the PMDB party.”While the PMDB includes\nboth longtime opponents and supporters of Ms. Rousseff, she cannot afford to\nlose any votes in Congress.After narrowly winning re-election in late 2014,\nMs. Rousseff has struggled to show leadership as bad economic news worsened,\nand an unprecedented corruption scandal widened involving the state oil\ncompany, Petrobras.While Ms. Rousseff has denied that her campaigns received\nany illegal money, or that she had any knowledge of corruption at Petrobras,\ncriticism of her grew this month after she named the former president, Luiz\nInácio Lula da Silva, to her cabinet. That appointment was seen in some\ncircles as a way to shield him from arrest by prosecutors who are\ninvestigating graft accusations against him.Subsequently, impeachment\nproceedings against Ms. Rousseff began in a committee in Brazil’s lower house.\nThat committee is expected to vote in April. The full house would then vote.\nIf it voted to impeach, and then the Senate voted to open proceedings, Ms.\nRousseff would be suspended for 180 days while she went on trial. Brazil’s\nvice president, Michel Temer, who leads the PMDB, but did not attend Tuesday’s\nmeeting, would then temporarily take over, with the ability to appoint\nministers and enact policy.Ms. Rousseff still has opportunities to thwart\nimpeachment, or at least delay the proceedings. If the full lower house voted\nto impeach, she could appeal to the high court and the Senate would have to\nawait a ruling before voting on whether it could commence its own impeachment\ndeliberations.Moreover, at any time between now and then, Ms. Rousseff also\nhas other legal remedies. “She can appeal at any moment she finds something\nlegally questionable occurring in the process,” said Brasílio Sallum Jr., a\nprofessor of sociology at the University of São Paulo and an expert in\nBrazil’s political processes.Her legal strategy aside, many question how the\nremoval of Ms. Rousseff, by itself, would help the country out of its\npredicaments.“Impeachment alone may not be the solution to the crisis,” said\nJoão Augusto de Castro Neves, the Latin America regional director of the\nEurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm.That is largely because many\nother leaders, particularly in the PMDB, have been implicated in the Petrobras\ninvestigation. While Mr. Temer has not been implicated, he would be vulnerable\nto political fallout from problems faced by his colleagues.It is also unclear\nhow much public support he has. His approval ratings are not much higher than\nMs. Rousseff’s.“All of these scenarios — one in which she survives, the other\none in which Temer takes over, and the new elections scenario — they all point\nto very tough policy making in the next year or two,” Mr. Castro Neves said.He\nforesaw “governments that are relatively weak or won’t have enough political\ncapital to do everything that needs to be done to fix the economy.”It is\nunclear how much public support the PMDB will have. Following the vote on\nTuesday, Marina Silva, a longtime critic of Ms. Rousseff, denounced the PMDB\nfor its move, saying it was “equally responsible” for the country’s political\nand economic crisis.The party is widely viewed as one that stands for no\nprinciples or ideology except staying in power. It does not field candidates\nin presidential elections but rather looks to play a decisive role in helping\nthe winner.It has long been an irritant to both Ms. Rousseff and her\npredecessor, Mr. da Silva.State Department officials have taken note. In a\n2004 cable, made available by WikiLeaks, American diplomats observed that “the\nPMDB has never pretended to be more than a high-maintenance ally-of-\nconvenience whose constant sniping often exposes coalition fissures.”Whether\nthe PMDB leadership’s decision to abandon Ms. Rousseff will prove politically\nexpedient remains unclear. Some prominent members have sharply criticized\nit.On Tuesday, Brazil’s minister of agriculture, Kátia Abreu, a PMDB member,\ndefended Ms. Rousseff in an interview with Globo Rural.Ms. Abreu said that she\nthought what was happening to Ms. Rousseff was unmerited and that impeachment\nwould be “traumatic” for the country.\n\n","title":"Dilma Rousseff Loses Support From Key Part of Brazilian Coalition - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Dilma Rousseff Loses Support From Key Part of Brazilian Coalition https://t.co/kk0KzVJTSl","date":"Wed Mar 30 11:04:40 +0000 2016","favs":135,"id":{"$numberLong":"715132630203830272"},"retweets":134},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21TaPAX"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01497"},"content":"It was New York City’s first new subway station in a quarter century, and\nofficials and riders marked the opening of the Hudson Yards station in\nSeptember with much fanfare.But less than six months later, riders began to\nnotice water leaking from above. Puddles appeared on the floor. Icicles\ndangled from the ceiling.At a meeting last week, board members demanded to\nknow how the Metropolitan Transportation Authority could have spent $2.4\nbillion on a project that leaks.In fact, leaks had plagued the station on the\nFar West Side of Manhattan for years while it was under construction. As the\ntransit agency investigates what exactly went wrong, documents from a\ncontinuing legal dispute among the site’s contractors reveal early concerns\nabout how the waterproofing system was built and the type of concrete that was\nused.The main contractor, Yonkers Contracting Company, has blamed flaws in\nshotcrete, a spray-on concrete that lines the waterproofing system. The\nconcrete was filled with “voids” or spaces, according to a 2014 lawsuit the\ncompany filed against two subcontractors on the project.But a 2011 letter that\nwas sent to Yonkers Contracting discouraged the use of shotcrete because it\ncould increase the potential for leaks. The letter, which was obtained by The\nNew York Times, was sent from Cetco Building Materials to KJC Waterproofing,\nthe subcontractor that installed the waterproofing system.KJC Waterproofing\nforwarded the letter to Yonkers Contracting, according to a deposition from\nthe lawsuit. It is unclear whether the letter was sent to the transportation\nauthority.The transit agency halted construction at the station in 2013 after\nofficials found “significant” leaks there. The agency issued a stop-work\norder, citing the use of shotcrete on overhead arches above the escalators and\nnoting it had not been specified in the design.Asked last week whether the\nleaks were tied to the spray-on concrete, the authority’s chairman, Thomas F.\nPrendergast, said an investigation by an independent engineer would examine\nthe issue.“It is essential that we let the world know that conditions like\nthat are unacceptable for a project of that significance and that importance\nto the City of New York,” Mr. Prendergast told the board last Wednesday.For\nnow, the leaks continue at the Hudson Yards subway station. Yonkers\nContracting will pay $3 million for a different subcontractor to make what the\nauthority hopes will be permanent repairs, the agency said.At the same time,\nthe authority is facing a lawsuit from a subway rider who said she and her\nmother fell down an escalator at the station last month after moving to avoid\nwater dripping from above. Meng He, 29, who lives near the station, said the\nwomen felt drops hitting their heads as they rode the escalator up to the\nticket-booth area. Her mother shifted her body to the side, letting go of the\nhandrail and falling back into her daughter, Ms. He said.“I tried to push her\nback up, but there was too much momentum, and we went tumbling down,” she\nsaid.Ms. He says she injured her right foot and ankle and has had to use\ncrutches. Her lawyer, Robert W. Georges, notified the authority that she\nplanned to sue, claiming it should have fixed the hazardous conditions at the\nstation.At the authority’s board meeting last week, Michael Horodniceanu, the\npresident of capital construction at the agency, said officials had known\nabout the leaks since 2012. Officials thought the leaks were fixed, he said,\nbut they kept reappearing. Despite the problems, Mr. Horodniceanu said the\nstation was safe.After the authority halted construction at the station in\nsummer 2013, it allowed work to start again in December 2013. The authority\nsaid the station would open by summer 2014, though it did not actually open\nuntil September 2015.The authority has been criticized for repeated delays and\ncost overruns on major projects like the Fulton Center transportation hub,\nwhich opened in 2014, and East Side Access, a plan to bring the Long Island\nRail Road to Grand Central Terminal.Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the\nconservative-leaning Manhattan Institute, said the leak problems had hurt the\nagency’s credibility.“This is their big marquee project, and the fact that\nthey can’t have it open and looking good a few months later doesn’t speak well\nto their ability to do these things,” Ms. Gelinas said.The contractors that\nworked on the station continue to blame one another for the leaks. Yonkers\nContracting sued Superior Gunite, the subcontractor that installed the\nshotcrete, and KJC Waterproofing for breach of contract and negligence. The\nsubcontractors have sued Yonkers Contracting for not paying them.Heather\nCuffel, a spokeswoman for Yonkers Contracting, said the company was working\nwith the authority to resolve the problems and declined to comment on the\nlawsuits.Frank Townsend, the East Coast area manager for Superior Gunite, said\nin a statement that shotcrete was an appropriate material for the project and\nthat it was commonly used in underground structures across the country. Mr.\nTownsend said the leaks were caused by a “failure of the waterproofing\nmembrane,” which the company did not provide or install.“Superior Gunite\nperformed the shotcrete work on the project,” he said, “and our work was\nperformed properly.”Lawyers for KJC Waterproofing said in a statement that any\ndamage to the waterproofing system happened after it was installed. Workers\nwho later applied the shotcrete or installed rebar at the site could have\ndamaged the system, the lawyers said.“KJC performed its contract properly,”\nthe statement said, “and its work was accepted by both Yonkers and the M.T.A.\nafter extensive testing.”\n\n","title":"$2.4 Billion Subway Stop Was Leaking Before It Opened - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"It was NYC's first new subway station in a quarter century.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01498"},"content":"HONG KONG — The Apple iPhone transformed the technology industry by\npopularizing the smartphone and blazing a path to a mobile future. But to do\nit, the company needed an important ally: a penny-pinching Taiwan-based\nfactory operator named Foxconn.Employing hundreds of thousands of workers at\nvast facilities in mainland China, Foxconn figured out a way to assemble the\niPhone at a cost low enough that middle-class Americans could afford it. The\nbusiness offered low profit margins, but the work buffed Foxconn’s financial\nresults and cemented its status as the world’s largest maker of hardware for\ncompanies like Apple and Sony.Those relationships are now shifting — and\nFoxconn is betting heavily to keep up.On Wednesday, Foxconn said it had struck\na deal to acquire control of the Japanese screen maker Sharp for $3.5 billion,\nafter weeks of negotiations and high-profile setbacks.The deal, for a 66\npercent stake in Sharp, is intended to make Foxconn a more attractive partner\nfor Apple. The American technology company uses Sharp screens, which could\ngive Foxconn added leverage in dealings between the two.The screen is an\nespecially lucrative piece of the smartphone, costing as much as $54 each,\naccording to estimates by the research firm IHS. Sharp provides roughly 25\npercent of the iPhone displays, IHS said.Still, the Sharp purchase will saddle\nFoxconn with an ailing business that will take considerable money and effort\nto turn around, some analysts say. Reflecting those problems, the purchase\nprice is $2 billion lower than a deal the two sides struck just last month,\nafter Sharp disclosed the potential for costly problems — nearly $3 billion in\npotential liabilities — down the road.But Apple has been diversifying its\nsupply chain, giving some production contracts to other assemblers and\ncomponent makers. And Foxconn is grappling with China’s rising labor costs and\na slowdown in the global smartphone market.The deal highlights the huge\npressure that the industry’s shifting dynamics are placing on Foxconn.“On the\none hand, you can see why Foxconn is trying to do it. It’s not clear the\neconomics make sense, but it’s that they need to control more and more of the\nsupply chain,” said Willy C. Shih, a professor at Harvard Business School. He\nnoted that Apple might soon switch to screens made by other producers.The deal\nfollows months of back-and-forth talks about the terms, including the surprise\ndisclosure last month of billions of dollars’ worth of potential problems on\nSharp’s books. Acknowledging Sharp’s poor performance, Terry Gou, Foxconn’s\nfounder and chairman, said in the news release that he was “confident that we\nwill unlock Sharp’s true potential.”The deal is a return to form for Foxconn —\nformally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry — in its emphasis on scale. The\ncompany has been looking in recent years for ways to further cut costs,\nincluding investment in automation. It has also expanded into businesses\npotentially more lucrative than unskilled-work manufacturing, opening\nfactories producing new technology like batteries for electric cars. It even\ncreated incubators to help hardware start-ups.Foxconn, most of whose factories\nare in China, is emblematic of the challenges facing the Chinese economy at\nlarge. Even while it tries to maintain the huge scale and efficiency of its\nproduction base, it is trying to climb the value chain to find new, more\nprofitable streams of revenue.Near Beijing, Foxconn operates a hardware\nincubator called Innoconn, which helps start-ups with production management\nwhile looking for investment targets.Liu Haoyang, a founder of Noitom, a\ncompany that makes motion-capture sensors and hardware, said Foxconn had\napproached Noitom when it was seeking crowdfunding for a sample product in\n2014. Ultimately, Foxconn gave Noitom advice, and it now helps Noitom produce,\nMr. Liu said.“They make parts of high complexity for us,” he said. “Average\nfactories aren’t able to make this type of thing, never mind in small\nbatches.”Foxconn, founded in Taiwan as a maker of television knobs in 1974 by\nMr. Gou, became a company with more than $100 billion in annual revenue by\nmaking things for other companies. Starting in the 1990s, as orders poured in\nto make personal computers, Mr. Gou built new and larger factories in China,\nculminating in the city-size Longhua plant in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong.At the\nLonghua complex, Foxconn coordinates more than 100,000 workers assembling\ndevices — including the iPhone — in daily and nightly shifts, and the feeding,\nclothing and planning for the turnover of workers are gargantuan challenges.\nThe company developed recreation facilities for the campus and designed a\nkitchen able to churn out the huge amounts of food necessary to feed tens of\nthousands of workers each day.A marvel of modern manufacturing, the Longhua\nplant is the most extreme example of Foxconn’s philosophy of maximizing\nefficiency through enormous scale, though in some ways the Longhua plant has\nproved too large. It was there in 2010 that a series of worker suicides drew\ninternational scrutiny from workers’ rights groups and the news media. The\ncompany put nets on the sides of buildings to catch would-be jumpers. On many\nbuildings the nets still sag today.Foxconn’s sales growth has slowed to\nsingle-digit percentages in the last two years from the double-digit growth it\nposted in the past, although profit growth has picked up recently, thanks in\npart to consumers buying bigger, more expensive phones with bigger\nscreens.While Foxconn’s revenue has been padded by booming orders for less-\nexpensive Chinese-branded smartphones, increased competition from China-based\nsuppliers has been a concern highlighted by analysts. Also, Apple, as part of\nits efforts to diversify its supply chain, has given orders for iPhone\nassembly to Pegatron, another Taiwan-based contract manufacturer, which\noperates a huge factory near Shanghai.Foxconn’s previous takeovers of screen\nmakers have not played out well. In 2010, it took over a Taiwan screen maker,\nChimei Innolux, for nearly $10 billion; analysts say the acquisition has\nfailed to produce the efficiencies and profitability hoped for.In Sharp,\nFoxconn picks up screen-making operations that have long been unprofitable and\ncostlier than those of its rivals in China. Alberto Moel, an analyst at\nSanford C. Bernstein, said the Sharp acquisition would probably distract\nFoxconn from more important ventures, while also proving difficult to\nintegrate and turn into a profitable business.“Terry Gou is going to have to\ndo some serious restructuring, spinouts, carve-outs, reduced head counts,\ncentralizing things, and he’ll have to do it at a distance, across a sea with\nmanagement he doesn’t really control,” Mr. Moel said. “It won’t be easy.”\n\n","title":"To Woo Apple, Foxconn Bets $3.5 Billion on Sharp - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesbusiness: Foxconn has finally sealed a deal to take over a majority of Sharp for $3.5 billion, @paulmozur reports. https://t.co/…","date":"Wed Mar 30 10:10:47 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715119069821841408"},"retweets":40},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PF4KBd"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0149a"},"content":"PARIS — The first airplane hijackings occurred not long after international\nair travel became commonplace. In those days, most hijackers were seeking\nrefuge or riches, not mass murder or global attention for a radical cause.\nTerrorist hijackings were a later development, but after reaching a grim apex\non Sept. 11, 2001, they have become less and less common.The motivations of\nthe man arrested in Cyprus on Tuesday after he hijacked an Egyptian airliner\nremain unclear. But when the most recent threats to commercial air travel have\ntaken the form of bombings, missile strikes or rogue pilots, an attempt to\ncommandeer a flight while sparing the aircraft — and the lives of everyone\naboard — came as a surprise to many observers conditioned to expect\ndisaster.It was not so during the Cold War, when hijackings were often\ndesperate attempts at escape across the Iron Curtain. In 1953, for example,\nMira Slovak, a Czechoslovak airline pilot, was flying a DC-3 on a domestic\nroute with 25 passengers on board when he suddenly diverted the plane to\nFrankfurt and requested political asylum. His daring escape was emulated by\ndozens of others through the early 1970s, including many who commandeered\nAmerican flights to reach Cuba.Jetliners also became attractive targets for\nescaped criminals, who used the planes and their passengers as leverage in\nransom negotiations. Sometimes they even got away with it.In the most storied\ncase, a man who became known as D. B. Cooper boarded a plane in Portland,\nOre., in 1971, armed with a bomb. After forcing the flight to land in Seattle,\nhe released the passengers in exchange for $200,000 and a parachute, and\nordered the crew to take off again. Once in the air, he leapt from the plane\nwith his bag of cash and was never seen again.By the mid-1970s, at least 150\nplanes had been “skyjacked” in the United States alone, and radical groups in\nthe Middle East had turned to hijackings as a way to seize the spotlight. In\n1968, hijackers seized an El Al flight to Tel Aviv from Rome and forced it to\nland in Algiers. They held 22 hostages. After more than a month, the final 12\nwere released, and only after a boycott by international pilots.In 1970,\nPalestinian militants hijacked five planes — four bound for New York, one for\nLondon — to demand the release of activists imprisoned by Israel. Three of the\nplanes were forced to land at Dawson’s Field, a former British Air Force base\nin a remote area of Jordan, while a fourth was diverted to Egypt. The crew on\nthe fifth plane — an El Al flight to New York from Amsterdam — overcame the\nhijackers on board and made an emergency landing in London.“That was the first\nmajor terrorist hijacking attempt that captured the media’s attention,” said\nNorman Shanks, a consultant and former manager of airport security at Heathrow\nAirport near London. “They were not intent on killing people. It was simply a\nway to get publicity.”It was not until Dawson’s Field, Mr. Shanks said, that\nthe international aviation community began to take coordinated action to\nprevent hijackings. And it was only in the late 1970s that the International\nCivil Aviation Organization, an arm of the United Nations, began requiring\nthat passengers pass through metal detectors and that hand luggage be X-rayed\nbefore boarding.Those steps were meant mainly to stop people from spiriting a\nmetal weapon like a gun, knife or grenade on board, Mr. Shanks said, “but\nthere was also a misguided belief that we could find bombs this way,\ntoo.”After a bomb brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in\n1988, airports began to introduce additional screening systems to detect\nexplosives.Those security measures significantly reduced the number of\nhijackings but did not eliminate the risk completely. And in many countries,\nthe enhanced screening procedures were used only for international flights,\nleaving domestic flights more vulnerable.That weakness was exploited on Sept.\n11, 2001, when four domestic United States flights were commandeered by\nmembers of Al Qaeda wielding box cutters — which were not prohibited on\nflights in the country at the time.The Sept. 11 attacks prompted a new wave of\ntighter precautions. Airport security and screening in the United States were\ncentralized under the new Department of Homeland Security. Airlines trained\ntheir crews to be more vigilant about violent or unruly passengers and to deal\nwith them more effectively. Cockpit doors were reinforced and kept locked in\nflight.Those steps and others have made hijacking a higher-risk proposition\nover the past 15 years, said Philip Baum, the managing director of Green\nLight, an aviation security consulting firm in London, and the author of a\nrecently published history of aircraft hijackings and bombings.“There has\ndefinitely been a change of mind-set,” Mr. Baum said. “Since Sept. 11, they\nnow can expect that the response from aircrew and passengers might be far more\naggressive.”Hijackings still occur, however — and the hijackers are not always\npassengers. In 2000, a Saudi Arabian Airlines flight to London from Jidda was\nhijacked by two airport guards, both Saudi citizens, who forced the pilots to\ndivert the plane to Baghdad. In 2014, the co-pilot of an Ethiopian Airlines\njet locked the captain out of the cockpit during a flight to Rome from Addis\nAbaba and diverted the plane to Geneva, where he requested asylum.Analysts say\nthat enough doubt remains about the thoroughness of security at some airports\nthat aircrews cannot confidently call a would-be hijacker’s bluff about having\na weapon.“Today you can hijack an aircraft with just words,” said Mr. Shanks,\nthe former Heathrow security manager. “All it takes is that uncertainty.”\n\n","title":"Why Airline Hijackings Became Relatively Rare - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Why airline hijackings became relatively rare https://t.co/pStqR7Q5oH","date":"Wed Mar 30 09:13:16 +0000 2016","favs":114,"id":{"$numberLong":"715104597858193408"},"retweets":68},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PDTAN8"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0149b"},"content":"OSLO — World sport resembles a failed state.Soccer’s ruling body offers\nindictments and perp walks, and Qatar stands exposed for using something akin\nto slave labor to build stadiums for the 2022 World Cup. Brazil — plagued by a\nsevere recession, corruption and Zika, a scary new virus — will host an\nobscenely expensive Summer Olympics.Fifteen months ago, a German\ndocumentarian, Hajo Seppelt, in “The Secrets of Doping: How Russia Makes Its\nWinners,” unveiled a world of athletic doping in track and field. Russian\nathletes spoke of extortion, thuggery and the state-sponsored doping of “99\npercent” of athletes.The World Anti-Doping Agency, which knew of these\nallegations for years and did nothing, was forced into action. Investigators\nfound sweeping corruption in track and field, and not just in Russia. The\nInternational Olympic Committee, a body happiest when somnolent and counting\nits cash, felt compelled to threaten Russia with suspension from the\nOlympics.Now a new question arises: Will the antidoping agency turn its\ninvestigative beams on winter sport, where the rot is probably just as\npervasive?That prospect appears not to thrill Sir Craig Reedie, the longtime\npresident of the antidoping agency. He notes that the agency has suspended the\nMoscow lab and issued lifetime bans for a few officials. He also doles out\nimprobable compliments to corruption-tainted Russian sports officials even as\nhe issues throat-clearing statements about needing more evidence of Russian\ndoping.“If concrete evidence comes to light,” he said recently, “and the\nevidence warrants further investigation, I will not hesitate to act.”Once,\nthis sort of response would have left reform stillborn. Executives and\ncoaches, in the West no less than the East, viewed revelations of doping as a\nthreat to profits and ratings.But world-class athletes are turning a withering\nfire on sports’ ruling bodies. WADA, they insist, must clean out the winter\nstables. “The clean athletes of the world feel this is the moment of truth,”\nBeckie Scott, an Olympic gold medal cross-country skier, said. “So WADA, are\nyou a credible organization, or not?”I flew to Norway for the world\nchampionships in biathlon, which is the most televised winter sport in Europe\nand Russia, to observe the front lines of this struggle between athletes and\nreformers, and the feckless executives of sport.**Biathlon’s Shadow**The\ncross-country skiers sweep downhill through a mist of seemingly perpetual\nsnow, their knees bent low, heads pointed forward like the prows of ships.\nTens of thousands of Norwegian fans, who have stood in 25-degree temperatures\ngroup-singing oldies rock hits and waving grinding wooden noisemakers, cheer\nfor Norwegians and foreign competitors alike.The skiers lean sharply to the\nright at the bottom of the hill, and pull target rifles off their backs. Their\nchests heaving, they steady their arms and take aim at shooting targets 50\nmeters away.Each target hit is met with a roar of approval, each miss with a\ngroan. Errant shooters embark on time-eating penalty loops while the sure\nshots sprint off on another exhausting loop.This is biathlon, a thrilling\nsport that draws on the endurance needed to cross-country ski along steep\ntracks and the idiosyncratic Zen needed to target shoot while gasping for air.\nTo watch athletes glide past the finish line after a 20-kilometer race and\nfall to their hands and knees, steam rising off their bodies like so many\ngeysers, is to harbor no doubt about their skill and effort.Biathlon is also\nshadowed by doping.Endurance is central to this sport, and the ability to pump\nextra oxygen to one’s blood is as attractive as adding high-test gasoline to a\nracing car. A young Russian biathlete recently tested positive for meldonium,\nthe same drug that could lead to a lengthy suspension for the tennis star\nMaria Sharapova after she admitted using it.Russians appear to be among the\nworst and perhaps the most systemic dopers. By no means, however, are they the\nsole offenders. Six Austrian cross-country skiers and biathletes were caught\ndoping at the Olympics in Turin in 2006 and barred for life. Swedes, Latvians,\nPoles and Germans were caught at the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014. In\n1987, a top American Nordic-combined skier, Kerry Lynch, was caught blood-\ndoping with the approval of his coach, Jim Page.Page was suspended but later\nbecame a managing director at the United States Olympic Committee.Gottlieb\nTaschler, an Italian who still sits on the board of the international biathlon\nunion, stands accused in Italy of obtaining EPO, an illegal blood oxygen\nagent, for his own son, an aspiring biathlete. (Taschler appears to have made\na family peace with doping; his daughter is married to a well-known Austrian\ncross-country skier who was busted for doping in the middle of the 2014\nOlympics.)Early one morning, I talked of sport and doping with one of the\nbetter American biathletes, Lowell Bailey. We sat in a hotel on Holmenkollen,\nthe large ski-jumping hill that rises over Oslo and its glittering fjord. In a\nfew minutes, Bailey would embark on his circuit of grueling training loops.A\nlithe athlete and a musician skilled on the mandolin and guitar, Bailey was\nraised in the mountains and dells of the Adirondacks in New York and has skied\nbiathlon for a decade. He finds poetry in its intricacies.Years back, the\nAmerican team hired a well-regarded Swedish coach. Bailey and his friend Tim\nBurke, perhaps the best American biathlete, looked at the coach’s training\nregimen, with the many hours of grueling up-and-downs. They thought: This is\ninsane.Then they shrugged and gave it a go.“We had the realization that to\ncompete with the world’s best, you have to train like they do, think like they\ndo and approach your life in biathlon like they do,” he says. “It was life-\nchanging.”I ask about doping. He recognizes that a shadow of doubt hangs\nacross all of those who participate in winter sports, no less than summer. Can\nhe spot an athlete who has doped? He nods tentatively; sometimes. There was a\nmarvelous German-Spanish cross-country skier in 2002, Johann Mühlegg. Bailey\nremembers watching him race in the Winter Olympics. The skier took the\nsteepest hills like a pile driver.“In his last climb of the 30K, I thought:\nThis isn’t possible,” Bailey says. “When he tested positive, no surprise. I\nsaw that coming.”More often, the clues are less obvious. “It’s disorienting,”\nBailey says. “You watch a great athletic feat and wonder if other forces are\nat work.”Bailey serves on the athletic advisory committee for the\nInternational Biathlon Union; he wants lifetime bans for individual athletes\nand far bigger fines for national sports federations. No American biathlete\nhas ever tested positive for doping, which does not entirely erase the smudge\nof doubt.Last year, International Biathlon fined Russia $106,000 because three\ntop biathletes had tested dirty. That amount, Bailey noted, is perhaps 1\npercent of Russia’s budget for biathlon.He shakes his head.“This is my career,\nmy life, I’m living this 24 hours a day,” he says. “As an athlete, the idea\nthat I’m competing on a level playing field sustains me.“Are we supposed to\nsay, ‘Oh well, that’s just the way it is?’” He looks up. “That’s offensive to\nme on a very, very personal level.”Biathlon, like so many Olympic pursuits, is\nat war with itself. It has produced insistent voices for reform, like the\nCanadian doctor James Carrabre, who is on the board of international biathlon,\nand Max Cobb, president of the U.S. Biathlon Association. Both have pushed for\nmore rigorous tests and the use of biological passports, which allow\nscientists to monitor individual blood levels. They also want WADA to launch a\nfull investigation.“To allow accusations of massive, state-supported doping\nfraud to go uninvestigated sends a signal that doping is just part of a game\nrather than a plague,” Cobb told me.Then there is Anders Besseberg, a\nNorwegian who has ruled as president of the International Biathlon Union since\n1992. He has fielded congratulatory phone calls from President Vladimir V.\nPutin of Russia. Ask about corruption at the Russian labs, and he talks as if\nthe problem is the overheated imaginations of reformers.“I must say that I’ll\nbe very surprised if one laboratory has managed to cheat.”Ah, Anders. You must\nsteel yourself better against surprise.Investigators for the World Anti-Doping\nAgency found nothing to like about those Russian labs. “The Moscow laboratory\nis not operationally independent from ... the Ministry of Sport,” the report\nstated. “Its impartiality, judgment and integrity were compromised by” the\nsecret police who walk the halls and intimidate athletes and doctors.It is too\neasy to fall into cynicism’s ditch and ignore the thousands of world-class\nathletes who compete clean. Scott, chairwoman of the athlete committee for the\nWorld Anti-Doping Agency, takes this war personally. A Canadian cross-country\nskier, she finished third behind two Russian athletes in the five-kilometer\npursuit at the Salt Lake Olympics in 2002. She took home a bronze medal.A year\nlater, investigators proved that the silver medal winner had tested positive\nbefore the Olympics for darbepoetin, which boosts the production of the red\nblood cells that trundle oxygen to the muscles. The silver medal was given to\nScott in a small ceremony.The gold medal winner, too, had tested positive for\ndarbepoetin, but that legal battle was epic. The International Olympic\nCommittee argued, bizarrely, that floodgates of litigation would open if it\nawarded the gold to Scott. A court overruled the I.O.C. and, at a ceremony in\nVancouver in June 2004, Scott, in tears, held aloft her gold medal.“It was a\nvery powerful moment, and a little bittersweet,” she recalled.Scott and Sarah\nKonrad, a former American biathlete and athlete representative to the United\nStates Olympic Committee, have written tough letters to Reedie, tossing down\nthe gauntlet. “The athletes of the world are watching and waiting,” Konrad\nwarned.Reedie replied with a letter caught in the no-man’s land between\nvaguely conciliatory and condescending. He stated that he alone would decide,\nin due time and if new allegations came forward, if further investigation was\nneeded. (He apparently missed the considerable pile of evidence about winter\nsports compiled by his own investigators.)“At the end of the day, I don’t\nthink anybody in Russia is happy with what happened,” Reedie said recently in\nSwitzerland. “I’m actually quite pleased with the reaction we’ve had from\nRussia.”This was the sound of a man doubling down on willful\nblindness.**Russian Misbehavior**The doping agency report, the documentaries\nand interviews with federation officials depict Russian sports as a hybrid of\na spy novel and a mafia tell-all.No nation has poured more money than Russia\ninto winter sports, and it fiercely protects its traditional bastions in\nbiathlon and cross-country skiing. The government recruits wealthy businessmen\nto oversee the various winter sports, and few expenses are spared, from grand\nhotels to exercise bikes on the road to large coaching staffs. And then\nthere’s the question of chemistry: For decades, the doping agency report\nnoted, the Russians have maintained a secret lab at the Ministry of Sport\ndedicated to the development of “undetectable” drugs.Carrabre, the\nInternational Biathlon Union reformer and doctor, spoke of the challenge of\ndetective work in this environment. In 2009, he suspected Russians biathletes\nwere doping with EPO, which is a synthetic cousin of a hormone that promotes\nthe production of red blood cells. “They were all but laughing at us, and\ntelling us we’d never catch them,” he said.He obtained blood samples from the\nathletes and sought out an outside laboratory. Upon painstaking inspection,\ntechnicians detected the subtlest of structural anomalies, a difference that\nunequivocally pointed to cheating.Holy cow, Carrabre said, “we had ourselves a\nnew form of EPO.”The pressure on Russian athletes to dope is immense. Athletes\nwho refuse to dope are told that they risk getting left off national teams and\ndenied access to the best coaches. Those who play along get advance notice of\ntests. If urine samples come back dirty, athletes can pay bribes and results\ndisappear.World doping agency investigators told the director of the main\nMoscow laboratory to preserve 1,400 urine samples from the Sochi Olympics. The\ndirector destroyed them.“In other countries, it’s rogue athletes,” Cobb, the\npresident of U.S. Biathlon, told me. “Here, it’s a rogue state\napparatus.”There are darker shades. Alexander Tikhonov was a former gold medal\nbiathlete and a chief of Russia’s federation. A few years ago, he ran for the\npresidency of the international union. Alas, Tikhonov had an extracurricular\nproblem: He had been found guilty of paying $180,000 to persuade men to murder\na local governor.He was sentenced to three years but immediately released\nunder an amnesty law passed by the Russian parliament. Candidate Tikhonov ran\nas an unlikely reformer, promising to sweep out corruption. “What else was he\nsupposed to say?” noted Carrabre, who ran against Tikhonov. “It’s difficult to\nrun when you’ve been convicted of planning a murder.”Mikhail D. Prokhorov, who\nowns the Brooklyn Nets, succeeded Tikhonov as president of Russian Biathlon\nand has poured many millions of dollars into the sport. He proclaimed himself\nincurious about his predecessor’s conviction. “I’m not a judge. I’m not a\nprosecutor,” he said in 2010. “I don’t know the details.”Mortality is a hound\nchasing on the heels of housecleaning in Russia. A former general director of\nthe much-investigated Russia Anti-Doping Agency, or Rusada, died unexpectedly\nin early February. The cause remains unknown.A recent chief of Rusada, Nikita\nKamayev, resigned under pressure in November. A few weeks later, he sent an\nemail to a reporter at The Times of London. “I want to write a book about the\ntrue story of sport pharmacology and doping since 1987 while being a young\nscientist working in a secret lab in the U.S.S.R. Institute of Sport\nMedicine,” he wrote. “I have information and facts that have never been\nknown.”In mid-February, Kamayev, 52, died after cross-country skiing,\nallegedly of a heart attack. “It’s a very unexpected death,” Vitaly Mutko,\nRussian’s minister of sport, noted.I’m sure it was.This perhaps underlines why\nthe Russian whistle-blowers, a husband and wife, who told all to the German\ndocumentary crew, remain in hiding in Western Europe. (WADA has agreed to help\nunderwrite the couple’s hidden exile.)Meanwhile, Russia has prospered on the\nsnowy fields of sport. In the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010, the Russians\nclaimed only three gold medals. At Sochi in 2014, they won 13 gold medals. In\nthe final race of that Olympics, the 50-kilometer cross-country race, three\nmidlevel Russian athletes unexpectedly took the hat trick, winning the gold,\nsilver and bronze medals.That was brilliant.**Conflicting Outlooks**I asked a\nspokesman for WADA about the investigative outlook, as the antidoping agency\nand the I.O.C. consider whether to ban Russia from the Summer Olympics. Just\nlast week, The Times of London reported on the case of Sergei Portugalov. He\nis a prominent Russian doctor who was chief of the Russian Athletic\nFederation’s Medical Commission. WADA accused him of personally injecting\nathletes and levied a lifetime ban on him. Now, he is reported to be working\nwith Russia’s Olympic swimmers; for the best results, The Times of London has\nreported, he recommended the swimmers embrace a rigorous doping program.As\nwith winter sports, the world antidoping agency so far has declined to start\nan investigation of swimming.The WADA spokesman emailed me Reedie’s statement\nin Switzerland: “If seemingly solid allegations/intelligence is brought\nforward to WADA, and/or by whistle-blowers, then we would seriously evaluate\nthe need for further investigations.”That is a fierce watchdog.On my last\nmorning in Oslo, I sat atop that mountain with Susan Dunklee, a 30-year-old\nwho came to biathlon after a career as an all-American cross-country skier at\nDartmouth. Her material rewards are small. “A lot of it for me is cultivating\nmy hunger,” she says, “and my joy.”She had watched that German documentary,\nand read the doping agency reports, and felt that shadow creeping over all of\nthem.“I’ve been shocked to learn that the system is not in place to enforce a\ngenuine competition,” she says. “We need to strongly encourage WADA to grow\nteeth.”That doesn’t seem to be a lot to ask.\n\n","title":"Winter Sports Athletes Ask for the Doping Spotlight - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @powellnyt: Pervasive Doping in Track Only the Half of It.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0149c"},"content":"When Donald Trump threatened to “break” the North American Free Trade\nAgreement, auto industry workers offered up some of the loudest cheers.Mr.\nTrump easily won the Republican primary in Michigan this month. The state,\nhome base for the American auto industry, also delivered an upset victory to\nBernie Sanders, the Democratic anti-Nafta standard-bearer.But the autoworkers’\nanimosity is aiming at the wrong target. There are still more than 800,000\njobs in the American auto sector. And there is a good case to be made that\nwithout Nafta, there might not be much left of Detroit at all.“Without the\nability to move lower-wage jobs to Mexico we would have lost the whole\nindustry,” said Gordon Hanson of the University of California, San Diego, who\nhas been studying the impact of Nafta on industries and workers since its\ninception more than two decades ago.Even in the narrowest sense — to protect\njobs in car assembly plants — a wall of tariffs against America’s southern\nneighbor would probably do more harm than good.To be sure, Rust Belt voters\ndrawn to Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders are not wrong to be angry. Trade and the\ndeals to reduce trade barriers often threaten the livelihood of workers in the\nindustries exposed most directly to foreign competition.In the home of the\nonce proud Big Three carmakers, which virtually owned the American car market\nthrough most of the 20th century, the issue is personal. Nafta put them in\ndirect competition with Mexican workers earning little more than one-fifth of\ntheir compensation.The American trade deficit in autos and parts tripled in\nthe two decades after the trade deal struck with Mexico and Canada took effect\nin 1994, to about $130 billion in 2013. The industry lost 350,000 jobs, or\nabout a third of its workers, over the period.“It was a massive shift in a\nflagship industry,” said Thea Lee, deputy chief of staff of the\nA.F.L.-C.I.O.Workers, she said, were promised one thing but got another. “One\nthing you need to understand about why working-class people are so cynical\nabout these trade agreements,” Ms. Lee said, “is that every time we had these\nbig debates, and they heard these optimistic projections and it never turned\nout the way they were told it would be.”Still, for all the brickbats thrown at\nit, the  Nafta trade deal itself had a relatively modest impact, most studies\nagree. For one thing, the Mexican economy is still tiny compared with that of\nthe United States and its trade surplus has remained relatively small.China,\nwhere workers were even cheaper and which has attracted far more foreign\ninvestment in manufacturing, ultimately bumped Mexico out of many American\nmarkets after Beijing entered the World Trade Organization in 2001.Nafta is\noften blamed for dynamics that are not of its making. The surge of Mexican\nexports in the 1990s was propelled by a sharp devaluation of the peso, which\nset off the so-called Tequila Crisis. The wave of immigration from Mexico into\nthe United States, which lasted until 2005, was driven by a decline in\ngovernment subsidies to farmers and an economic collapse that occurred just as\nmillions of young Mexicans were entering their late teens and were desperate\nfor jobs.Luis Rubio, who heads the Center of Research for Development in\nMexico City — known as CIDAC for its spelling in Spanish — complains that\nNafta gets the blame for the whole package of globalization and breakneck\ntechnological change that took off more or less at the same time.“Nafta is\nalso blamed for lots of things that are actually because of competition with\nChina,” he told me.The truth is that autoworkers in Detroit were not just\ncompeting with cheap workers in Mexico. They were also competing with American\nworkers in the union-averse South, where many car companies set up shop. They\nwere competing with robots and more efficient Japanese and Korean\nautomakers.Detroit responded by cutting as many costly factory jobs as it\ncould. But value added by the car and car-parts makers in the United States is\nonly slightly lower than it was in 1993.The integration of production across\ncountries with complementary labor forces — cheaper workers in Mexico to\nperform many basic tasks, with more highly paid and productive engineers and\nworkers in the United States — turned out to play a central role in reviving\nthe auto industry in North America.In the final analysis, Nafta might have\nsaved hundreds of thousands of jobs. By offering a low-wage platform, Mexican\nplants increased the scale of production in North America, allowing domestic\nand foreign automakers to amortize their large fixed costs. Carmakers and\nparts suppliers tend to cluster relatively close together. So assembly plants\nin Mexico help sustain a robust auto-parts industry across North America.The\nHonda CR-V assembled in El Salto, Jalisco, for example, uses an American-made\nmotor and transmission. Roughly 70 percent of its content is either American\nor Canadian, according to government statistics.This regional integration gave\nthe United States-based auto industry a competitive edge that was critical to\nits survival. “There was a concern 20 years ago that an auto industry\nproduction chain would develop across Asia, including China and Taiwan and\nSoutheast Asia,” Professor Hanson said. “Maybe Nafta saved us from that.”Nafta\nis now at a critical juncture. The Chinese manufacturing behemoth that\nsqueezed Mexico out of so many markets over the past 15 years seems to be\nlosing some of its power.As China’s wages rise, it is offering Mexico another\nshot at gaining North American market share, perhaps even at achieving Nafta’s\nunfulfilled promise to help Mexico get rich.Robust North American trade is\nalso critical to the United States. If Mexico achieved significantly higher\nliving standards, Mr. Trump could save the money for his border wall. Already\nfewer Mexican migrants are coming to the United States than going. Were Mexico\nricher, the flows back home to Mexico would probably be greater.And if the\nreal concern is China — another target of Mr. Trump’s ire — a truly integrated\nNorth American market would help keep it at bay.The auto industry remains a\nbright spot.“Every auto manufacturer is setting up shop in Mexico,” said\nEugenio Sevilla-Sacasa, vice president for international supply chain\noperations and cross-border logistics at Ryder, whose trucks cross the border\nbetween Mexico and the United States 150,000 times a year. “Ford, G.M. and\nChrysler but also Toyota, Mazda, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Kia.”And it’s no longer\njust about cars. Mexico is trying to get into the aerospace production chain,\ntoo. Over the past few years, Bombardier, Cessna and Hawker Beechcraft have\nset up shop there, among others. Just as Michigan’s autoworkers might thank\nNafta for keeping China from taking over the global auto industry, aerospace\nworkers might one day have Nafta to thank for keeping the Chinese out,\ntoo.“It’s exactly the wrong time to blow up Nafta,” Professor Hanson argued.\n“We would be doing China an enormous favor.”\n\n","title":"Nafta May Have Saved Many Autoworkers’ Jobs - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"\"Without NAFTA, there might not be much left of Detroit at all.\" https://t.co/hu2tbuPCL9","date":"Wed Mar 30 08:27:22 +0000 2016","favs":134,"id":{"$numberLong":"715093044912062464"},"retweets":62},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1MzibrB"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0149d"},"content":"New York City’s police commissioner expressed “strong concerns” on Tuesday\nabout the arrest of an African-American mail carrier who was at work in the\nCrown Heights section of Brooklyn when he was taken into custody amid an\naltercation with four police officers.The arrest of the mail carrier, Glen\nGrays, attracted national attention after a cellphone recording taken by one\nof several witnesses at the scene of the March 17 episode was released by the\noffice of Eric L. Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, last week.The\ncommissioner, William J. Bratton, said on Tuesday that the officers involved\nin the altercation belonged to the Police Department’s Conditions Unit, a\nneighborhood-based troubleshooting division that Mr. Bratton described as a\npreferred assignment.Members of the unit are expected to work in uniform, Mr.\nBratton said, and the officers who arrested Mr. Grays were wearing street\nclothes. After the arrest, which resulted in Mr. Grays being issued a summons\nfor disorderly conduct, the officers were removed from their assignments and\nput on patrol pending an investigation by the Internal Affairs Bureau, the\ncommmissioner said.“Part of the investigation into that incident will be, why\nwere they in plain clothes — for what purpose, who authorized it,” Mr. Bratton\nsaid at a news conference during which he discussed a variety of law\nenforcement issues. He also said he had “strong concerns” about the charges\nagainst Mr. Grays after viewing additional footage of the arrest that the\nPolice Department had obtained.The arrest forced Mr. Grays to leave a United\nStates postal truck unattended, raising questions about potential violations\nof federal law regarding the interruption of mail delivery. A representative\nof the United States Postal Service said in an email last week that its Office\nof Inspector General was investigating the matter. That an unsecured truck had\nbeen left double-parked on a busy street after Mr. Grays was taken into\ncustody “would be a significant issue of concern in terms of the investigation\ngoing forward,” Mr. Bratton said.The video released by Mr. Adams’s office ends\nwith the officers placing Mr. Grays, in handcuffs, in their unmarked car. In\nan interview last week, Mr. Grays said he was not given a seatbelt. On the way\nto the 71st Precinct, he said, the car struck a vehicle in front of it. The\nday after the episode, Mr. Grays, who said he was detained at the precinct for\na few hours before being released, returned to the precinct house to retrieve\nthe accident report that the officers filed. The report identified the\nofficers as Lt. Luis D. Machado, Lazo Lluka, Miguel I. Rodriguez and David G.\nSavella.Efforts to reach the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association for comment\nlate Tuesday were unsuccessful.Over the past six years at least three of the\nofficers involved have been named in federal civil rights suits alleging false\narrest, among other claims. Most of the cases remain active, and such suits\nare not uncommon.Two years ago, a suit in which Officer Lluka and six other\nofficers were named, resulted in a settlement in which the city paid the\nplaintiffs $140,000 in damages and an additional $75,000 in legal fees. On\nApril 30, 2009, the complaint stated, Officer Lluka arrived at an apartment\nbuilding on Empire Boulevard in Brooklyn where other officers were handling a\nnoise complaint involving the plaintiffs, a brother and sister, both of whom\nare African-American.When the woman said she would not let officers into her\napartment without a search warrant because there were children present,\nOfficer Lluka and two others “slammed her into a wall, threw her to the\nground, kneed her on her back and handcuffed her,” the suit alleged. A fourth\nofficer then hit her brother in the head with a baton when he spoke up to say\nthere had been a misunderstanding, according to the complaint; the brother was\ntreated at Kings County Hospital Center.Mr. Grays has not yet returned to\nwork.\n\n","title":"Bratton Has ‘Strong Concerns’ About Arrest of a Mailman in Brooklyn - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Bratton Has ‘Strong Concerns’ About Arrest of a Mailman in Brooklyn https://t.co/WJTievjbUj","date":"Wed Mar 30 08:13:33 +0000 2016","favs":91,"id":{"$numberLong":"715089566651252736"},"retweets":50},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22NDltF"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0149e"},"content":"**Q. Why do we become desensitized to a perfume we are wearing while others can still smell it?****A.** Ceasing to smell one’s perfume after continuous exposure while casual passers-by can still smell it is just one example of a phenomenon called olfactory adaptation or odor fatigue. After some time without exposure, sensitivity is usually restored.A similar weakening of odor signals with continued exposure also takes place in animals other than humans, and researchers often rely on animal studies to try to understand the cellular and molecular bases for the condition.It has been suggested that odor fatigue is useful because it enables animals to sort out the signals of a new odor from the background noise of continuous odors. It may also enable them to sense when an odor grows stronger.Studies published in the journal Science in 2002 pinpointed a chemical that seems to act as a gatekeeper for neurons involved in smell, opening and closing their electric signal channels. Genetically engineered mice that did not produce the substance, a protein called CNGA4, had profoundly impaired olfactory adaptation. A separate test-tube study found similar changes on a cellular level, with the signal channels remaining open when CNGA4 was absent. _question@nytimes.com_\n\n","title":"Why Your Perfume No Longer Reeks - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Why your perfume no longer reeks (to you) https://t.co/w1duKv41i9 https://t.co/9gRu9ajTNV","date":"Wed Mar 30 08:01:44 +0000 2016","favs":144,"id":{"$numberLong":"715086594030624768"},"retweets":74},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1RMcTvg"}

The latest\nguinea pig is Gwen Stefani, and she has passed with flying colors.The test\nboils down to a simple question: If an album is not on Spotify, can it still\ngo to No. 1? Taylor Swift and Adele both showed it was possible, but their\nalbums were exceptional blockbusters. And while the big record labels are not\ncrazy about the fact that Spotify makes music available free, that streaming\nservice’s powerful size — it has 30 million paying customers around the world,\nand tens of millions more who listen free — makes it hard to ignore.Yet Ms.\nStefani’s latest album, “This Is What the Truth Feels Like” (Interscope), is\nthe latest big release to be “windowed” — available at some online outlets but\nnot others — and still go to No. 1, Ms. Stefani’s first time at the spot as a\nsolo act. The album, which is on Apple, Tidal and Amazon, and also got a\npromotional push from Target, sold 76,000 copies in its first week out in the\nUnited States and had a modest 3.8 million streams, according to Nielsen.\nWhile several singles from the album are on Spotify, the service is not\nscheduled to get the whole LP until Friday.So is the test complete? Probably\nnot, since the results so far are inconclusive. This month the British band\nthe 1975 also went to No. 1 with its latest album despite its initial absence\nfrom Spotify. But when Coldplay took a similar route, it stalled at No. 2.\nNext week’s top album is likely to be the first solo release from Zayn of One\nDirection, whose popularity on Spotify has made him the service’s ninth most\npopular act. (The No. 1 artist on Spotify, by the way, is Justin Bieber, who\nhas likewise embraced the platform.)Also on this week’s album chart, Jordan\nSmith, a singer who won the last season of “The Voice,” opened at No. 2 with\n“Something Beautiful” (LightWorkers/Republic). Rihanna’s “Anti” (Roc Nation),\nlast week’s No. 1, fell two spots to No. 3; Adele’s “25” (XL/Columbia) is No.\n4 and Mr. Bieber’s “Purpose” (RBMG/Def Jam) is No. 5.\n\n","title":"Gwen Stefani Skips Spotify and Still Opens at No. 1 - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Gwen Stefani is the latest artist to skip Spotify and still go to No. 1 https://t.co/43RBWXFLd6","date":"Wed Mar 30 07:47:44 +0000 2016","favs":281,"id":{"$numberLong":"715083069972197376"},"retweets":113},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1Mzilzp"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014a0"},"content":"More government officials are asking what Exxon Mobil knew about climate\nchange.Attorneys general from Massachusetts and the Virgin Islands announced\nTuesday that they would join Eric T. Schneiderman, New York’s attorney\ngeneral, in his investigation into whether Exxon Mobil lied in decades past to\ninvestors and the public about the threat of climate change.The additional\nparticipation was announced during a news conference at Mr. Schneiderman’s\noffices in Lower Manhattan announcing support from 15 states, the District of\nColumbia and the Virgin Islands for the Obama administration’s Clean Power\nPlan.Attorneys general from Vermont, Maryland, Massachusetts, Virginia,\nConnecticut and the Virgin Islands, as well as former Vice President Al Gore,\nattended the event.While none of the other officials present, aside from Maura\nHealey of Massachusetts and Claude Walker of the Virgin Islands, announced\ninquiries of their own, Mr. Schneiderman said, “not every investigation gets\nannounced at the outset.”Mr. Schneiderman began his investigation in November.\nHis staff is looking at whether statements the company made to investors about\nclimate risks — some as recently as last year — conflicted with the company’s\nown scientific research.Part of that inquiry includes the company’s funding,\nfor at least a decade, of outside groups that worked to dispute climate\nscience, even as its in-house scientists were describing the possible\nconsequences of climate change, along with the areas of uncertainty.The\ncompany has supplied thousands of documents in response to the inquiry. While\nthe inquiry could be expanded to include other energy companies and trade\norganizations, none have been named so far.Many legal experts have questioned\nwhether the actions and statements by Exxon Mobil can be construed as criminal\nand outside the protections of the First Amendment.Mr. Schneiderman said, “The\nFirst Amendment, ladies and gentlemen, does not give you the right to commit\nfraud.”The attorneys general have a range of laws to work with, including the\nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. Mr. Schneiderman\nhas statutes specific to New York, including the Martin Act, which gives the\ngovernment broad investigative powers; laws allowing the state to take action\nagainst “persistent fraud or illegality”; and the state’s deceptive business\nand trade practices act.Mr. Schneiderman reached a settlement last year with\nthe coal giant Peabody Energy over that company’s financial statements and\ndisclosures with regard to climate change.In terms of the current\ninvestigation, Mr. Schneiderman said, “It’s too early to say what we’re going\nto find.” He added, “We intend to work as aggressively as possible, but also\nas carefully as possible.”California started its own investigation into Exxon\nMobil this year, but no other state had announced it was joining the effort\nuntil Tuesday. States can share information under agreements of\nconfidentiality, and speculation has grown that Mr. Schneiderman has been\nworking to bring other attorneys general into the New York investigation.Last\nyear, Inside Climate News and The Los Angeles Times published articles from\nExxon Mobil archives describing the company’s research into the risks of\nclimate change. An activist uproar ensued, complete with a popular Twitter\nhashtag: #ExxonKnew.Suzanne McCarron, Exxon Mobil’s vice president for public\nand government affairs, said accusations against the company “are politically\nmotivated and based on discredited reporting by activist organizations.”She\nadded, “We are actively assessing all legal options.”The accusations, she\nsaid, are based on the “preposterous” claim that the company “reached\ndefinitive conclusions about anthropogenic climate change before the world’s\nexperts” and withheld it. The company, she noted, shared its findings in peer-\nreviewed publications.The company “recognizes the risks posed by climate\nchange,” she said, and added, “the investigations targeting our company\nthreaten to have a chilling effect on private sector research.”At the news\nconference, Mr. Gore drew an analogy to the actions taken during the Clinton\nadministration against the tobacco industry, which denied risks of its\nproducts for decades, and noted that state attorneys general had been crucial\nto that effort. “I do think the analogy may hold up rather precisely,” he\nsaid.\n\n","title":"Exxon Mobil Climate Change Inquiry in New York Gains Allies - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTScience: More officials have joined the inquiry into what Exxon Mobil knew about climate change https://t.co/6l3tDx7pdj https://t.co…","date":"Wed Mar 30 07:33:30 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715079489424924672"},"retweets":267},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1Th7ewx"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014a1"},"content":"When Ottessa Moshfegh published her debut novel, “Eileen,” last August, she\ndid so without an online publicity apparatus.Vanity Fair noted that Ms.\nMoshfegh, 34, was an anomaly because she had neither social media profiles nor\na website. There wasn’t much personal information floating around about her,\neither. Ms. Moshfegh had made herself (apart from her work) somewhat un-\nGoogleable.As distress and distaste swirl around issues of privacy,\nexhibitionism and other occupational hazards of social media, a select few\nholdouts of the tech-savvy age are following Ms. Moshfegh’s example. According\nto the Pew Research Center, in 2015, 90 percent of American adults ages 18 to\n29 used a social networking site; more than three-quarters of those 30 to 49\ndid. (The percentages for those who have online access were, expectedly,\nslightly higher.)This leaves a stubbornly resistant minority that isn’t\nfocusing its energies on just one or two social media accounts, as is\ncustomary for people who find the whole enterprise overwhelming or irrelevant.\nThey are eschewing it completely: sharing zero voluntary personal information\non the web.A main criticism of social media is its vending of user data to\ninterested buyers. “All it does is provide a vulnerable attack surface to the\nworld,” wrote a pseudonymous commenter on a Reddit thread asking people why\nthey weren’t on Facebook. “Every service it claims to provide, I already have,\nwithout me, my friends and family having our privacy compromised and sold to\nevery comer.”Since one is barraged with hundreds of online and offline\nadvertisements a day, though, this may seem like a benign issue. But something\nmore pernicious may be looming, said Patrick Flanery, whose forthcoming novel,\n“I Am No One,” deals explicitly with surveillance and data collection.“We are\nbetraying things about our location and social relationships,” said Mr.\nFlanery, 40. “Even if it may only be used for corporations to sell us stuff,\nthen that’s also assuming that the corporations collecting that data aren’t\nmoving toward a different emphasis — that they’re only engaged in a kind of\nselling, rather than something that is a government by proxy.”As for the\ngenuine, not-by-proxy government, our fears about its intrusion — which\nreached their zenith after Edward Snowden’s revelations about National\nSecurity Agency practices in 2013 — may have diverted attention from purely\ncorporate oversight of our online habits. We are so focused on casting the\nN.S.A. as a modern-day Stasi that we have become less suspicious of Facebook,\nTwitter and the like, except when news articles crop up about their\ncollaboration with the government.With the phrase “vulnerable attack surface\nto the world,” the Reddit user suggested another problem beyond Orwellian\nsurveillance: We are now one another’s Big Brother. Social media accounts\nfurther expose oneself to hackers or, via a single tone-deaf misstep, a global\npublic shaming.Yet even outside of these obviously dangerous waters, releasing\nan identity into the digital world remains discomfiting to some. Once your\ndata is online, it no longer belongs wholly to you; subject to reposting and\ncomments, the data you generate gets tossed into the Internet’s melting\npot.Mr. Flanery, who joined Facebook in 2007 but now maintains only a public\npage, said he was initially unconcerned about what he posted because he was\njudicious about whose friend requests he accepted. But as his roster of\nconnections expanded, he became more cautious. “I was posting willy-nilly and\ncommenting and being quite free, as if I was talking to a closed circle of\nfriends,” he said. “It was only gradually that I began to realize the\nvisibility of my posts on other people’s pages, to a body whose makeup I\ncouldn’t police.”Not only can information circulate beyond intended\nrecipients, but people like Isabel Howe, 33, the executive director of the\nAuthors League Fund in New York, find the one-size-fits-all approach to social\nnetworks too unwieldy for their personalities. “I wouldn’t call myself a\nsecretive person,” she said. “But I do want the freedom to vary my level of\nself-exposure according to circumstance.”One can, of course, activate\nstringent privacy measures, set up alternative accounts for specific\nrelationships (like one that excludes co-workers) or not post anything and\nsimply “lurk.” But that’s a headache, and not foolproof; another user can\nstill tag or refer to your avatar in a way that feels more invasive than\nmerely naming you.“It was making me hate everyone,” Ms. Moshfegh, who closed\nher Facebook and Twitter accounts before her book came out, said in a phone\ninterview.“I don’t know anybody who comes across in any kind of positive way\non social media,” she said. “It made me feel bad, like there was a standard\nfor living that I didn’t even know about, and that I hated so much that, if I\never had to be in touch with that standard, I was going to kill somebody.”The\nblatant desire for recognition is what most irritated her. “It seemed like\neverybody wants to be a celebrity,” Ms. Moshfegh said. “As soon as anybody\nstarted to know who I was, being on Facebook was so incredibly tacky.”Ms.\nMoshfegh has the advantage, it must be noted, of a professional team behind\nher to publicize her efforts. Likewise, it’s no great sacrifice when someone\nof George Clooney’s stature swears off social media, as he has little to gain\nand much to lose from it. But for a person in the early stages of a career\ndependent on gaining attention, whether one is a literary novelist or an\nentrepreneur, to do so is a genuine risk.Ms. Moshfegh, though, pointed to some\nof the pitfalls of being an active social networker. “I remember putting in my\nname to see what people were saying on Twitter about me a lot, and\noccasionally finding something negative and being really upset by it,” she\nsaid.And not being on social media can, in fact, yield brand-building\nbenefits, especially for an artist.As hoi polloi shamelessly promote\nthemselves, bestow disingenuous praise upon colleagues in hopes of receiving\nit in return and peck out snarkily hashtagged jokes during awards shows, the\nperson who remains offline accrues mystique and is viewed as nobly\nintentioned, an elusive object of fascination rather than an accessible\nsubject of self-glorification. Who knows how they’re spending their time?\nLikely working hard for some transcendent and paradigm-shifting purpose, their\nonline absence suggests.But post a tweet, and everyone knows what you’re doing\nat that moment: idly looking at a screen, chasing after notice.\n\n","title":"Holdouts of the Social Media Age - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"What it's like to share zero voluntary personal information on the web https://t.co/NHZjEpLdeT","date":"Wed Mar 30 07:05:35 +0000 2016","favs":193,"id":{"$numberLong":"715072464896794624"},"retweets":91},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1XZvPVN"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014a2"},"content":"GENEVA — A yearlong conflict is threatening to cause a humanitarian\ncatastrophe in Yemen, one of the world’s poorest countries, the United Nations\nreported on Tuesday, saying that “children are paying the highest price.”The\neffects of the conflict and the deteriorating humanitarian conditions have\nbrought Yemen “to the point of collapse,” Unicef, the United Nations\nChildren’s Fund, said in a report, adding that the country was at risk of\nbecoming a failed state.At least six children have been killed or maimed in\nthe fighting every day for the past year, Unicef said, calling that “the tip\nof the iceberg” because that number represented only the cases that had been\nverified. The toll is almost certainly much higher, the organization said.For\nthe past year, a Saudi-led coalition has sought to re-establish the government\nof President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which was driven into exile by Houthi\nrebels and their allies.Mr. Hadi was able to reach the southern port city of\nAden in September, but the front lines have hardly shifted since, despite a\ncostly campaign marked by intensive Saudi-led airstrikes.The Unicef report was\nreleased as the Saudi-backed government and the Houthi rebels prepared for a\nhalt to hostilities scheduled to come into effect at midnight on April 10, and\nfor a round of peace talks, the second this year, to start in Kuwait eight\ndays later.As a confidence-building measure in the preparations for the cease-\nfire, Saudi Arabia announced on Monday that it had released 109 Yemeni\nprisoners in return for nine Saudis.Saudi military officials reported a drop\nin fighting this month along the border with Yemen, but Unicef’s\nrepresentative in Yemen, Julien Harneis, said that fighting around the\nfiercely contested city of Taiz had intensified in recent days and that heavy\nairstrikes had continued in the north of the country.The World Health\nOrganization said last week that more than 6,200 people had been killed and\nover 30,000 others wounded in the past year. Unicef reported that at least 934\nchildren had been killed in the conflict, 61 percent of them in airstrikes,\nand that an additional 1,356 had been wounded.“Children are paying the highest\nprice for a conflict not of their making,” Mr. Harneis said in a statement.\n“Children are not safe anywhere in Yemen.”Unicef said it had verified 51\nattacks on schools in the past year, and in comments by telephone from Sana,\nthe capital, Mr. Harneis said the organization had also seen a “massive spike”\nin the recruitment of children, some as young as 10, by armed groups,\nparticularly the Houthis.In addition to airstrikes, civilians must contend\nwith hazards posed by unexploded bombs and cluster munitions dropped by the\nSaudi coalition, and with land mines laid by Houthi forces as they pull back,\nMr. Harneis said.He added that the indirect consequences of the fighting were\ntaking an even bigger toll, most notably on children, citing the widespread\ndestruction of civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, health centers,\nand electricity and water supplies.Before the conflict, about 40,000 children\nunder 5 died from preventable diseases each year, Unicef said. But it has\nestimated that 10,000 more succumbed to disease in the past year because of a\nlack of access to clean water or health care.“That’s the catastrophe for me,”\nMr. Harneis said. “These children would never have died if it were not for\nthis war.”About 600 health centers have closed and 63 have come under attack,\nUnicef reported, adding that children’s vulnerability to disease had increased\nas a result of a sharp rise in the number suffering from acute\nmalnutrition.Despite the conflict, United Nations agencies have been able to\ndeliver aid to most parts of the country, vaccinating more than four million\nchildren against polio and 1.8 million against measles, but they have been\nable to address only the most urgent needs.The United Nations has reported\nthat more than 80 percent of Yemen’s population of 24 million needs some form\nof humanitarian aid, with 19 million lacking access to clean water and 14\nmillion in urgent need of health care.Unicef has appealed for $180 million to\nfinance its programs in Yemen in 2016, but so far it has received just 18\npercent of that amount, Mr. Harneis said.\n\n","title":"Children Pay ‘Highest Price’ as Yemen Falls Apart, U.N.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014a3"},"content":"“Everybody Wants Some!!” is many things — a baseball caper, a sex farce, a\ncampus romance, a campus bromance — but the film’s real claim to distinction\nmay be that it’s the least suspenseful ticking-clock movie ever. We start out\ncounting down the days and hours over the last long weekend before the\nbeginning of the fall semester at a Texas college, and at the end of the movie\n(spoiler alert? are you kidding me?) it’s time for class.The professor, who is\nonly the second or third responsible adult to appear onscreen, writes a\nthought-provoking quotation on the board: “Frontiers are where you find them.”\nI’m not sure where else they are supposed to be, but since the writer and\ndirector of “Everybody Wants Some!!” is Richard Linklater, there’s no harm in\naccepting an invitation to some casual philosophizing. That’s what the\ncharacters in his movies tend to do, even the ballplayers in this one. And\nthough their days are spent in pursuit of sex, beer and other delights, the\nmovie does have an undertow of profundity.Like the quizzical slackers in\n“Slacker,” the boy in “Boyhood” and Celine and Jesse in the “Before” trilogy,\nthe guys on the Southeast Texas State University baseball team are aware of\nthe riddles and paradoxes of time. The strange rhythms of its passage, and the\nways those can be captured and counterfeited on film are among Mr. Linklater’s\nabiding preoccupations. He has described “Everybody Wants Some!!,” which takes\nplace in 1980, as a “spiritual sequel” to “Dazed and Confused,” his ’70s high\nschool masterpiece. It’s also something of a sequel to “Boyhood,” since it\npicks up at almost exactly the life-cycle moment where that movie left off: a\nyoung man arrives at college, approaching an invisible frontier on the way to\nmaturity.Jake (Blake Jenner), a freshman pitcher, shows up at the team house\nwith a crate full of LPs and an easy, slightly wary smile. He receives a\nmostly friendly welcome, though one guy is forthright about his distaste for\npitchers. Jake’s roommate, wearing only underpants and cowboy boots, is\ntalking on the phone with his girlfriend. The coach drops by to explain the\nrules — no women upstairs, no alcohol in the house — mostly so the audience\ncan have the vicarious pleasure of watching as they’re broken.Plot summary?\nThe guys play Ping-Pong, practice baseball, tease one another mercilessly,\nsmoke weed, listen to records and try to pick up girls, not really in that or\nany other order. There is mud-wrestling, half-naked Twister and a lot of\ncasual sex. In the midst of it all, Jake pursues a crush on a theater major\n(Zoey Deutch), who invites him to a party. He gets to know his teammates,\nwhose names are harder to keep track of than their defining attributes.\nThere’s the sane one (J. Quinton Johnson), the vain one (Tyler Hoechlin), the\nphilosopher (Glen Powell) and the “raw dog” (Juston Street), an arrogant\nfastballer with a ratty mustache and a hot temper. Also a secondary assortment\nof goofballs, dimwits and wingmen, each of whom gets at least one big play for\nthe highlight reel.The facial hair works along with the soundtrack, the cars\nand the clothes to conjure a 1980 that viewers who were around back then may\nfind uncannily, even painfully realistic. “Everybody Wants Some!!,” which\npartakes of Mr. Linklater’s own recollections of Texas, baseball and college,\nunfolds in a mood of sweet, lascivious retrospect. Only four years of\nhistorical time separate it from “Dazed and Confused,” but the director is\nmore than 20 years older now, and the greater distance shows. The high jinks\nin the earlier film were laced with anxiety and aggression: The pranks had a\ncruel edge, and there was a predatory vibe to some of the sexuality. When you\nare in your early 30s, as Mr. Linklater was back then, high school is not that\nfar behind you.But when you are in your 50s, college is an almost mythically\ndistant land, and “Everybody Wants Some!!” is more than just nostalgic. It’s\ndownright utopian, a hormonal pastoral endowed with the innocent charm of a\nchildren’s book. There are plenty of movies about lust-addled youth, but it’s\nunusual to find one that feels truly wholesome. In college, one of Jake’s new\npals explains, “The girls can be just as slutty as the guys,” and at this\ncollege, at least, the pursuit of pleasure proceeds without shame, risk or\nhard feelings. (The guys, by the way, are as vain as any gossip girls,\nprimping endlessly before heading out to a club and admiring the curve-hugging\ntightness of their own jeans.) The premise is explained in the title, and\neverybody gets at least some of what they want.Mr. Linklater has never been\ninclined to moralize, and he has banished all piety from this movie, along\nwith any conflict larger than the occasional collision of male egos. There is\nno political correctness on this campus, and no politics of any kind beyond\nthe adjacent Carter and Reagan voter-registration tables outside the campus\ndining hall. The film brushes ever so lightly against issues of race and\nclass, but is finally more interested in how its characters are divided by\ntaste, temperament and attitude.For the most part they all get along, fellow\ncitizens in a republic of horniness. The athletes, who at once embody and\nupend the stereotype of the shallow, sexually entitled jock, go to a disco, a\ncountry-and-western bar, a punk-rock show and various parties, and they have a\ngood time wherever they are. It is impossible not to have a good time in their\ncompany. You can try to be judgmental or jealous, but the beer flows too\nfreely and the camaraderie — which I guess you could call peer pressure — is\njust too strong._“Everybody Wants Some!!” is rated R (Under 17 requires\naccompanying parent or adult guardian).

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014a4"},"content":"CAIRO — Getting out of Egypt was never going to be easy for Seif Eldin\nMustafa, a fugitive Egyptian convict who has been on the run since he escaped\nfrom prison five years ago. But on Tuesday, he resorted to extraordinary\nmeasures.Claiming to be wearing an explosive vest, Mr. Mustafa, 59,\ncommandeered an EgyptAir passenger airliner en route to Cairo from Alexandria,\nforced it to divert to Cyprus and set in motion a tense standoff lasting\nhours. He issued an incoherent set of demands that left officials alarmed,\npuzzled and touched before he gave himself up without hurting anyone.Mr.\nMustafa wanted female inmates released from Egyptian prisons. He demanded to\nspeak with officials from the European Union, ostensibly to obtain political\nasylum.And he wanted to see his former wife, who lived in Cyprus.“Always,\nthere is a woman,” the president of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, said in a\nbrief moment of levity in the early stages of the crisis at Larnaca\nInternational Airport.In the end, the crisis ended peacefully, but only after\nconfused scenes, including a hostage leaping from a cockpit window. Mr.\nMustafa, who it turned out did not have explosives, walked off the plane with\nhis hands up. The Foreign Ministry of Cyprus described him as “psychologically\nunstable.”There has been heightened global sensitivity among travelers since\nlast week’s devastating Islamic State attacks on Brussels, which began at that\ncity’s airport. And the timing could scarcely have been worse for Egypt, whose\ntourism industry has not recovered from a terrorist bombing in October that\nbrought down a Russian plane, killing 224 people.That disaster, which has\nprecipitated a currency crisis in recent months, has brought a deep crisis of\nfaith in Egypt’s ability to keep its airports and planes secure — fears that\nwere briefly exacerbated early in Tuesday’s crisis when Egyptian officials\nidentified the wrong man as the hijacker.That man, a university professor\nnamed Ibrahim Samaha, called a BBC program to clarify that he was, in fact, a\npassenger on the hijacked plane — not the hijacker.“We had no idea what was\ngoing on,” Mr. Samaha said of the flight. “After a while, we realized the\naltitude was getting higher; then we knew we were heading to Cyprus. At first,\nthe crew told us there was a problem with the plane, and only later did we\nknow it was hijacked.”Egyptian officials took pains to point out that Mr.\nMustafa was not linked to the Islamic State. Apparently seeking to deflect\ncriticism of their security procedures, officials released surveillance\nfootage that showed Mr. Mustafa being frisked by security officials as he\npassed through a security gate before boarding the flight.In fact, Mr. Mustafa\nwas a desperado of another kind. Egyptian security officials said he had been\non the run since 2011, when he was among hundreds of people who escaped prison\nduring the 18-day uprising that ousted President Hosni Mubarak. He had been\nimprisoned on multiple charges of forgery and fraud, the officials said.That\nmeant Mr. Mustafa had been unable to leave Egypt to see his former wife, with\nwhom he had lived in Cyprus until the 1990s. Moreover, his sense of\nconfinement had been affecting him recently, neighbors at his home in an\nimpoverished district of Helwan, south of Cairo, said Tuesday.One neighbor,\nNagat Hassanan, said that a few days ago, she had overheard Mr. Mustafa\nspeaking on the telephone outside the ground floor, metal-gated home where he\nlives with a mentally disabled brother and a widowed sister. “He sounded\nfrustrated, and he was saying, ‘I really want to leave, but my passport is\nblacklisted,’ ” she said.Early Tuesday, Mr. Mustafa boarded EgyptAir Flight\n181, from Alexandria to Cairo. Some 72 people were on board; about half were\nEgyptian, with the remainder from seven other countries, including Belgium,\nGreece, Italy and the United States, Egyptian officials said.Mr. Mustafa\nlooked uneasy, his fellow passengers said. After drinks were served, he pulled\nopened his jacket and showed flight attendants what he said was a suicide\nvest, and demanded to be taken to Greece, Cyprus or Turkey.The ultimatum was\nissued quietly, and the crew tried to reassure passengers who had seen it.\n“Don’t worry, we’re in it together,” one passenger, Muhammad Gouda, said he\nwas told by an attendant. But most passengers knew nothing of the hijacking\nuntil they noticed that, instead of landing in Cairo, they were heading north\nacross the Mediterranean.Then Mr. Mustafa demanded to see the passports of all\nof the passengers, and he sorted them by nationality.At first, after the plane\nlanded at Larnaca, it looked as if the crisis might be resolved quickly. After\nsending his demands to negotiators on a piece of paper, Mr. Mustafa allowed\ndozens of passengers to walk free, many carrying their luggage. To those who\nremained, he spoke of his desire to free female prisoners in Egypt and to\n“change the government in Egypt,” one passenger said.But alarmed Cypriot\nofficials, noting what the foreign minister, Ioannis Kasoulides, called the\n“incoherent” nature of Mr. Mustafa’s demands, diverted all flights to Pahphos,\nthe country’s second busiest airport, and deployed armed security personnel\naround Larnaca. Snipers moved into place.Inside the plane, at least seven\nhostages remained — crew members and five Western men selected by their\npassports: two Scotsmen, an Englishman, a Dutch businessman and an Italian. A\nsurreal atmosphere took hold.One of the hostages, Huub Helthuis, the Dutch\nbusinessman, said he had believed Mr. Mustafa posed a threat, but some of his\nfellow hostages had not.Speaking at a Cairo airport, Mr. Helthuis shared a\nphotograph from his cellphone that showed a fellow hostage, who he said was\nEnglish, grinning as he posed beside Mr. Mustafa, still wearing the belt,\ninside the plane. The photograph, which Mr. Helthuis said he took, quickly\nbecame a sensation on social media and news sites around the world.“Everything\nmoved so quickly,” Mr. Helthuis said. “You couldn’t really think. It was hard\nto know how seriously to take him.”Outside, Mr. Mustafa’s former wife had\narrived and helped officials persuade him to surrender. Cypriot officials said\nthe former couple had five children, one a daughter who had died in a car\ncrash.Then several of the remaining hostages fled, including one who climbed\nthrough a cockpit window, dropped onto the tarmac using a makeshift rope and\nsprinted to safety. Moments later, Mr. Mustafa emerged and surrendered. It was\nnot clear at what point the authorities realized that he did not have\nexplosives.“It’s over,” the Cypriot Foreign Ministry announced on Twitter at\n2:41 p.m.Applause erupted in a Cairo airport late Tuesday night as the\nexhausted passengers and crew finally emerged, many pushing their way through\ndozens of journalists and television cameras.“He was crazy, just crazy,” a\nteary flight attendant, clutching a rose, said before being whisked off by\nrelatives. Others said they just wanted to rest.“We are cooked,” said Mohammed\nZidan, one of the passengers. “We want to sleep.”Mr. Mustafa was taken into\ncustody in Cyprus and was expected to be formally charged on Wednesday. At his\nhome in Helawan, where the streets are unpaved and littered with trash,\nneighbors said his actions were motivated by desperation and poverty more than\npolitics.“His family are just poor, helpless people,” said Suhair Hanafi, who\nruns a small store across the street from his home. “Just like everyone here.”\n\n","title":"No One Hurt as EgyptAir Flight Is Forced to Cyprus in a Hijacking From the Heart - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesworld: No one hurt as EgyptAir flight is hijacked by a man who wanted to see his wife on Cyprus. https://t.co/F7bbT4Dkss https:/…","date":"Wed Mar 30 05:31:06 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715048684526895104"},"retweets":127},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21StbCg"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014a5"},"content":"Patty Duke, an Oscar-winning actress renowned at midcentury as a child star of\nstage, film and television, who, amid public struggles with bipolar disorder,\nwent on to cultivate a respected career in adulthood as an actress and mental-\nhealth advocate, died on Tuesday at a hospital near her home in Coeur d’Alene,\nIdaho. She was 69.The cause was complications of a ruptured intestine that Ms.\nDuke suffered on Thursday, said her husband, Michael Pearce.Ms. Duke came to\nwide public notice in 1959, at 12, when she starred as Helen Keller in the\noriginal Broadway production of William Gibson’s drama “The Miracle Worker.”\nAnne Bancroft played Helen’s teacher, Annie Sullivan.For her performance in\nthe 1962 Hollywood film adaptation, in which she and Ms. Bancroft reprised\ntheir roles, Ms. Duke won the Academy Award for best supporting actress.[\nWatch video clips of Patty Duke ]She came to even wider attention the next\nyear, with the debut of “The Patty Duke Show,” the popular ABC sitcom in which\nMs. Duke played the dual roles of Patty Lane, an unaffected Brooklyn girl, and\nher worldly, Scottish “identical cousin,” Cathy Lane.Broadcast on ABC, the\nshow ran through 1966, and also starred William Schallert as Patty’s\nfather.Homey, comforting and sentimental, the show, with its emblematic theme\nsong (“Where Cathy adores a minuet,/The Ballets Russes, and crêpes\nsuzette,/Our Patty loves to rock and roll,/A hot dog makes her lose\ncontrol;/What a wild duet!”) remains a touchstone of American nostalgia.But in\nan irony not lost one iota on Ms. Duke, the fame she won for playing a typical\nteenager — who inhabited a world of bubble gum, bobby socks and few real\nproblems — belied the lifelong upheavals that began in childhood.Among them\nwere a threadbare upbringing; parental alcoholism; her removal from her home\nby her managers, who co-opted not only her earnings but also, Ms. Duke later\nwrote, her very identity; implication in the television quiz-show scandals of\nthe late 1950s; sexual abuse; four marriages; and more than one suicide\nattempt.In the end, however, Ms. Duke found contentment in an enduring fourth\nmarriage; the presidency of the Screen Actors Guild; the proper diagnosis and\ntreatment of her bipolar disorder; her public lobbying for causes including\nmental health, AIDS awareness and nuclear disarmament; and a renewed\ntelevision career that brought her three Emmys.The youngest of three children,\nAnna Marie Duke was born in New York City on Dec. 14, 1946, and reared in\nQueens. Her father, John Patrick Duke, was a handyman and cabby; her mother,\nthe former Frances McMahon, was a cashier.Her mother, Ms. Duke later said, was\nchronically depressed; her father was an alcoholic. When Anna was 6, her\nfather left the family, and she saw him again only occasionally.Anna began\nacting at about 8, when she was taken on by John and Ethel Ross, husband-and-\nwife managers who represented her older brother Raymond.The Rosses immediately\nset to work neutralizing Anna’s prominent Queens accent. They also changed her\nname to the pert, less ethnic-sounding Patty.“Anna Marie is dead; you’re Patty\nnow,” she was told, as she recalled in a memoir, “Call Me Anna” (1987, with\nKenneth Turan).As Patty Duke, she landed bit parts in films and on television\nbefore being cast in “The Miracle Worker.” To prepare her to audition for the\npart, the Rosses took to blindfolding her and moving the furniture\naround.Playing the young Helen Keller — a rigorous role that required her to\nact, persuasively but without sentimentality, the part of a deaf-blind child\nsubject to fearsome rages; to learn the manual alphabet; and to engage nightly\nin an ad-libbed, highly physical onstage fight with Ms. Bancroft that could\nlast nearly 10 minutes — she won critical plaudits and enduring fame.Reviewing\nthe play in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson wrote:“As Helen, little Miss\nDuke is altogether superb — a plain, sullen, explosive, miniature monster\nwhose destructive behavior makes sympathy for her afflictions impossible, but\nwhose independence and vitality are nevertheless admirable.”In the view of\nmany critics, Ms. Duke’s passage from Helen Keller to Patty Lane was a voyage\nfrom the sublime to the ridiculous.From its pilot episode, scripted by Sidney\nSheldon, the show gloried in its preposterous premise: two cousins so\ngenetically indistinguishable that, as its theme song proclaimed, “They laugh\nalike, they walk alike, at times they even talk alike.”But the public ate it\nup, along with vigorously marketed merchandise like dolls, clothes, puzzles\nand board games.The show’s success — and Patty Lane’s popularity in particular\n— was something Ms. Duke came to deplore.“I hated being less intelligent than\nI was,” she later wrote. “I hated pretending I was younger than I was, I hated\nnot being consulted about anything, having no choice in how I looked or what I\nwore, I hated being trapped.”The Rosses, who by now saw Ms. Duke as a golden\ngoose, removed her, against her wishes, from her mother’s home and took her to\nlive with them. They monitored her every movement, she later said, telling her\nwhat to wear, what to do and what to eat, and fiercely controlled her mother’s\naccess to her.They also, Ms. Duke said, fed her uppers and downers and\nintroduced her to alcohol. Both members of the couple, she later wrote,\nsexually molested her on occasion.There was also financial malfeasance. In\n1959, testifying before a congressional committee, Mr. Ross, admitted that\nPatty, who had appeared not long before on the TV quiz show “The $64,000\nChallenge,” had been fed the answers by the show’s producers.She won $32,000\non the show, of which Mr. Ross took his standard 15 percent fee.By the time\nMs. Duke broke with the Rosses as a young woman, she later said, she\ndiscovered that they had embezzled the vast portion of her career earnings —\nabout $1 million.To extricate herself from the Rosses’ Svengali-like clutches,\nshe married Harry Falk, an assistant director on “The Patty Duke Show,” when\nshe was still a teenager; the marriage ended in divorce. A second marriage, to\nMichael Tell, was annulled after 13 days.In 1972, Ms. Duke married the actor\nJohn Astin; during their marriage, she was billed as Patty Duke Astin. They\ndivorced in 1985.Her other roles include the female lead in “My Sweet\nCharlie,” a 1970 TV movie in which she portrayed a pregnant runaway who falls\nin love with a black man, played by Al Freeman Jr. Her performance garnered\nher the first of her three Emmy Awards.On the big screen, she appeared in\n“Valley of the Dolls,” the 1967 adaptation of Jacqueline Susann’s novel,\nplaying Neely O’Hara, a woman addicted to sex, drugs and alcohol.But all the\nwhile, Ms. Duke was dealing increasingly with a real-life emotional lability\nfor which she had no name. She attempted suicide several times, and was\ncommitted to mental hospitals.Only in 1982 did she receive a diagnosis of\nbipolar disorder, along with proper medication. She recounted her experiences\nin another memoir, “A Brilliant Madness: Living With Manic-Depressive Illness”\n(1992, with Gloria Hochman).Ms. Duke’s survivors include her fourth husband,\nMr. Pearce, an Army drill sergeant whom she married in 1986 (she preferred\nafterward to be known in private life as Anna Pearce); her brother, Raymond;\ntwo sons, the actors Sean Astin and Mackenzie Astin; a stepdaughter, Charlene\nGibson, from her marriage to Mr. Pearce; a son, Kevin, with Mr. Pearce; and\nsix grandchildren. Another stepdaughter from her fourth marriage, Raelene\nPearce, died in 1998.Among Ms. Duke’s other television credits are the 1976\nNBC mini-series “Captains and the Kings,” for which she won her second Emmy,\nand a 1979 TV adaptation of “The Miracle Worker” for which — playing Annie\nSullivan to Melissa Gilbert’s Helen — she won her third.Ms. Duke played her\nadult self in “Call Me Anna,” a 1990 TV movie based on her memoir. Over the\nyears she had guest roles on a string of shows, including “The Love Boat,”\n“Amazing Grace,” “Touched by an Angel” and “Glee.”She served as president of\nthe Screen Actors Guild from 1985 to 1988.In a quotation on her website,\nofficialpattyduke.com, Ms. Duke summed up her quicksilver life in lines whose\nfinal word fairly rings with resonance:“I’ve survived,” she wrote. “I’ve\nbeaten my own bad system and on some days, on most days, that feels like a\nmiracle.”\n\n","title":"Patty Duke, Child Star and Oscar Winner, Dies at 69 - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The NYT obituary for Patty Duke, child star and Oscar-winning actress https://t.co/SqzI0i2DjB https://t.co/pvOIVwXfBl","date":"Wed Mar 30 05:18:11 +0000 2016","favs":344,"id":{"$numberLong":"715045435874873344"},"retweets":170},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21SAb26"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014a6"},"content":"The Syrian forces that recaptured the storied city of Palmyra from Islamic\nState occupiers this past weekend have encountered dozens of mines that the\nexpelled militants laid as booby traps around treasured ancient ruins sites,\nSyria’s state media reported Tuesday.Accounts of the Palmyra victory published\nby the official Syrian Arab News Agency also reported that Russia’s military,\nwhich has helped the Syrian forces regain momentum against insurgents with a\nsix-month bombing campaign, was sending 100 mine clearance engineers and\ntrainers of bomb-sniffing dogs to help rid Palmyra of the mines planted by the\nIslamic State, also known as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh.The expulsion of the Islamic\nState from Palmyra, the ancient “Bride of the Desert” oasis seized by the\nmilitant extremist group 10 months ago, is regarded as a turn in the five-\nyear-old war and an enormous propaganda victory for President Bashar al-Assad\nof Syria and the Russians.The Palmyra news also has left the United States and\nother Western and Arab opponents of Mr. Assad in the awkward position of\nwelcoming it while still insisting that the Syrian president’s autocracy and\nsuppression of dissent was the underlying cause of the Syria war.France, one\nof Mr. Assad’s most outspoken detractors, was the latest to react to the\nrecapture of Palmyra. “The advances against Daesh today cannot erase the fact\nthat the regime bears the main responsibility for the conflict and its 270,000\ndead over the past five years,” a spokesman for France’s foreign ministry,\nRomain Nadal, told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday.It is unclear how the\nPalmyra victory by Mr. Assad’s forces might affect the diplomacy underway to\nestablish peace negotiations. It came after Secretary of State John Kerry met\nwith his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, and with President Vladimir V.\nPutin in Moscow last week to discuss Syria and the preservation of a partial\ncease-fire that has taken hold in some areas. The United Nations special envoy\nfor Syria, Staffan de Mistura, is hoping to convene talks on April 9 in\nGeneva.Photographs and video images of Palmyra taken by the Syrian forces\nshowed some horrific damage to parts of the 2,000-year-old ruins, a Unesco\nWorld Heritage site, including decapitated statues and busts with smashed\nfaces. But Syria’s top antiquities official, Maamoun Abdulkarim, said Monday\nthat 80 percent of the ruins appeared to remain intact.The Russians, who have\nbeen widely criticized by Mr. Assad’s opponents and international aid groups\nfor intensive bombing in Syria, have sought to portray the recapture of\nPalmyra as a triumph of civilization over barbarism. On Sunday, the director\ngeneral of Unesco, Irina Bokova, said she had been offered help to restore\nPalmyra, in a personal telephone call from Mr. Putin.Ms. Bokova, who has\ndescribed the Islamic State’s destruction of Middle East artifacts as an\natrocity against humanity, also said she intended to hold a conference of\nexperts on reconstructing Syria’s cultural heritage by the end of\nApril.Foreign news organizations have not been given direct access to Palmyra\nsince the Islamic State retreated. But Syrian activists reached on Tuesday\nreported that large numbers of displaced civilians from areas thought to have\nbeen controlled by the militants were traveling to Azaz, a northwest town near\nthe Turkish border that has become a magnet for hundreds of uprooted Syrians.\nThe activists said many had come from the Palmyra area and from Deir al-Zour\nfarther east.“We received about 100 families after Daesh allowed them to\nleave, which is something unusual,” said Mohamed al Abdalla, an activist\nreached in Azaz. “Honestly we weren’t expecting people from Palmyra and Deir\nal-Zour to arrive here.”\n\n","title":"ISIS Fighters Laid Mines Around Palmyra’s Ancient Ruins Before Retreating, Syrians Say - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesworld: ISIS fighters reported to booby-trap Palmyra’s archaeological treasures before retreating. https://t.co/Ot5y1Z8XvH https:…","date":"Wed Mar 30 05:06:02 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715042378898345985"},"retweets":152},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1V2O8tL"}

The vast majority had failed\nto register their stay with the police, as required by law, and they had left\nthe country by Monday night, the Interior Ministry said, without providing\ndetails of where they had gone.During the raids, the government seized several\nthousand euros in cash and electronic devices, which were taken for forensic\nanalysis.In a phone interview, Vucko Rovcanin, the owner of the Perjanik Hotel\nin Danilovgrad, where one of the raids took place, said the group had rented\nthe property for a negotiated rate through an agent. The agent had said they\nwere visiting from Ukraine and needed a place to stay with a fast Internet\nconnection and no staff or other people around, Mr. Rovcanin said.He said the\nagent had signed a rental agreement on March 15 and paid in advance. Mr.\nRovcanin said the group’s members seemed odd but not dangerous. Told about the\n1995 attack, he said he had not heard of Aum Shinrikyo.The Japanese Embassy in\nSerbia, which covers Montenegro, was informed on Friday that four Japanese\ncitizens had been detained and would be deported, according to the Japanese\nForeign Ministry, which said it was looking into the matter.The Japanese\nbroadcaster NHK reported that the sect was active in Russia and engaged in\nactivities like yoga classes, even though the group is prohibited there. The\nRussian police raided an Aum Shinrikyo facility in Moscow last October, NHK\nreported.Founded in 1984, Aum Shinrikyo formally lost its status as a\nregistered religious group in Japan after the attack but continued its\nactivities, even though the United States and other countries classified it as\na terrorist organization.The group declared bankruptcy in 1996, but a\nsuccessor organization, Aleph, replaced it in 2000. Some member of Aleph\ncreated a breakaway group, the Circle of Rainbow Light, in 2007. Both groups\nare still active.Thirteen members of the cult, including its founder, Shoko\nAsahara, were sentenced to death in connection with the subway attack on March\n20, 1995, which left 13 people dead and injured thousands. None have been\nexecuted, pending legal appeals.\n\n","title":"Montenegro Expels Foreigners Linked With Japanese Cult - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Montenegro has expelled 58 people linked to a Japanese cult that staged a deadly attack on Tokyo’s subway in 1995 https://t.co/3sf7ZEMdPA","date":"Wed Mar 30 04:56:04 +0000 2016","favs":166,"id":{"$numberLong":"715039871144996866"},"retweets":200},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SkpZtT"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014a8"},"content":"JANESVILLE, Wis. — Donald J. Trump, who has risen to front-runner status by\ngiving voice to anti-establishment rage against the Republican Party, kicked\noff his quest for the support of Wisconsin voters at a rally on Tuesday\nafternoon in Janesville, the hometown of Speaker Paul D. Ryan — the button-\ndown, clean-cut steward of the party.Wisconsin, whose middle class has been\nhard hit by a decline in manufacturing jobs, could prove fertile ground for\nMr. Trump when it holds its presidential primary next Tuesday. He has defied\nRepublican orthodoxy by opposing many trade deals, calling for high tariffs\nagainst China and railing against countries like Mexico and Japan that he says\nare taking away American jobs. Mr. Ryan generally supports free trade.The\nissue could be particularly resonant in Janesville, where a General Motors\nplant once employed roughly 7,000 workers at its peak but ceased production in\n2009, when it employed just 1,200 workers.Mr. Trump did not mention the closed\nfactory on Tuesday, but criticized the trade positions of his Republican\nrivals, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, who has also been portraying himself in\nWisconsin as an advocate for working-class voters, and Gov. John Kasich of\nOhio.Wisconsin’s middle class, Mr. Trump said, has been hit “very, very hard\ndue to loss of manufacturing jobs,” and he warned that Mr. Cruz’s and Mr.\nKasich’s support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement signed\nthis year among a dozen Pacific Rim countries, would make things worse.The\nPacific pact, he said, would make the North American Free Trade Agreement\n“look like a baby, and Wisconsin will be hit so hard.”The rally was held in\nthe wake of a speech Mr. Ryan gave last week that did not name Mr. Trump, but\nseemed aimed directly at him. Mr. Ryan urged Republicans to embrace civility\nand high-minded policy ideas, rather than the “ugliness” that he said had\nconsumed the 2016 presidential race so far.Shortly after that speech, Mr.\nTrump, a self-styled counterpuncher, responded by scheduling his first\nWisconsin rally before the primary in Mr. Ryan’s hometown.Mr. Trump did not\nattack Mr. Ryan on Tuesday. But when he asked the crowd how it liked its\ncongressman, he was met by boos and jeers.“Paul Rino,” offered one attendee,\nusing a derogatory acronym for “Republican in name only.”“I was told to be\nnice to Paul Ryan,” Mr. Trump said, sounding momentarily surprised. “Are you\nall Republicans? Are you mostly conservative?”Mr. Ryan was his party’s 2012\nvice-presidential candidate, and his name is still floated by party officials\nas a possible Republican nominee if Mr. Trump fails to secure the 1,237\ndelegates necessary to win the nomination outright. The chairman of the\nRepublican National Committee, Reince Priebus, is also from Wisconsin.Mr.\nTrump also addressed the arrest of his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski,\nwho was charged on Tuesday with battery in Jupiter, Fla. Mr. Lewandowski was\naccused of jerking the arm of a reporter from Breitbart News, a conservative\nwebsite, as she tried to ask a question after a campaign event this month.Mr.\nTrump used a question about restoring discipline to schools to defend Mr.\nLewandowski, spending three minutes walking his crowd through a play by play\nof his version of the episode, in which he sought to blame the reporter,\nMichelle Fields.The Trump campaign originally denied Mr. Lewandowski had\ngrabbed Ms. Fields. But after a series of still images from security cameras\nseemed to corroborate her account, Mr. Trump told the crowd here that on the\nsecurity tape, Ms. Fields’s face “stayed the same” instead of flinching, as he\nwould have expected.“If somebody squeezed your arm or hurt you, wouldn’t you\nstart screaming or something?” he asked. “Did you see any change in her\nface?”Mr. Trump then claimed that Ms. Fields had seemed to be reaching out to\ntouch him, and offered a competing theory — that Mr. Lewandowski was defending\nhim. Mr. Trump said that “maybe he touched her a little bit,” but added, “It\nwas almost like he was trying to keep her off me, like he was helping her.”“I\ncan’t destroy a man,” he said, referring to some calls to fire Mr.\nLewandowski. “I’m not going to destroy a man for that.”Mr. Trump visited\nWisconsin the same day that Gov. Scott Walker endorsed Mr. Cruz during the\nradio program of Charlie Sykes, a popular conservative talk radio host in the\nstate.Mr. Trump began his remarks by criticizing the governor and noting that\nwhile Mr. Walker rides a Harley-Davidson, “the motorcycle guys like Trump.”He\nalso went after Mr. Cruz, portraying him as a friendless puppet of the\nRepublican Party leaders.“Frankly, in a way it’s worse, because Cruz is\nestablishment and yet he’s got no relationship with the establishment,” Mr.\nTrump said. “He’s sort of got the worst of all elements. He’s an insider,\ntotally, but he can get nothing done. He can get nothing done.”In advance of\nhis trip, Mr. Trump made a series of calls on Monday to Wisconsin talk radio\nshows — which carry outsize influence among the state’s Republican primary\nvoters — and engaged in a combative back-and-forth with Mr. Sykes.Mr. Ryan’s\noffice, in a statement (which again did not mention Mr. Trump by name), said\nthe speaker was excited to welcome presidential hopefuls to his state.“Speaker\nRyan is glad Republican candidates are campaigning for president in Wisconsin,\nincluding his hometown of Janesville,” Zack Roday, a spokesman, said in a\nstatement. “Wisconsin voters expect to talk with candidates seeking public\noffice and hear their views on the major issues before our nation so they can\nmake an informed decision.”\n\n","title":"Donald Trump Starts Wisconsin Bid in Ryan’s Hometown - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Donald Trump starts Wisconsin bid in Paul Ryan’s hometown https://t.co/cfACOmiJDf https://t.co/shzSkBQ26E","date":"Wed Mar 30 04:16:05 +0000 2016","favs":134,"id":{"$numberLong":"715029807306768385"},"retweets":52},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SlxCAg"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014a9"},"content":"By every conventional measure, Jessica Knoll’s thriller, “Luckiest Girl\nAlive,” was a wildly successful literary debut. It sold more than 450,000\ncopies and spent four months on the best-seller lists. Foreign rights sold in\nmore than 30 countries. The actress Reese Witherspoon optioned the film\nrights, and Ms. Knoll wrote the screenplay.Still, Ms. Knoll couldn’t escape\nthe nagging feeling that she had let her readers down. Even though her book\nwas fiction, she felt she hadn’t fully told the truth.The white lie she told\nover and over, at readings and book signings and in interviews, was\ncomplicated and hard to untangle. She assured fans that some of the darker\nelements of her novel, which centers on a successful young woman who struggles\nwith the lingering trauma of a sexual assault, were purely fiction. She\ndeflected questions from readers who wanted to know how she had managed to\nportray a rape and its aftermath so vividly and realistically, saying she had\nheard stories from friends and classmates.She is no longer dodging those\nquestions. On Tuesday, Ms. Knoll published a raw and chilling essay describing\nhow the gang rape depicted in her novel was drawn from her own experience in\nhigh school, when she was sexually assaulted by three boys at a party, and\nthen tormented by classmates who labeled her a slut.“I was so conditioned to\nnot talk about it that it didn’t even occur to me to be forthcoming,” Ms.\nKnoll said during a recent interview at her publisher’s office in Midtown\nManhattan. “I want to make people feel like they can talk about it, like they\ndon’t have to be ashamed of it.”In the essay, published on Lenny, a newsletter\nand website for young women, Ms. Knoll described how some of the most\nharrowing and horrific scenes in her novel came from her fragmented memories\nof a party that went devastatingly wrong: blacking out and then regaining\nconsciousness when a boy was assaulting her; waking up later in a bathroom,\nseeing a toilet bowl of blood-tinged water, and not understanding where it\ncame from; finding herself in a strange bed the next morning beside a\ndifferent boy, who laughed it off as a wild night; going to a clinic for\nemergency contraception and asking the doctor if what happened to her counted\nas rape, and feeling stunned when the doctor said she wasn’t qualified to\nanswer the question.The essay sparked a flood of supportive messages on social\nmedia from readers who thanked Ms. Knoll for coming forward.It wasn’t until\nshe was in her early 20s and in counseling that her therapist helped define\nwhat had happened. “I was so young that it was very hard to make sense of\nit,’’ she said, adding: “I didn’t want to talk about it. I didn’t want to deal\nwith it.’’Ms. Knoll, 32, grew up in a Roman Catholic family in the\nPhiladelphia suburbs, and attended the Shipley School, a prestigious prep\ninstitution. She read Sylvia Plath and Flannery O’Connor and dreamed of\nbecoming a writer.Before she was assaulted, Ms. Knoll was a happy, social 15\n-year-old who played sports and was on the dance team. Afterward, she said,\nshe shut down and felt crushingly isolated, unable to connect even with\nfriends. Some classmates taunted her and scrawled “trash slut” inside her\nlocker.“No one was treating me like a victim; they were treating me like I was\na perpetrator, like I was getting what I deserved,” she said.She added: “The\nmessage I internalized was that nothing bad happened; you did something\nwrong.”Ms. Knoll said that she took no action against her attackers, who never\nsuffered any consequences. She does not name them in the essay. Shaming them\nis not the point, she said.“It’s not directed at them,” she said. “It’s more\nlike, ‘I’m going to tell the story this time.’ This is a very empowering thing\nfor me to be able to say, actually, this is what happened to me, and to take\nownership of my own narrative.”In college, as an English major at Hobart and\nWilliam Smith Colleges in Geneva, N.Y., she tried to reinvent herself. Still,\nshe could never bring herself to let loose at parties the way her friends and\nclassmates did. She was too scared.After graduating, she moved to New York\nCity and took an internship at Parenting magazine, then worked as an editorial\nassistant at Popular Science. From there, she moved to Cosmopolitan, where she\nrose through the ranks to become a senior editor.While at Cosmo, Ms. Knoll\nbegan writing “Luckiest Girl Alive.” She decided to use fiction to address her\nhigh school trauma.“I knew I wanted to write about that in some way, because\nit was such a visceral experience that stayed with me my whole life,” she\nsaid.“Luckiest Girl Alive” is narrated by TifAni FaNelli, an ambitious 28\n-year-old editor at a women’s magazine who writes sex columns and is obsessed\nwith projecting a perfect image. Her life is derailed when she participates in\na documentary about her high school, and is forced to confront the rage she\nhas carried with her since she was raped as a teenager. The novel toggles\nbetween past and present, and takes a shocking, violent turn in the middle\nwhen a second crime devastates the school.After Simon \u0026amp; Schuster published\n“Luckiest Girl Alive” last May, Ms. Knoll was flooded with messages from women\nwho said they had endured traumas similar to TifAni’s. Many said they were\ncomforted by the dedication page of the book, which reads: “To all the TifAni\nFaNellis of the world. I know.”Those messages prompted Ms. Knoll to wonder why\nshe had kept silent.With another big book tour on the horizon — she is\ntraveling to 16 cities to promote the paperback this spring — she decided to\nstop hiding behind her fictional creation. In January, she contacted Jessica\nGrose, editor of Lenny, the email newsletter and website started by the\nactress and writer Lena Dunham and “Girls” showrunner Jenni Konner, and\npitched an essay about how she drew on her experience for her novel.In an\nemail, Ms. Dunham said that she was “honored” to publish the essay. “This word\nis overused but the piece is the definition of brave,” she said.There have\nbeen hard moments for Ms. Knoll, both in reliving that awful night and in the\npainful conversations with friends and family that have followed. Her younger\nbrother never knew what happened to her until he read about it in her novel,\nshe said.In her professional life, Ms. Knoll had been discreet about the\nautobiographical threads of her novel.“We were all shocked and moved by what\nwe read,” Jonathan Karp, president and publisher of Simon \u0026amp; Schuster, said\nin response to the essay. “It’s a little bit like finding out something about\na friend that you never knew, and it makes you respect them even more for\ntheir strength and their character.”There is also relief. A few months ago,\nMs. Knoll attended a book event in New Jersey, where a woman asked her if she\nhad interviewed rape victims while researching the novel. For the first time,\nMs. Knoll answered honestly.“I said, ‘Yeah, that happened to me,’” Ms. Knoll\nsaid. “It was kind of like, ‘Why have I waited so long to say that? What was\nso hard about that?’”\n\n","title":"Jessica Knoll Reveals the Rape Behind Her Novel, ‘Luckiest Girl Alive’ - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Jessica Knoll has revealed that the gang rape depicted in her novel was drawn from her own high school experience https://t.co/oqxSQ7KH3o","date":"Wed Mar 30 04:06:03 +0000 2016","favs":237,"id":{"$numberLong":"715027284651077632"},"retweets":150},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25vs544"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014aa"},"content":"WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court handed organized labor a major victory on\nTuesday, deadlocking 4 to 4 in a case that had threatened to cripple the\nability of public-sector unions to collect fees from workers who chose not to\njoin and did not want to pay for the unions’ collective bargaining\nactivities.It was the starkest illustration yet of how the sudden death of\nJustice Antonin Scalia last month has blocked the power of the court’s four\nremaining conservatives to move the law to the right.A ruling allowing workers\nto refuse to pay the fees would have been the culmination of a decades-long\ncampaign by a group of prominent conservative foundations aimed at weakening\nunions that represent teachers and other public employees. Tuesday’s deadlock\ndenied them that victory, but it set no precedent and left the door open for\nfurther challenges once the Supreme Court is back at full strength.When the\ncase was argued in January, the court’s conservative majority seemed ready to\nsay that forcing public workers to support unions they had declined to join\nviolates the First Amendment. Justice Scalia’s questions were consistently\nhostile to the unions.His death changed the balance of power in this case, and\nmost likely in many others. The clout of the court’s four-member liberal wing\nhas increased significantly. Its members — Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg,\nStephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — can create deadlocks, as\nthey did Tuesday, and they can sometimes attract the vote of Justice Anthony\nM. Kennedy for a liberal result.Should Senate Republicans relent and confirm\nJudge Merrick B. Garland as Justice Scalia’s replacement, the power of the\ncourt’s liberals might only grow.Union officials said they were elated by\nTuesday’s decision, but they remain wary of future efforts to diminish their\neffectiveness.“We know the wealthy extremists who pushed this case want to\nlimit the ability for workers to have a voice, curb voting rights and restrict\nopportunities for women and immigrants,” said Mary Kay Henry, the president of\nthe Service Employees International Union.The case was brought by the Center\nfor Individual Rights, a libertarian group that pursued an unusual litigation\nstrategy. Responding to signals from the Supreme Court’s more conservative\njustices, the group asked the lower courts to rule against its clients, 10\nteachers and a Christian education group, so they could file an appeal in the\nSupreme Court as soon as possible.Terence J. Pell, the group’s president, said\nhe was disappointed with Tuesday’s tie vote.“With the death of Justice Scalia,\nthis outcome was not unexpected,” he said. “We believe this case is too\nsignificant to let a split decision stand.”“Either compulsory dues are an\nacceptable exception to the First Amendment or they are not,” Mr. Pell said.\n“A full court needs to decide this question, and we expect this case will be\nreheard when a new justice is confirmed.”Under California law, public\nemployees who choose not to join unions must pay a “fair share service fee,”\nalso known as an “agency fee,” typically equivalent to the dues members pay.\nThe fees, the law says, are meant to pay for some of the costs of collective\nbargaining, including “the cost of lobbying activities.” More than 20 states\nhave similar laws.Government workers who are not members of unions have long\nbeen able to obtain refunds for the political activities of unions, like\ncampaign spending. The case the court ruled on Tuesday, Friedrichs v.\nCalifornia Teachers Association, No. 14-915, asked whether such workers must\ncontinue to pay for any union activities, including negotiating for better\nwages and benefits. A majority of the justices had seemed inclined to say\nno.Relying on a 1977 Supreme Court precedent, the United States Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, upheld the requirement that\nthe objecting teachers pay fees. Tuesday’s announcement, saying only that “the\njudgment is affirmed by an equally divided court,” upheld that ruling and set\nno new precedent.The unions defending the compulsory fees said the teachers’\nFirst Amendment arguments were a ruse. Collective bargaining is different from\nspending on behalf of a candidate, the unions said. They said the plaintiffs\nwere seeking to reap the benefits of such bargaining without paying their fair\nshare of the cost.Limiting the power of public unions has long been a goal of\nconservative groups, and they seemed very close to victory when the case was\nargued in January.In 2014, the court stopped just short of overruling the\nfoundational 1977 decision and declaring that government workers who choose\nnot to join unions may not be forced to pay fees in lieu of dues. In the 1977\ndecision, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, the Supreme Court made a\ndistinction between two kinds of compelled payments.Forcing nonmembers to pay\nfor a union’s political activities violates the First Amendment, the court\nsaid. But it is constitutional, the court added, to require nonmembers to help\npay for the union’s collective bargaining efforts to prevent freeloading and\nensure “labor peace.”Tuesday’s decision was the second deadlocked case since\nJustice Scalia died, and there will almost certainly be more by the end of the\nterm in June. But there is no reason to think that ties will dominate the\ndocket.In recent years, the court has split 5 to 4 about a quarter of the\ntime. In the term that ended last June, there were 19 such cases, and Justice\nScalia was in the majority in just six of them.“On eight-person courts the\njustices reach far fewer 4-4 decisions than we would expect,” said Lee\nEpstein, a law professor and political scientist at Washington University in\nSt. Louis. “They seem to work hard to minimize them because they’re so\ninefficient. They can hold over cases, cast strategic votes to avoid a\ndecision down the road that may be even worse ideologically, write narrowly\nand dump cases on procedural grounds.”After Tuesday’s deadlock, some critics\nof public unions said they would turn to other forums.“With a divided court,\nthousands of public servants around the nation must still financially assist a\ngovernment union that they disagree with,” said Trey Kovacs, an analyst with\nthe Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian group. “Now it is up to\nstate legislatures to provide public employees with the freedom to choose\nwhether or not to pay for union representation.”Union officials, too, were\nlooking ahead. “The Supreme Court today rejected a political ploy by the\nwealthy corporate special interests backing this case,” said Eric C. Heins,\nthe president of the California Teachers Association. “Now it’s time for\nsenators to do their job and appoint a successor justice to the highest court\nin our land.”\n\n","title":"Victory for Unions as Supreme Court, Scalia Gone, Ties 4-4 - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The Supreme Court's decision on unions is the starkest illustration yet of how Scalia's death has impacted the court https://t.co/8navadoebE","date":"Wed Mar 30 03:56:07 +0000 2016","favs":194,"id":{"$numberLong":"715024781486256129"},"retweets":147},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VRZ5PO"}

After appearing in\ncommercials and a few television shows as a child, she found fame on Broadway,\nstarring with Anne Bancroft in William Gibson’s “The Miracle Worker.” The\nplay, about Helen Keller and her teacher, Anne Sullivan, ran from 1959 to\n1961. Ms. Duke reprised the role in the 1962 film version of “The Miracle\nWorker,” which Bosley Crowther praised in The Times for retaining the play’s\n“absolutely tremendous and unforgettable display of physically powerful\nacting.” Ms. Duke won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for the\nperformance — at 16, she was then the youngest actor to win that award.Ms.\nDuke returned to television for “The Patty Duke Show,” an era-defining sitcom\nof the more outwardly wholesome early 1960s. Ms. Duke played, as the\ninfectious theme song put it, “cousins, identical cousins”: Patty, a fun-\nloving stereotypical American girl from Brooklyn Heights, and Cathy, a prim\nyoung lady from Scotland.The show, created by Sidney Sheldon (“I Dream of\nJeannie,” “Hart to Hart”), featured celebrity guest stars including Frankie\nAvalon, Sal Mineo, Paul Lynde and Sammy Davis Jr. and ran from 1963 to\n1966.Ms. Duke’s next move telegraphed a desire to leave her child-actor past\nbehind. She starred as a debauched singer in the film “Valley of the Dolls” in\n1967, based on the Jacqueline Susann novel about good girls going bad and the\nperils of Hollywood.This time, Mr. Crowther was not as charmed. “It’s an\nunbelievably hackneyed and mawkish mish-mash of backstage plots and ‘Peyton\nPlace’ adumbrations in which five women are involved with their assorted\negotistical aspirations, love affairs and Seconal pills,” he wrote.Ms. Duke\nreturned to television in the 1970s and would spend the next couple of decades\nstarring mostly in TV movies, including as Anne Sullivan in “The Miracle\nWorker,” and the occasional feature film. In the 1982 she returned to sitcoms\nwith “It Takes Two,” a topical comedy about the modern challenges that face a\nhard-charging, career-minded couple, also starring Richard Crenna.She also\nbegan working to raise money and awareness for mental health issues after\nbeing diagnosed with bipolar disorder in the 1980s.Though her celebrity peaked\nearly, Ms. Duke suggested late in her career that she was more proud of her\nprofessionalism rather than past fame.“I’m proud that when I get a job, I’m\ngonna give you what you paid for,” she said in a 2013 interview. “And maybe\neven more.”\n\n","title":"Video: Remembering Patty Duke - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Watch: Remembering Patty Duke https://t.co/OOOjWVer64 https://t.co/xOo0GX2LMb","date":"Wed Mar 30 03:36:07 +0000 2016","favs":370,"id":{"$numberLong":"715019750682836993"},"retweets":185},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PEBNoY"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014ac"},"content":"It’s that time again, everybody. The one we’ve all been waiting for.No, I’m\nnot talking about spring, March Madness or the start of Major League Baseball.\nIt’s election season. Aren’t you excited?Every four years (or more often, for\ncitizens who never miss a chance to cast a ballot), we partake in what seems\nlike the cherished national pastime of “blame somebody else.” Whether it’s\nDemocrats blaming Republicans, conservatives blaming liberals, Congress\nblaming the White House or citizens blaming politicians en masse, everybody at\nthis special time seems to find someone else to blame for our many\nproblems.Here’s my question: What good does it do to blame other people? The\nanswer, of course, is nothing.For this election season, and going forward in\nour lives, I suggest trying something novel: Take responsibility\nyourself.Look, I know that sounds ridiculous in some situations. It’s absurd\nto suggest that you, or any person, is responsible for huge and complicated\nproblems like poverty, unemployment or something as random as the Zika virus.\nIf you’re stopped at a red light and someone rear-ends you, obviously it’s not\nyour fault.But I’d like to encourage you to think of this concept not in terms\nof truth, but in terms of use. Forget about figuring out who actually is to\nblame for something. Instead, consider whether it’s more valuable to blame\nsomeone else or to take responsibility yourself and learn from past\nmistakes.When it comes to our own investment behavior, this is particularly\nvaluable advice. Imagine that Goldman Sachs just predicted a terrible market\nin the coming year and, based on that forecast, you sold a quarter of your\nportfolio for a loss. Immediately after, the market boomed for months.Did you\nlose a ton of money? Yes. Was it Goldman Sachs’ fault? That’s arguable. But\neven if it were, did you learn anything by blaming it on the firm?If we blame\nGoldman Sachs for our losses, all we can do is say we got badly misled and\nhope we don’t get fooled again. We’re powerless to improve our situation. But\nif we instead take responsibility for risky investing or listening to the\nlatest professed market seer, for not sticking to our financial plans or for\nany other number of things, we have a much better opportunity to minimize the\nchances of bad things happening to us in the future.What’s really powerful\nabout this practice is that even when I know I’m not to blame for my\nsituation, I still find it helpful. It sounds really heavy, always taking\nresponsibility. But I’ve found the opposite to be true. It feels enlightening\nand not heavier at all, like a burden has been lifted from my shoulders. It\nallows me to let go of feeling helpless and empowers me to come up with\ncreative ways to improve my situation.This idea reminds me of a quote from Leo\nTolstoy, “Everyone thinks about changing the world, but no one thinks of\nchanging himself.” In the end, that’s the only thing you have control over:\nyourself!Even if you could bend Goldman Sachs over your knee and give it a\nspanking when it messed up a market forecast, odds are that you wouldn’t get\nthe firm to change its behavior. What you can do is take responsibility for\nhow you react to that forecast. In the future, you can make a plan for how to\nhandle the risk, then stick to it_._Think of this not as an indictment but as\nan invitation. I’m not here to lay blame on you; I’m here to encourage you to\ntake at least some of the responsibility when things go wrong and then learn\nfrom your mistakes. Ultimately, I think you’ll find that doing so will be more\nempowering and more productive than blaming someone else.\n\n","title":"Learning to Take Responsibility When Things Go Wrong - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesbusiness: Learning to take responsibility when things go wrong https://t.co/z2W8mFCGWA https://t.co/1ibilBMqiT","date":"Wed Mar 30 03:06:44 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715012356473008128"},"retweets":187},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25u98yz"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014ad"},"content":"PARIS — The pithiviers de canard at Clown Bar, a historic restaurant in Paris\nwith circus-themed glazed tiles from the 1920s, is an exquisite rendering of a\nclassic dish. Duck breast surrounded by minced duck meat, topped with duck\nfoie gras and baked inside a pastry shell the color of varnished teak, it is a\nflaky, tender, succulent argument for why we still worship traditional French\ncuisine.The pithiviers may be as French as the four-week vacation, but the one\nat Clown Bar is the creation of the chef Sota Atsumi, who is from Tokyo.Mr.\nAtsumi, 30, is part of a new generation of Japanese chefs who set out to\nmaster French cooking and who now run some of the most acclaimed French\nrestaurants in Paris — notable in a city known for its snobbish dismissal of\noutsiders. Le Fooding, possibly the most influential food publication in the\ncountry, named Clown Bar the best bistro in all of France for 2015.Some of the\nchefs, such as Dai Shinozuka of Les Enfants Rouges, are so orthodox that the\nfood they cook could illustrate a textbook. Others, like Shinichi Sato at\nPassage 53, a white jewel box of a restaurant with two Michelin stars, or\nAtsushi Tanaka at Restaurant A.T, embrace modernist cuisine. They moved to\nFrance to learn from the country’s culinary lions and to absorb its traditions\nand techniques.“You can impress Japanese people with French cuisine, but I\nwant to cook French cuisine for French people,” said Katsuaki Okiyama, the 39\n-year-old chef at the restaurant Abri. Mr. Okiyama, who was born outside Tokyo\nand studied French cuisine in Japan before moving to France, worked at\nTaillevent and La Table de Joël Robuchon (now closed), two citadels of formal\ndining in Paris.Japanese chefs have been cooking in Paris for some time.\nAlexandre Cammas, the editor of Le Fooding, recalled that a handful of\nJapanese chefs were running the kitchens of Michelin-starred restaurants with\nexpensive menus in 1990s.But recently, he said, many in this new generation\nare opening the kind of small, studiously informal restaurants that have\nchanged the culinary landscape in Paris. They are card-carrying members of the\n“bistronomy” movement, which brings the sophistication and technique of fine\ndining to tastefully scuffed neighborhood restaurants, where the confidently\ndisheveled waiter is more likely to guide you to a weird, wonderful and\ninexpensive natural wine than a pricey grand cru. These ambitious and\naffordable restaurants have created a new eating culture, cultivating a\nyouthful and discerning clientele. Some of the most refined cooking in Paris\nis now found in restaurants that are young, loud and fun.These Japanese-born\nchefs are integral to that movement, running the kitchens in a number of the\ncity’s most talked-about restaurants. “The big increase is maybe since three\nyears,” Mr. Cammas said. The current edition of Le Fooding includes a\n“Japaname Tour” of Paris with a lavishly illustrated foldout map. It lists 40\nrestaurants headed by Japanese chefs, 28 of which are cataloged as\n“Japarisiennes,” a portmanteau for Japanese chefs cooking French cuisine.It’s\nnot easy to win over Parisians, but diners have been seduced by how these\némigrés have mastered the local vernacular. After all, food is more than\nsustenance or a source of pleasure in France; it’s an important part of the\nnation’s identity. In 2010, Unesco named the multicourse French meal — the\norganization defines as “commencing with an aperitif” and consisting of “at\nleast four successive courses” — as a heritage worthy of protection.Chefs like\nMr. Atsumi and Mr. Okiyama are as much the guardians of that legacy as any\nchef from France.“It is a question of talent and passion, and it’s a question\nof soul,” Mr. Cammas said, explaining that technical skills will only take you\nso far in Paris. “The mille-feuille at Abri is one of the best you can taste,”\nhe said, speaking of Mr. Okiyama’s playful interpretation of the intricate\npastry. It isn’t a classic mille-feuille, but the flavors are true to the\noriginal — it doesn’t flirt with fusion.“He just does it better,” Mr. Cammas\nsaid.Narrow and cramped, Abri feels more like a student dive than a restaurant\nthat books up weeks in advance. At night, fashionable Parisians navigate an\nunphotogenic stretch of rue du Faubourg Poissonnière to crowd into one of the\nsmall tables and linger over one of the city’s gastronomic bargains, a six-\ncourse tasting menu that costs 48 euros (about $55). On a recent evening, that\nincluded two Normandy oysters barely warmed through so that they still had a\nbriny bite, sitting on pureéed cress and emulsified vinegar, and cod cooked to\ntender perfection with rosemary honey and aerated sunchokes.There is\nlongstanding mutual admiration between French and Japanese cuisines. Both are\nrefined and highly codified, and revere technique that’s handed down through a\nstrict master-apprentice relationship that is basically the same as that of a\nmedieval guild. Some exceptional French restaurants have opened in Japan over\ntime — out of Tokyo’s 13 restaurants with three Michelin stars, 11 are\nJapanese and two are French — and the food they serve has ignited the\nimaginations of some young cooks.It helps explain why many of the Japanese\nchefs working in France are ingredient fanboys. Lamb, butter, chanterelles:\nWhat was so exotic back home can be picked up at the local markets in\nParis.“Yuzu is easy,” said Mr. Okiyama, the chef at Abri. “I go to shops and\nsee what French people are buying. For example, fennel. I don’t naturally like\nfennel, but I’m trying to understand fennel and to see what flavors I can\nbring out of it, what I can do with it.”Akiko Kawamura, a Japanese journalist\nbased in Paris who writes for Madame Figaro Japon, said, “The difference\nbetween French food and Japanese food is one of addition, one of subtraction.”\nIn French haute cuisine, more is more, with the reductions and sauces that\nform dishes set out to impress you. On the other hand, formal Japanese cuisine\nis more understated, defined by its subtleties.According to Ms. Kawamura, that\nessential distinction is never fully erased. “Young Japanese chefs in France\nare always saying that they use French technique, but they really are doing\ntheir own cooking,” she said.You see that intersection of cuisines at Dersou,\na high-ceiling restaurant in a raw, loftlike space close to the Place de la\nBastille that crackles with animated conversation. The restaurant is known for\nits food and its cocktails. The five-course tasting menu, which is paired with\nfive cocktails, is 95 euros a person.The chef, Taku Sekine, worked at Alain\nDucasse in Tokyo before moving to Paris and cooking at Clown Bar. He starts\nthe meal with a broth served in a Japanese-style soup bowl, and it looks as if\nit could be a part of a kaiseki, but it tastes of France: bouillon de légumes\nwith poulet fermier and brown butter.Mr. Sekine, 35, and the Japanese chefs\nworking in Paris are less an informal group of like-minded expats than a\ncadre. Many worked in the same kitchens (a number cooked at le Comptoir du\nRelais under the exacting chef Yves Camdeborde, or at Vivant Table when it was\nowned by the tastemaker Pierre Jancou), and after hours they gather at the\nsame bars. On Sunday nights, when most restaurants in Paris are closed, you\ncan find them at Clown Bar, which is open.They go to Clown Bar for the\nintimate room, which is as elegant as it is kitschy; for the wine list, which\nis full of obscure and wonderful choices; and for the food, which is\nunmistakably Gallic — turbot with white asparagus, roast pigeon, veal\nsweetbreads. In other words, they gather at Clown Bar for the same reasons\nthey moved to France.\n\n","title":"Japanese Chefs Make Their Mark in Paris - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"A new generation of Japanese chefs has set out to master the art of French cooking https://t.co/intwJCAjBS https://t.co/2qhYLCUWOG","date":"Wed Mar 30 02:56:05 +0000 2016","favs":377,"id":{"$numberLong":"715009675134111744"},"retweets":141},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1Th1Byi"}

(“One part of me can never say never, I could be back\n...but I won’t be _right_ back,” he concluded.)Avicii, 26, became a poster\nchild for the electronic dance musician-as-pop star beginning with his 2011\nhit “Levels,” riding the commercial rise of E.D.M. to six-figure performance\nfees at Las Vegas nightclubs and outdoor festivals. Last year, Forbes named\nhim the sixth-highest-paid D.J. in the world, behind Calvin Harris and Tiësto,\nwith annual earnings of around $19 million. He has released two albums: “True”\nin 2013, and “Stories,” in 2015.In his note, Avicii wrote: “My choices and\ncareer have never been driven by material things, although I’m grateful for\nall the opportunities and comforts my success has availed me. I know I am\nblessed to be able to travel all around the world and perform, but I have too\nlittle left for the life of a real person behind the artist.”He added: “Two\nweeks ago, I took the time to drive across the U.S. with my friends and team,\nto just look and see and think about things in a new way. It really helped me\nrealize that I needed to make the change that I’d been struggling with for a\nwhile.”Avicii has grappled with health problems while on the road. In 2014, he\ncanceled shows after having his gall bladder and appendix removed. Before\nthat, he received a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, which he linked to the\nhard living that comes with working as a touring musician.“You are traveling\naround, you live in a suitcase, you get to this place, there’s free alcohol\neverywhere — it’s sort of weird if you don’t drink,” he told GQ in 2013. “I\njust got into a habit, because you rely on that encouragement and self-\nconfidence you get from alcohol, and then you get dependent on it.”In his note\non Tuesday, Avicii, whose songs have been streamed more than a billion times\non Spotify, thanked his fans and industry colleagues, while noting that his\nsuccesses have come at a young age. “My path has been filled with success but\nit hasn’t come without its bumps,” he wrote. “I’ve become an adult while\ngrowing as an artist, I’ve come to know myself better and realize that there’s\nso much I want to do with my life. I have strong interests in different areas\nbut there’s so little time to explore them.”As of now, Avicii’s last gig is\nscheduled for Aug. 27 at the Creamfields festival in the United Kingdom,\nfollowing a handful of festival appearances in Europe this summer.On Tuesday,\nthe D.J. and producer Steve Angello, formerly of Swedish House Mafia, reached\nout to Avicii on Twitter. “Read your post on touring,” he wrote. “I know how\nhard the decision was but I also know how right it felt once you figured it\nout.

Still, Mr. Obama’s six-year effort to rid the world of loose nuclear\nmaterial has succeeded in pulling bomb-grade fuel out of countries from\nUkraine to Chile, and has firmly put nuclear security on the global agenda.But\ndespite the progress, several countries are balking at safeguards promoted by\nthe United States or are building new stockpiles.President Vladimir V. Putin\nof Russia, where some of the largest stockpiles of civilian nuclear material\nremain, has decided to boycott the summit meeting, which begins Thursday\nnight. Mr. Putin has made it clear he will not engage in nuclear cleanup\nefforts dominated by the United States.In addition, Pakistan’s embrace of a\nnew generation of small, tactical nuclear weapons, which the Obama\nadministration considers highly vulnerable to theft or misuse, has changed the\nway the administration talks about Pakistani nuclear security. While Mr. Obama\ndeclared early in his presidency that the United States believed Pakistan’s\nnuclear assets were secure, administration officials will no longer repeat\nthat line. Instead, when the subject comes up, they note the modest progress\nPakistan has made in training its guards and investing in sensors to detect\nbreak-ins. They refuse to discuss secret talks to persuade the Pakistanis not\nto deploy their new weapons.Pakistan, China, India and Japan are all planning\nnew factories to obtain plutonium that will add to the world’s stockpiles of\nbomb fuel.And Belgium, where a nuclear facility was sabotaged in 2014 and\nwhere nuclear plant workers with inside access went off to fight for the\nIslamic State militant group, has emerged as a central worry. The country is\nso divided and disorganized that many fear it is vulnerable to an attack far\nmore sophisticated than the bombings in the Brussels airport and subway system\nlast week.For the first time, the Nuclear Security Summit will include a\nspecial session on responding to urban terrorist attacks — and a simulation of\nhow to handle the threat of imminent nuclear terrorism.“The key question for\nthis summit,” said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear expert at Harvard and a former\nWhite House science adviser, “is whether they’ll agree on approaches to keep\nthe improvements coming.”The nuclear initiative has been a signature issue for\nMr. Obama: It is among the goals he campaigned on in 2008 and part of the\nreason he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize barely a year into his presidency.\nBenjamin J. Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, told reporters on\nTuesday that the administration’s overall efforts had made it “harder than\never before for terrorists and bad actors to acquire nuclear material.”But the\nadministration’s budget for aiding global nuclear cleanups has been cut by\nhalf; some officials argue that less funding is needed with fewer nations\nwilling to give up nuclear materials. A report Mr. Bunn helped write noted,\n“The administration is now projecting lower spending year after year for years\nto come, postponing or canceling a wide range of nuclear security activities\nthat had been included in previous plans.”In a recent report, the Nuclear\nThreat Initiative, a private advocacy group in Washington that tracks nuclear\nweapons and materials, warned that many radioactive sources were “poorly\nsecured and vulnerable to theft.” The report called the probability of a\nterrorist’s detonating a dirty bomb “much higher than that of an improvised\nnuclear device.”Ingredients for so-called dirty bombs, which use conventional\nexplosives to spew radioactive material, are still scattered around the globe\nat thousands of hospitals and other sites that use the highly radioactive\nsubstances for industrial imaging and medical treatments. Less than half of\nthe countries that attended the last nuclear summit in 2014 pledged to secure\nsuch materials, and they in turn represent less than 15 percent of the 168\nnations belonging to the International Atomic Energy Agency.And while the\nadministration succeeded in getting more than a dozen countries to give up\ntheir civilian stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, a main fuel of atomic\nbombs, the Nuclear Threat Initiative said in another report that some 25\nnations still had such materials — enough for thousands of nuclear weapons.The\nreport called highly enriched uranium “one of the most dangerous materials on\nthe planet,” warning that an amount small enough to fit in a five-pound sugar\nbag could be used to build a nuclear device “with the potential to kill\nhundreds of thousands of people.”Still, that does not mean Mr. Obama’s efforts\nhave failed altogether. He is expected to announce a major achievement soon:\nthe removal of roughly 40 bombs’ worth of highly enriched uranium and\nseparated plutonium from Japan. Some of the uranium was fabricated in pieces\nthe size of squares of chocolate that could be easily slipped into a pocket, a\nterrorist’s dream.And Ukraine was the site of a success that, in retrospect,\nlooks even bigger than it did four years ago.On a bitterly cold day in Kiev,\nthe Ukrainian capital, in March 2012, two years before Ukraine descended into\ncrisis, a team of Americans and Ukrainians packed the last shipment of highly\nenriched uranium into railway cars, ridding the country of more than 500\npounds of nuclear fuel. It would have been enough to build eight or more\nnuclear bombs, depending on the skill and destructive ambitions of the bomb\nmaker.“We had vodka,” recalled Andrew J. Bieniawski, then a United States\nEnergy Department official central to the elimination. “It was amazing.”Yet\nthere are signs that what began as a global effort to prevent terrorists from\nobtaining the world’s deadliest weapons is fracturing.In fact, there is a case\nto be made that even as vulnerable stockpiles have shrunk, the risk of nuclear\nterrorism has not.There is evidence that groups like the Islamic State are\nmore interested than ever in nuclear plants, materials and personnel —\nespecially in Belgium, where the attacks last week killed more than 30\npeople.The Belgian police discovered last year that Islamic State operatives\nhad taken hours of surveillance video at the home of a senior official at a\nlarge nuclear site in Mol, Belgium. The plant in Mol, a northern resort area,\nholds large stocks of highly enriched uranium.Laura Holgate, Mr. Obama’s top\nadviser on nuclear terrorism, noted on Tuesday that the United States had\nworked with Belgium to “reduce the amount of nuclear material” at one key\nsite. Asked about the Islamic State’s interest in obtaining nuclear fuel from\nBelgium, she said, “We don’t have any information that a broader plot\nexists.”Ms. Holgate told reporters that this week’s meeting would address the\nquestion: “How do you sustain the momentum to the summit after the summit\nends?”The results of previous summit meetings have ranged from treaty\nratifications to the establishment of more than a dozen training centers\naround the globe where guards, scientists, managers and regulators sharpen\ntheir skills at preventing atomic terrorism.Near Beijing, one of the largest\ntraining centers opened this month. “It’s in our national interest” to help\nforeigners secure their atomic materials, said Nick Winowich, an engineer at\nSandia National Laboratories, one of the American nuclear labs that helped in\nthe center’s development.The biggest wins have been the removal of all highly\nenriched uranium from 12 countries, including Austria, Chile, Hungary, Libya,\nMexico, Turkey and Vietnam. The material was mostly reactor fuel. But\nofficials said terrorists could have turned it into least 130 nuclear\nweapons.Critics of the summit process point to vague communiqués that seem to\nhave done little to drive hard decisions. A sense of summit fatigue now seems\nto prevail, the critics add, noting that Russia’s withdrawal evades some of\nthe biggest security problems.The Obama administration has also presided over\na steady drop in American spending on international nuclear security. Budgets\nfell from over $800 million in 2012 to just over $500 million in 2016. For\n2017, the White House has proposed less than $400 million — half the spending\nof the high point.The administration has defended the cuts, saying they\nreflect the completion of some programs and upgrades and the suspension of\ncooperative work with Russia after its invasion of the Crimean Peninsula.“The\nsummit process has achieved some very important objectives,” said Kenneth N.\nLuongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a private group that\nadvocates new nuclear safeguards. “But it needed to aim higher. The world is\nnot becoming any easier to deal with. There’s still a responsibility to think\nbig.”\n\n","title":"As Nuclear Security Summit Begins, Materials Remain Vulnerable to Theft - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Tons of materials that terrorists could use to make a small nuclear or dirty bomb remain deeply vulnerable to theft https://t.co/LwGXRRj4g0","date":"Wed Mar 30 02:26:05 +0000 2016","favs":115,"id":{"$numberLong":"715002124162232320"},"retweets":141},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1qgp8nC"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014b0"},"content":"In Detroit’s crumbling schools, where the threat of insolvency means that\nbasic repairs, supplies and even teachers are in short supply, 13 principals\nconspired with a vendor to defraud the system, siphoning away millions of\ndollars, federal agents and prosecutors charged on Tuesday.The principals,\nincluding five who have retired and one who became a district administrator,\nordered supplies like paper, workbooks and chairs from the vendor, and Detroit\nPublic Schools paid the bills. The vendor then delivered only some of the\nsupplies to the schools, and paid $908,518 in kickbacks to the principals,\naccording to documents filed in Federal District Court in Detroit.At a news\nconference, Barbara L. McQuade, the United States attorney for the Eastern\nDistrict of Michigan, said the orders had totaled about $5 million, “and of\nthat, we believe that $2.7 million was fraudulent.”“The real victims in a case\nlike this are, of course, the students and the families who attend Detroit\nPublic Schools,” and honest school employees struggling under tough\nconditions, she said. “A case like this is a real punch in the gut to people\nwho are trying to do the right thing.”The charges implicate a significant\nportion of the school leaders in a district with only about 100 schools,\nadding to the litany of woes in what may be the most troubled big school\nsystem in the country.The system has about 46,000 students, less than one-\nfifth of the enrollment in the 1970s, and about $3.5 billion in debt and\npension obligations. Since 2009, it has been under the control of an emergency\nmanager appointed by the governor.Amid warnings that the district would run\nout of cash in April and be unable to pay employees, the State Legislature\nlast week approved $48.7 million in short-term emergency aid. But lawmakers\nhave not yet agreed on a longer-term rescue that could stave off bankruptcy;\nthe City of Detroit’s recent bankruptcy did not include Detroit Public\nSchools, a separate entity.Teachers have staged a series of sickouts to\nprotest work conditions like crowded classrooms, dilapidated and dirty\nbuildings, and vermin infestation of schools. The district consistently ranks\nnear the bottom among city school systems nationwide in standardized test\nscores.Just weeks ago, another Detroit principal and another vendor pleaded\nguilty in a similar kickback scheme, albeit at schools that were run by a\nstate agency, not Detroit Public Schools. That case led indirectly, through a\ntwo-year investigation by the F.B.I., the I.R.S. and prosecutors, to the one\nannounced Tuesday, officials said.“Here we go again,” Ivy Bailey, the interim\npresident of the Detroit Federation of Teachers, said of the criminal charges\nannounced Tuesday. “Just when you think you can start to fix things, you get\nsomething like this. It’s like you take two steps forward and 50 steps\nback.”The new charges center on Norman Shy, the owner of Allstate Sales, a\nbusiness that sells supplies to schools. He was accused of entering into\nillegal arrangements with the principals one at a time, and it appears that\nthey did not know about one another, prosecutors said.Most of the incidents\ndate from 2009 to 2015, but prosecutors said one fraudulent deal occurred in\n2002.The other main beneficiary, they said, was Clara Flowers, who was accused\nof receiving $324,785 in illicit payments over six years, starting when she\nwas a principal and continuing into her tenure as an assistant superintendent\nof the system.The defendants face felony charges of conspiracy and bribery;\nMs. Flowers and Mr. Shy were also charged with tax evasion.According to the\ncharges, the principals used an array of methods to disguise the kickbacks,\nincluding receiving prepaid gift cards or having payments made to sham\ncompanies they had created.Prosecutors said that some of Mr. Shy’s payments to\nMs. Flowers had gone to a travel agency she owned, and that in other cases, he\nhad paid contractors to do work on her home.Ms. McQuade said the defendants\nhad waived their right to an indictment by a grand jury, so they were charged\nunder documents called “informations.” That often indicates a willingness to\nwork out plea agreements.Lawyers for Mr. Shy and Ms. Flowers did not reply to\nrequests for comment.\n\n","title":"13 Detroit School Principals Charged in Vendor Kickback Scheme - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"13 Detroit school principals charged in vendor kickback scheme https://t.co/1pMvKmOUtL","date":"Wed Mar 30 02:11:04 +0000 2016","favs":125,"id":{"$numberLong":"714998345551491072"},"retweets":139},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1qg5h8e"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014b1"},"content":"We are witnessing a great explosion in the way that human beings are allowed\nto express their gender identities. We are also hearing a lot of awkward\nconversations. What are we supposed to ... call everyone? A recent scene on\nHBO’s “Girls” riffed on this problem, drawing a linguistic fault line down a\nBrooklyn street. On one side is a no-frills coffee joint run by Ray\nPloshansky, the show’s resident grumpy old man. (He’s, like, 38.) Across the\nstreet, a hip new cafe springs up and instantly hoovers up Ray’s\nclientele.When Ray crosses the road to eyeball the competition, he encounters\na barista he can’t quite size up. First he calls the barista “sir,” and the\nbarista balks, “Why’d you feel the need to call me ‘sir’?” So Ray tries\n“female?” and the barista says: “Oh, ‘female’? You a biologist? You a\nbiological essentialist? Are you a detective?” So Ray asks, “What’s going on\nhere?” and a second barista steps in to explain: “What’s going on here is that\nyou offended they, and you offended me, so I think it’s best that you leave.”\nHe does. The baristas embrace.The cafe clash took the language debate of the\nmoment and personified its most extreme positions. On one side are people like\nRay, who come off as clueless and offensive for failing to recalibrate their\nlanguage to accommodate people who don’t identify as “he” or “she.” On the\nother side are “theys” like the barista, who can sound unreasonable and absurd\nwhen they try to police new rules of language that are still in flux. But in\nthe subtext of the scene, a third figure emerged. The barista character was\nplayed by the younger sibling of Lena Dunham, the creator of “Girls”: Grace\nDunham, a young queer writer and performer who identifies as a “trans person\nwith a vagina” and recently wrote on Twitter, “I hate, fear and am allergic to\nbinaries” — and is also game for joking about how hard it can be to get\neverybody on the same page.This registers as a modern problem, but gender-\nneutral pronouns have been proposed for centuries. In 1808, Samuel Taylor\nColeridge suggested repurposing “it” and “which” “in order to avoid\nparticularizing man or woman, or in order to express either sex\nindifferently.” But only recently has mainstream pop culture entertained the\nidea of a neutral pronoun for referring to trans, genderqueer and even some\nfeminist folks who either don’t identify as “he” or “she” or are interested in\ndemolishing that binary in speech. A flurry of totally new constructions has\nemerged to bridge the gap. On Tumblr, it’s now typical for young people to pin\ntheir preferred pronouns to their pages: The writer behind a blog called “The\nGayest Seabass” identifies as “Danny, xe/xim/xir or he/him/his or\nthey/them/their, taken-ish, 20.”Lynn Liben, a psychologist at Penn State, has\nstudied the effects of gender-coded language — English weaves it in by way of\npronouns (she, his) but also identifying nouns (girl, uncle) and honorifics\n(Mr. and Mrs.) — for about 15 years. In a pair of studies conducted in\npreschool classrooms in 2008 and 2010, Liben found that when teachers\nemphasize a gender divide in speech — like saying, “Good morning, boys and\ngirls” — children adopt more intense stereotypes about what boys and girls are\nsupposed to do, and become less likely to play with children of a different\ngender at recess. “When they see adults talk about gender as a category\nsystem,” Liben says, “kids become more vigilant about making the distinction\nthemselves.” Jill Soloway, creator of the Amazon series “Transparent,” is a\nfan of “they” as a corrective to that phenomenon. “A really interesting\nthought exercise is to say ‘they’ and ‘them’ for all genders,” she told The\nNew Yorker recently. “The promise of this revolution is not having to say,\n‘Men do this, women do this.’ ”These gender-neutral constructions, which not\nso long ago may have sounded odd or even unthinkable to traditionalists, are\nbecoming accepted as standard English. The Washington Post is one of the first\nto have taken up the cause, welcoming the singular “they” into the paper’s\nstylebook late last year. And in January, the American Dialect Society voted\nthe singular “they” its 2015 Word of the Year, noting its “emerging use as a\npronoun to refer to a known person, often as a conscious choice by a person\nrejecting the traditional gender binary of he and she.”But central to the\nappeal of the singular “they” is that it’s often deployed _unconsciously_.\nIt’s regularly repurposed as a linguistic crutch when an individual’s gender\nis unknown or irrelevant. You might use it to refer to a hypothetical person\nwho, say, goes to the store and forgets “their” wallet. That casual usage has\na long history — it has appeared in Chaucer, Shakespeare, Austen and Shaw. It\nwasn’t until 1745, when the schoolmistress-turned-grammar-expert Ann Fisher\nproposed “he” as a universal pronoun for a person of unknown gender, that the\nuse of “they” in the same circumstance was respun as grammatically incorrect.\n“The Masculine Person answers to the general Name, which comprehends both Male\nand Female; as, any Person who knows what he says,” she wrote.It’s precisely\nthe vagueness of “they” that makes it a not-so-ideal pronoun replacement. It\ncan obscure a clear gender identification with a blurred one. Think of\ngenderqueer people who are confident in their knowledge of their own gender\nidentity as one that simply doesn’t fit the boxes of “he” or “she”: Calling\nall of them “they” can make it sound as if someone’s gender is unknowable;\nit’s the grammatical equivalent of a shrug. In December, the Post copy editor\nBill Walsh called “they” “the only sensible solution to English’s lack of a\ngender-neutral third-person singular personal pronoun,” with “sensible” being\nthe key word. The singular “they” gained favor with The Post’s standard-bearer\npartly because the presumptive “he” “hasn’t been palatable for decades,” but\nalso because a generic “she” feels “patronizing” and “attempts at made-up\npronouns” — like “xe,” “xim,” and “xir” — strike Walsh as “silly.” The New\nYork Times hasn’t officially adopted “they,” but The Times’s standards editor,\nPhillip B. Corbett, thinks it’s likely to earn a place in the paper’s\nstylebook as usage evolves. “Eventually, I assume, certain forms will become\nwidely adopted, and that’s the point when it would make sense for us to set\nout formal style rules,” he told me. “My guess — just a guess — is that ‘they’\nis far more likely to become the default pronoun in these cases, rather than\n‘xe’ or other neologisms.”A 2014 dispatch in The Economist in favor of “they”\nargued that “pronouns (unlike nouns and verbs) are a ‘closed class’ of words,\nalmost never admitting new members.” (The Economist’s style guide, by the way,\nstill calls the honorific Ms. an “ugly” word.) If the point of the gender-\nneutral pronoun is to get hulking institutions like The Washington Post and\nThe Economist to become comfortable with a concept that currently strikes\ntraditional folks as incomprehensible — the rejection of the gender binary —\nthen “they” feels a little bit like a shortcut on the way to acceptance. It\nrepresents a third option outside the binary, sure. But it doesn’t compel\npeople to make mental room for a new word.The media guide for “transgender\nissues” by Glaad, a lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy group,\nadvises reporters to use whatever pronoun their subjects prefer. If they don’t\nprefer “they,” using it anyway feels like an erasure of their own identity in\nfavor of society’s new standardized label. In a very real way, accepting the\nfluidity of gender requires rejecting standards in general. It means opening\nour “closed class” of pronouns. In “The Argonauts,” Maggie Nelson’s memoir of\ngender and language, she acknowl­edges “the Aristotelian, perhaps evolutionary\nneed to put everything into categories,” but embraces another need “to pay\nhomage to the transitive, the flight, the great soup of being in which we\nactually live.” It’s hard to sum it all up in a word.__\n\n","title":"Who’s ‘They’? - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Using \"they\" as a gender-neutral pronoun feels \"a little bit like a shortcut\" https://t.co/uMfi7J63AF via @nytmag","date":"Wed Mar 30 01:51:24 +0000 2016","favs":196,"id":{"$numberLong":"714993397099061248"},"retweets":97},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25uKVZ9"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014b2"},"content":"_Oklahoma and neighboring states have been grappling with an increase in\nearthquakes tied to the boom in oil and gas production over the past 15 years.\n__Adam Nagourney, the Los Angeles bureau chief for The New York Times, and\n__Michael Wines, who has covered this subject, __ discussed Monday’s report\nthat because of these man-made quakes, Oklahoma is as much at risk for a\ndamaging quake as California. Here is an excerpt from their\nconversation:_**MICHAEL WINES:** Kansans and Oklahomans like to say they are\ncool in the face of nature’s wrath — twisters put quakes to shame, some have\nbragged to me — but the truth is that the last few years of shaking there has\na lot of people rattled, so to speak. Now the United States Geological Survey\ncomes out with a map that quantifies the chances of a damaging quake in the\nnext year, and for parts of northern and central Oklahoma and southern Kansas,\nit’s somewhere between one in about eight and one in 10 — about the same as\nyour state. And just a few hours ago, there were two fairly big ones —\nmagnitudes 3.6 and 4.2 — just north of Oklahoma City, which had been fairly\nquiet in recent months. Any advice for them?**ADAM NAGOURNEY:** I’ll try to\nresist the “our catastrophic threat is worse than yours” instinct but, well,\nI’m afraid it probably is. The most discomforting things about earthquakes,\nI’ve found, is that there is no warning; I’ve never heard of anything called\nan earthquake siren. You’ll find no end to people talking about earthquake\nweather, or how dogs will begin howling a few seconds before a big one\nstrikes, but I wouldn’t count on it. The threat of earthquakes is just part of\nliving in California. I suppose you could move someplace else, but there are\nthings one can do to at least prepare for them.**WINES**: You’re right about\nthe threat: In Oklahoma, the Big One probably would be to the San Francisco\nquake what my two Aussies are to a snarling Doberman pinscher. One of the\nbiggest quakes in state history, in 2011, totaled a dozen or so houses and\ndamaged a lot more, but nobody died. The forecast that federal scientists\nissued on Monday is not as scary as it seems at first glance. Mostly, they are\nsaying that the region is likely going to suffer more of the plaster-\nfracturing, driveway-cracking quakes that have been a costly nuisance for some\ntime. But they don’t rule out something more serious, and a lot of scientists\nI’ve talked to say the potential for a shock more damaging than past ones is\nnot insignificant. The Plains-state geology transmits shaking better than\nCalifornia dirt. And most important, maybe, Oklahoma buildings haven’t been\nquake-proofed like yours.**NAGOURNEY: **I wish I could say that about\nbuildings being quake-proofed here. One thing I’ve noticed: Earthquake\nprotection talk becomes front-burner in the first few weeks after a noticeable\ntemblor, but it’s not long before people just forget. But finally San\nFrancisco, Los Angeles and Santa Monica, to name the main players, have all\nenacted measures requiring the retrofitting — that’s the term of art, and if\npeople living in Oklahoma or Kansas don’t know it now, they will soon enough —\nof buildings.Here in California, that includes what are known as soft-story\nbuildings, such as small apartment buildings held up by a few pillars to make\nroom for a garage on the first floor that have proved to be very vulnerable to\ncollapse, as we saw in the 1994 Northridge earthquake. Also at risk are older\nconcrete buildings; later ones were required to include steel reinforcing bars\nthat provide added protection against collapse. The Los Angeles Times did an\ninvestigation a few years back that suggested that as many as 1,000 buildings\nmight be in danger of tumbling in a big earthquake. Admirable journalism, to\nbe sure, but not very comforting to those of us working on the ninth floor of\nan office building on Wilshire Boulevard.**WINES:** The most unnerving thing\nabout Oklahoma, as we’ve written, is that one fault sits more or less directly\nbeneath one of the world’s largest oil-storage facilities, a tank farm of\ngargantuan proportions. And it certainly hasn’t been retrofitted. Beat that,\nCalifornia.**NAGOURNEY:** There are always fears about an earthquake at a\nnuclear facility, but I think what people are really afraid of — and what Eric\nGarcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles, who has made earthquake preparation a\ncentral part of his legacy, has warned about — is a catastrophic earthquake\nthat essentially shuts down his city by cutting off water and power for as\nmuch as six months. His worry, and the concern of other earthquake experts —\nthere is a cottage industry of them here — is that could lead to people giving\nup on Los Angeles and moving to firmer ground.It could also lead to\ncatastrophic fires that could go unchecked because fire authorities don’t have\nwater to put them out. The worst-case scenario, which people insist will\nhappen someday, is pretty alarming. That said, you might want to ask, why do\npeople keep living here, and how do they deal with it?**WINES:** I was in your\nstate writing about water not long ago, and the big worry indeed was that a\nquake would wreck the aqueduct network that carries water from rainy Northern\nCalifornia to the south. The big worry in Oklahoma is about another liquid:\noil. Scientists say you can’t stop the quakes without cutting back drastically\non the amount of wastewater pumped back into the ground, but the oil and gas\nindustry can’t pump up the good stuff without bringing a torrent of wastewater\nwith it, and if there’s no place to put it, pumping has to stop, or at least\nbe dialed way back.The prospect that Oklahoma’s cash cow might have to run dry\nto stop the tremors all but paralyzed state officials for years. You had the\nodd spectacle of hopping-mad citizens demanding action even as the governor\nruminated that, well, maybe something else is making the state shake. Kansas,\nmeanwhile, deemed quakes an imminent threat to the public and ordered steep\ncutbacks in waste disposal a year ago.**NAGOURNEY: **Well, for what it’s\nworth, let me tell our Oklahoma and Kansas readers what it’s like to live in a\npart of the land that is subject to the Big One. First, on the serious side,\nthere is an ongoing effort to make sure everyone is prepared with an\nearthquake kit. I’m guessing people who live in tornado country know the\ndrill, but I have, in the back of my car, enough water to last a week,\nbatteries, flashlights, a transistor radio (remember those?), a satellite\nphone, some cans of food, crackers, a blanket, a first aid kit. There are also\nannual shake-out drills, where people practice what they do during an\nearthquake. (Please, do not stand under any door frames or go running outside:\nThat is _so_ 1960s. “Drop, cover and hold on” is the mantra).**WINES: **That’s\nexactly what federal officials are telling Oklahomans and Kansans to do:\nPrepare for a big quake, even if it might never come. And people may be doing\nthat, but I haven’t seen much anecdotal evidence of it yet. What about\nCalifornians? Do they see earthquakes as an imminent threat, or are they just\nthe Golden State’s version of the Plains states’ tornadoes, a nasty but\nunavoidable routine in life?**NAGOURNEY:** To me, as a reporter covering\nCalifornia, the most intriguing part of this is the psychological aspect, how\npeople come to terms with living in a place where, if experts are to be\nbelieved — and I do believe them — it’s just a matter of time till there is a\nhuge earthquake. It says a lot about the human condition, I think (and also a\nlot about what a cool place California is to live). Of course, some people\ndon’t want to deal with it; there was a bit of an exodus after the 1994\nearthquakes. Others are practical, making sure they are prepared and realizing\nthat the odds are against them dying in an earthquake.That said, perhaps not\nsurprisingly, the two most common defense reactions I’ve found are denial and\nhumor. Whenever there is a minor earthquake, the “did you feel that?” tweets\nand blog headlines are everywhere. By the way, earthquakes are a regular topic\nat dinner party conversations — brought up alike by relative newbies like me\nand by people who have spent their life here. And consider this: The Los\nAngeles City Council has declared today Lucy Jones Day. Never heard of Lucy\nJones? Well, around these parts, she is nothing short of a celebrity, known as\nthe “Earthquake Lady.” For nearly a quarter-century, she has been the go-to\nperson for everyone, including most recently Mr. Garcetti, looking for\ninformation on the latest earthquake. She is retiring after 33 years as a\nseismologist with the Geological Survey.\n\n","title":"Considering Earthquake Threats in California and Oklahoma - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTNational: Oklahoma joins California as a major quake-prone zone.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014b3"},"content":"BEIJING — An anonymous letter calling on President Xi Jinping to resign for\nthe good of China and his own safety seemed to be digital rumor-mongering when\nit appeared on the Internet this month. It spread by email and lingered on a\nsmall domestic Chinese news site before it was removed.But the response from\nBeijing has been anything but dismissive.Surprising even some hardened\ncritics, Mr. Xi’s security forces have overseen a far-reaching inquisition to\nroot out the culprits behind the letter, resorting to measures that have drawn\nmore attention than the letter itself. They have detained at least 11 people,\nincluding relatives in China of two exiled writers accused of spreading or\npromoting the letter.Mr. Xi’s handlers have sought to give him an aura of\nunshakable dominance. But the unusually severe response to what might be\nnothing more than an outlandish Internet ruse suggests some anxiety about his\nhold on power, including among security officials keen to show their loyalty\nand avoid any hint of exposing him to danger, experts said.“The response has\nshown how jittery they are,” said Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese politics\nat King’s College, London. “The fear seems to be that these views might be\ntaken as representative of real elite figures.”Xiao Qiang, an adjunct\nprofessor at the University of California, Berkeley, who monitors Chinese\nmedia for the website China Digital Times, attributed the response in part to\nthe letter’s unusual phrasing. “Bluff or true, this tone sounds more like coup\nplotters talking to the leader they want to depose, rather than an open letter\nwith dissenting political views,” he said.There is no evidence that any coup\nplot could be in the works. Mr. Xi appears firmly in control; this week he has\nbeen visiting the Czech Republic, and he is scheduled to arrive in Washington\non Thursday for a nuclear security meeting.But the government’s alarmed\nreaction has highlighted the alternating pulls of swaggering confidence\nprojected outward and internal anxiety about political control driving Mr. Xi\nto stamp down harder on critics, said several people embroiled in or closely\nwatching the inquiry.“Xi Jinping wants full control, and for the letter to\nappear on a domestic website marked a loss of control,” said Zhang Ping, a\nChinese journalist and rights advocate living in Germany, whose siblings have\nbeen detained in southwest China as part of the investigation.Mr. Zhang, who\nwrites under the pen name Chang Ping, said two younger brothers were held by\nthe police in Sichuan Province after his immediate family and even distant\nrelatives were told to tell him to remove from the Internet an essay he wrote\ncondemning the detention of a Chinese journalist, Jia Jia, possibly over the\nletter. Mr. Zhang said his younger sister was also missing, almost certainly\ndetained.Mr. Zhang said it would be impossible to take down the essay, which\nwas published on a Chinese-language website of Deutsche Welle, the German news\nservice. Mr. Jia has since been released.The police initially said Mr. Zhang’s\nbrothers were suspected of illegally starting a fire by burning joss sticks\nand paper at ancestral graves.On Tuesday, the Sichuan police also issued a\nletter, purporting to be from one of Mr. Zhang’s detained brothers, Zhang Wei,\nin which Zhang Wei said that the family had urged Zhang Ping to stop\ncriticizing the party and that they were “very angry” with him for saying his\nsiblings had been detained for political reasons.“If my brother were free, he\nwould not have said that,” Mr. Zhang said in response to the statement. “The\npolice are using my brothers as hostages to first blackmail me and then attack\nme.”Wen Yunchao, a Chinese writer and rights activist living in New York, has\nsaid that his parents and younger brother in southern China were also detained\nby the police after being pressed to tell him to admit to spreading the letter\nonline. He has refused, adamantly denying disseminating the letter.The letter\nappeared online on March 4, just before China’s national legislature started\nits annual session. It lays out accusations against Mr. Xi from “loyal\nCommunist Party members,” using a mix of old-school party jargon and liberal\ncriticisms that makes its true authorship difficult to discern.Mr. Xi has\namassed too much power, betraying the party’s recent traditions of collective\ndecision-making, it says. He has abandoned the calibrated foreign policy of\nDeng Xiaoping for dangerous adventurism, it continues, and has turned the news\nmedia into servile tools for promoting his own image.“Comrade Xi Jinping, you\ndo not possess the abilities to lead the party and the country into the\nfuture,” it says.This is not the first time that an anonymous online message\nhas rattled party leaders.In 2011, the government of Hu Jintao, Mr. Xi’s\npredecessor, ordered a sweeping crackdown and tightened Internet censorship\nafter anonymous messages spread online calling on citizens to join a peaceful\n“Jasmine Revolution” inspired by uprisings across the Middle East.But the hunt\nfor the letter’s authors suggests Mr. Xi is taking security controls to\ngreater lengths.“They’re extending their hands abroad,” Su Yutong, a Chinese\njournalist and rights advocate based in Bonn, Germany, said by telephone. “We\nwere receiving attention before, but now even more.”The security authorities\nappear to be using the investigation into the letter to target young exiled\nactivists adept at using the Internet to spread news and stay in touch with\npeople and events in China, she said.“For a town police station in an isolated\npart of China to demand that German media, Deutsche Welle, remove an article\nof mine, that’s absurd,” said Mr. Zhang, the writer in Germany. “It wouldn’t\nhave happened before.”Chinese officials were probably most upset by the\nletter’s suggestion that Mr. Xi and his family faced personal peril, said Mr.\nXiao, the Chinese media expert. The letter demands that Mr. Xi resign “out of\nconcern for the party’s endeavors, out of concern for the future of the\ncountry and its people, and also out of concern for the personal safety of you\nand your family.”It was first published online by Canyu, or Participation, a\nChinese-language website based in the United States that specializes in news\nabout human rights cases and commentary critical of the Chinese Communist\nParty.Cai Chu, the chief editor at Canyu, said he and colleagues received the\nanonymous letter by email on March 3. Mr. Cai declined to describe the email\naddress it came from, citing the need to protect the safety of those who\nsubmitted the letter.“To judge from the contents of the open letter, it may be\nthe work of an elderly gentleman,” Mr. Cai said in emailed answers to\nquestions. “Whether it was possibly written by old party members can only be\nguessed at, not determined.”The letter appeared next on the website of Wujie,\na domestic Chinese news website. Wujie quickly removed it. But editors and\ntechnicians there have vanished, possibly detained, and precedent suggests the\nsite will be shut down.“The investigators are probably trying to figure out\nwhat technological loophole allowed the letter to appear on Wujie, and they\nwant to figure out if the loophole was deliberate,” said Zhao Hui, a writer in\nsouthern China who uses the pen name Mo Zhixu. “I guess they suspect a\nconspiracy here.”Mr. Cai said he received a new letter on Monday claiming to\nbe a petition of 171 “loyal party members” urging Mr. Xi to quit. He said he\nchose not to publish that one. He said: “As it was also anonymous, it lacks\ncredibility.”\n\n","title":"Anonymous Call for Xi to Quit Rattles Party Leaders in China - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Anonymous call for President Xi Jinping to quit rattles party leaders in China https://t.co/n4zhK2FJlw","date":"Wed Mar 30 00:07:04 +0000 2016","favs":101,"id":{"$numberLong":"714967140324012032"},"retweets":79},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21SioYQ"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014b4"},"content":"Donald J. Trump’s presidential campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was\ncharged with battery Tuesday by the police in Jupiter, Fla., who said he had\ngrabbed a reporter this month as she tried to ask Mr. Trump a question.His\nformal arrest was detailed in a police report that cited new security-camera\nimages of the episode, which show Mr. Lewandowski roughly pulling the\nreporter, Michelle Fields, out of his way — despite his vigorous denials that\nhe ever touched her and his repeated attacks on her credibility.Mr.\nLewandowski, who turned himself in on the misdemeanor charge, was quickly\nreleased. But the incident, the way the campaign has dealt with it, and the\nnew photographic images refuting Mr. Lewandowski’s and Mr. Trump’s versions of\nevents seemed to encapsulate much of what has made Mr. Trump’s campaign like\nno other.For much of the past year, fact-checkers have struggled to keep up\nwith the frequent truth-stretching and wholesale inaccuracies of Mr. Trump and\nhis campaign, with little discernible effect on his support among a large\nportion of the Republican electorate. But on Tuesday, the new video — taken\nfrom security cameras at a Trump property — confronted the Republican front-\nrunner with a different kind of challenge: hard-to-discount visual evidence\ndirectly contradicting him, looping over and over again on cable news and news\nwebsites.Moreover, the allegation of violence came as Mr. Trump faces\naccusations that he incites or condones violence against protesters at his\nrallies.It offered a reminder that Mr. Trump, a candidate whose own\ncommunications, whether on Twitter or on television, can often be menacing in\ntone, has entrusted his White House bid to a political operative whose\nbelligerence extends to physicality. On March 19, Mr. Lewandowski was captured\non video grabbing a protester by the shirt collar at a Trump rally in Arizona\nand yanking him backward — normally the work of security guards, not a top\npolitical adviser.To Mr. Trump, Ms. Fields was out of bounds, and his campaign\nmanager was the victim.“The news conference was over, and she was running up\nand grabbing and asking questions,” he said late Tuesday, in the first of\nseveral recapitulations of the episode. “She wasn’t supposed to be doing\nthat.”But Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Lewandowski’s depiction of Ms. Fields as a drama\nqueen faking an injury — “How do you know those bruises weren’t there before?”\nMr. Trump asked — risked a new level of fallout for a candidate repeatedly\naccused of making misogynistic remarks who polls show is already viewed\nnegatively by an overwhelming number of American women.Mr. Lewandowski, in the\nweeks since the March 8 encounter, repeatedly denigrated Ms. Fields as\n“delusional” and “an attention seeker.” And Mr. Trump, on Tuesday, redoubled\nthe attack on Ms. Fields’s credibility, saying, “Wouldn’t you think she would\nhave yelled out a scream if she had bruises on her arm?”The man whose\ncatchphrase on the television show “The Apprentice” was “You’re fired!” said\nthat it would be easy to fire Mr. Lewandowski, but that it wasn’t his way. “I\ndon’t discard people,” Mr. Trump said.Nita Chaudhary, a co-founder of\nUltraViolet, an advocacy group that fights sexism, denounced Mr. Trump for\nsticking by Mr. Lewandowski. “What Donald Trump is doing fits the very\ndefinition of victim blaming, and it is not only unacceptable, it is actively\ndangerous,” she said. “They are belittling Michelle Fields’s claim despite\noverwhelming evidence.”She added: “Comments like this essentially perpetuate\nviolence against women.”All told, it was the latest in a series of self-\ninflicted wounds by Mr. Trump’s campaign, and effectively upstaged his much-\nballyhooed rally in the Wisconsin hometown of Representative Paul D. Ryan, the\nHouse speaker — scheduled after Mr. Ryan sharply condemned Mr. Trump’s\nrhetoric.Mr. Lewandowski’s arrest prompted renewed criticism from Mr. Trump’s\nrivals in both parties. Alice Stewart, a spokeswoman for Senator Ted Cruz, Mr.\nTrump’s chief rival, said “abusive behavior” seemed to be “part of the culture\nof the Trump campaign.”“Personal attacks, verbal attacks and now physical\nattacks have no place in politics or anywhere else in our society,” she\nsaid.And the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, told reporters that Mr.\nTrump had for months been “inciting violent behavior, aggressive behavior that\nI think is very dangerous.” She added that Ms. Fields “deserves a lot of\ncredit for following through on the way she was physically manhandled.”The\nepisode involving Ms. Fields set off an incendiary dispute within Breitbart\nNews, the conservative website where she worked and that has at times been a\nvocal champion of Mr. Trump. Several of its journalists resigned after\naccusing management of failing to support Ms. Fields, who resigned on March\n14, six days after the episode.Before her resignation, one of Breitbart’s top\nexecutives, Joel B. Pollak, publicly questioned the veracity of her claims. On\nTuesday, after Mr. Lewandowski’s arrest, Mr. Pollak wrote on Twitter, “Clearly\nI was wrong.”The incident in question occurred  on March 8, as Mr. Trump’s\nvictories in the so-called Super Tuesday contests on March 1 gave way to more\nmixed results in subsequent contests. As he made his way out of a crowded room\nafter a news conference at Trump National Golf Club, Ms. Fields approached\nhim.Ms. Fields said she was trying to ask Mr. Trump a question about\naffirmative action when Mr. Lewandowski grabbed her and nearly knocked her off\nher feet. She posted on Twitter a picture of finger-shaped bruises on her\narm.Mr. Lewandowski denied touching her, but Ms. Fields pressed charges three\ndays later. The investigating officer, Detective Marc Bujnowski, took\nstatements from her and from a Washington Post reporter, Ben Terris, who was a\nwitness.Security video footage from the Trump golf club “parallels what Fields\nhad told me,” the detective wrote: Mr. Lewandowski “grabbed Fields left arm\nwith his right hand, causing her to turn and step back.”Indeed, the new\nsecurity-camera images show Mr. Lewandowski reaching for and then grabbing Ms.\nFields’s arm, tugging at her clothing as he pulls her, then walking ahead of\nher as she reacts, close behind Mr. Trump. The entire episode takes less than\nfour seconds.Mr. Lewandowski turned himself in at the headquarters of the\nJupiter Police Department at 8:10 a.m. on Tuesday. He was charged with one\ncount of simple battery and given a court date of May 4 in Palm Beach Gardens,\nFla.A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, Hope Hicks, said Tuesday that Mr. Lewandowski\nwas “absolutely innocent of this charge,” that he would plead not guilty and\nthat he had not been arrested but had merely been issued a “notice to\nappear.”But Officer Joseph Beinlich, a spokesman for the department, said\notherwise. “A notice to appear is an actual arrest,” he said.Mr. Lewandowski,\n42, has been a combative and sometimes divisive figure in Mr. Trump’s circle.\nHe has been known to scream and curse at reporters with regularity, putting\nsome on a “blacklist” for coverage he considers unfavorable.In 1999, as chief\nof staff to Bob Ney, then a Republican representative from Ohio, Mr.\nLewandowski was charged with a misdemeanor when he took a pistol into a\ncongressional office building. He said then that it had been an accident. The\npolice seized the weapon, prompting him to sue unsuccessfully in federal\ncourt, claiming he had been stripped of his gun without due process.Before his\nlate-afternoon remarks on Mr. Lewandowski’s behalf, Mr. Trump responded to his\narrest in a string of midday Twitter posts.“Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my\ncampaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a\nreporter. Look at tapes — nothing there!” he wrote in one.In another, Mr.\nTrump appeared to raise questions about Ms. Fields’s veracity, asking why\npeople were not looking at her “earliest statement as to what happened,” from\n“before she found out the episode was on tape.”To which Ms. Fields responded\nin her own Twitter post: “Because my story never changed. Seriously, just stop\nlying.”\n\n","title":"Corey Lewandowski, Donald Trump’s Campaign Manager, Is Charged With Battery - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Police charged Trump’s campaign manager with battery and released images of him grabbing a reporter https://t.co/gW2vr2ejUe","date":"Tue Mar 29 23:49:28 +0000 2016","favs":271,"id":{"$numberLong":"714962712334352384"},"retweets":236},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1qfBRae"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014b7"},"content":"For more than 24 hours last week, Cody Lee Miller perched in a giant sequoia\ntree in downtown Seattle, pelting people and cars with pine cones and tearing\noff branches to throw like spears into the street below.Investigators said Mr.\nMiller harmed the 90-foot tree, and they have come up with a figure for the\ndamage, using a complicated formula that goes far beyond the value of natural\nbeauty.A Seattle tree expert, Darren Morgan, said Mr. Miller caused $7,800 in\ndamage, according to court documents released this week. Investigators took\ninto account the tree’s age, its potential life span and how much of its lush\nfoliage was denuded.The formula, created by professional foresters, goes like\nthis. The trunk is 34 inches in diameter at breast height, an investigators’\nreport said. The tree has a “95 percent species rating,” a “100 percent\ncondition rating” and a “100 percent location rating,” Mr. Morgan was quoted\nas noting in his calculations.The sequoia’s pre-damage value was put at\n$51,700. But after Mr. Miller’s arboreal escapade, the tree lost 15 percent of\nits value, the documents show, and was now worth $43,900, the report said.“The\ndamage to the tree was extensive,” the report said.Mr. Miller was charged on\nMonday with first-degree malicious mischief and third-degree assault. He was\nalso ordered to stay away from the tree by observing “no unwanted contact”\nwith it, according to the documents released by King County Superior Court.It\nwas not immediately clear if Mr. Miller would be responsible for paying for\nthe damage to the tree, but any charge of first-degree malicious mischief\nrequires prosecutors to show there was property damage of more than\n$5,000.Giant sequoias grow fast and live a long time, usually up to 3,200\nyears in the wild, but in an urban setting, their life span is curtailed to\n200 to 300 years, according to the investigation report.The Seattle\nTransportation Department planted the sequoia when it was 20 feet tall in the\nearly 1970s near a Macy’s store at Fourth Avenue and Stewart Street. Officials\nfought to save it in 2010, when experts questioned whether it could survive in\nits city environment.Mr. Miller, 28, who is from Oregon, climbed the tree\nabout 11 a.m. on March 22. When a few police officers arrived, he refused to\ndescend.Over the next 24 hours, Mr. Miller’s day in the sequoia became a local\nand national spectacle, fueled by a #ManInTree Twitter hashtag and a live\nvideo feed of the situation. About 70 officers and negotiators, some using\nladders, tried to coax him to the ground. An impromptu fan club grew around\nthe tree as people held up signs defending his apparent pursuit of solitude.He\nthrew pine cones and other objects at law enforcement officers, pedestrians\nand firefighters, striking three officers, the documents said. He also threw\nan apple at a passer-by and a metal ring affixed to the top of the tree for\nChristmas decorations at rescuers, the court documents said.There were minor\ninjuries.By the time he climbed down, apparently without injury, on March 23,\nMr. Miller had snapped off most of the branches at the top of the tree.In\naddition to the $7,800 damage tally, there was an “incalculable” waste of time\nand services by the officers who worked at the scene, the charging documents\nsaid.In an interview with The Seattle Times this week, Mr. Miller’s mother,\nLisa Gossett, said she had not talked to her son for about five years when a\nfriend called saying he was in the news. She said she hardly recognized\nhim.“There are all these people out there worried about the tree, but they’re\nnot worried about him, the human,” she said. “He’s obviously sick.”\n\n","title":"Damage After Man Climbs and Camps in Seattle Tree? $7,800 - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Damage after man climbs and camps in Seattle tree? $7,800 https://t.co/pyMn9GW4MK https://t.co/ReVG70hMoM","date":"Tue Mar 29 22:56:04 +0000 2016","favs":164,"id":{"$numberLong":"714949273377501185"},"retweets":97},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1ThknW9"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014b8"},"content":"WASHINGTON — Two months ahead of a federal court hearing on President Obama’s\nsignature climate change rule, a coordinated public relations offensive has\nbegun — modeled after the same-sex marriage campaign — to influence the\noutcome of the case.A national coalition of liberal and environmental advocacy\ngroups, state attorneys general, mayors and even some businesses are adhering\nto the strategy that a network of gay rights and other advocacy groups began\nin the months before the Supreme Court heard arguments in the same-sex\nmarriage case, Obergefell v. Hodges, last year. Those advocates cannot be\ncertain, but they said they believed it had influenced the opinions of the\njustices, who ruled in June that the Constitution guarantees a right to same-\nsex marriage.While such campaigns are common before major Supreme Court\narguments, it is unusual to see a national effort aimed at a lower court\nhearing. But the climate change case, West Virginia v. the United States\nEnvironmental Protection Agency, to be argued June 2 before the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, is unusual.“The reason\nthere is all this focus is that this is arguably the most important\nenvironmental regulation ever,” said Richard L. Revesz, the director of the\nInstitute for Policy Integrity at the New York University School of Law. This\nweek, the institute and several other groups will file briefs in support of\nthe E.P.A.’s position in the case.At stake is a sweeping federal rule intended\nto cut the emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases from coal-fired power\nplants. While environmentalists see the rule as the largest step ever taken by\nthe United States to tackle climate change, the coal industry sees it as a\nhuge threat.If enacted, the rule could shut down hundreds of coal-fired power\nplants and rapidly escalate wind and solar power, transforming the American\nelectricity industry. The rule also provided Mr. Obama with a pivotal tool\nduring negotiations of last year’s Paris Accord, the first deal committing\naction from every country in the world to fight climate change. If the rule\nunravels, it could severely weaken that global pact.Meanwhile, the vacancy on\nthe Supreme Court after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last month has\nalso heightened the national impact of decisions by lower courts. If the\ndecision by the Federal Circuit Court is appealed to the Supreme Court — as is\nwidely expected — and the eight justices are evenly split, the decision of the\nlower court will stand.“If the Supreme Court is divided 4 to 4, it would make\nsense that you want to pour resources into the outcome of the lower court, if\nthat’s the one that’s going to matter at the end of the day,” said Allison Orr\nLarsen, a law professor at the William and Mary Law School.The campaign by the\nadvocates kicked off Tuesday morning, timed to highlight the E.P.A.’s Monday\nafternoon filing of its legal briefs in the case and an expected Tuesday court\nfiling by about 20 states and other outside groups, such as the Sierra Club\nand Natural Resources Defense Council, which support the rule.Even more groups\nplanned to file briefs this week in support of the administration. In New\nYork, Al Gore, the environmental advocate and former vice president, joined\nseveral state attorneys general, led by the New York attorney general, Eric\nSchneiderman, at a news conference supporting the Obama administration’s\nposition.The groups backing the administration began posting quotable excerpts\nfrom the legal briefs on Twitter and Facebook on Tuesday. Several more such\nevents are planned for this week, and the public relations push will escalate\nfor the next eight weeks, culminating in a rally outside the federal\ncourthouse on the day of the hearing.The White House is aware of the campaign,\nbut is not coordinating with the groups or planning any messaging of its own,\nsaid Thomas Reynolds, who until last week directed climate change\ncommunications efforts for the White House, but this week moved back to a\nsimilar position at the E.P.A.While developing the campaign, the environmental\nadvocates closely examined the messaging tactics of the same-sex marriage\nefforts — particularly the message that the issue affects individual lives\nbeyond the gay community.“On gay marriage, it was that everyone has a friend,\na neighbor, a sibling who could be impacted,” said Joshua Dorner, a strategist\nat the Washington political communications firm SKDKnickerbocker, who worked\non the same-sex marriage public relations campaigns ahead of the Supreme Court\nargument. The same message could be applied to a campaign on climate change,\n“showing how it directly impacts people’s lives,” he said.To that end, the\nenvironmentalists will deploy several mayors, like Dawn Zimmer of Hoboken,\nN.J., who will speak at news conferences over the coming months in support of\nthe climate rule.“After Hurricane Sandy, we had senior citizens stranded in\ntheir apartments who couldn’t get medicine,” she said. “Substations were\nflooded, and we were without power for two weeks. The threat to Hoboken from\nclimate change and rising sea levels is very real, and the predictions are\nit’s getting worse.”But the plaintiffs in the case, including over two dozen\nstates and the nation’s largest coal companies, are not planning a similar\npublic campaign. Those groups began planning their legal attack on the\nadministration’s climate change rules long before they were made final, and\nare expected to focus their attention on the legal arguments.“There’s people\non both sides of the aisle who specialize in this kind of thing, but the idea\nthat you’re going to affect these judges on the D.C. Circuit and their clerks\nis ridiculous,” said Michael McKenna, a Republican energy lobbyist who is\nclosely involved in the legal and public relations strategy for the coal\ncompanies. “It may work at the Supreme Court level. But every judge and clerk\nI’ve ever met at this level would be insulted at the suggestion that they\ncould be influenced by something like this. It’s a colossal waste of\nmoney.”Ultimately, it may be impossible to know the impact of campaigning in\nthe courts. “The theory is that you want to influence them just like you\ninfluence any other citizen,” Ms. Larsen said of the judges. “But the only\nperson who knows the influence of something like that is the judge herself.”\n\n","title":"Climate Policy’s Advocates Take Page From Same-Sex Marriage Playbook - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"With Obama's signature climate change rule at stake, advocates are taking a page from the same-sex marriage playbook https://t.co/t7ijlDnWkO","date":"Tue Mar 29 22:11:06 +0000 2016","favs":95,"id":{"$numberLong":"714937957552099331"},"retweets":68},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SkJUcq"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014b9"},"content":"The closer Donald J. Trump draws to winning the Republican presidential\nnomination over opposition from party leaders, the more his detractors ask:\nHow can this happen?There’s no singular answer.One part of the explanation\nlies in the modern evolution of presidential competition, another in the\nspecial talents of Mr. Trump, and a third in the contours of the 21st-century\nRepublican Party.Today, voters across the United States take their influence\nover presidential nominations for granted. As recently as 1968, however, just\n15 nominating contests were held, in which the rank-and-file selected\nconvention delegates.The eventual Democratic standard-bearer that year, Vice\nPresident Hubert Humphrey, didn’t enter a single primary. He didn’t have to;\nhe enjoyed the support of party leaders who controlled the Chicago\nconvention.But that acrimonious gathering made clear that voters wanted a\ngreater say, and both parties gave it to them. By 1980, they each conducted\nmore than 35 nominating contests. Now, nearly every state holds either a\nprimary or a delegate-selection caucus.As a result, precinct captains in Iowa,\nNew Hampshire or South Carolina have more influence over Republican and\nDemocratic nominations than national party leaders. It opens the door to\ncandidates who can attract grass-roots followings even as they repel party\nleaders.The author Alan Ehrenhalt called it “The United States of Ambition,”\nin which candidates nominate themselves with their drive and talent for\ncampaigning. For all the controversy he has ignited, Mr. Trump has displayed\nplenty of both.Mr. Trump, a billionaire real estate developer, began preparing\nto run long before others recognized his seriousness. He has used his personal\nwealth to bypass fund-raising concerns that constrain his rivals.He has\ncommanded an outsize share of media attention in a crowded Republican field.\nAnd he has used the attention to mine the economic and cultural anxieties of\nhis party’s conservative base, especially among working-class white voters.In\ntheory, a gifted Democratic insurgent could do the same thing. In reality, the\nera of polarization makes it easier for Republican renegades to flourish,\nbecause the party base is more ideologically intense and culturally\nhomogeneous.Once dispersed throughout both parties, liberals now almost\nexclusively flock to the Democrats, and conservatives to the Republicans. But\nthere are significantly more conservatives.For the same reason right-leaning\ntalk-radio shows draw larger audiences than left-leaning programs, Republican\nprimaries are pulled further toward ideological extremes. On the touchstone\nissue of immigration, Mr. Trump has capitalized by proposing to build a wall\non the southern border and send Mexico the bill.As the nation grows more\nethnically diverse, Republicans remain overwhelmingly white. Nine of every 10\nvotes Mitt Romney received in 2012, exit polls showed, came from whites.\nNearly half came from whites without college degrees, the Americans feeling\nmost aggrieved by recent economic and cultural trends.Mr. Trump has topped the\nRepublican field by making himself their champion. Within the more diverse\nDemocratic base, there’s no single constituency of a comparable size to lift\nan iconoclast to the nomination.In 2012, for example, Mr. Obama received\nslightly fewer than one-fourth of his votes from African-Americans; an\nadditional 14 percent came from Hispanics. White liberals accounted for\nslightly more than one-fourth of his support, whites under 30 just 10\npercent.That’s why Senator Bernie Sanders, the self-described “democratic\nsocialist” from Vermont, faces an uphill fight for the Democratic nomination.\nHe enjoys a strong following among white liberals and young voters, but there\naren’t enough of them to topple a candidate, like Hillary Clinton, who\ndominates among nonwhites.Mrs. Clinton holds one additional advantage: support\nfrom hundreds of so-called superdelegates, party leaders who are free to back\nthe candidate they consider strongest, whatever primary voters say.A\ngeneration ago, Democratic officials created superdelegates as a hedge in\nclose contests if they found the rank-and-file’s choice unsuitable.\nFortunately for Mr. Trump, Republicans haven’t done the same.\n\n","title":"G.O.P.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014ba"},"content":"New York City has long fancied itself the center of the universe. The 2016\nelection has only stockpiled the evidence.There is the billionaire from\nQueens, who speaks little of that borough anymore from his Fifth Avenue\nskyscraper, and the socialist from Brooklyn, who rails against a certain\ncapitalist-crowded street in Lower Manhattan.There is the bravado, the\nprofanity, the showmanship sizzle, the overpriced steaks. Accents have reigned\n— “yuge” ones. “Billionehhhs” have had their r’s redistributed to “idears.”And\nnow, at long last, it seems the presidential race could meet its match: The\ncircus is coming to the Big Apple.For the first time since 1988, New York is\nhosting a meaningful presidential primary — two, actually — bracing for\nbipartisan chaos as the candidates prepare to blitz the country’s pre-eminent\nmedia market.“It’ll be wild,” said Alfonse D’Amato, the former senator,\npredicting a throwback free-for-all with daily fireworks in the city’s\ntabloids.On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton, the transplanted former New\nYork senator, whose campaign headquarters are in Brooklyn Heights, is hoping\nto hold off Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator with the _fuhgettaboutit_\ntimbre and a diploma from James Madison High near Sheepshead Bay.And for\nDonald J. Trump, who is seeking a big-state springboard to the Republican\nnomination, the competition from visiting rivals in both parties could prove\nparticularly jarring.He has for decades regarded himself as an unrivaled titan\nin his hometown, gorging at the only-in-New-York intersection of real estate,\nmedia and celebrity-for-its-own-sake. His name has appeared on the facades of\nNew York’s buildings, at the top of its V.I.P. lists and in the gossip pages\nwhose stewards he had on speed dial.There was no anonymous “source close to\nTrump,” reporters across town came to know, quite so availing as The Donald\nhimself.Yet in recent months, to the dismay of a great many New Yorkers, Mr.\nTrump has become something of an avatar for the city — the brash ambassador\nwho defended its honor when Senator Ted Cruz of Texas used “New York values”\nas a slur. (Mr. Cruz was criticizing Mr. Trump’s past support for abortion\nrights, among other shifts.)John Catsimatidis, a grocery store and oil magnate\nwho is friendly with Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton, likened Mr. Trump to a\nconquering hero returning home.“He’s coming back as the king of the world,”\nMr. Catsimatidis said. “I don’t think me or you has ever seen something like\nthis.”When, after all, has anyone seen a New Yorker go up against a New Yorker\nfor the right to go up against, very possibly, a New Yorker?And it could have\nbeen worse: Michael R. Bloomberg, the former three-term mayor, decided against\nan independent bid.While the primary is not until April 19, attention has\nturned quickly to New York, with only one major contest, next week’s Wisconsin\nvote, ahead on the calendar.Mr. Cruz kicked off his New York campaign last\nweek with an event in Midtown Manhattan, just south of Trump Tower, and\nimmediately, gleefully ignited a feud with Bill de Blasio, the city’s liberal\nmayor.The senator also made the covers of The Daily News and The New York\nPost, though for this, Mr. Trump may have deserved some credit: Mr. Cruz was\ndefending himself against a supermarket tabloid allegation of extramarital\naffairs, which he accused Mr. Trump of peddling. Mr. Trump has denied being\ninvolved.On Saturday, Mr. Cruz used Mr. Trump’s favored medium, Twitter, to\nlist New York Democrats to whom the Republican front-runner has contributed:\nChuck Schumer, Andrew M. Cuomo, Charles B. Rangel, Anthony D. Weiner, Eliot\nSpitzer.On Tuesday, his wife, Heidi Cruz, was scheduled to appear at the\nJewish Center of Brighton Beach in Brooklyn, but the event was called\noff.Still, the borough will be busy. Mr. Sanders’s team held a block party on\nSaturday for the opening of its Brooklyn headquarters, perched between a Whole\nFoods and the Gowanus Canal — right around the corner from the Morbid Anatomy\nMuseum. The gathering was headlined by what the Sanders campaign called\n“prominent supporters,” including the fourth male lead in “The Hangover”\nmovies and a member of the band TV on the Radio.Mr. Sanders, the expatriate\nNew Yorker, has also challenged Mrs. Clinton, the adopted one, to a debate in\nBrooklyn, where Mrs. Clinton has few natural ties despite the address of her\ncampaign hub.“Brooklyn, U.S.A., how can you beat that?” she said during a rare\nvisit last year, posing with a fan’s commemorative license plate in a video\nproduced by her aides.Mrs. Clinton usually works out of a Manhattan office\nwhen she is in the city. On Wednesday she will be uptown, holding a rally at\nthe Apollo Theater in Harlem.While she is banking on support from the city’s\nlarge black and Hispanic populations, her chief bulwark is in the rest of the\nstate, with expected success in places like Rochester, Syracuse and Buffalo,\nas well as the suburbs Westchester and Long Island.Mr. Trump is likewise\nexpected to thrive in much of central and western New York.One of his highest-\nprofile surrogates, Carl Paladino, a businessman with a penchant for picking\npublic battles, ran for governor against Mr. Cuomo in 2010, pursuing many of\nthe same themes and tactics that Mr. Trump has.The area that Mr. Paladino\nrepresents could be ripe territory for Mr. Trump, filled with working-class\nwhite voters hit hard by the loss of jobs that left and never came back.But\nRepublican delegates are awarded proportionally by congressional district,\ncreating a quirk: Though Republicans may be rare in New York City’s many deep-\nblue districts, their votes will be especially valuable in the primary, making\nit very likely that the campaigns will spend heavily in the metropolitan\nregion.Accordingly, the candidates have begun honing their pitches to city\nvoters. Some messages appear more fully honed than others.Asked in an\ninterview last week if he planned to speak Spanish in the city’s Hispanic\ncommunities, Mr. Cruz suggested his uneven “Spanglish” could resonate in\nsecond-generation homes.“My grandmother would say, ‘Oye, niño, tráeme el\nremote control,’” he said. “That was a perfectly normal sentence in our home,\nand it’s true in most Hispanic homes.”Representative Dan Donovan of Staten\nIsland, the lone Republican in the city’s congressional delegation, offered\nonly culinary advice for prospective visitors to his borough.“Don’t eat pizza\nwith a knife and fork,” he said, recalling an infamous lunch at which Mr. de\nBlasio defied the rule. Mr. Trump has been known to do the same.Mr. Donovan,\nchafing at Mr. Cruz’s appraisal of the city’s “values,” said the senator had\nhis own offenses to answer for. “I had to smack Cruz around a little bit on\nthat,” he said.Others were more sympathetic. George E. Pataki, the former New\nYork governor and presidential candidate, said Mr. Cruz’s slight was narrowly\ntargeted.“He was talking about people like Donald Trump who use political\ninfluence and lawsuits to get their way,” Mr. Pataki told reporters. (He was\non his way into a meeting with Mr. Cruz.)At the Cruz campaign event in\nMidtown, at least one supporter agreed, with a caveat.“I understand why he\nsaid it,” said Jonathan Maas, 31, lingering near Fifth Avenue after the\nrally.He added, meekly, “I’m from Missouri originally.”\n\n","title":"With the New York Presidential Primary, the Circus Is Coming Home - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"For the first time since 1988, New York is hosting a meaningful presidential primary  — two, actually https://t.co/ar8xm7hmva","date":"Tue Mar 29 20:40:02 +0000 2016","favs":126,"id":{"$numberLong":"714915040546177027"},"retweets":94},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21RFaA0"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014bb"},"content":"Not far from the house where I grew up in Karachi, Pakistan, there was a\nchildren’s amusement park. It sat on top of a hill, its slides and swings\nbeckoning children from the houses below. As summer vacations dragged on, my\nbrother and I would hear the gleeful screams of other children, and we begged\nmy mother to take us. It wasn’t an easy sell. “The swings are so rickety,” she\nwould say one day. “Aren’t you afraid you will fall out of the spinning\nwheel?” she would say on another. We were a little afraid, but we ached to go.\nThat park was the only one we knew, and if it was shabby, its toy horses and\npretend cars worn and weary, it still held the promise of exhilaration.Like\nchildren everywhere, we were drawn to being a little scared. That, after all,\nis the pull of the amusement park: small thrills ordered and anticipated, and\nthen conquered, fear confronted and overcome. When we did get to go, our\nhearts pumped wildly at the crazy height of a swing, our breath raced as our\nbodies were flung about; all of it made us wild with joy. Like everywhere,\nthere were small dangers: grim grown men who sat at the periphery, watching\ngiggling children with beady eyes; boarded-up or broken rides, like ominous\nwarnings of thrills gone wrong; beggars who beseeched us for the coins we\nclenched in our fists. But the heedlessness of childhood worked its wonders;\nthe swings and the slides blurred them into the background.The children who\ndied in Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park in Lahore on Sunday would have been riding those\nfamiliar crests of feeling: the wild joy of being high up or spun around\nmixing suddenly, grotesquely with the grim finality of death. Twenty-nine of\nthe at least 72 dead were children, all of them, presumably, engaging in the\nchild’s pastime of facing fear and surviving it. In the footage of the\naftermath, their bloodied clothes and toys are strewn about; a green plastic\ntoy car sits untouched in the rubble.Their deaths are a stern rebuke to the\ncountry that failed them and to the world that turns away from them. The\nlurking men of the playgrounds of my childhood are no longer predictable\nvillains, the deviants and kidnappers who feature in the cautionary tales told\nto children around the world. They are assassins, their hearts harnessed with\nexplosives, their bodies bundled with bombs. The mothers refusing their\nchildren a trip to the amusement park will now tell them not about a rickety\nswing but about a bombing. Even the resilience of the very young cannot dream\nthat away; the shadow of terror encroaches on childhood.For much of the world,\nthe deaths of Pakistani children are forgettable. They are, after all, the\nprogeny of poor distant others destined to perish in ever more alarming ways.\nIt may not be said, but it is believed that they are complicit in their own\ndeaths, guilty somehow — even at 2 or 4 or 6 years of age — of belonging to a\nnation that the world has appointed as its own boogeyman, a repository of all\nits vilest trepidations. In December 2014, Taliban militants gunned down more\nthan 140 people at a school in Peshawar, a vast majority of them students. A\nformer American ambassador, speaking of his government’s lack of desire to\nhelp the Pakistani government fight extremists, put it succinctly: “There is\ngreat Pakistan fatigue in Washington.”In the media, too, it seems. Two days\nafter Sunday’s attack, Lahore has disappeared from the top headlines.\nPakistan’s pain has already been extinguished from the global news cycle, its\ncatastrophe a news item and not — as in Paris or Brussels — a news event. The\nworld has many demands on its meager stores of empathy. The children’s names,\ntheir pictures, the terrain of the park where they fell to bits will never be\nfamiliar to a mourning world. Efforts to make the dead children of Pakistan\nreal and innocent, worthy of a tear and not just a tweet, start, sputter and\nfizzle.The playgrounds of Pakistan have fallen silent for the moment as the\ncountry buries its dead children. As I think of them, my ears ring with the\nsounds carried down by the wind from the playground on the hill. We wished to\ngo when we couldn’t, but even that longing for the playground has now been\ndenied to Pakistani children. What children ache to do when they stand on top\nof a slide or swing high in the air is simply to face their fear and vanquish\nit. In this the dead children of Lahore are braver than their country, braver\nthan the world, braver than all of us who are scared but cannot confront our\nfears.\n\n","title":"The Playgrounds of Pakistan - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"\"The playgrounds of Pakistan have fallen silent for the moment as the country buries its dead children.\" https://t.co/4zuU0Vfm9z @nytopinion","date":"Tue Mar 29 20:25:05 +0000 2016","favs":199,"id":{"$numberLong":"714911277093621761"},"retweets":258},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1Th1XFb"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014bc"},"content":"LONDON — Yves Cibuabua, a Congolese business school graduate living in\nBrussels, was known among family and friends for his gumption and\ndetermination: By age 27, he had progressed from doing stints as a cleaner and\na supermarket cashier to working in the financial securities department of\nBanque Eni, part of the Italian energy giant.Focused, hard-working and a sharp\ndresser, Mr. Cibuabua, the father of two girls, spoke at least four languages:\nFrench, English, Lingala and Dutch. He was as adept at navigating new\ntechnologies as he was at baking pastries, one of his hobbies.After working as\na steward at soccer matches, stocking shelves at a store and dusting plane\ncockpits and passenger cabins, he attained two master’s degrees, one in\neconomics and another in accounting.“My strengths are that I am brave,\npassionate and a hard-working person,” he wrote on his LinkedIn page.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014bd"},"content":"At 10:33 a.m. on Sunday, Nov. 1 of last year, the highway police in Ningbo, an\nindustrial city on China’s eastern coast, posted a seemingly innocuous message\nto their official microblog. “Due to sudden traffic control,” the message\nread, “all the entrances and exits of the G15 Expressway at Hangzhou Bay\nBridge have been closed.”That weekend, Xu Xiang, one of the wealthiest men in\nChina, had been visiting Ningbo, his hometown, to attend his grandmother’s\n100th birthday party. As the founder of Zexi Investment, one of China’s most\nsuccessful hedge funds, Xu had consistently produced returns that were truly\nunbelievable: His worst-performing fund had grown by nearly 800 percent in\nfive years. He had also survived countless corruption investigations, market\nfalls, purges and other scares. Yet even as his legend grew, Xu remained\nintensely secretive. He had amassed a fortune by trading on knowledge and\ninformation no one else had, rumors no one else knew — a strategy perfectly\ncrafted for China, where information is tightly controlled and reluctantly\nreleased. (Almost every source I approached for this article would only speak\nto me anonymously, fearing government reprisal or harm to their business.)\nEven as Xu grew richer and more powerful, he kept nearly every detail about\nhis personal life and his trading techniques jealously hidden.That equilibrium\nseemed certain to crumble on June 12, when the Chinese stock market began a\nfree-fall. In the span of three weeks, the market lost a third of its value.\nIt continued to careen downward throughout the summer, with major declines on\nJuly 27 and Aug. 24. On the second of these, named Black Monday by The\nPeople’s Daily, the Shanghai composite index fell by 8.5 percent, its worst\nsingle-day tumble in eight years. In the span of two and a half months, $5\ntrillion was wiped out of the market. The ripples were felt around the globe.\nOn Black Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 1,000 points\nshortly after opening, and the FTSE 100 index in London lost $116 billion. Yet\nXu (pronounced shu) somehow managed to survive this free-fall\nunscathed.Despite his wealth, the party in Ningbo had been a low-key affair.\nXu’s family shared his taste for anonymity. His wife preferred the subway to\nher chauffeured car, and his grandmother still lived in the same middle-class\nneighborhood where Xu grew up. But the festivities were interrupted a little\nbefore 10:30 that Sunday, when Xu received a message bearing a warning: The\nauthorities were coming for him.Xu left the party immediately and sped north\non the G15 Expressway toward Shanghai. As he drove, he passed neighborhoods of\nsquat gray apartment buildings with smog-stained walls, unkempt courtyards and\nbarred windows. He crossed the Fenghua River, which bisects Ningbo, and curved\nalong Hangzhou Bay, racing toward the bridge. But he didn’t know about the\npolice blockade. When he reached the bridge, the authorities ushered him from\nhis car and shuttled him to the side of the expressway to an office of the\nhighway patrol.For all the secrecy and intrigue that had long surrounded Xu,\nthe moment of his downfall was strikingly prosaic. That evening, a photo of\nhim appeared on the Internet. Dressed in a white Armani coat, gray button-down\nshirt and rimless glasses, he is clean-shaven, with pudgy cheeks and a\nreceding mop of unruly black hair. Someone out of frame is carefully pulling\nback the sleeve on Xu’s coat, revealing the clasp of a handcuff around his\nwrist. Xu stares directly into the camera, seemingly unmoved or\nuncomprehending. If he is surprised or distraught, his face betrays no hint of\nit. It is the only known photograph of the man who, until that morning, had\nbeen the king of China’s stock market.**The story of Xu** Xiang starts with\nthe beginning of the Chinese market itself. Xu, who grew up in a quiet, lower-\nclass neighborhood of hardscrabble shops and public housing projects in\nNingbo, was a freshman in high school when China opened its first stock\nexchange in nearby Shanghai in 1990. Market fever spread quickly through\nNingbo, which had a long history as a commercial hub and a proud business\nculture. Stocks were a natural fit, and a few trading outposts opened.Xu began\ntrading while still in high school. He was entirely self-taught: His parents,\na retired factory worker and a homemaker, knew nothing about investing. “I\nstudied the stock market by reading books and attending lectures and by\nstudying foreign investment techniques,” Xu later told Caixin, a Chinese news\norganization, in one of the few interviews he has given. After graduating from\nhigh school, he skipped China’s infamous college entrance exam and borrowed\n30,000 renminbi (roughly $5,000) from his parents to trade full time. He would\nlater say that he had actually been born in 1993 — the year he first started\ntrading stocks.At the time, millions of Chinese were opening stock accounts\nwith an enthusiasm that proved long-lasting and transformative. Between\nShanghai and a second exchange in Shenzhen, the market grew from a\ncapitalization of $61 billion in 1993 to $10 trillion by the summer of 2015.\nUnlike in the United States, where institutional investors dominate the\nmarket, China’s 200 million mom-and-pop investors make roughly 85 percent of\nall trades. According to a survey by the State Street Center for Applied\nResearch, 81 percent of these trade at least once a month. But less-\nexperienced individual investors are easily swayed by rumors and operate with\na poor understanding of market fundamentals, making them easy prey for more\nsystematic and sophisticated traders. “All these small individual investors\nare called ‘chives’ in the market,” says Hong Yan, a finance professor at the\nShanghai Advanced Institute of Finance. “They get cut over and over again, but\nthey come back every time, like little weeds.”In his early days, Xu worked\nfrom the Galaxy Securities trading hall on South Liberation Road in Ningbo.\nStock prices were written in chalk on blackboards, and arbitrary rule changes\naffecting stock issuance and corporate disclosure constantly jostled an\nalready unpredictable market. In 1992, the Shanghai index grew by 167 percent\n— then tumbled roughly 75 percent between April 1993 and July 1994. The fact\nthat China Galaxy Securities was a state-owned enterprise offered little\nprotection; as Xu cut his teeth, the traders around him won and lost fortunes\nalmost overnight.On an overcast Monday morning last December, I visited\nGalaxy. The building itself had hardly changed from the days when Xu first set\nfoot inside. Located beside a pharmacy that glowed with blue lights, the\neight-story structure seemed on the verge of physical collapse. A wide\nconcrete staircase, littered with cigarette butts and sun­flower seeds, led up\nto the main trading hall on the second floor, which, by 9 a.m., was packed\nwith haggard-looking investors. Directly opposite the trading board, hung\nabove a small statue of a golden bull, was a red banner urging traders to\n“stay away from illegal securities activities.”**The heady tumult** of those\nearly days in China’s stock market shaped what would become Xu’s signature\nstyle: Buy quickly, sell quickly and always go big. It was the familiar ethos\nof day trading, but taken to the extreme within a Wild West market in which\ninformation was scarce, unreliable or nonexistent. Xu won renown so quickly\nthat by 1995, at 19, he was rumored to be the subject of a heated dispute\nbetween two powerful Shanghai gangsters. Having seen the lucrative potential\nof the market, and the exceptional returns of the young trader, both men\nwanted Xu as their own personal investor. Several sources told me that the\ndispute was eventually settled by a leader from one of China’s infamous triad\ngangs — and that, improbably, the episode later became the inspiration for a\nseries of Hong Kong gangland movies about stock-market geniuses.As Xu’s fame\ngrew, so did his network. By the late 1990s, he became the unofficial captain\nof a group popularly known as the Ningbo Death Squad. The squad made its\nreputation by manipulating cheap, relatively unknown stocks, which in the\nChinese market are not allowed to rise or fall more than 10 percent in a\nsingle trading day. To game the system, the squad devised a strategy: Out of\nnowhere, it would place a gigantic order for a chosen stock. Other traders,\nseeing the sudden upward movement in price, would flood in, pushing the stock\ntoward its daily 10-percent limit. Once the stock hit the limit on the first\nday, the momentum became self-perpetuating. Eager traders rushed to buy the\nstock as soon as the market opened the next day, propelling it toward the\n10-percent limit once again. The movement generated its own publicity and easy\nprofits. After a few days, the squad would sell out, and the stock would\ntumble back to a lower price as other traders followed. In the American\ncontext, this tactic was reminiscent of present-day schemes in “penny stocks,”\nbut with much higher stakes, and playing out in a regulatory environment that\nmirrored the early days of the United States market. One Chinese day trader I\ntalked to spoke in reverent tones about the turn-of-the-century American stock\npicker Jesse Livermore, who made and lost several multimillion-dollar fortunes\nbefore killing himself in 1940 at 63.As the squad gained notoriety, other\ntraders began to monitor the buy orders coming from the Galaxy trading hall —\nany stock they picked was guaranteed to attract attention, and a corresponding\nsurge in buy orders. Profit was almost unavoidable.Despite Xu’s preference for\nanonymity — he eschewed flashy purchases while other squad members parked new\nsports cars conspicuously in front of the trading hall — the group took on a\nmythical status. There was a series of books by two self-proclaimed “Ningbo\nmasters,” as well as traveling seminars that promised to teach legions of\nnovice investors the moneymaking secrets of the Ningbo Death Squad. Copycat\ndeath squads popped up in other Chinese cities.The attention was not all\npositive. After a 2003 article in The China Securities Journal raised\nquestions, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the country’s chief\nmarket watchdog, assigned a special czar to investigate the trading practices\nat Galaxy Securities and five other Ningbo trading halls. In the process, the\nczar called in a number of big-name local traders for an “informal discussion\nsession.” The squad disappeared from the market, only to return a week later\nwhen the czar released a public statement saying he had found no evidence of\nwrongdoing. Whatever the traders’ methods, they were pulling in millions, and\nNingbo — and the greater Chinese economy — was thriving.**By 2005, Xu** had\noutgrown his hometown. He needed to be closer to power and money on a scale\nthat Ningbo couldn’t provide. With his usual perfect timing, he moved to\nShanghai with hundreds of millions of renminbi just as the country’s hedge-\nfund industry was taking off. The industry existed in some form as early as\nthe 1990s, but in those days the amounts traded were small — China’s economy\nwas still developing — and there was no local expertise or legal framework.\nWhat funds did exist operated in the shadows, absent any type of government\nregulation. “Who could run hedge funds?” a former Chinese regulatory official\nsays. “At that time, it was an open question.”It was only in 2005 that a\nrevision to China’s Securities Law helped pave the way for hedge funds. Those\nfunds that decided to operate openly within the new framework became known as\n“sunshine funds,” to distinguish them from funds who kept their participants\nhidden. As this was happening, a new class of wealthy Chinese, enriched by the\ncountry’s rapid economic boom, suddenly found themselves with billions of\nrenminbi to invest. “It was just the perfect storm,” says Zhang Howhow, the\ndirector of strategy at KPMG in Hong Kong. “People were starting to study the\nregulations more closely, more seriously, to find a relatively legal way to\napproach this as a business. The market was going up, and you have a group of\nhigh-net-worth individuals.” This was Xu’s chance “to build a proper hedge\nfund in China — the biggest, the most successful.”On Dec. 7, 2009, Xu founded\nZexi Investments with 30 million renminbi — a little under $4.5 million — in\ncapital. The name was a homage to the two men Xu admired most: “Ze” for Mao\nZedong, the founder of the People’s Republic of China, and “xi” for Emperor\nKangxi, the longest-ruling emperor in Chinese his­tory. In March 2010, Xu\nopened Zexi’s first fund with one billion renminbi. It was technically a\nsunshine fund, but because it had fewer than 200 investors, he wasn’t required\nto divulge the names of his clients.As a boss, Xu was obsessive and untiring.\nFriends say he had no hobbies or interests outside the stock market. He\narrived at Zexi’s sleek Shanghai office each morning at 8:45, and often stayed\nuntil 2 a.m. From his seat at the back of the firm’s trading floor, he\npersonally directed Zexi’s investments, even as the firm’s assets approached\n30 billion renminbi. He remained intensely secretive. The firm’s researchers\ndid not know if he had heeded their stock recommendations until they saw their\nperformance assessments at the end of each year. “Xu Xiang is always trading,”\na longtime friend said. “If he’s not trading, he’s thinking about trading.”In\nmeetings, Xu was glued to two smartphones, one displaying market prices and\nthe other pinging with news about economic developments. He preferred to let\nothers speak, and when he did interject, his answers were brief and\ndismissive. One Western fund manager said he seemed as if he was “bored of\nanswering questions and would rather get back to trading.” He dressed\ninformally, sometimes in tracksuits.As he had in Ningbo, Xu regularly poured\nbillions into big, risky bets that always seemed impeccably timed. He focused\non buying stocks that were either small and relatively unknown or sinking\ntoward bottom-dollar price, then pulled out as soon as he made a profit. The\nstrategy was partly a reaction to the peculiarities of the Chinese market.\nPractices common among United States hedge funds, like short-selling stocks to\nprotect against downturns in the market (in other words, hedging), are\nrestricted in China, where regulators treat them with suspicion. Instead, fund\nmanagers rely almost exclusively on buying and selling stocks at just the\nright time.The results Xu achieved were unbelievable — perhaps literally.\nBetween March 2010 and October 2015, Zexi’s Fund No. 1 produced a return of\nmore than 3,270 percent, even while the Shanghai Stock Exchange index grew by\nonly 11.6 percent. Other Zexi funds grew at similarly startling rates. By\n2015, Xu controlled at least 28 billion renminbi, the most of any Chinese\nhedge-fund manager. An adoring public, aspiring to his rags-to-riches tale,\ncalled him “China’s Carl Icahn,” “Xu the Legend” and “Hedge Fund Brother No.\n1.”**Throughout his career,** Xu’s wild success provided fodder for rumors and\nspeculation: about his access to insider information, his un­canny timing and\nthe possible government connections of his wealthy (and entirely anonymous)\nclients. The most persistent rumor held that Xu was investing on behalf of\nwealthy and corrupt Shanghai-based “princelings,” the second-generation\ndescendants of prominent Communist Party officials. These princelings, the\nrumors went, fed Xu inside information and protected him from prosecution; in\nexchange, he managed their wealth in private funds that were tailored to their\nneeds and hid both the amount invested and the identity of the investor. These\nrumors had the virtue of being both entirely plausible and entirely\nunverifiable.In an elegant waterfront coffee house in Ningbo, I met a young\nstock trader who speculated about the web of political connections that had\nenriched and ultimately doomed Xu. “Xu was pushed onto the stage,” the trader\ntold me, as fashionable young women toting Gucci bags and wearing Cartier\nwatches strode past us. “There are a lot of red capitalists in Shanghai, the\nchildren of leaders and important officials. They put a lot of money into his\nprivate fund to use as their personal bank account.”By the young trader’s\ntelling, Xu’s entire operation was a cover for this simple scheme. “Xu had\nseven products,” the trader told me. “The most successful are for the red\ncapitalists. The others are rat funds” — dummy products used to drive up stock\nprices and enrich Xu’s clients.Nearly every one of the experts I spoke with\nrepeated some version of the same rumor: that Xu was less a financial genius\nthan a puppet of even larger powers. Most often, this explanation was deployed\nin response to a question that had been troubling observers of the Chinese\nfinancial world for months: Why hadn’t Xu stopped earlier? Rumors of his\nillegal methods were an open secret, and he had already built the most\nsuccessful hedge fund in China, reaping billions of dollars in personal wealth\nin the process. Why keep going and risk a reckoning?“That goes to the investor\nconspiracy,” a former hedge fund researcher told me. “The people who give\nmoney to him to manage would not like to see the fund wound down.” Whether Xu\nhad begun as a willing partner or was coerced from the start was just further\nspeculation. “When you have someone very politically powerful and well\nconnected coming to you who wants you to manage money for him or her,” the\nresearcher said, “then it’s sort of difficult to say no, right?”If Xu was\nindeed tied to figures in the country’s opaque political elite, his carefully\nprotected anonymity was all the more crucial. In a nation where political and\neconomic control are inseparable, and where the flashiest are often the first\nto fall, remaining unknown can serve as a survival technique. Even the true\nvalue of his assets remains a mystery. In 2015, the Hurun Rich List ranked Xu\nas the 188th-richest person in China, with a value of $2.2 billion. But that\nfigure does not necessarily include all of Xu’s earnings from privately\nmanaged funds, the money he controlled through family members or assets\nstashed outside Zexi. Xu’s true wealth was unknown and unknowable.**As Zexi\ngrew **and thrived, the fund began to operate through murkier market channels.\nBuying and selling shares was no longer adequate to keep the empire growing\napace. Xu needed a new business model.In late 2010, he began operating through\na network of shell companies and affiliated investment funds with near-\nidentical names, purchasing ownership stakes in companies. He took on the role\nof the activist investor, padding corporate boards with his associates, who\nwould then implement investor-friendly policies — particularly dividend\npayouts.Between 2010 and 2014, Zexi invested in 45 companies that issued\ndividends — more companies than the average Chinese hedge fund had invested in\naltogether during that period. “That strategy was quite unique,” the China-\nbased Western fund manager told me. “Maybe in part because there are only a\nfew managers who can pull that off.” But Xu had the leverage and the\nconnections. A company’s performance or fundamentals did not seem to concern\nhim; if he could find a few winning stocks, he could use his tactics to ride\nthem to huge profits. Zexi would use dividend payouts to purchase additional\nshares in the company, which it could then sell when prices rose, netting\nmillions more in profits.To execute this scheme, Xu relied on a network of\ntrusted proxies. Two of the most important were his parents. As executives at\nZexi and controlling shareholders at several related companies, Xu’s mother\nand father helped direct billions in investment in their son’s name. They also\nran many of the companies that made up Xu’s secret empire. Through a Zexi-\naffiliated fund, Xu’s father owned a large share of Ningbo Zhongbai, a\ndepartment store company based in Xu’s hometown. Other corporations, like an\nunprofitable apparel chain called Shanghai Metersbonwe Fashion \u0026amp;\nAccessories, were run by friends and allies.The stock rout last summer\ncoincided with the apex of both Xu’s success and his notoriety. The\ngovernment’s response to the crisis was swift and heavy-handed. Large\nshareholders were prohi­bited from selling listed stocks; I.P.O.s were halted,\nand state-run institutions were ordered to maintain their positions or to buy\nshares. The government also mobilized a “national team” of brokers and\ninvestors, backed by up to three trillion renminbi in state capital, to\npurchase shares and raise prices.But while the rest of the market was\ncollapsing, Xu continued to thrive. From the beginning of 2015, one of Zexi’s\nfunds grew by 357 percent, ranking first among 1,649 funds in China. Another\ngrew by 187 percent. All five publicly listed funds had growth of at least 20\npercent during three weeks of the crash in mid-June.Xu benefited from\nseemingly miraculous luck and timing, according to The South China Morning\nPost. At least three of the stocks that Zexi held most heavily were purchased\nen masse by the “national team.” More remarkable still, all the funds run by\nXu seemed to exit the stock market at just the right moment, when it briefly\nre­bounded during the late summer before plummeting again. By the end of the\nsummer, the annual return on his funds was more than 200 percent.But as the\nmarket dried up, Xu became a target. In September, a social-media post\nimplicating Zexi in corruption and insider trading went viral on the Chinese\nInternet. The post, written anony­mously, claimed that Zexi had conspired with\nCitic Securities, a powerful state-owned investment house, to direct buyers\ntoward Shanghai Metersbonwe Fashion \u0026amp; Accessories, which saw its share\nprices surge during the worst of the market rout. Zexi denied that Xu had\nworked with Citic to manipulate the price of Metersbonwe, but the arrest of\nseveral Citic executives that fall only fueled more speculation.The same post\nprovided a possible motive for the swindle. It began when a Shanghai\nprinceling who held shares of Metersbonwe complained to Xu about the stock’s\nlow price during the summer rout. Xu called in a favor at Citic Securities,\nand in a matter of weeks the “national team” purchased 15 percent of the\ncompany’s total shares in circulation, sending prices soaring. The C.S.R.C.\nnoticed the incident and began investigating. Almost immediately, the\ngovernment placed restrictions on Xu’s ability to travel outside the\ncountry.Nine days later, Xu was fleeing his grandmother’s birthday party,\ntrying to reach Shanghai. The timing was not coincidental. A special group\norganized by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection was about to\nbegin a top-to-bottom review of the activities and leadership of the C.S.R.C.\nTaking down Xu — especially in public, and with photographic evidence — was a\ndisplay of force and competence from a government battered by a summer of bad\neconomic news. “In China,” one fund manager told me, “the compromising and\nbargaining is in the execution of the law, not the formulation. The government\nis using this case to show that from now on, they will enforce the law.”Xu\nhimself seemed to sense the end coming. A year before his arrest, in November\n2014, he moved to Beijing and opened an office less than half a mile from the\nheadquarters of the C.S.R.C. According to colleagues, the move was the start\nof a yearlong effort by Xu to use his connections and money to avoid a\nreckoning. But despite his billions, Xu was an ordinary man from a poor\nfamily. By itself, Xu’s market malfeasance might have been enough to spell his\ndownfall; that he was said to be protected by some of the same corrupt\nofficials targeted by the anticorruption push meant there was no escape.**Xu\nXiang remains** in detention in an undisclosed facility somewhere in Beijing.\nMonths after his capture, the only detail confirmed by the Chinese government\nis that he has been detained for insider trading and stock manipulation. There\nhas been no word of a trial, no taped confession, no formal charges or\npublicly disclosed evidence of wrongdoing. In his absence, Zexi has crumbled.\nXu was Zexi; without him, the magic is gone.In the months since the crash, the\nChinese government has instituted a sweeping crackdown on illegal practices in\nthe financial markets. “There are many, many, many, many, many other managers\nin the market who could be apprehended for the same reasons,” the Western fund\nmanager told me. Xu proved an irresistible target not because of his own\nmalfeasance, but because he offered a path to an even larger target — perhaps\nthe clique of Shanghai princelings. “If you’re going to knock somebody down,\nfirst you take out the whole row of people around them, the people who support\nthem,” the fund manager said. “You tighten the noose around them.”From the\nbeginning of 2015 through September of that year, 34 companies listed on the\nChinese stock market reported officials as either missing or under\ninvestigation by the authorities, according to Bloomberg News. As of late\nNovember, Xinhua, the official Chinese news agency, had identified at least 16\nmajor finance industry figures tied directly to the stock-market cleanup who\nwere either arrested, under investigation or assisting the authorities. In\nearly January, the chairman of Metersbonwe joined the list, disappearing\nwithout explanation for more than a week.“The level of corruption is beyond\nyour imagi­nation,” a prominent Beijing-based hedge-fund manager told me over\ncoffee several weeks after Xu’s arrest. Like all my sources, this fund manager\nwas extremely nervous about being interviewed. The irony of the crackdown was\nclear: Though a lack of transparency had clearly shattered the market, the\nChinese government was responding with a crushing clampdown on information.\nThe fund manager insisted that I could not use his name, for fear of being\nblacklisted or arrested. The ubiquity of wrongdoing, he said, did not make\nanyone safe. “No one knows who will be next. If they want to catch you, they\nwill catch you.”The term used to describe what happened to these executives —\n_shilian,_ “lost contact” — has become a coy euphemism for the Communist\nParty’s holding individuals indefinitely for questioning or arrest. The\ncampaign was partly a reaction to widespread anger within China: The people,\nthe party and the government all wanted someone to blame for the loss of face\n— and money. Xu became the emblem of ubiquitous financial corruption. “There\nwill be new tricks,” the former regulatory official says. “But none will be as\noutrageous as his.”For China’s would-be tycoons, the stakes of the crackdown\ngo far beyond the market. During my conversation with the Beijing-based fund\nmanager, which took place in a cafe on a university campus, a young man\nwandered toward us, admiring a pair of paintings on a nearby wall. The manager\nwent quiet, and shifted uncomfortably, watching the potential eavesdropper\nfrom the corner of his eye. When the young man had passed, the manager turned\nback to me. “In China,” he said, “the losing side doesn’t get to sleep at\nnight.”__\n\n","title":"The Fall of China’s Hedge-Fund King - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"He was a legend in China's booming stock market — until the bubble he helped to create eventually took him down https://t.co/hOyPoj2h0w","date":"Tue Mar 29 19:55:03 +0000 2016","favs":123,"id":{"$numberLong":"714903718022541313"},"retweets":105},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PDNQmD"}

As\nshe, Andrew J.J. MacIntosh and their colleagues noted in describing their\nresearch in Scientific Reports, grooming is known to reduce lice, but such\nclose physical contact can also make it easy for lice to pass from one animal\nto another.Dr. Duboscq is interested in the costs and benefits of social\nbehavior. For animals that live in social groups, as macaques and people do,\nthe benefits of social life are many, from defense against predators (for wild\nmonkeys, and no doubt for humans at some point in their history) to emotional\nhealth and well-being (for humans, and probably monkeys, too).But there are\nnegatives associated with sociality, like the transmission of parasites and\ndiseases. “We don’t fully understand the costs and benefits,” Dr. Duboscq\nsaid.In this study, she and her colleagues estimated the degree of louse\ninfestation by the number of nits picked. The more nits, they calculated, the\nmore lice-producing nits.They compared the degree of louse infestation with\nhow central each female was in the social network, meaning how many other\nmonkeys were her social contacts. The result was that the females with more\nsocial contacts, and who therefore received more grooming, had fewer lice, but\nonly during the winter and summer.During the spring and fall, a female’s\nposition in a social network didn’t seem to make any difference.Dr. Duboscq\nsaid the reason for the seasonal difference wasn’t yet clear, but it was\npossible that the monkeys’ biology affected that of the lice.Winter is the\nmating season for these macaques, and they give birth in the summer. Hormonal\nchanges in the blood of the macaques that the lice feed on could affect louse\nreproduction and cause a jump in lice in winter and summer, which would make\ngrooming more important.But that is only speculation so far. What is clear is\nthat grooming works well to keep the louse population down. In this case, the\nbenefits of sociality outweigh the risks.\n\n","title":"Japanese Monkeys Like to Socialize, Even With Nits to Pick - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTScience: Having a rich social life is good for you, even if your friends have lice https://t.co/Ig9AQKYkrM https://t.co/MCvXOjaQ9o","date":"Tue Mar 29 19:09:30 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714892256256331776"},"retweets":210},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PBlnO1"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014c0"},"content":"TIRANA, Albania — Sebino Plaku, a player for the Polish professional soccer\nteam Slask Wroclaw, sat across a small desk from the club’s president and vice\npresident.It was Aug. 28, 2014. The two club officials, Mr. Plaku said,\npresented him with a document that was an “annex” to his contract with the\nteam. The team, the executives told Mr. Plaku, wanted to immediately reduce\nhis monthly salary by more than 50 percent. They told Mr. Plaku, an Albanian,\nthat he had 20 minutes to decide whether to accept.Then, Mr. Plaku said, the\npresident — speaking Polish and using the vice president as his English\ninterpreter — delivered a message: “If you don’t sign this,” he said,\naccording to Mr. Plaku, “we will destroy your career.”Mr. Plaku refused. What\nfollowed, he has claimed in an arbitration case against the club, was roughly\nfive months of isolation, humiliation, psychological abuse and intimidation,\nall of which combined to derail his professional career.According to player\nadvocacy groups, Mr. Plaku’s case is emblematic of a widespread labor issue in\nEurope in which players are given the choice between bending to their\nemployers’ demands or enduring harsh, punitive training regimens. The practice\nis known by the catchall term training alone, and it is regarded as soccer’s\nversion of solitary confinement.“It is physical torture and it is\npsychological torture,” said Dejan Stefanovic, a former player who now leads\nSlovenia’s players’ union. “And it happens everywhere.”Accusations of players\nbeing forced to train alone have been reported in virtually every country in\nEurope — from marquee teams like Chelsea and Manchester United to minor ones\nlike Slask Wroclaw — and player advocates say the cases that go unreported are\nmost likely innumerable given that many players stay quiet for fear of losing\ntheir positions altogether. Typically, clubs that separate players from their\nteammates do so over money — because the player will not sign a contract\nextension, or he refuses to allow the club to terminate a contract early or\nmodify its terms.In Poland, training alone is so common it even has a\nnickname: the Coconut Club, named after Daniel Kokosinski, a player who\nendured the treatment in 2009. (“Kokos” means “coconut” in Polish.)Mr. Plaku\nsaid he had been forced to train three times a day (alone, and often without\ntime to eat between sessions); required to do excessive running; fined\nthousands of euros if he was even 30 seconds late for a training session; and\nmade to take part in demeaning activities like changing in the boys’ teams’\nlocker room or standing in the city center for hours to hand out\nnewspapers.Slask Wroclaw, which is based in southwest Poland, has defended its\nactions by saying that Mr. Plaku’s fitness was not sufficient for him to be a\npart of its top team any longer. (Mr. Plaku, 30, who is currently playing for\na first-division club in Albania, dismissed that claim as “ridiculous.”)Slask\nWroclaw’s president, Pawel Zelem, did not respond to questions about his\ninvolvement in the case. Krzysztof Swiercz, a spokesman for Slask Wroclaw,\nagreed to a brief telephone interview in which he said that the club had\n“nothing to blame ourselves for.”“There are many professional players who\ntrain twice or thrice a day and never complain; they are professionals in\nevery way,” Mr. Swiercz continued. “There are people who work in factories for\n13 hours a day and get paid 1,000 zlotys per month, and they don’t complain.\nSo do you really think Plaku has anything to complain about?” The amount of\nPolish zlotys he referred to is equivalent to about $263.Mr. Swiercz added\nthat on Sundays — “as the law states” — Mr. Plaku had the day off.A tribunal\nfor Poland’s soccer federation ultimately dissolved Mr. Plaku’s contract with\nSlask Wroclaw but did not assign blame, which allowed the club to avoid paying\nMr. Plaku the balance of his salary (about $222,000 in lost wages). Mr. Plaku\nhas appealed, taking the matter to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, an\ninternational organization that adjudicates cases related to athletics. A\ndecision is expected as soon as this week.In Western Europe, accusations that\nclubs have treated players in a similar manner are common. Nicolai Boilesen,\nwho was the captain of the Dutch club Ajax last season, was separated from the\nfirst team this year after refusing to sign a contract extension. Ajax’s\ncoach, Frank de Boer, has been quoted as saying: “Nicolai made his choice. If\nyou do not accept the offer that we make, then you have to suffer the\nconsequences.”In Eastern Europe, the problem is more pervasive. Results of a\n2012 player survey conducted by FIFPro, the international players’ union,\nfound that in 12 Eastern European countries, roughly one in six players\nreported having been forced to train alone, while about 40 percent of players\nin Poland specifically said they knew of at least one such incident.Mr.\nStefanovic, the Slovene player representative, said the survey offered only “a\nhint” of how common such intimidation tactics were. He cited the case of the\nSerbian midfielder Andrija Zivkovic, one of the continent’s most promising\nyoung players, who starred at the FIFA U nder-20 World Cup last year and was a\ncenterpiece of the decorated team Partizan Belgrade.Earlier this year, Mr.\nZivkovic, 19, refused to sign a contract extension with Partizan after drawing\ninterest from richer clubs abroad, Mr. Stefanovic said. He was summarily sent\nhome from the club’s training camp and has since been barred from practicing\nwith the first team.“He’s literally running circles by himself,” Mr.\nStefanovic said. “If this happens to one of the best players, imagine what is\nhappening to the other poor guys.”Much of the problem, Mr. Stefanovic said, is\na lack of standard professional contracts for players. Mr. Stefanovic said\nthat in Romania, for example, players are typically assets of the club, which\nmeans that even if a club goes bankrupt, players are not allowed to find new\nclubs because all assets are frozen.Mr. Stefanovic added that as far back as\n2011, FIFPro, which represents players’ interests but lacks collective\nbargaining power or leverage with individual leagues, had asked European\nsoccer’s governing body, UEFA, to consider making standard contracts a\nrequirement. The union has seen no progress, he said, adding, “The problem is\ngetting worse, not better.”According to Maciej Krzeminski, a lawyer for the\nPolish players’ union, Mr. Plaku’s case is typical. Mr. Plaku was a star\ngrowing up here and played for Albania’s national youth teams.Early in the\n2014-15 season, after Mr. Plaku sustained a minor injury while playing for\nSlask Wroclaw, he said he was called into Mr. Zelem’s office for the meeting\nin which he was told to sign the reduced-value contract. After he declined, he\nsaid, the intimidation from the club began.Running and physical exertion were\nconstant, he said, but psychological punishment was significant as well.Most\ndays he was at the club 12 or 13 hours, stopping only for short breaks between\nsessions. He was not allowed to eat with the first team. Some days he was\nallowed to play with the reserves, but when he scored two goals in one match,\nhe said, he was pulled from the game and the coach told him, “Sebi, if you\nscore too many goals, it’s not good for me.”Mr. Plaku was separated from his\nteam for about five months, he said, before his contract was terminated by the\nPolish federation in February 2015. At that point, he was free to sign with\nanother team, but the transfer window in Europe was closed until the summer.\nThe damage to his career had been done, he said.“Now I am close to 31 — it\nwill be difficult to make a step forward,” he said.He shrugged. “I thought it\nwas going to be the best part of my career,” he said. “It turned out to be the\nworst.”\n\n","title":"A Challenge to Soccer’s Version of Solitary Confinement - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"\"Training alone\": Soccer's version of solitary confinement https://t.co/Js3ee3sZUD https://t.co/x3P1tCoxOO","date":"Tue Mar 29 16:55:02 +0000 2016","favs":167,"id":{"$numberLong":"714858416158744576"},"retweets":85},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VRD0AL"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014c1"},"content":"All campaigns want to know the way to the heart of the crucial female\nvoter.Over the years, they have sliced and diced demographics to try to get\nthere. They’ve tried to reach soccer moms, hockey moms, security moms, married\nwomen, unmarried women, white women, black women, Latinas, suburban women and\nespecially women who live in swing states.Women — a group that makes up 52\npercent of the voting-age population — are catered to like a niche group. Why\ndon’t men, specifically white men, get this treatment? Where are the\ncandidates seeking out “security dads” or the key “single men” voters?The\nanswer is simple: In electoral politics, white men are the air we breathe and\nthe water we swim in.“They’re the yardstick against which other groups measure\ntheir own electoral fortunes and influence,” said Jennifer Lawless, a\npolitical science professor at American University. “They’re the most\nprivileged group out there, so the extent to which you match up to that group\nor you’re able to have the amount of access that that group has is how you\ndefine your own political power.”This is an especially weird year for\ndissecting gender politics. On the one hand, we have Hillary Clinton, who,\nunlike any other presidential candidate, has the added advantage in appealing\nto women of actually being a woman. On the other hand, there is Donald J.\nTrump, whose predominantly white, male supporters delight in him saying\n“politically incorrect” things, even when that means implying that his\nopponent’s wife is unattractive.Mr. Trump is also running a campaign that\nanswers the question, What if male voters were treated like female voters?\nWhat if they were reduced to a single issue, condescended to, and counted on\nto show up anyway?There are plenty of examples of how campaigns have done just\nthat to female voters for years.In 2014, the College Republican National\nCommittee released a series of ads aimed at young women, based on the TLC\nprogram “Say Yes to the Dress,” with Republican candidates for governor\nstanding in for garish taffeta creations. In one of the ads, a young woman\nmodels a strapless wedding gown called “The Rick Scott,” to her female\nfriends’ delight. Her mother wants her to wear the frumpy “Charlie Crist”\ndress.In his re-election campaign that same year, Senator Mark Udall, Democrat\nof Colorado, ran ads contrasting his record on supporting access to abortion\nand birth control with that of his challenger, Cory Gardner. At one point in\nthe campaign, ads about abortion and birth control made up more than 50\npercent of the television spots Mr. Udall had on the air, earning him the\nnickname “Mark Uterus.” In the end, Mr. Udall won the female vote by an eight-\npoint margin, but still lost to Mr. Gardner.To Elizabeth Wilner, a senior vice\npresident at Kantar Media, which tracks political advertising, that recent\nexample shows how self-defeating chasing votes by gender can be.“It was a case\nstudy in how you can go too far in one direction treating women not\nnecessarily as a monolithic voting bloc, but as a single-issue voting group,”\nshe said. “They’re related, but they’re not quite the same.”The 2012\npresidential election had the largest gender gap since at least 1952, when\nGallup started measuring that figure. While Mitt Romney won male voters by a\nmargin of eight points, President Obama won female voters by a margin of 12\npoints.Still, though voting seems to vary greatly by gender, no one is\nofficially or openly going after “men’s issues” or male voters. I asked Ms.\nWilner if she had ever seen any ads that she thought clearly went after male\nvoters. She laughed, then paused for six seconds. “No,” she said.“I guess\nbecause of the history of having issues that were viewed as being specific to\nwomen, it’s more noticeable when an ad is catering to women than that you look\nat an ad and think, Oh, that ad is obviously catering to men,” she said. “A\nlot of Republican primary ads are catering to men because they focus on the\nvery muscular issues. They focus on national security. They focus on\nimmigration and closing the border. But women do care about security as\nwell.”Ms. Wilner’s take on the Republican primary ads this year: “They’re\nsimply not at all trying to appeal to women.”Kellyanne Conway, a veteran\npollster who works for a “super PAC” that supports Senator Ted Cruz’s\ncampaign, argued that abortion-rights groups are responsible for the one-\ndimensional narrative about female voters.“Women as a monolith is actually a\nsubtle form of misogyny, and it’s been pushed by frankly, I hate to say it,\nbut it’s been pushed by a lot of professional females in the industry,” Ms.\nConway said. “When you’re a hammer the whole world looks like a\nnail.”Professor Lawless said that people will keep using the phrase “women’s\nrights” as long as there are policies that disproportionately burden women.“As\nlong as women are still primarily responsible for child care and household\nresponsibilities, as long as they’re still making 78 cents on the dollar,\nthere are differences in how policies affect women and men,” she said. “I\nthink that that’s part of the reason that we see this divide.”With Mr. Trump,\nwe are getting the opposite of all of these years of appeals to “women’s\nrights,” for better or worse: He is specifically saying what many women find\nobjectionable, and often doing so enough that it almost seems intentional.The\nanti-Trump group Our Principles PAC recently released an ad showing women\nrepeating offensive things Mr. Trump has said about women.A recent NBC\nNews/Wall Street Journal poll found that 70 percent of women hold a negative\nview of Mr. Trump, with 47 percent of Republican female primary voters saying\nthey could not imagine themselves supporting him for president.“If we end up\nwith a Trump-Clinton general election, we will have a gender gap the size of\nthe Grand Canyon,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. “Many of the things\nthat Donald Trump has said about women make him toxic to many female voters\nacross the country. On the other hand, some of the grievances he has\narticulated resonate particularly well with non-college male voters in many\nparts of the country as well.”The gender gap does cut both ways, even if we\ntend to focus on women’s influence on the electorate (in part because women\nare more likely than men to vote). Hillary Clinton is struggling to gain the\nsupport of white male voters, while Mr. Trump has put non-college-educated\nwhite men, a group of people hit hard by the 2008 economic meltdown, at the\nrhetorical center of every speech and interview he gives.“Democrats have just\nas much of a problem among white men as Republicans do among women,” Mr. Ayres\nsaid.But not all demographics are created equal, according to Ms.\nConway.“Hillary Clinton could get 35 percent of the white male vote and still\nwin,” she said. “Donald Trump can’t get 40 percent of the female vote and\nstill win.”The United States is projected to look quite different,\ndemographically, 30 or 50 years from now. That means white men may be a\nsmaller segment of the voting public, and we’ll need a new name for this niche\nthat future political campaigns will have to sell their message to with their\nown clumsy ad campaigns. Fortunately, a fitting nickname is already available:\nthe Trump voter.\n\n","title":"The League of Men Voters - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Why are women, 52% of the voting-age population, \"catered to like a niche group\" in politics? https://t.co/3M63Sc8uBN via @nytopinion","date":"Tue Mar 29 16:40:05 +0000 2016","favs":193,"id":{"$numberLong":"714854655877099524"},"retweets":149},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1V1f3WX"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014c2"},"content":"WASHINGTON — On weekdays, Dr. Patrick H. Conway is one of the most powerful\ndoctors in America, steering federal health programs that spend nearly $1\ntrillion a year while shaping health policies that affect tens of millions of\ncitizens.On many weekends, he is just another doctor in blue sterile gloves\nand a yellow gown with a stethoscope around his neck, comforting children and\ntraining young physicians, many of whom have no idea of his other role.Doctors\nand hospital executives have long complained that the Centers for Medicare and\nMedicaid Services is out of touch with the real world where care is given. As\nthe Obama administration races to reshape the nation’s disjointed, hugely\nexpensive health care system, those complaints are widespread.But Dr. Conway,\nthe centers’ chief medical officer, is not a bureaucrat removed from the front\nlines of medicine. He treats patients every few weeks at the Children’s\nNational Medical Center here, in addition to serving as the No. 2 official at\nthe federal agency, which provides health insurance to one-third of all\nAmericans.On a recent Saturday, Dr. Conway, a pediatrician, examined a 5\n-month-old girl who had a heart defect and pneumonia, a cranky 2-year-old girl\nwhose body was covered with a mysterious rash, and a 17-year-old patient with\nbelly pain and an inflamed pancreas. (The president of the hospital, Dr. Kurt\nNewman, said he had not known that Dr. Conway worked there until the two\nencountered each other in an elevator several years ago.)Dr. Conway, 41, has a\nsay in almost every significant or controversial health care policy change\ncontemplated by the Obama administration.He is devising a new way of paying\ndoctors under Medicare, as required by a 2015 law, the biggest change in\npayment policy since 1992. He is responsible for deciding whether Medicare\nwill pay for new items and services, like PET scans to help detect Alzheimer’s\ndisease, or counseling patients about end-of-life care. He also leads efforts\nto measure the quality of care provided by doctors and hospitals, so the\ngovernment can tie its payments to their performance.And by using financial\nrewards and penalties, he is trying to nudge doctors and hospitals to provide\nbetter, safer, more coordinated care at a lower cost.“Our fee-for-service\nsystem is broken,” Dr. Conway said. “It causes fragmented care. It pays not\nfor outcomes but for outputs. It causes volume-driven care. So the question\nis, ‘How do we shift that payment model?’ ”Dr. Conway said his experience at\nthe children’s hospital here had contributed directly to changes in federal\npolicy, including a new rule that expanded the role of dietitians. In\naddition, he said, “using electronic health records as a physician in practice\nhas informed the way I think about policy, both what’s good and what needs to\nbe improved” — to ensure that electronic records “do not disrupt the doctor-\npatient experience.”Some experts say federal efforts to measure the quality of\ncare, though well intentioned, are out of control.“We need to stop excessive\nmeasurement,” said Dr. Donald M. Berwick, who headed the Medicare agency in\n2010-11 and recruited Dr. Conway to be the chief medical officer. “I vote for\na 50 percent reduction in all metrics currently being used.”The National\nAcademy of Sciences has expressed concern about the proliferation of quality\nmeasures, including nearly 1,700 used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid\nServices.Many doctors doubt whether the government can reliably assess their\nperformance. In the second round of incentive payments, announced this month,\nfar more doctors received financial penalties than bonuses.“It’s like a\nlottery,” said Anders M. Gilberg, senior vice president of the Medical Group\nManagement Association, referring to the payments. His organization represents\nphysician groups.Despite skepticism or outright resistance from some health\ncare providers, Dr. Conway exudes a boyish enthusiasm for his work.He\nacknowledges that critics have a point. “We do want to focus on smaller sets\nof measures when possible,” he said. He promised that the government would\nconcentrate more on the results of care, not just whether doctors gave the\nrecommended tests and treatments.Consumer advocates like Debra L. Ness, the\npresident of the National Partnership for Women and Families, see Dr. Conway\nas a kindred spirit who understands what is important to patients. “He has the\nexperience of being a clinician, a direct provider of health care services,\nbut also has an incredible grasp of the administrative and policy aspects of\nhealth care,” Ms. Ness said.Some of that insight comes from firsthand\nexperience. Dr. Conway was expelled from the delivery room when his wife\nreceived an epidural injection while giving birth to their fourth child last\nyear.“C.M.S. says you have to leave the room,” said a nurse anesthetist,\nreferring to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Dr. Conway\ncomplied with the request, he said, though he later checked and found that the\nagency had no such regulation.Dr. Conway was the youngest of four children,\nand he realized that he liked working with children when he was a camp\ncounselor in his teens. He received his bachelor’s degree at Texas A \u0026amp; M,\nwhere his father was a chemistry professor and his mother was an assistant\ndean at the business school. He went to Baylor College of Medicine and did his\nresidency at Boston Children’s Hospital, where he met his wife, Heather, a\npediatric intensive care nurse.In 2007, during the Bush administration, he\ncame to Washington as a White House fellow and worked for Michael O. Leavitt,\nwho was then the secretary of health and human services.“I have no idea\nwhether Patrick is a Republican or a Democrat,” Mr. Leavitt said. “He came to\ngovernment not for politics, but for policy.” Voter registration records list\nthe doctor as unaffiliated with any political party.When Dr. Conway speaks to\ngroups of doctors or hospital executives, they often complain that federal\nrules are rigid and oppressive. But he has a way of disarming critics.After\none speech, he recalled, a doctor buttonholed him and said: “I always thought\nC.M.S. was evil. But you’re not evil. You seem very nice. I could work with\nyou.”His zeal to improve care is rooted in personal experience. He was\nfrustrated, he said, at the fragmented care that his father, Dwight Conway,\nreceived when he was dying of cancer in 2007.He promised his father that he\nwould devote his life to trying to fix the health care system. His father told\nhim: “You can’t. It’s too hard. But you are persistent. If anyone can, it\nwould be you.”Dr. Conway also supervises the Center for Medicare and Medicaid\nInnovation, a test bed for new ways of financing and delivering care. In one\nsuch project, Medicare will make a “bundled payment” for hip and knee\nreplacement surgery and 90 days of follow-up care, forcing hospitals to work\nmore closely with doctors, nursing homes and home health agencies.Federal\nofficials are continually trying to measure the quality of care provided to\nMedicare beneficiaries, and Dr. Conway applies similar techniques to his\npersonal life. He has a large whiteboard at work to keep track of office\nprojects, and on one side is a mission statement he and his wife wrote,\noutlining objectives for family life, including ways to be a good father and\nhusband.“He evaluates his performance against those objectives,” said Wesley\nR. Perich, a former deputy in the office. Using one such metric, Dr. Conway\nsaid, he got home for dinner with his family about 75 percent of the time.Some\ndoctors worry that the administration is trying to do too much too fast,\nwithout considering the effects on patients.“Dr. Conway is a very smart man,\nand he is trying lots of innovative programs and ideas,” said Dr. Thomas C.\nBarber, the chairman of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons’ Council\non Advocacy. “But some of those ideas are being implemented before they are\nready.”Among those providing unvarnished feedback to Dr. Conway is his sister,\nDr. Kathleen C. Jurell, who specializes in physical medicine and\nrehabilitation.“I hear from her about C.M.S.,” he said, “and it’s not always\ngood.”\n\n","title":"Shaping Health Policy for Millions, and Still Treating Some on the Side - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"On weekdays, he's one of America's most powerful doctors.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014c3"},"content":"The Secret Service said it would forbid attendees to carry firearms at the\nRepublican National Convention in Cleveland in July, neutralizing a debate\nthat had put pressure on the candidates to take a side on the issue.“Only\nauthorized law enforcement personnel working in conjunction with the Secret\nService for a particular event may carry a firearm inside of the protected\nsite,” Kevin Dye, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement Tuesday.The\ndebate over whether to permit guns at the Quicken Loans Arena in the second-\nlargest city in Ohio flared in the past week after an online petition appeared\non Change.org, taking issue with the arena’s anti-weapons policy in a state\nthat allows “open carry” of firearms.“This is a direct affront to the Second\nAmendment and puts all attendees at risk,” said the petition, which had\ngathered more than 50,000 signatures by Tuesday morning.The petition may have\nbeen a ruse intended to put Republicans on the spot over their support for\nopen-carry laws. A CBS News report linked it to a liberal activist who said it\nwas intended as satire, and some of its signatories seemed to be playing\nalong.Momentum over the issue grew, nonetheless, and the Republican candidates\nfaced increasing pressure to take a position.Appearing on ABC’s “This Week” on\nSunday,  Donald J. Trump, the G.O.P. front-runner, said that he had yet to\nreview the petition, but added that delegates risked becoming “sitting ducks,\nutterly helpless against evildoers and criminals.”He said he was a “very, very\nstrong person for the Second Amendment.”The other Republican contenders,\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, have not commented on\nthe petition, but Mr. Cruz has been a vocal opponent of so-called gun-free\nzones. Messages left with their campaigns on Tuesday were not immediately\nanswered.The fight against gun-free zones has been propelled by Republicans in\nrecent years partly as a response to the drumbeat of mass shootings in the\nUnited States. Gun rights advocates have pushed a “good guy with a gun”\nargument: that licensed gun owners could save lives during such shootings.Mr.\nTrump, who has a wide lead in the delegate count and is under Secret Service\nprotection, said in January that he would eliminate gun-free zones on “my\nfirst day” in the White House.Among the latest battlegrounds is Texas, where a\nlaw was approved last year to allow licensed gun owners to carry them in\nbuildings at state universities, setting off protests by some faculty members\nand student groups.The Secret Service said Tuesday that it had the authority\nto ban guns from sites visited by presidential candidates under its\nprotection.A perimeter would be set up outside the arena during the convention\n— July 18 to 21 — which “individuals determined to be carrying firearms will\nnot be allowed past,” Mr. Dye said.\n\n","title":"No Guns Allowed at Republican Convention, Secret Service Says - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Secret Service to forbid guns at Republican National Convention, ending debate over gun-free venue https://t.co/i2gT5F4ExM","date":"Tue Mar 29 15:55:02 +0000 2016","favs":293,"id":{"$numberLong":"714843314848141313"},"retweets":142},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21Rqhh3"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014c4"},"content":"ATLANTA — President Obama, confronting a national epidemic of heroin and\nprescription drug abuse, met here Tuesday with recovering addicts, doctors and\nlaw enforcement officials to underscore his determination to tackle a problem\nsome critics say he left until too late in his administration.“We are seeing\nmore people killed because of opioid overdose than from traffic accidents — I\nmean, think about that,” Mr. Obama said at a meeting of the National Rx Drug\nAbuse and Heroin Summit. “It has to be something right up at the top of our\nradar screen.”The administration announced an array of new measures to expand\ndrug treatment centers and increase the use of drugs, like naloxone, that\nreverse the effects of overdoses from opioids, ranging from illegal narcotics\nlike heroin to brand-name painkillers like OxyContin and Percocet. These\nmodest steps built on the $1.1 billion in additional funding that the White\nHouse requested this year to fight opioid addiction.But the president said\nthat “this is still an area that’s grossly underresourced.”Mr. Obama cast the\nopioid scourge as having transcended economic and social boundaries. “If\nthere’s a market for heroin in an inner city in Baltimore,” the president\nsaid, “it’s not going to take that long before those drugs find their way to a\nwealthy suburb outside Baltimore.”The president listened as two fellow\npanelists recounted their struggles with drug addiction and a treatment\nprocess that often stigmatized them as criminals. Crystal Oertle, a 35-year-\nold mother of two from Ohio, described how she progressed from the\nrecreational use of the painkiller Vicodin to OxyContin and then, finally, to\nheroin.“They are pretty much like heroin,” she said of Vicodin and OxyContin.\n“When it came to the point when I couldn’t find those pills, I had to go to\nthe street. That’s how I got into using heroin after the pills.”Justin Riley,\n28, said he had begun experimenting with painkillers in third grade to\ncompensate for a feeling of emotional emptiness. “I used to take Benadryl to\nsleep through the night,” he said. Mr. Riley, who has been in recovery since\n2007, runs a nationwide organization that helps young people combat\naddiction.Treating addiction, Mr. Obama said, has been hindered because the\npublic has long viewed opioid use as a character flaw, common to people in\npoor and minority communities. That has changed, he said, because opioid\naddiction has spread so widely.Mr. Obama again spoke about these drugs in\nstarkly personal terms. “When I was a kid, I was— how would I put it? — not\nalways as responsible as I am today,” Mr. Obama said to laughs. “I was lucky\nbecause, for whatever reason, addiction didn’t get its claws into me, with the\nexception of cigarettes.”Mr. Obama said he was not certain why he had not\nstrayed into drug use. He referred to friends who had battled drug addiction\nand “were not more morally suspect than me.”The last time Mr. Obama traveled\noutside Washington to dramatize the scourge of opioid addiction — to West\nVirginia in October — his administration won praise for drawing attention to\nthe problem but was criticized for not doing enough to combat a public health\nepidemic that worsened greatly during his presidency.Since then, the federal\ngovernment has published the first national guidelines  for prescription\npainkillers, required new warning labels for certain kinds of opioid\npainkillers, and requested an additional $1.1 billion to expand treatment\nfacilities and finance programs to prevent overdoses and crack down on illegal\nsales of drugs.“The only thing I would fault them for is that they waited too\nlong to do this,” said Dr. Carl R. Sullivan, the director of addiction\nservices at the West Virginia University School of Medicine. “This has been\nable to idle along for a long time.”In particular, Dr. Sullivan said, the\nnational guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nprovide a “compass point” for the treatment of patients and the education of\nmedical residents and even practicing doctors. “The situation is so dire that\nwe had to do something,” he said.Josh Earnest, the White House press\nsecretary, denied that the administration had waited too long to address the\ncrisis. The Affordable Care Act, he noted, provides funding for expanded\ntreatment of mental health problems, a key cause of drug abuse. By doing so,\nMr. Earnest said, the president shifted the focus from purely law enforcement\nto medical treatment.He said the coming presidential election had thrown a\nharsh spotlight on the extent of the problem. The Democratic front-runner,\nHillary Clinton, after stressing that addiction was a recurring theme in her\ncampaign swings, has proposed $7.5 billion in federal funding to help states\nexpand treatment programs. Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, has spoken\nemotionally of the death of his older half sister, Miriam, from a drug\noverdose at 49.Opioids played a part in 28,648 deaths in the United States in\n2014, a record number, according to the C.D.C., and opioid painkillers like\nOxyContin, Percocet and Vicodin generate nearly $2 billion a year in\nsales.Part of the problem for the Obama administration in combating these\ndrugs is that the epidemic was fueled in part by doctors who prescribed the\nmedicines indiscriminately, but regulating doctors has historically fallen to\nthe states. Massachusetts, Vermont and Maine are among states that have moved\nin recent months to limit the ability of doctors to prescribe these pills. But\npatient and doctor groups, some funded by the pharmaceutical industry, have\nresisted state and federal efforts.To underscore the role of the states, Mr.\nObama invited two lawmakers to join him on the trip: Senator Edward Markey,\nDemocrat of Massachusetts, and Representative Hank Johnson, Democrat of\nGeorgia. Mr. Markey is pushing legislation that would remove all federal caps\non the ability of doctors to prescribe buprenorphine, an opioid derivative\nthat is used to treat people addicted to opioids.“Coming from a state that is\ndisproportionately impacted by this scourge,” Mr. Markey said in a statement,\n“I believe we should do as much as we can, as soon as we can, to expand\ntreatment to those who need it most.”\n\n","title":"Obama Steps Up U.S. Effort to Fight Abuse of Heroin and Painkillers - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Obama steps up the U.S. effort to fight the growing abuse of heroin and painkillers https://t.co/kwyOpSe7QV","date":"Tue Mar 29 15:25:06 +0000 2016","favs":179,"id":{"$numberLong":"714835783530708992"},"retweets":91},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1VRyJgQ"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014c5"},"content":"The 1966 N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament was a pre-March Madness event.\nOnly 22 teams were in it. The tournament was not carried by a major network,\nlet alone the four that televise it now. But it remains a landmark event\nbecause Texas Western started five black players against Adolph Rupp’s all-\nwhite Kentucky in the championship game and won, 72-65.Ten years ago, the game\ngot the Disney Hollywood treatment in the film “Glory Road.”Last month,\nPresident Obama offered a 50th anniversary tribute to Texas Western: “Our\nprogress demands not only Dr. Kings, but Jackie Robinsons. Not only Rosa\nParks, but Aretha Franklins. Not only household names but ordinary Americans\ndoing their part in their own lives with their own example. That’s what we\nhonor today — a group of Americans who laced up their shoes and moved our\ncountry forward.”That game has rarely if ever been seen on television since\nits original broadcast on March 19, 1966, and eventually the rights to the\ntournament were acquired by NBC, CBS and now the partnership of CBS and Turner\nSports. Rebroadcasts of classic games are standard procedure these days; ESPN\nClassic was specifically created (originally as the Classic Sports Network)\nfor that purpose. On the YES Network, classic games are defined as only those\nthe Yankees won, and continue to win, over and over.But not every classic has\na level of historical significance like Texas Western’s. (The college is now\nknown as the University of Texas at El Paso.)Now, fortunately, it will be seen\nagain on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. Eastern on ESPN. How it looks will not be a\nsurprise to those who have seen some clips online: The original black-and-\nwhite broadcast is a little bleached out. But it is intact.“This is clearly a\nseminal event in the history of college basketball, and American sport, in\nterms of integration,” said John Wildhack, an executive vice president of\nESPN, speaking about the original game. “But it was under the radar. I brought\nit up to everybody and asked if there was a copy of the game anywhere.”The\nsearch for the game did not require uncovering a decaying videotape in an\nattic, as was the case with the only known copy of the first Super Bowl. A\nkinescope of Game 7 of the 1960 World Series between the Pittsburgh Pirates\nand the New York Yankees was discovered in Bing Crosby’s wine cellar.It was\nquite easy for ESPN to acquire the rights to the game because the N.C.A.A. is\npretty good about historic preservation. A company called Wazee Digital\nmaintains and licenses an archive whose oldest men’s tournament film contains\nhighlights from the 1939 Oregon-Ohio State championship game.“When the\nquestion came up, I contacted our account rep and asked him if they had the\nentire game,” said Mike Cocchi, ESPN’s director for content rights management.\n“He did a little research and said they had something that might work.”Burke\nMagnus, another ESPN executive vice president, said: “We would have taken as\nmuch of it that existed. But Mike quickly learned it was all available.”ESPN’s\nbroadcast will be augmented with commentary by John Saunders, Jay Bilas and\nMichael Wilbon, but they will not speak during the rebroadcast, an approach\nthat was criticized when NFL Network recently let its announcers speak over\nNFL Films’s restitching of its footage of Super Bowl I. Dave Lattin, the\nstarting center for Texas Western, will be interviewed.The game was originally\nbroadcast by Sports Network Inc., which assembled ad hoc networks of stations\nfor the events it televised in the 1950s and ’60s. Ian Retzlaff, the senior\nsports account manager at Wazee, said he was not certain that the N.C.A.A.\nreceived its copy of the game directly from S.N.I. because it has no\nidentifying onscreen graphics.Whatever the provenance, Wazee uses its\ndigitized version of the original 16-millimeter film of the game to fulfill a\nhandful of requests for clips each year. But Retzlaff said he had been\nsurprised to get a request for the whole game because of ESPN’s reliance on\nlive games and events, news programming and documentaries.Viewers should not\nexpect a great production. Cocchi said it was typical of its day: a lot of\nhigh-angle, center-court shots that wouldn’t be mistaken for a modern\nbroadcast.One person who has seen the game is the writer Frank Fitzpatrick,\nwho viewed a silent version of it provided to him by UTEP while researching\nhis book “And the Walls Came Tumbling Down: The Basketball Game that Changed\nAmerican Sports.” In an article for ESPNcom, he writes that if you watch it,\n“you’ll probably wonder what all the fuss is about” with 10 players in\n“laughably short pants” who “move slowly through 40 minutes of ordinary\nbasketball.“There’s not much drama, very little passion, and, in 2001, you’ll\nsee more athletic talent at many high school games,” Fitzpatrick\ncontinues.But, he adds, the grainy film reveals much more: the crowd, the\nofficials, the referees, the coaches and the cheerleaders, all of them white.\nThe Kentucky fans waving a Confederate flag in the bleachers. And then, he\nwrites: “Walking toward the red ‘M’ at center court, in their orange uniforms\nand white Converse All-Stars, are the five starters for Texas Western. They\nare all black.”\n\n","title":"A Game Changed History, but It’s Hardly Been Seen Since - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"This basketball game changed history, but it's hardly been seen since https://t.co/lDvgPHJ5JH https://t.co/6f4FUvW1Rh","date":"Tue Mar 29 15:16:55 +0000 2016","favs":258,"id":{"$numberLong":"714833723821334531"},"retweets":147},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PBlVDM"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014c6"},"content":"CHICAGO — Late at night this month, the pastor’s phone beeped with a text\nmessage from an anguished parishioner. Andre Taylor, the church member’s\ngreat-nephew, had been shot and killed.“Dre had just turned 16,” the message\nto the pastor, the Rev. Ira Acree, read. “I think that it’s time to call for\naction and solicit help, have the National Guard to take over and patrol the\nChicago streets.”Four days earlier, he had received another text. A different\nparishioner’s granddaughter, Daysha Wright, a 21-year-old nursing student, had\nbeen shot to death in a car, leaving a 2-year-old son.At his desk at Greater\nSt. John Bible Church, Mr. Acree said he was bracing for the coming months.\n“Unless something radical takes place, it’s going to be a blood bath this\nsummer,” he said.Chicago has long been troubled by violence, but homicides and\nshootings have risen sharply this year. Violent crime remains below the levels\nof two decades ago, and criminologists caution against finding trends in only\na few months of data. But City Hall, the police and community leaders are\nalarmed by the surge: As of Friday, 131 people had been killed here in the\nfirst months of 2016, an 84 percent rise in homicides from the same period in\n2015. There had been 605 shootings, nearly twice as many as at this point last\nyear.The increase could hardly have come at a more difficult time. The city is\nat a pivotal moment for law enforcement, mired in a crisis over police conduct\nand discipline and over distrust of officers, particularly among African-\nAmerican residents, who make up about one-third of Chicago’s population.The\nJustice Department is scrutinizing the patterns and practices of the city’s\npolice force; the mayor on Monday named an interim police superintendent to\nreplace the department’s fired leader; and voters have rejected Cook County’s\ntop prosecutor, defeating her in a primary on March 15. The release in\nNovember of a police video that showed a white officer shooting a black\nteenager, Laquan McDonald, 16 times caused longstanding anger about police\nconduct to boil over.And Mayor Rahm Emanuel faces enormous challenges: tamping\ndown a flood of crime while simultaneously repairing frayed relations with the\npeople who live here, as well as addressing low morale among officers.“Trying\nto rebuild and do all of that at the same time, when violence is going up,\ncreates all kinds of additional struggles and issues,” said Kim Foxx, who\ndefeated a two-term incumbent in the Democratic primary to be the next Cook\nCounty state’s attorney in a race that revolved around the McDonald\ncase.Weekends and summer nights have often presented the most danger here, but\nthese days shootings feel constant. On March 14, three police officers were\nshot and wounded in an exchange of gunfire that left a suspect dead. The next\nday, three people were killed in a single hour. The next, people inside two\ncars were reported shooting at one another along Lake Shore Drive.“I’m really\ntired of it, and tired of worrying,” said Gloria Johnson, 37, who serves food\nat a restaurant in Austin, a neighborhood where the authorities say violence\nhas been particularly harsh. Like other parts of the West Side, Austin has\nlong wrestled with economic distress, gangs and crime, and Ms. Johnson bears a\nlong scar on her elbow from a bullet fired about a decade ago. “But it seems\nlike this year is just the worst of the worst,” she said.The police say much\nof the violence in this city of about 2.7 million people is tied to gangs,\nwhich have become disorganized and have splintered into more factions. While\nshootings along Lake Shore Drive and near a W Hotel not far from Chicago’s\nGold Coast have drawn notice, most of those dying are young men on the South\nand West Sides, the police say.Back-and-forth acts of violence between groups,\noften using guns, are common. And the authorities say threats are increasingly\ndelivered through social media (a notion some officers here have begun\nreferring to as “cyberbanging”), perhaps speeding up the pace of retaliation.A\nlong-running dispute between gang factions, the authorities say, was at play\nin November, when Tyshawn Lee, a 9-year-old fourth grader, was lured from a\nSouth Side park where he was playing basketball into an alley where he was\nfatally shot, execution-style. This month, in what the authorities believe was\na continuation of the fight, three more people were shot and wounded, and\nTyshawn’s father, Pierre Stokes, was charged.Few agree on why bloodshed has\nsurged so far this year. Some experts point to relatively mild winter weather,\nwhile others note that Chicago has had ups and downs over many years,\nincluding an uptick in 2012, when more than 500 criminal homicides were\nreported. They point out that the numbers in recent years have been below\nthose in the early 1990s, when more than 900 homicides were reported some\nyears. And the police say the rate of homicides has slowed some in March\ncompared with earlier in the year.“Trying to read too much into this is a\ngrave mistake,” said Craig B. Futterman, a clinical professor of law at the\nUniversity of Chicago. “We’re all just guessing.”Some officers and residents\nsaid they believed that since the McDonald case — and other police shootings\nthat have drawn attention nationwide — Chicago officers may have “backed off,”\nthough others rejected that as an explanation for a rise in violence.Since\nJanuary, officers have recorded 20,908 instances in which they stopped, patted\ndown and questioned people for suspicious behavior, compared with 157,346 in\nthe same period last year. Gun seizures are also down: 1,316 guns have been\ntaken off the streets this year compared with 1,413 at this time last year.In\nan unusual video address meant to reassure Chicago officers, John J.\nEscalante, who had been the interim superintendent, told them, “We are aware\nthat there’s a concern among the rank and file about not wanting to be the\nnext YouTube video that goes viral.”Dean Angelo Sr., the president of the\nlocal police union, said public scrutiny had an effect on officers. “They’re\nbeing videotaped at every traffic stop,” he said.But the drop in street stops\nby the police could be tied to a departmental change that took effect in\nJanuary, requiring officers to fill out a far more detailed form for each one.\nThe change was imposed after the American Civil Liberties Union raised\nquestions about whether officers were targeting minorities in their stops. The\ndepartment recently simplified the required paperwork, and the number of stops\nhas since been on the rise, officials say.Mr. Escalante said in an interview\nthat the department “can’t rely on what we’ve been doing, and we’ve got to\nstart looking at things we can do.”He said changes had been made, including\ndispatching 100 new sergeants to the city’s 22 police districts to oversee\nofficers. He also said that he intended to intensify a program in which gang\nmembers are urged to end criminal behavior and are offered social services,\nand another that holds meetings with families of people on the department’s\nStrategic Subjects List, a database ranking hundreds of people deemed most\nlikely to be victims or perpetrators of shootings.But Mr. Escalante learned\nthis month that he was not in the running to become the permanent\nsuperintendent of the department, and three recommended finalists learned over\nthe weekend that they would not get the job, either. The city has gone months\nwaiting for a permanent replacement for Garry F. McCarthy, the superintendent\nwho was fired after the release of the McDonald video, and while Mr. Emanuel\nannounced that he had chosen Eddie Johnson, a longtime member of Chicago’s\nforce, as the new interim leader, the department’s long-term approach remains\nuncertain.In a statement, Adam Collins, a spokesman for Mr. Emanuel, said,\n“The task before us, and focal point of our efforts, is to rebuild that trust\nwhile continuing to expand our crime-fighting strategy and invest in proven\nprevention programming.”Some are skeptical. “Right now, there’s no strategy,”\nsaid the Rev. Corey Brooks, a minister on the South Side. “Or if there is a\nstrategy, whatever it is, it’s not working.”At his desk, Mr. Acree, the pastor\nat Greater St. John, flinches slightly when his cellphone chirps with new text\nmessages.The police said Friday that they had made no arrests related to the\ndeaths of the family members he has been trying to counsel. The authorities\nsaid a replica gun, drugs and money were found at the scene where Mr. Taylor\nwas shot. They said Ms. Wright was apparently not the intended target of the\nshooting that killed her while she was the passenger in a car.All of it, the\npastor said, had left him with few words. “I make sure they know I will walk\nwith them through this,” he said. “But there’s nothing much I can say. You\ndon’t want to just try to calm people down because you don’t want to give a\nfalse sense of security.”\n\n","title":"Violence Surges in Chicago Even as Policing Debate Rages On - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"\"Unless something radical takes place, it's going to be a blood bath this summer\" in Chicago https://t.co/JUG4jX1mB1 https://t.co/O44BiSZtSh","date":"Tue Mar 29 14:40:04 +0000 2016","favs":361,"id":{"$numberLong":"714824451779596288"},"retweets":157},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1StMcs9"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014c7"},"content":"CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — In a brightly lit classroom here at Harvard, Mia Karvonides\nwas trying to explain to a group of bemused student leaders the difference\nbetween a romantic encounter and “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature,” as\nthe university’s relatively new code of sexual misconduct defines it.She tried\nto leaven the legalistic atmosphere at the town-hall-style meeting with\nrealistic-sounding examples, defying gender stereotypes. Jose and Lisa,\nchemistry students, are working late at night in the lab, she began, when Lisa\ncomes up from behind and kisses Jose on the neck.Such a surprise move, she\nsuggested, could be the beginning of a sexual misconduct complaint. “I want to\nacknowledge that this isn’t so simple,” Ms. Karvonides said. “I don’t have any\nmagic words for you. It takes a little bit of a closer look to grasp the\nconcepts.”Ms. Karvonides is Harvard’s first Title IX officer, leading a new\nbureaucracy that oversees how the institution responds to complaints of sexual\nviolence under Title IX, the federal law that governs gender equity in\neducation. She is one of a rapidly growing number of Title IX employees on\ncampuses nationwide, as colleges spend millions to hire lawyers,\ninvestigators, case workers, survivor advocates, peer counselors, workshop\nleaders and other officials to deal with increasing numbers of these\ncomplaints.Recently, the dean of the law school at the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley, resigned when it became public that he had been\ndisciplined for sexually harassing his executive assistant, yet had been\nallowed to remain on the job. The dean apologized, though he later disputed\nthe circumstances of the case.And the captain of Yale’s basketball team was\nexpelled in February after a confidential school proceeding found that he had\nnonconsensual sex with a female student, according to his lawyer. But the\nlawyer said the former player maintained that the woman had consented.The\nexpansion of Title IX bureaucracies — often at great expense — is driven in\npart by pressure from the federal government, which recently put out a series\nof policy directives on sexual misconduct on campus. More than 200 colleges\nand universities are under federal investigation for the way they have handled\ncomplaints of sexual misconduct, up from 55 two years ago.But the growth of\nthese bureaucracies also reflects the difficulties that students, parents,\nadministrators and faculty members face as they negotiate changing ideas and\nstandards of sexual behavior.And in a report last week, a national association\nof professors said that the Title IX bureaucracy had started to infringe on\nacademic freedom, by beginning investigations into faculty members’ lectures\nand essays.Because of these complexities, dealing with these kinds of cases\nhas been wrenching for students, faculty members and administrators. Many\nwomen’s groups have set a much lower bar for what constitutes sexual\nmisconduct than previous generations, leading to more internal review of\ncampus behavior.“I think this is becoming more of an issue because it’s\nactually being recognized as an issue, rather than hidden behind the veils\nthat existed for previous generations,” said Melanie Boyd, an assistant dean\nfor student affairs at Yale College who oversees sexual violence prevention\nprograms.Title IX, enacted in 1972, bars discrimination on the basis of sex in\neducational programs that receive federal funds. It is more familiar as the\nlaw used to promote gender equity in sports and faculty hiring. But a 2011\nfederal policy statement clarified that it also applies to how universities\ndeal with complaints of sexual assault. At a minimum, federal rules require\ncolleges to designate one Title IX coordinator, at least part time.Many\ncolleges have gone far beyond that, at a cost ranging from thousands to\nmillions of dollars. College officials said it was difficult to put a price\ntag on the efforts because they often spanned more than one department and\ninvolved volunteers and doubling up on jobs.“There’s so much more litigation\non all sides of the issue,” said Brett Sokolow, the executive director of the\nAssociation of Title IX Administrators, an industry group of 5,000 members\nthat did not exist in 2011, and has doubled in size for each of the past two\nyears. “This has very much created a cottage industry.”Title IX coordinators,\nwho carry out policy and oversee how institutions respond to complaints, can\nearn $50,000 to $150,000 a year. Mr. Sokolow estimated that the cost of\nlawyers, counselors, information campaigns and training to fight sexual\nmisconduct ranges from $25,000 a year at a small college to $500,000 and up at\nlarger or wealthier institutions.At the University of California, Berkeley,\nofficials said, Title IX spending has risen by at least $2 million since 2013,\nthough they declined to give the total.“Certainly, colleges are spending more\nrelated to Title IX than ever in history, both preventatively and\nresponsively,” Mr. Sokolow said. He estimated that dealing with an inquiry\ncould cost “six figures,” and that responding to a lawsuit “can run into the\nhigh six or even seven figures, not counting a settlement or verdict.”A check\nof employment ads online found recent calls for Title IX officials at the\nUniversity of Chicago, Elon University, Barnard College, George Mason\nUniversity, University of the Pacific, Lynn University and Columbia\nUniversity.Columbia guarantees outside counsel to advise students on either\nside of the sexual misconduct hearing process, with the university picking up\nthe bill. It has doubled the number of advocates, educators and counselors to\n11 from five just three years ago. Instead of two investigators and case\nworkers, it now has seven.At Yale, nearly 30 faculty and staff members work\npart time or full time in support of Title IX efforts, and twice as many\nfaculty and staff members and students volunteer as advisers and committee\nmembers. In addition, Yale has trained 48 students who are paid to listen to\nstudents and intercede when they seem to be in distress.Occidental College in\nLos Angeles hired a law firm, Pepper Hamilton, to conduct what was essentially\na Title IX compliance audit.Harvard has 50 full-time and part-time Title IX\ncoordinators across 13 schools. Ms. Karvonides, a civil rights and education\nlawyer, was hired in March 2013. Under her leadership, the university adopted\nthe new sexual misconduct policy and created a bureau of trained\ninvestigators.Harvard dormitories have tutors for students to talk to about\nmatters of sexual conduct. This month, a task force recommended that the\nuniversity put more resources into sexual assault prevention, including hiring\none or more people to coordinate the disparate efforts.Still, despite the best\nefforts of Ms. Karvonides and others, students are yearning for a clear code\nof conduct.Some campuses have adopted “affirmative consent” rules, in effect a\nwritten or unwritten contract, requiring a yes before the first kiss and at\nevery step along the way. Harvard has opted instead for what Ms. Karvonides\ncalled a more nuanced standard of “unwelcome conduct.”This has led to\ncriticism by some that the policy is not strong enough, and by others that it\ncould punish behavior as mild as flirting.“This is ubiquitously on the mind of\neveryone at Harvard,” said Daniel Banks, the undergraduate council vice\npresident, who helped organize the recent town-hall-style meeting on the\nsubject. Many students have concluded that the best solution is not so much\ncompliance as avoidance.“You either don’t date at all,” said Daniel Levine,\nanother student leader, “or you’re like a married couple.”\n\n","title":"Colleges Spending Millions to Deal With Sexual Misconduct Complaints - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Colleges across America are spending millions to deal with increasing complaints about sexual violence https://t.co/d6s0xJ2H0q","date":"Tue Mar 29 14:25:04 +0000 2016","favs":173,"id":{"$numberLong":"714820676364931073"},"retweets":151},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21RdRpz"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014c9"},"content":"One afternoon last fall, an actor named Greg Boz got a phone call.It was a job\noffer, but not the kind he was used to getting. The caller was an artist who\nspoke in vague, mystical terms.“She was like, ‘Would you like to be a tool for\na grand architectural design?’” Mr. Boz recalled.Mr. Boz, an improviser and\ncomedian, was intrigued. He could also use the $100 she was offering. The next\nday, he met the woman on a bridge over the famously polluted Gowanus Canal in\nBrooklyn.She wore a gold mask and gold robes. She had an assistant hand Mr.\nBoz a FedEx box.Inside were five taxidermied catfish, each with an extra eye\nstuck to the middle of its forehead.The artist calls herself Zardulu. Her\nmedium is the elaborately staged viral video. As to her own identity, Zardulu\nwill say only that she was born in Manhattan in 1971. Efforts to uncover her\nreal name proved fruitless.She has been revealed as the force behind the\nSelfie Rat, who achieved world fame for appearing to take a self-portrait with\na passed-out man’s phone on a subway platform. She has been suspected as the\ncreator of the even more famous Pizza Rat, caught dragging a slice down subway\nstairs in September, though another man claims credit for that video.On that\nNovember afternoon by the Gowanus Canal, Mr. Boz said, Zardulu enlisted him in\nthe Three-Eyed Gowanus Canal Catfish Project.He was given a fishing pole and\ninstructed to return another day and to appear to have caught one of the fish,\nand to alert passers-by to his catch.“It felt totally fake to me,” Mr. Boz,\n29, said last week at his apartment in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the five\nfish laid out on his kitchen table. “I felt like I was being a bad actor. But\nit was funny.”A few days after Mr. Boz’s faux fishing expedition, an article\nappeared on Gothamist: “Video: Man Claims He Caught Three-Eyed Fish in Gowanus\nCanal.” Mr. Boz said he is not the flannel-shirted fisherman in the video, but\nhe assumes that Zardulu tried the scene with other actors.A slew of news\noutlets, including this one, wrote about the fish with varying degrees of\ncredulousness. It even found its way into the ultimate zeitgeist barometer: a\nsubway ad.Zardulu — or at least, a person writing from the email address that\nMr. Boz and another of Zardulu’s collaborators said was hers — refuses to\nconfirm any connection to a three-eyed fish or to discuss any specific\nillusions. This is understandable. Unlike most artists, Zardulu’s art  seems\nto seek not recognition but erasure. Her art succeeds only to the extent that\nher hand is unseen.She does, however, have plenty to say in a more general way\nabout the enduring power of mystery. Like:“I think creation and perpetuation\nof modern myths is a tragically underappreciated art form. It upsets me when I\nhear people refer to them as lies.”Notwithstanding all that, she is not above\ncoyly taking credit for Pizza Rat — writing that “one day I might be hiding\nbehind around a corner coaxing a rat to drag something down a staircase” —\neven though the man who says he shot the video, Matt Little, insists it is\nlegitimate.Hoaxes are not exactly a new thing on the Internet, which has come\nto seem almost purpose-built to breed them. But Finn Brunton, an assistant\nprofessor of media at New York University and a historian of the web, said\nthat Zardulu’s work was unusual for its generosity. Most hoaxes, he said,\nappear to be motivated by a simple desire to put one over on the world, or by\nhidden commercial interests.Zardulu’s work, he said, “seems to be closer to\ndoing magic. You stage these events, and it delights people and makes them\nhappy to live in a world where something like this took place – and it’s\nalmost as if it really did take place, as long as nobody talks.”Zardulu’s\nexistence was revealed in January after an actor who said he worked with her\nand was irked that she wanted to keep the projects secret contacted several\nnews organizations. He identified another actor, Eric Yearwood, as the man in\nthe Selfie Rat video.Mr. Yearwood, when contacted by the Gothamist, confirmed\nthat the video was staged by Zardulu. Both he and Mr. Little are improv actors\nwho have worked with the Upright Citizens Brigade, a comedy troupe.In an\ninterview on Sunday, Mr. Yearwood said that after Zardulu reached him by\nemail, she summoned him to a face-to-face meeting. She appeared in ceremonial\nrobes and introduced him to her army of trained rats.“It was kind of somewhere\nin between like a chemistry lab meets some kind of artist’s studio space,” he\nsaid.For the Selfie Rat stunt, he said, Zardulu smeared peanut butter on the\nshutter button of a cellphone to get her rat Whiskers to press it.The whole\nexperience, he said, deeply impressed him.“I’ve only met a handful of true\neccentrics in my life, and true artists,” he said. “Art for art’s sake is a\npretty unbelievable thing if you see it with your eyes.”Though he admired\nZardulu and was sworn to secrecy about Selfie Rat, he said he told his story\nin January because it seemed like it was going to get out there one way or\nanother.Mr. Boz said much the same thing. Besides, he said, the artist had\nsigned her name in florid script on the underside of each of the three-eyed\nfish.“With the ‘Zardulu’ written on the bottom,” he said, “she kind of wants\nit to be out there, too.”\n\n","title":"The Artist Behind the Three-Eyed Fish and Selfie Rat, and Other Hoaxes - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The selfie rat a hoax?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014cb"},"content":"Public health advocates who push for taxes on soda say any reduction in sugary\ndrinks can help fight obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. Yet most soda taxes\ntreat all sugary drinks as if they have the same amount of sugar.That’s the\nstructure of Mexico’s soda tax, which went into effect in 2014 and is being\nclosely watched by researchers. It’s also a feature of the soda tax in\nBerkeley, Calif., the first American city to pass one. Those taxes apply a\nsurcharge on every liter or ounce of sugary drink, no matter how much sugar it\nhas.A new soda tax in Britain, expected to become law, is different.The\nBritish tax won’t treat a full-calorie soda and a lightly sweetened iced tea\nin the same way. Instead, it imposes its tax in three brackets. Sugar-free and\nlow-sugar products, those with less than around three teaspoons of sugar for a\n12-ounce can, aren’t subject to any additional tax. Products with between\nthree and five teaspoons, approximately, will pay a lower tax of around 9\ncents for that can. Products like a standard cola, with more than nine\nteaspoons in a can, will pay more, about 12 cents. The result is a slightly\nmore complicated tax structure, but one that might provide some incentives for\nbeverage makers to offer healthier products.Donald Marron, an institute fellow\nat the Urban Institute who studies tax policy, said the tiered prices might\nsteer price-sensitive customers from high-sugar drinks to lower-sugar ones.\nBut he thinks its bigger effect could be encouraging companies to develop\ninnovative drinks for the lower-tax category.“If there are small changes they\ncan make to get under the threshold without really affecting mouth-feel and\ntaste, they may well do that,” he said. In a recent blog post, he hailed the\nBritish idea as a “better soda tax.”Mr. Marron makes his own mid-calorie\nproducts, he said, by mixing diet and regular sodas at soda fountains. But big\nsoda companies have begun experimenting with more professional versions of\nthis idea. Coca-Cola and Pepsi have recently released lower-calorie versions\nof their flagship sodas without eliminating sugar entirely. Coca-Cola Life,\nPepsi Next and Pepsi True each have about two-thirds as many calories as the\noriginals. The companies also offer lower-sugar products in other categories,\nlike iced teas.The beverage industry has introduced these products in response\nto consumer demand for healthier drinks. But they have also been spurred by a\nvoluntary pledge to lower the calorie counts in their beverages by 20 percent\nbefore 2025 in the United States.The soda companies, naturally, oppose soda\ntaxes. But a tax like the British one might give them more of a window to\ndevelop and sell these newer products.The British government says this is its\nhope, pointing to some beverage companies that have already reduced sugar\nlevels.“The independent Office for Budget Responsibility expects that\nproducers will change their behavior as a result of this levy, which will mean\nthat the consumption of high added sugar soft drinks should fall over time,”\nthe treasury said in a fact sheet it released.In the United States,\nconsumption of full-calorie soda is already declining. Americans are drinking\nmore than 25 percent less soda than they were in the late 1990s, a trend that\nis contributing to an overall decline in the number of calories consumed by\nthe average American.In general, sin taxes have tended to follow the model of\nBerkeley’s soda tax. Alcohol taxes are usually imposed by category and volume,\nnot the proof of the drink. But there is one famous example of a tax proposal\nalong the lines of the British soda tax: the carbon tax. That tax, as it is\ndiscussed by economists, is focused on the amount of the damaging ingredient —\ncarbon — not the product that contains it. Under a carbon tax formula, people\nwho get energy from coal, a high-carbon fossil fuel, would pay more than those\nwho get energy from natural gas, which emits less carbon.The result, in\ntheory, is getting people to focus on reducing the harmful ingredient, not its\nvehicle.\n\n","title":"How Britain’s Soda Tax Plan Could Spur New Low-Sugar Drinks - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesbusiness: How Britain’s soda tax plan could spur new low-sugar drinks https://t.co/G4xA4FjOi2 https://t.co/22D71TQDRl","date":"Tue Mar 29 12:58:04 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714798781594730496"},"retweets":39},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21QB7UG"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014cc"},"content":"Californians have lived with the risk of a damaging earthquake for centuries.\nNow Oklahomans, and some Kansans, face the same threat, federal seismologists\nsaid on Monday.In an assessment released by the United States Geological\nSurvey, experts said the chance of a destructive temblor in the next year is\nas great in parts of north-central Oklahoma and southern Kansas — where oil-\nand-gas operations have set off man-made quakes for about five years — as it\nis in the shakiest parts of quake-prone California.The warning came in the\nagency’s map of earthquake risks, a document that for the first time included\nthe prospects for human-caused quakes.“By including human-induced events, our\nassessment of earthquake hazards has significantly increased in parts of the\nU.S.,” Mark Petersen, the chief of the agency’s Natural Seismic Hazard Mapping\nProject, said in a news release.Four other states where waste disposal has led\nto human-induced quakes — Texas, Colorado, New Mexico and Arkansas — face\nconsiderably smaller risks of damaging tremors, the agency said. About seven\nmillion people live in the areas at risk of a human-induced earthquake, most\nof them in Oklahoma and Texas.Over the last 15 years, those states have\nexperienced an explosion in oil and gas production, which releases huge\namounts of toxic wastewater. That wastewater is disposed of by re-injecting it\ninto the ground, into rock formations thousands of feet below the surface,\nincreasing the pressure on existing subterranean faults, and causing them to\nslip and produce tremors.Along with the economic boom from oil and gas\nexploration, Oklahoma has experienced a rising number of earthquakes. In an\naverage year, Oklahoma has historically had fewer than two quakes of magnitude\n3 or greater — roughly the level at which a tremor can be felt. Kansas has had\neven fewer such shocks. But last year, Oklahoma recorded 907 quakes at\nmagnitude 3 and above, and Kansas registered 54.Oklahoma now ranks behind only\nAlaska in earthquake frequency, followed by California.Three of the quakes\nthis year, measured at magnitudes of 4.7, 4.8 and 5.1, were among the largest\nin Oklahoma’s history.Including Oklahoma and southern Kansas on the map\nreinforces what the Geological Survey’s scientists have said for some time:\nThe huge number of small, human-caused quakes in the two states may have set\nthe stage for a larger, more destructive one.The area of greatest risk, the\nagency stated, is a swath of rural land along the Oklahoma-Kansas border that\nhas been repeatedly rocked by tremors. Because the area is thinly populated,\ndamage has so far has been limited.The assessment said that in that area,\nthere is a 5 to 12 percent chance of a level six earthquake on the Mercalli\nindex of intensity, which rates the potential for damage. Level six indicates\na strong earthquake that is widely felt, but that does not cause much damage.\nLevel seven can cause moderate damage in ordinary buildings and considerable\ndamage in lesser ones.But the area of risk also extends through the central\npart of the state toward Oklahoma City, where the rate of quakes has recently\ndropped. Experts estimated the one-year risk there at between 5 and 10\npercent.Twenty other sites in the eastern and central United States have also\nexperienced human-induced quakes, the agency said, but the threat of larger\nquakes in these areas is small, the agency said.The Geological Survey\nemphasized that earthquake prediction was an uncertain science, and that some\nstudies suggested that the maximum magnitude of human-induced quakes was less\nthan that of natural ones.Much of the region’s boom in oil and gas production\ncomes from wells that employ hydraulic fracturing of shale deep in the earth,\na process commonly called fracking. But the scientists said those wells likely\nare responsible for only a tiny share of quakes; fracking-related earthquakes\ntypically are too small to be felt.In both Oklahoma and Kansas, some of the\ntremors over the last five years have rivaled the largest in their\nhistories.This year, Oklahoma has recorded more than 160 quakes with a\nmagnitude of 3 or more. But the pace appears to have slowed after the state’s\noil and gas regulator, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, effectively\nimposed steep reductions in underground waste disposal in February and\nMarch.Earthquake scientists have nevertheless warned that the risk of a larger\nquake does not necessarily drop in lock step with a decline in smaller ones.\nThe forces that have been loosed underground, they say, can take years to sort\nthemselves out.The Geological Survey report also said the chances of a\ndamaging natural earthquake had risen in some parts of the United States.\nScientists noted an increase in the number of small tremors along the New\nMadrid fault, near Memphis, which in the early 1800s was the site of one of\nthe nation’s largest earthquakes. The increase in tremors there has slightly\nraised the prospects of a larger quake, the scientists said.\n\n","title":"Drilling Is Making Oklahoma as Quake Prone as California - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Why a big earthquake may be now as likely in Oklahoma and Kansas as it is in parts of quake-prone California https://t.co/JQPBwuNJ9j","date":"Tue Mar 29 12:45:04 +0000 2016","favs":156,"id":{"$numberLong":"714795508515123200"},"retweets":283},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1qbSXFM"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014cd"},"content":"As a pediatrician, I find that there are few topics that parents want to\ndiscuss more than sleep. Parents worry about their own sleep deprivation when\nbabies arrive. Later, they worry about their children’s. I almost never\nencounter patients who are convinced that they’re getting the recommended\namount of sleep.It’s harder than you might think to determine how much sleep\nan adult actually requires. Modern technology has significantly altered how\nand when we might naturally sleep. Electricity allows us to be productive long\nafter the sun has gone down. Coffee and other stimulants allow us to wake up\nmore quickly. Measuring “natural” levels of sleep would require us to return\nto a simpler time.As part of a German science television show, five men and\nwomen volunteered to return to Stone Age conditions for eight weeks. They had\nno smartphones or Internet, no electricity or running water, no alarm clocks —\nor any clocks for that matter. Enterprising scientists took advantage of this\nto make some measurements.Before the study, they went to sleep (median) about\n20 minutes before midnight. Without interference from modern amenities, their\nbedtimes moved up about two hours. Before the experiment, they woke up\n(median) about 7 a.m. Under Stone Age conditions, they woke up about a half-\nhour earlier.Counting the periods of awake time between going to sleep and\nwaking up in the morning, they had been spending less than six hours asleep\neach night before the experiment, and without outside interference they slept\nabout seven and a quarter hours a night. This might be the closest we’ll get\nto figuring out what a modern human body naturally requires.Granted, many\npeople probably aren’t getting that much. In 2013, the National Sleep\nFoundation released the results of a survey on sleep among people 25 to 55 in\nsix countries. Canadians and Mexicans topped the list at 7.1 hours a night,\nfollowed by Germans at 7 and residents of Britain at 6.8. Bringing up the rear\nwere Americans at 6.5 hours and Japanese at 6.4.Sleeping hours are\ndisproportionate across the socioeconomic spectrum as well. The more you make,\nthe less you sleep. Almost half of people earning less than $30,000 a year\nsleep at least six hours a night, compared with about a third of those earning\nat least $75,000.Americans also sleep less than we used to. In 1942, almost 85\npercent of us slept at least seven hours a night. Today, less than 60 percent\nof us do.Not getting enough sleep is a big problem. Randomized controlled\ntrials show that people who are sleep-deprived can see decreases in their\nempathy. More than one such study has shown that sleep deprivation can leave\npeople more sensitive to pain. Sleep deprivation can hurt cognition, and it is\nassociated with many, many car accidents.But serious sleep deprivation in\nadults is most likely rarer than many think it is. After all, people in\ncontrolled studies of sleep deprivation are usually getting very, very little\nsleep. Complicating things, not all people react to sleep deprivation in the\nsame way. Some people just need less sleep, and that may be somewhat genetic.\nMany news reports that highlight the dangers from too little sleep are\nassuming that all adults need at least eight hours. There’s just little\nevidence that’s so.There’s one group where that may not be true, however.\nYounger people need more sleep than adults. The National Heart, Lung and Blood\nInstitute recommends that newborn babies get 16 to 18 hours of sleep a day.\nIt’s likely that many of them get that, because we let them. As I tell parents\nall the time, only a fool wakes a sleeping baby. The usual recommendation for\npreschool children is 11 to 12 hours, school-age children 10 hours and\nteenagers about 9 to 10 hours a night.It’s likely few teenagers are sleeping\nthat much.The most obvious reason for that is that the high school day\ngenerally starts so early. Next year, when my oldest heads to ninth grade, his\nbus will come for him around 6:45 a.m. To get nine hours of sleep, he will\nhave to be asleep by 9:15. Going to bed early doesn’t seem to bother Jacob\nmuch, so I imagine he might just do that; most teenagers can’t, though.Many of\nthem are engaged in activities after school. They eat dinner late, so that\nthey can be with their parents, who probably work late. They also need time to\nget their homework done, let alone to have any type of social life.There’s no\ngood reason school has to start this early, and starting it later might\nimprove the amount of sleep teenagers get. A study published in 2014 examined\n9,000 students in eight public schools in three states. It found that in high\nschools where classes began at 7:30 a.m., about a third of children got at\nleast eight hours of sleep a night. If they started at 8:35 a.m., about 60\npercent of children achieved that goal.Moreover, the later start time was\nassociated with improvements in a number of subjects, as well as state and\nnational achievement test scores. Attendance increased. Perhaps more\nimportant, the number of car crashes by drivers 16 to 18 was reduced by 70\npercent when school start times were changed from 7:35 to 8:55.It’s for\nreasons like these that the American Academy of Pediatrics released a policy\nstatement in 2014 calling for a shift in school start times to 8:30 or later.\nFew school systems, however, have heeded the call.Many media stories about\nsleep breathlessly worry that the average American is at grave risk because of\nsleep deprivation. Even if it were true, that could be improved for many of us\nby choosing to turn off our devices and shut our eyes just a little bit\nsooner. Too few stories focus on those who are really at risk for sleep\ndeprivation, namely teenagers. It’s not their fault. We could fix this problem\nfor them.\n\n","title":"Schools Are Slow to Learn That Sleep Deprivation Hits Teenagers Hardest - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Teens: It's not your fault that you are sleep deprived.\nAdults: Here's how you could fix that problem for them. https://t.co/UOa21MoyRx","date":"Tue Mar 29 11:27:01 +0000 2016","favs":264,"id":{"$numberLong":"714775866966978560"},"retweets":175},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1UXGJfn"}

He was 69.The cause was a heart\nattack, said his wife, Leticia Lopez Erevia.Mr. Erevia, who single-handedly\nwiped out four enemy bunkers while his comrades lay wounded, said years later\nthat after his heroics had been made known a fellow soldier was asked to draft\na citation for the Medal of Honor, the highest military award.Instead he\nreceived the Distinguished Service Cross, the nation’s second-highest award\nfor valor. Mr. Erevia long believed that he had been denied the Medal of Honor\nbecause he had survived the firefight. (In fact, recipients are frequently\nstill alive when given the award.)But a 12-year Pentagon investigation,\nmandated by Congress, of discrimination in the awarding of the Medal of Honor\ncame to a different conclusion: that the heroism of Mr. Erevia and 23 other\nArmy veterans of World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars — most of them\nHispanic — had been undervalued because of their race, religion or ethnicity\nand thus denied the medal unjustly.That wrong was rectified at a White House\nceremony in March 2014, when President Obama awarded the medal to the 24\nveterans. Mr. Erevia, in his full dress uniform, was one of three men on hand\nto receive the honor. The 21 others had not lived to see the moment.His\nheroics took place on May 21, 1969, near Tam Ký City, a coastal town south of\nDa Nang in South Vietnam. Sergeant Erevia, a radio telephone operator with the\nrank of specialist fourth class, was part of a company that had breached the\nenemy’s defensive perimeter near the town and was continuing its advance. Mr.\nErevia was delegated to stay behind and treat the wounded.When he and his\nhalf-dozen wounded comrades came under heavy fire, however, he gathered their\nweapons and, after a companion, Patrick Diehl, was shot, charged four enemy\nbunkers armed with hand grenades and two M-16 rifles.“I zigzagged, firing my\nM-16,” he told NPR in 2014. “I thought I was going to get killed instantly,\nyou know.”He “fought his way to the final bunker, running and firing both M-16\nrifles simultaneously, and killed the fortification’s defender with point-\nblank fire,” according to the official citation, “then returned to the\nsoldiers charged to his care and resumed treating their injuries.”Santiago\nJesus Erevia was born in Corpus Christi, Tex., on Dec. 15, 1946, the son of a\nlaborer, also named Santiago, and Raphaela Erevia.As a boy, he picked cotton\non a farm near Nordheim, a tiny town between Corpus Christi and San Antonio.\nHe excelled in math in high school but was persuaded by his father to drop out\nwhen he was a sophomore so that he could go to work.When he was 22, working as\na cook and going through a divorce, he decided to volunteer for the Army\nrather than wait to be drafted. He also saw the military as an opportunity to\nfurther his education.He was assigned to Company C, First Battalion, 501st\nInfantry, 101st Airborne Division.On his second day in Vietnam, he recalled in\nan interview with _NCO_ magazine, “we were in line, and maybe 200 or 300 yards\nfrom where I was, one guy stepped on a mine, and his boot landed about 10 feet\nfrom where I was.”“And that was my first experience there,” he added. “I had\nonly about 350 days to go.”He earned the nickname Mr. Lucky for escaping\ninjury.Mr. Erevia left active service in 1970, served in the Texas National\nGuard for 17 years and retired from the United States Postal Service in\n2002.In addition to his wife, he is survived by three sons, Jesse Edward,\nJames and Roland, and a daughter, Rosie.\n\n","title":"Santiago Erevia, Once Denied Medal of Honor Over Ethnicity, Dies at 69 - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The NYT obituary for Santiago Erevia, once denied Medal of Honor over ethnicity https://t.co/isEhO6Xmby https://t.co/77KMfX3kQi","date":"Tue Mar 29 11:01:04 +0000 2016","favs":258,"id":{"$numberLong":"714769335861047297"},"retweets":155},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1RMcTeS"}

Mr. Auernheimer was initially\nconvicted of identity fraud and conspiracy to access a computer without\nauthorization, but his conviction was overturned on appeal.Mr. Auernheimer\nsaid in an interview on Monday that he sent the fliers to every publicly\naccessible printer in North America. He said he did not specifically target\ncollege campuses.The fliers directed readers to The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi\nwebsite. Mr. Auernheimer said free speech concerns were behind his printing\nspree. “My motivation is this: White cultures and only white cultures are\nsubject to an invasion of foreigners.”The debate comes at a time of heightened\nawareness about speech on campus. Black student movements at many campuses\nbroke out this school year, protesting what students saw as the continuing\nlegacies of racism. Last week, the University of California became the first\npublic university system to adopt an official stance condemning anti-Semitism\non their campuses.After the fliers appeared on Princeton University printers,\nthe administration promised to try to “block any further messages.”Some\nleaders of the black protests here said they saw a discrepancy between the\nuniversity’s response to the fliers and what they saw as racism against black\nstudents in the past.Almost a year ago, after Urban Congo, a student\npercussion group, performed on campus in loin cloths, which many on campus\nfound offensive, the university’s president, Christopher L. Eisgruber, sent an\nemail to the student body that affirmed the school’s commitment to free\nspeech.He reiterated that on a trip to India last week, when he told the\nIndian Express, “We think it’s very important for people be able to say what\nit is they want to say even if it’s offensive to the government or offensive\nto some of the other people on campus.”Asanni York, a member of the Black\nJustice League, an activist group that led a sit-in in November that called\nfor the removal of President Woodrow Wilson’s name from the campus because of\nhis racist positions, said the university’s response to the fliers differed\nfrom past stances. “When it was happening to black students, it was a matter\nof free speech,” he said. “Now that it’s happening to white, Jewish students,\nit’s something else. There seems to be no conflation of hate speech and free\nspeech now.”A Princeton spokeswoman, Min Pullan, said the fliers were not a\nquestion of free speech. “External messages infiltrating our campus is a\ncompletely different matter. They are not two things that can be compared,”\nMs. Pullan said.In addition to Princeton, the messages appeared at the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley; Smith College; Brown University; the\nUniversity of Massachusetts, Amherst; and Mount Holyoke College, among other\nplaces.Many university printers allow printing from outside their computer\nnetworks. Mr. Auernheimer said he did not hack into the printers, but\nactivated them using remote access.In response to the fliers, universities\nhave notified the police and begun to conduct investigations, but it was\nunclear if Mr. Auernheimer broke any laws. DePaul University in Chicago, for\ninstance, has turned off remote printing.On Monday morning, anti-gay and\ntransgender fliers appeared on printers at the University of California,\nBerkeley, and the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Mr. Auernheimer said\nhe was not involved with them.\n\n","title":"Hacker Says He Printed Anti-Semitic and Racist Fliers at Colleges Across U.S. - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Hacker says he printed anti-semitic and racist fliers at colleges across U.S. https://t.co/gzIYluGzeb","date":"Tue Mar 29 10:01:03 +0000 2016","favs":61,"id":{"$numberLong":"714754235502559233"},"retweets":50},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1XZvPFm"}

Still, Dr. Bui\ncould see problems.Seven patients had turned up with multidrug-resistant\ntuberculosis; four had been cured, two had died — and one had simply\ndisappeared.It’s a story repeated throughout Vietnam. The nation was once\nracked by a tuberculosis epidemic, one of the worst in which H.I.V. was not\nthe driving force. But officials fought back fiercely.Twenty-five years ago,\nbattered by the aftermath of a long war, chronic poverty and a heavy-handed\ngovernment isolated from much of the world, Vietnam had nearly 600 cases of\ntuberculosis for every 100,000 residents. Today, it has less than 200.The\ncountry boasts a 90 percent cure rate for uncomplicated tuberculosis and cures\n75 percent of its drug-resistant cases, easily beating the global average, 50\npercent.Indeed, public health officials worldwide have made remarkable\nprogress against tuberculosis. Deaths from the disease have fallen drastically\nsince 2000, according to the World Health Organization. Tuberculosis has been\nhalted or reversed in 16 of the 22 countries that account for the vast\nmajority of cases.But Ban Ki-moon, secretary-general of the United Nations,\nlast week warned that the fight was “only half won” and estimated that 1.5\nmillion worldwide would die of the disease this year.There is no better\nexample of how fragile this success may be than Vietnam. Hospital wards here\nare packed dangerously full, raising the risk that drug-resistant strains will\nspread.The easy-to-reach patients have been treated, and many of the rest are\nthe hardest to help: heroin-addicted couriers and laborers from the poppy\nfields of the nearby Golden Triangle, and mountain villagers who do not speak\nVietnamese and are barely connected to the health care system.But the biggest\nthreat is that the money is close to running out.“Our TB program is cost-\neffective and has great impact,” said Dr. Nguyen Viet Nhung, its national\ndirector. “But I always emphasize that this is a preliminary success. We need\nto sustain it.”To reach Vietnam’s ambitious goal of pushing prevalence rates\ndown to 20 cases per 100,000 residents — essentially eliminating tuberculosis\nas a public health problem — its tuberculosis-control program needs to spend\nat least $66 million a year. It now spends about $26 million a year.About $19\nmillion of that comes from foreign donors, with more than a third from the\nUnited States, Dr. Nguyen said. Evidence of donor help is everywhere.The\nexpensive diagnostic machines in hospital laboratories bear stickers from the\nUnited States Agency for International Development or from The Global Fund to\nFight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, 30 percent of whose budget is paid by\nthe United States. But The Global Fund, the chief support of the tuberculosis\nprogram here, has long struggled to meet its fundraising goals, and Vietnamese\nofficials worry about what happens when its current commitment ends in 2017.\nThe White House tried to reduce the American contribution to the fund in\nfiscal year 2016 (Congress restored it), and proposed cuts to Usaid’s\ntuberculosis programs in both 2016 and 2017.Officials here and at the W.H.O.\nfear that hard-won progress may soon be reversed and a remarkable success\nstory may come apart, with deadly consequences.After years in the shadow of\nthe AIDS epidemic, tuberculosis is regaining its notoriety as one of the\nworld’s great killers: an airborne bacterium that spreads easily among people\nliving crowded together — in jails, ships, mines, trenches or slums — and\ninsinuates itself deep in the lungs and grows, slowly tearing apart the tissue\nuntil victims are coughing up blood.Tuberculosis now kills more people around\nthe world than AIDS, according to the W.H.O.: 4,100 a day, compared with 3,300\ndying of AIDS, making tuberculosis the leading infectious cause of death in\nthe world.Mortality from both diseases is dropping, but tuberculosis deaths\nhave fallen more slowly, especially in Asia.Vietnam’s success where so many\nother nations have failed is not just because of donor money, said Dr. Mario\nC. Raviglione, the director of the W.H.O.’s global tuberculosis program.“It\nsucceeds because it’s a Communist country,” he said. “Socialist countries put\na lot of resources into primary care: lots of doctors, lots of clinics. And\nonce central government adopts a thing, they really _do_ it. They give\norders.”Tuberculosis is an ideal disease for a regimented treatment\napproach.Almost all patients with “uncomplicated” tuberculosis — bacteria that\nare not drug-resistant — can be cured if they take a standard menu of four\nantibiotics every day for six months without fail.In Vietnam, treatment\nstandards set at the national level are followed by the entire public health\nnetwork. The National Lung Disease Hospital in Hanoi oversees 64 provincial\nhospitals, which oversee 845 district hospitals, which oversee 11,065\nneighborhood health clinics.The pharmaceutical-supply chain, the Achilles’\nheel in many tuberculosis-ridden countries, is impressive. On a weeklong tour\nof urban and rural clinics, not one nurse or patient reported ever running out\nof drugs.Those neighborhood clinics — usually just a few examining rooms, a\nsmall pharmacy and a parking lot — are as ubiquitous here as police stations\nand firehouses in the United States.They treat many illnesses, but their role\nin tuberculosis is simple: Every tuberculosis patient in the district reports\nonce a day to take his or her pills in front of a nurse. Each dose taken is\nchecked off on a yellow card.Most patients comply without complaint, doctors\nsay. Many poor countries are chaotic; Vietnam, while poor, is not. Parks are\nneatly trimmed, public bathrooms are clean, and police in gold-buttoned\nuniforms and high-brimmed hats are omnipresent.Nonetheless, there are a few\nstubborn patients — Dr. Bui’s missing patient was a heroin addict who infected\nhis mother with drug-resistant tuberculosis before disappearing. And the\ncountry has one surprising gap: It has no quarantine laws.In New York City’s\noutbreak of drug-resistant tuberculosis in the 1990s, officials legally locked\nup patients who refused to take their pills. The rare noncompliant patient\nhere faces no such threat.“We can’t do that,” said Dr. Le Minh Hoa, the head\nof treatment at Hanoi’s provincial lung hospital. “And besides, we don’t have\nenough spaces for the people who want treatment.”Patients with drug-resistant\ndisease are especially hard to help. Their medicines, some of which are\nintravenous, must be taken for two years, and can cause deafness, psychosis\nand kidney failure. Patients must be hospitalized, their movements restricted\nto one or two corridors, sometimes for months until they are no longer\ncoughing up live bacteria.Hospital wards are full of stooped, forlorn-looking\nmen and women in masks and pajamas waiting to be declared well enough to go\nhome and become a district outpatient.If they become worse instead of better,\nthe prognosis is usually grim. Extensively drug-resistant disease (XDR TB)\nrequires even more toxic drugs costing 25 times as much. Most XDR TB patients\nhere die.Pham Thi Tuy, 25, was an unlucky woman — she caught a drug-resistant\nstrain, perhaps at her job as a medical technician. Facing two years of\ntreatment, she lay hooked up to an IV in Dr. Le’s hospital, nauseated and\nexhausted by the drugs, watching videos on her cellphone all day.“I only went\nto the doctor for an earache,” she said. “It didn’t go away and didn’t go away\n— and they finally did a test and said it was TB.”She hoped her fiancé would\nwait two years for her to recover, she said — and then suddenly looked up at\nDr. Le.“When I finish this, will I still be able to have children?”“Yes,” Dr.\nLe said, patting her hand.Ms. Pham’s eyes crinkled behind her mask, suggesting\na sweet smile, and she gave a big thumbs-up.There are many signs that the\nnational tuberculosis program here survives on a shoestring budget.While its\ntop laboratories have some modern equipment, the 64 provincial hospitals share\nonly 60 rapid diagnostic machines, less than half the number they need, even\nthough Vietnam pays only $17,000 for each, about a tenth of the American\nretail price.More ominously, hospital wards are dangerously crowded. Seven\npatients a room, with beds only a foot apart, is not an uncommon sight. (That\neffectively means 14 inhabitants a room, as many patients have a relative\nsleeping on the floor or in a corridor to do nursing chores and bring\nfood.)Windows and doors are kept open to blow away the bacteria that patients\ncough up. In chilly Hanoi, patients like Ms. Pham wear parkas in bed; in\ntropical Ho Chi Minh City, the former Saigon, they perspire in the muggy\nheat.Dr. Thuy Nguyen Thu, the head of the inpatient unit at the National Lung\nDisease Hospital, which treats the toughest cases, said four of her staff had\ncaught tuberculosis in the last five years. New nurses were nervous, she\nsaid.Dr. Thuy had asked for ozone air filters, better fans and safer face\nmasks, “but there are budget limitations.”Geography presents the tuberculosis-\ncontrol program with another kind of obstacle. In the Shangri La-like valleys\nof Son La province, a six-hour drive west of Hanoi, some inhabitants live in\nvillages with thatched roofs and speak only Hmong, Meo or Thai.Finding and\nkeeping them in treatment is hard, said Dr. Tong Van Hieu, the director of the\nQuyet Thang neighborhood clinic in Son La. Some believe tuberculosis is caused\nby fog or dust or gold mine fumes, and turn first to folk remedies.In the\ncities, a new problem is on the rise.Vietnam’s growing prosperity lets some\npatients afford private doctors — who often ignore the official four-drug\nregimen and fail to insist their patients take every pill.Pharmacists sell\nantibiotics without prescriptions, so some wealthy patients swallow only what\nthey feel like taking. As a result, Dr. Phat Nguyen Ngoc, the head of a\ndistrict hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, said about a third of his patients with\ndrug-resistant disease had gotten it because they had seen private doctors\nfirst and had taken too few pills, or the wrong ones.And sometimes, even when\ncompliant patients play by the rules, treatment fails, anyway.In the Hanoi\nLung Disease Hospital, Hoang Van Toan, a weathered farmer looking much older\nthan his 49 years, sat wrapped in a blanket. He had taken all his pills, he\nsaid, but tuberculosis had somehow outwitted them.The room was bare, with no\ntelevision or any other diversion. “I talk to my wife,” he said, nodding at\nthe woman sitting on the temporarily empty bed opposite him.“And I walk for\nthree hours every day at dawn,” he added, pointing out the window to a nearby\npark. He wears a surgical mask as required, he said, but that makes no one\nnervous in Hanoi; thousands of passing motorcyclists wear them, too.What made\nhim saddest, he said, is that it is still too dangerous for his grandchildren\nto visit.Asked if he would make it through the next two years, he said “Yes,”\nemphatically.“I was a soldier,” he added. “I fought the enemy. I can fight\nthis.”\n\n","title":"Vietnam’s Battle With Tuberculosis - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Vietnam’s Battle With Tuberculosis https://t.co/ALE21nzZ5v","date":"Tue Mar 29 09:58:44 +0000 2016","favs":85,"id":{"$numberLong":"714753650451734528"},"retweets":62},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21QMrQy"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014d1"},"content":"SAN FRANCISCO — The Justice Department said on Monday that it had found a way\nto unlock an iPhone without help from Apple, allowing the agency to withdraw\nits legal effort to compel the tech company to assist in a mass-shooting\ninvestigation.The decision to drop the case — which involved demanding Apple’s\nhelp to open an iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, a gunman in the December\nshooting in San Bernardino, Calif., that killed 14 people — ends a legal\nstandoff between the government and the world’s most valuable public company.\nThe case had become increasingly contentious as Apple refused to help the\nauthorities, inciting a debate about whether privacy or security was more\nimportant.Yet law enforcement’s ability to now unlock an iPhone through an\nalternative method raises new uncertainties, including questions about the\nstrength of security in Apple devices. The development also creates potential\nfor new conflicts between the government and Apple about the method used to\nopen the device and whether that technique will be disclosed. Lawyers for\nApple have previously said the company would want to know the procedure used\nto crack open the smartphone, yet the government might classify the\nmethod.“From a legal standpoint, what happened in the San Bernardino case\ndoesn’t mean the fight is over,” said Esha Bhandari, a staff lawyer at the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union. She notes that the government generally goes\nthrough a process whereby it decides whether to disclose information about\ncertain vulnerabilities so that manufacturers can patch them.“I would hope\nthey would give that information to Apple so that it can patch any\nweaknesses,” she said, “but if the government classifies the tool, that\nsuggests it may not.”In a two-paragraph filing on Monday, the Justice\nDepartment said it had “now successfully accessed the data stored on Farook’s\niPhone and therefore no longer requires the assistance from Apple.”F.B.I.\ninvestigators have begun examining the contents of the phone but would not say\nwhat, if anything, they have identified so far. A senior federal law\nenforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said it was\npossible that law enforcement might not find anything useful on the phone.The\nJustice Department also remained tight-lipped about how it was able to finally\nget into the smartphone after weeks of furious public debate.A second law\nenforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reporters in a\nconference call said that a company outside the government provided the F.B.I.\nwith the means to get into the phone used by Mr. Farook, which is an iPhone 5C\nrunning Apple’s iOS 9 mobile operating system. The official would not name the\ncompany or discuss how it was accomplished, nor would officials say whether\nthe process would ultimately be shared with Apple.Melanie Newman, a\nspokeswoman for the Justice Department, signaled in a statement that the\nbroader battle over access to digital data from devices was not over.“It\nremains a priority for the government to ensure that law enforcement can\nobtain crucial digital information to protect national security and public\nsafety, either with cooperation from relevant parties, or through the court\nsystem when cooperation fails,” Ms. Newman said. “We will continue to pursue\nall available options for this mission, including seeking the cooperation of\nmanufacturers and relying upon the creativity of both the public and private\nsectors.”“This case should never have been brought,” Apple said in a\nstatement, adding that it would continue to help with law enforcement\ninvestigations.Given that the F.B.I. may never tell Apple how it forced open\nthe iPhone, the company also said that it would “continue to increase the\nsecurity of our products as the threats and attacks on our data become more\nfrequent and more sophisticated.”The conflict between Apple and the government\nerupted openly last month when a federal magistrate judge in California\nordered the Silicon Valley company to help unlock the smartphone used by Mr.\nFarook. Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, opposed the court order in a\npublic letter, saying that “compromising the security of our personal\ninformation can ultimately put our personal safety at risk.”The resistance led\nto heated rhetoric from both sides in dueling court filings, and the issue\nspurred debates — finding its way onto late night talk shows, and dividing the\npublic. Apple and the Justice Department had been due in court last week in\nRiverside, Calif., and the case was seemingly headed toward appeals and even\nthe Supreme Court.Then last Monday, the Justice Department said it had been\napproached by a third party with a potential alternative method for opening\nthe iPhone.The Justice Department’s cracking of the iPhone has implications\nfor other cases that involve locked iPhones. Last month, a federal magistrate\njudge in the Eastern District of New York refused to grant an order, requested\nby the government, that asked Apple to extract data from an iPhone used by a\ndrug dealer in Brooklyn. The Justice Department is in the process of appealing\nthat decision.The federal law enforcement official who spoke on the condition\nof anonymity to reporters on Monday said it was premature to say whether the\nmethod it used to open the phone in the San Bernardino case could be used on\nphones in other cases. The phone in the Brooklyn case was an iPhone 5S running\nthe iOS 7 mobile software.“Courts should be skeptical going forward when the\ngovernment claims it has no other option besides compelling a device maker’s\nassistance,” said Riana Pfefferkorn, a cryptography fellow at the Stanford\nCenter for Internet and Society.“Now that the F.B.I. has accessed this iPhone,\nit should disclose the method for doing so to Apple,” she added. “Apple ought\nto have the chance to fix that security issue, which likely affects many other\niPhones.”\n\n","title":"U.S. Says It Has Unlocked iPhone Without Apple - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"U.S. withdraws Apple case saying it has unlocked iPhone, but privacy questions remain https://t.co/YKxw6SPI4p","date":"Tue Mar 29 09:21:07 +0000 2016","favs":157,"id":{"$numberLong":"714744183853080576"},"retweets":128},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1XZvS3V"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014d2"},"content":"You didn’t read the fiction of Jim Harrison, who died on Saturday at 78, for\nplot. You read it for its appetites. Mr. Harrison was our poet laureate of\nlumbering desire. His books declared: If you aren’t taking big bites out of\nwhatever life is on offer to you, you are doing it wrong.Mr. Harrison tattooed\nevery available surface, in his prose, with ideas and impressions about almost\neverything: sex, death, hawks, paperback books, Hawaiian shirts, getting lost\nin the woods, mustaches, guns, red wine, illness, roast beef sandwiches and\nlong-form love.He wrote about macho guys. (He preferred the word “nacho,” like\nthe corn chips.) But they were sensitive and easily wounded macho guys, given\nto pratfalls of every variety. He liked to give the good lines to women. In\n“The Beast God Forgot to Invent” (2000), one of his many books of novellas, a\nwoman complains about a central drawback of Manhattan life: “There’s no nature\nin New York, and the closest you can get is an orgasm.”Mr. Harrison was a\nseemingly casual writer; his long sentences flowed like streams. These streams\nwere rocky with wit. I reread his first novel, “Wolf” (1971), not long ago.\nMr. Harrison’s hero finds himself driving endlessly across Nevada, and he\ncomments: “I see why they test atomic bombs in this state — if they didn’t I\nwould, only in more central locations.”My favorite Harrison novels remain his\nearly ones: “Wolf,” “A Good Day to Die” (1973), “Farmer” (1976) and “Warlock”\n(1981). This might be sentimentality speaking. I read them at an\nimpressionable age, and they meant — and mean — a lot to me.They offered a\nworldview, suggesting that to live well was to live with curiosity and humor.\nThey spoke a subliminal truth about writers, that the good ones are rarely the\npretentious ones.These novels set the tone for his oeuvre. He wrote about men\nmoving through the woods and sometimes across the country, on offbeat personal\nmissions or on the run from heartbreak or misfortune. Emotionally and\nintellectually, they have many self-inflected wounds to lick.Mr. Harrison was\na more cerebral writer than he is often given credit for. In his memoir, “Off\nto the Side” (2002), he reads books as if he were shoveling coal into a blast\nfurnace. He wore his erudition with enviable lightness.That memoir is a\nreminder that Mr. Harrison’s nonfiction, to some of us at any rate, is nearly\nas valuable as his fiction. His essays are collected in two books, “Just\nBefore Dark” (1991) and “The Raw and the Cooked: Adventures of a Roving\nGourmand” (2001). Both are worth possessing.Mr. Harrison paid a price for his\nappetites. His suffered from gout, and his essay about it, “One Foot in the\nGrave,” collected in “The Raw and the Cooked,” is probably the finest we have\nabout this malady. This is the kind of pain, he declared, “where you limp\ntoward the bathroom calling out for pets that died in your youth.”Worse, you\nhave no one to blame but yourself. “In bed, after the hysterical removal of\nthe boot, with the foot propped up,” he wrote, “you stare at this blushing,\nthrobbing appendage and do not say ‘Why me?’ because you know so poignantly\nthe answer.”Mr. Harrison’s later fiction and poetry was increasingly concerned\nwith illness and mortality. Not that he didn’t try to stay limber. In 1988,\nwhen he was 50, an interviewer from The Paris Review asked him if he was\nbeginning to lose his stamina.He seemed to find this question absurd, so he\ngave an absurd reply. “Actually, it’s increased over what it was 10 years\nago,” he said. “I usually dance a half-hour a day to Mexican reggae music with\n15-pound dumbbells. I guess it’s aerobic, and the weights keep your arms and\nchest in shape.”In a later book, a character thinks, “I have certainly rounded\nthird base and am headed for home plate, which is a hole in the ground.” But\nhis fiction was never morose.In his most recent book of poems, “Dead Man’s\nFloat,” he remained committed to whatever pleasures were still on offer. He\nwrote:I knew Mr. Harrison, not well, just a bit. I edited some of his pieces\nfor The New York Times Book Review, when I was an editor there, and once in a\nwhile he’d call when he was in town.He was a jumbo presence. People gawked at\nhim when he strolled down the street, not because they knew who he was but\nbecause they felt they should know who he was. He _looked_ famous.I was at\ndinner with him once, at a trendy Manhattan restaurant, when he lit a\ncigarette. This was about a year after the city’s smoking ban began. Since he\ngot away with it, diners at surrounding tables quickly lit up, too. Briefly,\nit was a big, happy, smoky room.Then a waiter came out and made everyone stub\nout their Marlboros. Except for Mr. Harrison. The waiter brought him a nice\nashtray and told him he could keep going. It was hard to say no to anyone who\nseemed that happy.\n\n","title":"An Appraisal: Taking Big Bites of Jim Harrison’s Voracious Life - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"An Appraisal: Taking Big Bites of Jim Harrison’s Voracious Life https://t.co/FYB3DuQ5wi","date":"Tue Mar 29 08:44:27 +0000 2016","favs":80,"id":{"$numberLong":"714734957000785920"},"retweets":32},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22JS4Wu"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014d3"},"content":"CAIRO — As photographs and video footage emerged on Monday from the ancient\nSyrian city of Palmyra, antiquities experts were relieved and horrified at\nwhat Islamic State militants had wrought in the months they had controlled the\ncity.A day after Syrian government troops retook control of the city, the most\nhopeful appraisal came from Maamoun Abdulkarim, Syria’s antiquities director,\nwho said 80 percent of the Unesco World Heritage site that encompasses the\n2,000-year-old ruins remained intact. He said that the militants appeared to\nhave deliberately slowed their assault on the ruins, fearing that they would\nstir a revolt among the local population.But archaeologists abroad expressed\nshock at the damage inside the Palmyra Museum, where Syrian state television\nshowed shattered statues and other artifacts torn from their mountings and\ndamage apparently caused by shelling.The damage to the museum was “severe,”\nsaid Michael D. Danti, a professor of archaeology at Boston University. “The\nrelease of video and photography of some of the galleries shows substantial\ndamage to the buildings,” he wrote in an email message, adding that there was\nevidence that the Islamic State had “carried out acts of deliberate\ndestruction of sculptures.”Syrian government troops fully captured the city on\nMonday, after a three-week assault supported by Russian air power. The\nexpulsion of the Islamic State, whose tenure in Palmyra was marked by public\nbeheadings and the attacks on its heritage, prompted a sense of collective\nrelief rare during Syria’s five-year-plus war.In an episode that came to\ndefine the militant’s occupation of the city — and their violent disdain for\nits residents and Palmyra’s cultural legacy — the militants publicly executed\nKhalid al-Asaad, who had worked for decades as the city’s head of antiquities,\npossibly because he refused to reveal the locations of ancient artifacts.The\nyears of combat between the government and its opponents have killed more than\n200,000 people and displaced more than half of Syria’s population. Amid the\ncarnage, many Syrians have continued working, often in vain, to protect the\ncountry’s historical sites from heavy weapons and other threats, including\nlooters.The worries for the ancient treasures in Palmyra, an oasis city in\nSyria’s central desert, began even before the Islamic State captured the city\nin May. The Temple of Baal, one of the ancient city’s best preserved sites,\nhad been damaged by mortar fire, and grave robbers had stolen artifacts from\ntombs.Within months of taking control of the city, Islamic State militants had\ndestroyed the temple’s primary building and other structures, as well as the\nnearby Temple of Baalshamin. In October, they destroyed triumphal arches\ndating to the second century, built by the Romans to celebrate victory over\nthe Persians.But in contrast to the gleeful videos the militants have released\ndetailing their destruction of ancient artifacts in other places, they had\nmade little attempt to publicize their actions in Palmyra. Mr. Abdulkarim said\nthat in October, after the militants destroyed the triumphal arches, the\nIslamic State had begun to regard its campaign as potentially dangerous\nprovocation to locals, for whom the ancient city was not just a treasure, but\nalso a central pillar of the local economy.Mr. Abdulkarim, who works in\nDamascus, said he had pushed residents to warn the Islamic State to stop the\ndestruction, delivering the message through employees of his ministry still\nworking in Palmyra, as well as the family of Mr. Assad, the murdered\nantiquities head.“I think Daesh understood very strongly that if they\ncontinued to destroy buildings, they would be attacked by the local\ncommunity,” he said, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State.Mr.\nAbdulkarim said that the damage to Palmyra’s medieval citadel, including to a\nbridge and a wall, could be repaired within two years. Blocks from the\ntriumphal arc were in good condition, and it could also be rebuilt, he said.\nThe restoration of the two temples, along with funerary towers that had been\ndestroyed, would take years, and would require support from Unesco, he\nsaid.Professor Danti, who is also a director of an initiative focused on\ndocumenting and protecting the cultural heritage of Northern Iraq and Syria,\nsaid that while the damage had been expected, it was “both severe and\nextensive with some monuments in better condition and some worse than\nexpected.”The sculptures in the museum had suffered, “but most if not all can\nbe reconstructed,” he said. “We can say the same for Palmyra’s major\nmonuments, but debates over authenticity, priorities, and motivation will not\nbe far behind,” he said.\n\n","title":"Scenes From Palmyra Indicate ISIS Slowed Assault on Treasures - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesworld: Antiquities experts are relieved, and horrified, at what ISIS did to monuments in Palmyra. https://t.co/FSPqbn71me https:…","date":"Tue Mar 29 07:58:04 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714723284248604673"},"retweets":214},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PC7DTa"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014d4"},"content":"CAIRO — The intricate mural took shape over the past few weeks, little noticed\nat first, spreading across a harried quarter of Cairo where Egypt’s garbage\ncollectors live, amid overflowing bundles of this overcrowded city’s trash.By\nthe time the painting was finished two weeks ago, it stretched across more\nthan 50 buildings, making it the largest public work of art here anyone can\nrecall. The mural, a circle of orange, white and blue in Arabic calligraphy,\nquotes a third-century Coptic Christian bishop who said, “If one wants to see\nthe light of the sun, he must wipe his eyes.”When the first photographs of the\nmural circulated, reactions ranged from astonished delight to disbelief. Some\npeople, struck by its seemingly impossible scale, seemed convinced that the\nimages had been digitally altered, according to the man behind the project, a\nTunisian-French artist known as eL Seed.But what seemed most surprising was\nthat eL Seed and several friends who worked with him had been able to complete\nthe project at all, without being harassed or arrested.Egypt’s highhanded\ngovernment has shown little tolerance for artists, sending agents to raid\ncultural centers and recently prosecuting a novelist on charges that he had\nharmed public morality. Street artists who made the city their canvas in the\nheady days after Egypt’s uprising in 2011 have lately been forced to work\nhastily or in secret, carrying out projects “as you would a heist,” said\nSoraya Morayef, who has documented street art over the past five years on her\nblog.But eL Seed chose a forsaken corner of the city, called Manshiyat Naser,\naway from the gaze of officials, the kind of place where artists have had more\nspace to work, Ms. Morayef said.The artist said he intended to change popular\nperceptions of the district, too narrowly associated with squalor, and to\ncelebrate decades of unsung work by its residents who sort and recycle tons of\nthe city’s waste. He has painted large works of distinctive calligraphy in\nother countries over the past few years, including in Brazil, France and\nTunisia, but he said the experience in Egypt, and the reaction, were\n“overwhelming.”He chalked up the success of the project, which was entirely\nself-funded, to his decision to work quietly, with the cooperation of\nresidents, but also to a visitor’s naïveté.That meant ignoring the arguments\nthat seem to attend many public expressions in a testy Egypt these days.\n“Sometimes when you come from outside, you don’t see all the problems that\nmight happen,” he said in an interview. “I was trying not to look at the\npolitical situation, the economic struggles, and just focus on the art\nproject.”The praise came from the neighborhood, young anti-government\nactivists and other artists. A well-known Egyptian graffiti artist, Ammar Abo\nBakr, writing on Facebook, called the mural “the first of its kind” in\nEgypt.“Just imagine that our artists who sell their art for thousands of\npounds decide to contribute and suggested some solutions to beautify or enrich\nEgypt’s facades,” he wrote.More than 5,000 people shared a post of eL Seed’s\nmission statement on Facebook, and there were hundreds of mostly positive\ncomments that suggested that he had accomplished his goals. “Beautiful and\nhonest words,” one woman in Egypt wrote. The garbage collectors, she added,\n“deserve our gratitude.”Officials seemed taken by surprise. The Egyptian\nEmbassy in Washington promoted the project on its Twitter feed, and said it\nwas “totally amazed.”As eL Seed planned the mural over the past year, he was\naided by a local priest, the Rev. Samaan Ibrahim, who is considered a leader\nof the mainly Coptic garbage collectors in the neighborhood. The priest’s\napproval and participation in the project in turn brought residents on board,\neL Seed said.The neighborhood was established more than four decades ago, with\nits striking location in the shadow of cliffs and fetid streets making it the\nmost recognizable of several settlements where the city’s garbage collectors\nlive.The neighborhood has also received frequent attention over the years from\ninternational aid organizations and journalists, making it one of the most\nprosperous settlements, said Gaétan du Roy, a Belgian researcher who studies\nthe religious lives of the collectors.But many of its residents are\nimpoverished and continue to be regarded as second-class citizens because of\ntheir association with the trash, he said.Their relations with the government\nhave also been strained. Officials have tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to\nreplace the garbage collectors and their extensive family networks with more\nmodernized private companies. In one of the most enduring shocks to the area,\nPresident Hosni Mubarak’s government, reacting to fears of a swine influenza\nepidemic in 2009, decided to kill all of Egypt’s pigs, including thousands\nkept by the garbage collectors, who used them to consume organic waste and who\nwould also sell their meat.From the streets of the neighborhood, the painting\nappears in fragments: above a courtyard where members of one family carefully\nsearch for recycling in bags of trash, or looming over a rooftop occupied by a\nhandful of sheep. The bracing scale of the mural is fully visible only from\nthe Mokattam Hill on the edge of the district, near a famous cathedral carved\ninside a cave.Viewed from there, the colors interrupt the monotonous red brick\nfacades below, distinguishing these buildings from the thousands that have\nsprung up across the city over decades, with little oversight, to contain\nCairo’s bursting population.In the days after the mural was completed, the\nresidents of Manshiyat Naser seemed not to focus too closely on its message:\nMany people had yet to trek up the hill for a viewing, and few had any idea\nwhat the calligraphy said.Instead, people seemed moved that eL Seed and his\nfriends had bothered to travel to Cairo and immersed themselves in the\nneighborhood defying the various calamities that have driven away many\nvisitors to Egypt in the past few years. The only complaint was that the\nartists had not painted more of the houses.“They used to play with the kids\nhere, and talk to the people,” said Boutros Ghali, a 24-year-old shopkeeper\nwho placed a photograph of himself with one of the visitors, a young Algerian,\non the wall of his store. “People loved them, and got used to them. And when\nthey left, people were upset.”\n\n","title":"Sprawling Mural Pays Homage to Cairo’s Garbage Collectors - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesworld: This eL Seed mural sprawls over 50 buildings in Cairo to quote a 3rd-century bishop @kfahim https://t.co/TtZBmm0np4 https…","date":"Tue Mar 29 07:35:02 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714717487904989185"},"retweets":161},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1MwORlE"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014d5"},"content":"For Brett Fox, just getting around an airport could be difficult enough. From\ncheck-in to security lines to finding a meal that he actually wants, it added\nstress to the journey.But then he discovered the turn-by-turn direction\nfeature on American Airlines’s app when he and his family arrived at Miami\nInternational Airport from a Bahamas vacation last fall.With it, he could find\nLa Carreta — a Cuban restaurant at the airport where he had dined years before\nbut whose name he could not remember — on the airport’s map.“My wife and I had\nthree kids who were hungry,” said Mr. Fox, a sales manager based in St. Louis\nfor a legal research company. He did a search for Cuban restaurants at the\nairport, found La Carreta, and the app “showed us exactly where it was and the\nbest way to get there.”The capability on American’s app — known as\n“wayfinding” — is part of a growing trend among airlines and airports to use\nsmartphones along with other technologies to make the airport experience\nsmoother and less stressful.American’s app uses Wi-Fi to give travelers\ncustomized information and directions on its airport maps. Other apps use\nsensors called beacons that also can help figure out the shortest security or\ncustoms and immigration lines.In addition to the Miami airport, the American\nAirlines app offers turn-by-turn directions on maps of Chicago O’Hare\nInternational Airport and the San Jose and Phoenix airports. Soon directions\nwill be available for, among others, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport,\nLa Guardia Airport in New York City, Los Angeles International Airport and\nHeathrow Airport in London.Many other airlines and airports, like Amsterdam\nAirport Schiphol, home of KLM, are introducing the technology.Albert van Veen,\nchief information officer of the Amsterdam airport, said its app could help\nreduce passengers’ stress and create a seamless journey “without the hassle of\nchecking paper documents all the time.” He said, “Information and wayfinding\non a personal level are crucial elements in attaining these goals.”Mr. van\nVeen said Schiphol’s research found that 50 percent of travelers cannot find\nwhat they want at airports.“Our goal is to be the world’s best airport,” he\nsaid. “Therefore, we have to offer an amazing airport experience.”Many of the\nnew systems require travelers to download an app from an airline or the\nairport. While some, like American’s, use Wi-Fi to provide information to\ntravelers, others — particularly those developed by SITA, a communications and\ninformation technology company owned and operated by major airlines — use\nbeacons. Beacons are transmitters that use Bluetooth technology to communicate\nwith travelers.SITA has deployed beacons at airports in Miami and Nice,\nFrance.In a survey last year, SITA found that 30 percent of airports around\nthe world “are planning major investments with sensor technology over the next\nthree years, with a further 51 percent evaluating the technology.”Some United\nStates airports use technology to provide other types of information.Terminal\n2 at San Francisco International Airport, for example, is testing a system\ninvolving beacons and an app that helps visually impaired travelers, with the\nuse of audio instructions, find their way to gates, restaurants and power\noutlets.And airports in Austin, Tex., and Cincinnati use beacons to assess\nwait times at security checkpoints and display the information on terminal\nmonitors. Terminal 4 at Kennedy International Airport in New York displays\nprocessing times on monitors for security, customs and immigration, and its\ntaxi line located in the terminal, near the first-floor street entrance. Last\nweek, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport began a six-week trial\ncompilation of security wait-time data through SITA’s beacons.Besides allaying\ntravelers’ concerns about getting through security, wait-time data can also\nalert security officials about processing bottlenecks.Airlines other than\nAmerican offering apps include United, which is testing an “indoor location”\napp feature at Terminal C at Newark Liberty International Airport.In Europe,\neasyJet’s Mobile Host app, developed with Gatwick Airport, outside London,\nassists travelers as soon as they approach the airport, telling them where\nthey can check bags and providing directions to their gate.One app feature\nthat potentially could irritate travelers is the capability of bombarding them\nwith unsolicited commercial offers. Also, privacy advocates are concerned\nabout the data that marketers could potentially collect about travelers\nthrough such apps.A spokeswoman for American Airlines said the carrier’s\nmobile app does not track or share user data.Melanie Hinton, a spokeswoman for\nAirlines for America, an industry trade group, said: “We have not tracked who\nis utilizing beacons. However, we do know that a number of airlines are\nconsidering harnessing the new technology of beacons to communicate with\npassengers.“Beacons can use passengers’ locations to provide instructions,\nflight and gate information, proximity to gates and other important messaging\nto ease their travel experience. The beacons are shared between airlines and\nairports to analyze customer behavior.”Antoine Rostworowski, director of\nairport customer experience and technology for Airports Council International-\nWorld, a trade group, said that the group did not recommend sharing any\npersonal information with airport security officials. He added that his\norganization urged members to adopt an opt-in policy for sending commercial\ninformation to travelers.A spokesman for Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta — which\nbegins concessions marketing in the fall — said travelers would receive the\ninformation only if they requested it.Then there is the issue of how many\ntravelers will find the apps useful.“Will consumers download an app they use\nfrom a business they only use intermittently, or of a hub they transit\nregularly?” said Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst with Atmosphere Research.\n“The challenge is who will be the gateway to the customer’s phone, the\nairport, airline or another business entity?”Travelers, he added, “are still\ntrying to figure out what the real value is, if the services offered are\ncompelling enough to download one more app to their phone.”Mr. Fox, for one,\nis sold on American’s offering: “You have to know so many things today to be a\nfrequent flier. What they’re trying to do at American is to take that\nknowledge so any traveler can have inside tips and be confident he can get to\nwhere he wants to go.”\n\n","title":"Using Apps to Ease the Headache of Navigating Airports - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesbusiness: “You have to know so many things today to be a frequent flier.” https://t.co/zWzBKF7W4N https://t.co/VVyREviSt4","date":"Tue Mar 29 07:15:32 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714712582138028033"},"retweets":43},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21Po45Q"}

His\nexplosives turned out to be fake, and he surrendered with all passengers\nreleased unharmed after a bizarre six-hour standoff.As more became known about\nthe motive of the 59-year-old Egyptian who was taken into custody, authorities\ncharacterized the commandeering of the EgyptAir jetliner not as an act of\nterrorism but more like a \"family feud\" with his former wife.The aviation\ndrama ended peacefully on the tarmac of Larnaca airport on the island nation's\nsouthern coast with the surrender of a man identified by Cypriot and Egyptian\nauthorities as Seif Eddin Mustafa.The incident was likely to renew concerns\nabout Egyptian airport security months after a Russian passenger plane was\nblown out of the sky over the Sinai Peninsula in a bombing claimed by the\nIslamic State group.But Egyptian officials stressed that their security\nmeasures were not to blame, and there was praise for the EgyptAir flight crew.\nPilot Amr Gamal told The Associated Press: \"We rescued all the people and the\nman got arrested.\"EgyptAir Flight 181 took off from the Mediterranean coastal\ncity of Alexandria for a 30-minute hop to Cairo with at least 72 people\naboard, Cyprus police said, including about two dozen foreigners.At some\npoint, the hijacker claimed to have explosives in his belt and forced the\npilot to fly the Airbus 320 to Cyprus, Egyptian authorities said.Egyptian\npassenger Farah el-Dabani told the Dubai-based Al-Arabiyah TV network that the\nhijacker was seated in the back of the aircraft and that it was the crew who\ntold passengers that the plane was being hijacked.\"There was panic at the\nbeginning, but the crew told us to be quiet. They did a good job to keep us\nall quiet so the hijacker does not do anything rash,\" she said in a telephone\ninterview.After the jet landed in Larnaca about 9 a.m., the hijacker asked to\nspeak to his Cypriot ex-wife, who was brought to the airport, and he sent out\na letter from the aircraft to give to her, said Cypriot Foreign Minister\nIoannis Kasoulides.The foreigners on board included eight Americans, four\nBritons, four Dutch, two Belgians, a French national, an Italian, two Greeks\nand one Syrian, the Egyptian Civil Aviation Ministry said. The nationalities\nof three other foreigners could not be determined immediately.Most of the\npassengers were freed, and they calmly walked down a set of stairs from the\nplane, carrying their hand luggage and boarding a bus. But he kept on board\nseven people: four members of the flight crew and three passengers.Mustafa\nlater asked to speak to European Union representatives, and among his demands\nwere the release of female inmates held in Egyptian prisons.\"It was one demand\nhe made, then dropped it and made another,\" Kasoulides said. \"His demands made\nno sense or were too incoherent to be taken seriously.\"From the start, \"it was\nclear that this wasn't an act of terrorism,\" he added.\"Despite the fact that\nthe individual appeared to be dangerous in terms of his behavior, we\nunderstood that this was a psychologically unstable person,\" he said.Hussein\nAbdelkarim Tantaway Mubarak, Egypt's ambassador to Cyprus, said the whole\naffair \"looks like it was a family feud.\"\"As far as I know, I think he has a\nfamily problem, probably with members of his family, probably his ex-wife or\nsomething,\" Mubarak added.A Cypriot police official who spoke on condition of\nanonymity because he was not authorized to give out details of the\ninvestigation said the hijacker and his wife were divorced in 1994, and the\ncouple had four children.The hijacker eventually realized there was \"no\nchance\" any of his demands would be met, Kasoulides said, and he left the\nplane, where he was immediately arrested by anti-terrorism police. The belt of\nexplosives turned out to be \"telephone cases\" made to look like they were\nexplosives.Just minutes before the arrest, several people were seen also\ngetting off the aircraft, and a crew member — later identified as Ahmed el-\nQaddah — climbed out of the cockpit window and slid down the side of the plane\nin accordance with his training for such emergencies.Cyprus President Nicos\nAnastasiades said the hijacking was \"not something that has to do with\nterrorism.\"Anastasiades, appearing alongside European Parliament President\nMartin Schulz in Nicosia, was asked by reporters whether he could confirm that\nthe incident was about a woman. \"Always, there is a woman,\" he replied,\ndrawing laughter.But the mood aboard the hijacked aircraft was anything but\nlight-hearted.A veiled female passenger told Egyptian TV upon arrival back in\nCairo: \"We were terrified but cooperating.\"The woman, who was not identified,\nsaid she thought the explosives had been real.\"I felt like the man can just\npress the button, and we will be gone,\" she said.A middle-aged male passenger\nwho also didn't identify himself told the broadcaster, \"The situation was very\nhard, more than anyone can imagine.\" He also praised the flight crew, saying\nthey \"were like a psychiatrists to the hijacker.\"The flight crew and\npassengers who returned to Cairo on Tuesday night broke into tears while\nhugging and kissing their waiting families.Mustafa is to appear in court\nWednesday, where authorities will ask that he be held on a number of\nunspecified charges, said police spokesman Andreas Angelides.Mubarak said\n\"it's amazing\" how the hijacker managed to convince passengers and crew that\nhe had a belt of explosives strapped to him when he actually had no\nweapons.Police in Cairo questioned Mustafa's relatives, said Sharif Faisal,\nthe police chief for the industrial suburb of Helwan.Islam Magdy, a taxi\ndriver who lives in the same five-story house as Mustafa's sister, described\nhim as \"a mysterious person,\" with police inquiring about him.Egypt's Interior\nMinistry released surveillance video that it said showed Mustafa being\nthoroughly searched at the Alexandria airport. It said his hand luggage held\nitems that he later used to \"give the impression that he is wearing an\nexplosive belt.\"Aviation expert Philip Baum said the EgyptAir crew \"seems to\nhave responded to this incident in an exemplary fashion.\"\"The idea that the\nair crew should have taken steps to overpower the hijacker is, I believe,\nwrong,\" said Baum, author of \"Violence in the Skies: A History of Aircraft\nHijacking and Bombing.\"Flight attendant Nihal el-Barqouqi played a role in\nconvincing the hijacker to free the passengers once the plane landed in\nCyprus, Egyptian TV reported.\"We managed with diplomacy ... to get the\npassengers out,\" co-pilot Ahmed el-Qaddah told the broadcaster.Security at\nEgyptian airports has been under scrutiny since the Oct. 31 crash of a Russian\njetliner in the Sinai Peninsula minutes after it took off the Red Sea resort\nof Sharm el-Sheikh for St. Petersburg, Russia. All 224 people on board were\nkilled.Russia later said a bomb brought down the aircraft, and the Islamic\nState group took responsibility. Russia suspended all air links to Egypt after\nthe revelations about the bombing, dealing a major blow to the Egyptian\ntourism industry.___Michael reported from Cairo.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014d7"},"content":"A new virtual gold rush is underway.Even as Bitcoin, riven by internal\ndivisions, has struggled, a rival virtual currency — known as Ethereum — has\nsoared in value, climbing 1,000 percent over the last three months.Beyond the\nprice spike, Ethereum is also attracting attention from giants in finance and\ntechnology, like JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft and IBM, which have described it as\na sort of Bitcoin 2.0.The rise of the relatively new virtual currency has been\nhelped by a battle within the Bitcoin community over how the basic Bitcoin\nsoftware should develop.The fights have slowed down Bitcoin transactions and\nled some people to look for alternative virtual currencies to power their\nbusinesses. Enter Ethereum.Like Bitcoin, the Ethereum system is built on a\nblockchain in which every transaction is recorded publicly. The promise of\nsuch a system is that it allows the exchange of money and assets more quickly\nand more cheaply than relying on a long chain of middlemen.But Ethereum has\nalso won fans with its promise to do much more than Bitcoin. In addition to\nthe virtual currency, the software provides a way to create online markets and\nprogrammable transactions known as smart contracts.The system is complicated\nenough that even people who know it well have trouble describing it in plain\nEnglish. But one application in development would let farmers put their\nproduce up for sale directly to consumers and take payment directly from\nconsumers. There are already dozens of functioning applications built on\nEthereum, enabling new ways to manage and pay for electricity, sports bets and\neven Ponzi schemes.All of this work is still very early. The first full public\nversion of the Ethereum software was recently released, and the system could\nface some of the same technical and legal problems that have tarnished\nBitcoin.Many Bitcoin advocates say Ethereum will face more security problems\nthan Bitcoin because of the greater complexity of the software. Thus far,\nEthereum has faced much less testing, and many fewer attacks, than Bitcoin.\nThe novel design of Ethereum may also invite intense scrutiny by authorities\ngiven that potentially fraudulent contracts, like the Ponzi schemes, can be\nwritten directly into the Ethereum system.But the sophisticated capabilities\nof the system have made it fascinating to some executives in corporate\nAmerica. IBM said last year that it was experimenting with Ethereum as a way\nto control real world objects in the so-called Internet of things.Microsoft\nhas been working on several projects that make it easier to use Ethereum on\nits computing cloud, Azure.“Ethereum is a general platform where you can solve\nproblems in many industries using a fairly elegant solution — the most elegant\nsolution we have seen to date,” said Marley Gray, a director of business\ndevelopment and strategy at Microsoft.Mr. Gray is responsible for Microsoft’s\nwork with blockchains, the database concept that Bitcoin introduced.\nBlockchains are designed to store transactions and data without requiring any\ncentral authority or repository.Blockchain ledgers are generally maintained\nand updated by networks of computers working together — somewhat similar to\nthe way that Wikipedia is updated and maintained by all its users.Many\ncorporations, though, have created their own Ethereum networks with private\nblockchains, independent of the public system, and that could ultimately\ndetract from the value of the individual unit in the Ethereum system — known\nas an Ether — that people have recently been buying.The interest in Ethereum\nis one sign of the corporate fascination with blockchains. Most major banks\nhave expressed an interest in using them to make trading and money transfer\nfaster and more efficient. On Tuesday, executives from the largest banks will\ngather for a conference, “Blockchain: Tapping Into the Real Potential, Cutting\nThrough the Hype.”Many of these banks have recently been looking at how some\nversion of Ethereum might be put to use. JPMorgan, for instance, has created a\nspecific tool, Masala, that allows some of its internal databases to interact\nwith an Ethereum blockchain.Michael Novogratz, a former top executive at the\nprivate equity firm Fortress Investing Group, who helped lead Fortress’s\ninvestment in Bitcoin, has been looking at Ethereum since he left Fortress\nlast fall. Mr. Novogratz said that he made a “significant” purchase of Ether\nin January. He has also heard how the financial industry’s chatter about the\nvirtual currency has evolved.“A lot of the more established players were\nthinking, ‘It’s still an experiment,’ ” he said. “It feels like in the last\ntwo to three months that experiment is at least getting a lot more\nvalidation.”Since the beginning of the year, the value of an individual unit\nof Ether has soared as high as $12 from around $1. That has brought the value\nof all existing Ether to over $1 billion at times, significantly more than any\nvirtual currency other than Bitcoin, which had over $6 billion in value\noutstanding last week.Since Bitcoin was invented, there have been many so-\ncalled alt-coins that have tried to improve on Bitcoin, but none have won the\nfollowing of Ethereum.Unlike Bitcoin, which was released in 2009 by a\nmysterious creator known as Satoshi Nakamoto, Ethereum was created in a more\ntransparent fashion by a 21-year-old Russian-Canadian, Vitalik Buterin, after\nhe dropped out of Waterloo University in Ontario.The most basic aim of\nEthereum was to make it possible to program binding agreements into the\nblockchain — the smart contract concept. Two people, for instance, could\nprogram a bet on a sports game directly into the Ethereum blockchain. Once the\nfinal score came in from a mutually agreed upon source — say, The Associated\nPress — the money would be automatically transferred to the winning party.\nEther can be used as a currency in this system, but Ether are also necessary\nto pay for the network power needed to process the bet.The Ethereum system has\nsometimes been described as a single shared computer that is run by the\nnetwork of users and on which resources are parceled out and paid for by\nEther.A team of seven co-founders helped Mr. Buterin write up the software\nafter he released the initial description of the system. Mr. Buterin’s team\nraised $18 million in 2014 through a presale of Ether, which helped fund the\nEthereum Foundation, which supports the software’s development.Like Bitcoin,\nEthereum has succeeded by attracting a dedicated network of followers who have\nhelped support the software, partly in the hope that their Ether will increase\nin value if the system succeeds. Last week, there were 5,800 computers — or\nnodes — helping support the network around the world. The Bitcoin network had\nabout 7,400 nodes.One of Mr. Buterin’s co-founders, Joseph Lubin, has set up\nConsenSys, a company based in Brooklyn that has hired over 50 developers to\nbuild applications on the Ethereum system, including one that enables music\ndistribution and another that allows for a new kind of financial auditing.The\nConsenSys offices are in an old industrial building in the Bushwick section of\nBrooklyn. The office is essentially one large room, with all the messy\ntrademarks of a start-up operation, including white boards on the walls and\ncomputer parts lying around.Mr. Lubin said he had thrown himself into Ethereum\nafter starting to think that it delivered on some of the failed promise of\nBitcoin, especially when it came to allowing new kinds of online contracts and\nmarkets.“Bitcoin presented the broad strokes vision, and Ethereum presented\nthe crystallization of how to deliver that vision,” he said.Joseph Bonneau, a\ncomputer science researcher at Stanford who studies so-called crypto-\ncurrencies, said Ethereum was the first system that had really caught his\ninterest since Bitcoin.It is far from a sure thing, he cautioned.“Bitcoin is\nstill probably the safest bet, but Ethereum is certainly No. 2, and some folks\nwill say it is more likely to be around in 10 years,” Mr. Bonneau said. “It\nwill depend if any real markets develop around it. If there is some actual\napplication.”\n\n","title":"Ethereum, a Virtual Currency, Enables Transactions That Rival Bitcoin’s - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Bitcoin has struggled, but a rival virtual currency called Ethereum has climbed 1,000% over the past 3 three months https://t.co/HCwmh9ylgt","date":"Tue Mar 29 06:50:56 +0000 2016","favs":145,"id":{"$numberLong":"714706389478801409"},"retweets":162},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1ShAGxs"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014d8"},"content":"WASHINGTON — A furious legal battle over digital privacy in the age of the\niPhone ended on Monday with no clear winner — only lingering questions over\nwhat will happen the next time the government tries to force Apple to help\nbreak into one of its own phones.The Justice Department on Monday announced\nthat it had gotten what it wanted most immediately in the case of the San\nBernardino terrorist attack: a way to unlock the iPhone used by one of the\nshooters to determine what evidence it might hold, even without Apple’s\nassistance.But that development forestalls a court ruling on the bigger legal\nquestions that have been so hotly debated since the case erupted last month\nwhen a judge in California ordered Apple to unlock the phone used by Syed\nRizwan Farook.The legal debate in that state offered what many legal analysts\nsaw as a powerful test case for the Justice Department to establish its\nposition. But that verdict will now have to wait for another day.“This might\nbe a missed opportunity for the Justice Department,” said Eric Berg, a former\nfederal prosecutor who now works on electronic surveillance cases at a private\npractice in Milwaukee. “Having this whole debate muted by this solution is\nprobably a little bit disappointing for them.”Likewise, the development\nrepresented an uneven result for privacy advocates. They could claim some\nmeasure of victory because Apple was able to hold to its position without\ngiving in to the government, but an apparent flaw in Apple’s vaunted\nencryption protocols was worrisome.“Unfortunately, this news appears to be\njust a delay of an inevitable fight over whether the F.B.I. can force Apple to\nundermine the security of its own products,” said Alex Abdo, staff attorney\nfor the American Civil Liberties Union.The Justice Department did not say\nwhether it would seek to use the method discovered for accessing the San\nBernardino phone in any other cases. Law enforcement officials have said they\nhave been locked out of dozens of other phones as a result of encryption\nsafeguards, and the unlocking method — a tightly held secret at the F.B.I. —\ncould be valuable in many of those cases as well. But some law enforcement\nofficials said it was too early to say anything about their ability to access\nother phones.With the Justice Department moving on Monday to withdraw its\nmotion forcing Apple’s cooperation in the San Bernardino case, Apple is still\non the winning side in a separate but related case in federal court in\nBrooklyn.In that case, United States Magistrate Judge James Orenstein in the\neastern district of New York ruled last month in a 50-page opinion that the\nJustice Department was not entitled to force Apple’s cooperation in unlocking\na drug dealer’s iPhone. He said that prosecutors were taking too broad a\nruling of a 1789 statute known as the All Writs Act in seeking to secure\nApple’s cooperation.The Justice Department is appealing his decision.Mr. Berg,\nthe Milwaukee lawyer, said that although the San Bernardino fight might have\nended without a court decision and a clear verdict, “this case has forced a\nnational dialogue, and it really has brought this issue front and center. So\nthe public won in the sense that this issue is now being debated.”\n\n","title":"In Apple Debate on Digital Privacy and the iPhone, Questions Still Remain - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"In Apple Debate on Digital Privacy and the iPhone, Questions Still Remain https://t.co/f0f0ZzxYkZ","date":"Tue Mar 29 06:38:31 +0000 2016","favs":89,"id":{"$numberLong":"714703265091424256"},"retweets":52},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21Qxxtt"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014d9"},"content":"SHANGHAI — The new $1.3 billion Cadillac factory on the outskirts of Shanghai\nis a shrine to modern manufacturing, the kind of facility that automakers all\nover the world dream of building but can seldom afford.Hundreds of robots\nbend, arch and twist to assemble the body of Cadillac’s new flagship CT6.\nLasers seal the car’s lightweight aluminum exterior using techniques that the\ncarmaker, General Motors, has only just introduced in the United States.\nYardlong, bright yellow robots like mechanical Alaskan huskies tow five-foot-\ntall carts of auto parts to the assembly line.“It’s more along the lines of\naircraft technology than traditional, spot-welded steel bodies,” said Paul\nBuetow, G.M.’s head of manufacturing in China, as he strode along the assembly\nline.The factory is part of an aggressive expansion by automakers in China,\nthe world’s largest market for new cars and the industry’s brightest hope for\nthe last 15 years. But the country’s economy is now cooling, which could leave\ncarmakers with too many factories and not enough buyers.G.M. will open a\nsecond, $1 billion factory in Wuhan next year. G.M.’s main rival in the\nChinese market, Volkswagen, plans to open large assembly plants next year\nalongside its existing factories in the cities of Foshan, Ningbo and Yizheng\nand build one in Qingdao by 2018. Hyundai plans to complete a factory south of\nBeijing by October and another in Chongqing next year, while Chinese\nautomakers like Great Wall and Changan are aggressively adding capacity.The\nresearch firm Sanford Bernstein estimates that auto manufacturing capacity in\nChina will rise 22 percent over the next two years, bringing it to 28.8\nmillion cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles annually. That is almost\nequal to the American and European markets combined, and greater than even the\nmost optimistic forecasts: that sales in China will reach about 25 million\nnext year.Automakers are expanding at a time when China’s economic growth has\nslowed to its lowest level in more than a quarter-century. China is closing\ncoal mines across the country and plans to shutter steel mills. Exports are\nfalling. Many Chinese cities are dotted with empty apartment buildings.\nWorried about pollution and traffic jams, China’s wealthiest metropolises have\nbegun limiting the number of new cars that may be registered.On the surface,\nauto sales in China seem strong. More Chinese families can afford cars and are\nflocking to showrooms. Sales of cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles\njumped 8 percent last year from 2014.The buyers are not just China’s college-\neducated, white-collar elite, but also the beneficiaries of the country’s\nroughly eightfold growth in blue-collar wages in the last dozen years. Zhou\nGenkou, a burly truck driver, recently waited in a Volkswagen dealership to\npay $12,300 for a new white Santana sedan. He explained that he could not\ntolerate life without a car.“It’s so that we don’t have to walk,” he said.But\nthere are signs that China’s yearslong auto boom is easing.After car sales\nfell three months in a row, the Chinese government decided last September to\nhalve the sales tax on cars with engines of 1.6 liters or less, to 5 percent\nthrough the end of 2016. The main beneficiaries have been domestic Chinese\nautomakers, mostly affiliated with municipal or provincial governments, that\nchurn out cheap subcompacts with small engines.A similar tax reduction\nproduced strong sales in 2009 and 2010. But it mainly encouraged consumers to\nbuy sooner. When the tax cut expired, sales essentially leveled off for the\nnext two years.With the current tax reduction scheduled to end, “2017 will be\na very difficult year for the auto industry, probably no growth,” said Yale\nZhang, the managing director of Automotive Foresight, a Shanghai consulting\nfirm.Multinationals are focusing more on higher-profit segments that are\ngrowing without help from such incentives. But they are also finishing up a\nfactory-building spree that started three years ago, when the economy was\nhealthier.“We see China moving to a pace of what I would call moderate\ngrowth,” said Matthew Tsien, the G.M. executive vice president who oversees\nthe company’s China business.Volkswagen forecasts that China’s auto market\nwill grow slightly faster than the overall economy this year and slightly\nslower than the overall economy for the rest of the decade. G.M. is\nforecasting that the market will grow a little less than 5 percent a year\nthrough the end of the decade, the equivalent of adding the entire auto market\nof Japan, or five Australias.Both automakers are planning to meet much of that\ngrowth with factories they have already commissioned or will soon finish. But\nif the economy weakens significantly, the industry could get stuck with a\nlarge amount of excess capacity.“Are manufacturers going to keep the rose-\ncolored glasses or get real? Most of the multinationals are going to get real\nand slow down the new capacity,” said Bill Russo, former chief executive of\nChrysler China and now a consultant. “I’m not sure about the local\nmanufacturers. They have a ‘Field of Dreams’ and ‘build it and they will come’\nmentality.”Chinese auto industry leaders shrug off such concerns. “They see\nthe small-car market as having a lot of potential,” said Cui Dongshu, the\nsecretary general of the China Passenger Car Association.The Chinese economy\nneeds continued strength in the auto market. The government wants to shift to\na new, more sustainable model for growth based on consumer spending.Since\n2009, China has depended heavily on a loan-fed surge in construction of ever\nmore highways, rail lines, factories and other investments. But that has\nproduced a mountain of debt, particularly at state-owned enterprises.Strong\nauto sales helped China attain a little-noticed milestone in recent months.\nOverall retail sales of consumer goods in China surpassed such sales in the\nUnited States, according to official data.If sales do slow sharply, the\nquestion is whether multinationals and domestic automakers will try to start\nexporting more from their Chinese factories. The facilities are among the most\nadvanced in the world, not least because they are also the newest.G.M. and\nother automakers could in theory try to export more cars to the United States,\nwhich is also a relatively healthy market. One potential obstacle, however, is\nthat China’s surplus capacity is mainly in subcompact cars, for which\nAmericans have little appetite.G.M. is already preparing to start shipping a\nnew car-based sport utility vehicle, the Buick Envision, from China to the\nUnited States, from a factory in northeastern China. The arrival of the\nEnvision, which is being built only in China, Buick’s biggest market by far,\nwill be the mass market debut of Chinese-built cars in Big Three showrooms in\nthe United States.The preferences of Chinese consumers tend to be different\nfrom those of American buyers. Chinese customers, for example, are highly\nprone to complain if fabrics and other materials in a car’s interior do not\nsmell quite right, according to surveys by J. D. Power \u0026amp; Associates. Many\nin the auto industry have said they will be watching how American buyers\nrespond to Chinese-built Envisions.“So will we,” said Mr. Buetow of G.M.\n\n","title":"Automakers Expanding in China May Soon Face Weakening Demand - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesbusiness: Looming glut?

Eighty-one people, including\n21 foreigners and 15 crew, were on board the Airbus 320, Egypt's Civil\nAviation Ministry said in a statement.Conflicting theories emerged about the\nmotives of the hijacker, an Egyptian. A senior Cypriot official said he seemed\nunstable and the incident did not appear related to terrorism. The Cypriot\nstate broadcaster said he had demanded the release of women prisoners in\nEgypt.In the midst of the hijack, witnesses said he threw a letter on the\napron at Cyprus's Larnaca airport, written in Arabic, and asked that it be\ndelivered to his Cypriot ex-wife.After the aircraft landed at Larnaca,\nnegotiations began and everyone on board was freed except three passengers and\nfour crew, Egypt's Civil Aviation Minister Sherif Fethy said.Soon afterwards,\nCypriot television footage showed several people leaving the plane via the\nstairs and another man climbing out of the cockpit window and running off.The\nhijacker then surrendered to authorities.Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis\nKasoulides said the hijacker had threatened to blow himself up and demanded\nthat the aircraft be refueled and head to Istanbul.\"It looks like he realized\nhis demands would not be met, allowing the last two hostages, Britons, to flee\nthe aircraft. He also tried to leave, running out. He was arrested,\" said\nKasoulides.\"The explosives on him were examined. They weren’t explosives, but\nmobile phone covers.\"Egyptian Prime Minister Sherif Ismail said the hijacker\nwould be questioned to ascertain his motives. \"At some moments he asked to\nmeet with a representative of the European Union and at other points he asked\nto go to another airport but there was nothing specific,\" he said.\"ABNORMAL\"\nHIJACKEREgypt's Civil Aviation Ministry said the pilot, Omar al-Gammal, had\ntold authorities that he was threatened by a passenger who claimed to be\nwearing an explosive belt and forced him to divert the plane to\nLarnaca.Reached by telephone, Gammal told Reuters that the hijacker seemed\n\"abnormal\". Sounding exhausted, he said he had been obliged to treat the man\nas a serious security threat.Photographs on Egyptian state television showed a\nmiddle-aged man on a plane wearing glasses and displaying a white belt with\nbulging pockets and protruding wires.Television channels showed video footage\nof the hijacker, identified as Seif Eldin Mustafa, 59, being searched by\nsecurity men at a metal detector at Borg al-Arab airport in\nAlexandria.Interior Ministry officials said he was expelled from law school\nand had a long criminal record, including robberies.Fethy, the Egyptian\nminister, said authorities suspected the suicide belt was not genuine but\ntreated the incident as serious to ensure the safety of all those on board.\"We\ncannot say this was a terrorist act... he was not a professional,\" Fethy told\nreporters after the incident.EgyptAir delayed a New York-bound flight from\nCairo onto which some passengers of the hijacked plane had been due to\nconnect. Fethy said it was delayed partly due to a technical issue but partly\nas a precaution.The hijacked plane remained on the tarmac at Larnaca\nthroughout the morning while Cypriot security forces took up positions around\nthe scene.EGYPT'S IMAGEThe incident will deal another blow to Egypt's tourism\nindustry and hurt efforts to revive an economy hammered by political unrest\nfollowing the 2011 uprising that ousted veteran ruler Hosni Mubarak.The\nsector, a main source of hard currency for the import-dependent county, was\nalready reeling from the crash of a Russian passenger plane in the Sinai\npeninsula in late October.President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has said the Russian\nplane was brought down by a terrorist attack. Islamic State has said it\nplanted a bomb on board, killing all 224 people on board.The latest incident\nraised renewed questions over airport security, though it was not clear\nwhether the hijacker was even armed. Ismail said stringent measures were in\nplace.Passengers on the plane included eight Americans, four Britons, four\nDutch, two Belgians, an Italian, a Syrian and a French national, the Civil\nAviation Ministry said.Cyprus has seen little militant activity for decades,\ndespite its proximity to the Middle East.A botched attempt by Egyptian\ncommandos to storm a hijacked airliner at Larnaca airport led to the\ndisruption of diplomatic relations between Cyprus and Egypt in 1978.In 1988, a\nKuwaiti airliner which had been hijacked from Bangkok to Kuwait in a 16-day\nsiege had a stopover in Larnaca, where two hostages were killed.(Additionaly\nreporting by Michele Kambas in Athens and Mostafa Hashem, Ahmed Mohammed\nHassan, Amina Ismail and Lin Noueihed in Cairo, Writing by Lin Noueihed,\nEditing by Michael Georgy and Mark Trevelyan)\n\n","title":"EgyptAir Hijack Ends With Passengers Freed - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Egyptair Passenger Plane Hijacked, Forced to Cyprus https://t.co/QtMngTtWnK","date":"Tue Mar 29 06:33:56 +0000 2016","favs":99,"id":{"$numberLong":"714702112979075072"},"retweets":237},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21QxiPb"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014db"},"content":"BRUSSELS — A noisy citizen journalist who reveled in verbal and physical\nfights in public spaces, Fayçal Cheffou never quite fit the profile of a\nfurtive underground operative for the Islamic State. Yet that was the role\nassigned to him when the Belgian authorities announced that he had been\ncharged with terrorism and the Belgian news media identified him as the “third\nbomber” at Brussels Airport in last Tuesday’s attacks.Mr. Cheffou’s arrest\nlast week, curiously easy as he was picked up right outside the federal\nprosecutor’s office, signaled a big break for a Belgian security apparatus\nassailed by complaints that it had missed vital clues before the terrorist\nassault at the airport and a subway station.Now it looks as if the police got\nthe wrong man, or at least lacked enough evidence to hold him. Mr. Cheffou was\nreleased on Monday.Vilified as “an extremist jihadi horror” early on Monday by\na senior Belgian official, Mr. Cheffou was freed just a few hours later with\nthe authorities acknowledging that the evidence against a man they had charged\nwith terrorism and murder was not as strong as they had thought. This\nsuggested that Mr. Cheffou had been mistakenly identified by a witness as the\nbomber in a dark hat and white coat in an airport surveillance photo.On\nMonday, the Belgian police again asked for help identifying that bomber,\nreleasing for the first time surveillance video showing him and the two other\nattackers slowly pushing luggage carts through the airport with large black\nbags on them.To add to the confusion, Eric Van der Sijpt, a spokesman for the\nprosecutor’s office, said Monday that the charges against Mr. Cheffou remained\nfor the moment.“We’re not saying that he’s innocent. That we do not do,” Mr.\nVan der Sijpt said in telephone interview. “It’s that he’s no longer needed in\nprison. But there are two different things. Preventative custody has nothing\nto do with the actual investigations or the charges brought.”He added that the\nprosecutor would decide at the end of the investigation whether to prosecute\nMr. Cheffou and that only then would the status of the charges against him be\ndecided.In a separate statement, the prosecutor’s office said Monday that\nthree men detained in and around Brussels on Sunday had been charged with\nparticipating in the activities of a terrorist group. It was not clear if they\nwere connected to the attacks last Tuesday.The disarray over Mr. Cheffou\nfollowed a catalog of mishaps and errors that last week prompted Belgium’s\nministers of justice and the interior to offer their resignations — they were\nasked to stay on — and led to angry questioning of the government during a\nparliamentary hearing on Belgium’s response to terrorism.Reflecting public\noutrage over mounting evidence that the authorities had ignored or\nmisinterpreted signals that might have prevented the attacks, Le Soir, a\nleading French-language Belgian newspaper, last week splashed a damning\nindictment of the security apparatus across its front page: “Serious\nmistakes.” La Capitale, another newspaper, was blunter still: “Chaos,” its\nfront page screamed.Since then, dismay has only increased, with rival French-\nand Dutch-speaking politicians trading accusations on Monday over who was\nresponsible for allowing several hundred hooligans to storm a makeshift shrine\nto the victims of the terrorist attacks in front of the old Brussels stock\nexchange on Sunday. The French speakers denounced the hooligans, who had\nassembled on Saturday in the town of Vilvoorde, north of Brussels, as Dutch-\nspeaking fascists.Then, just as the hooligan furor was reaching its peak, the\nfederal prosecutor’s office announced that Mr. Cheffou, named only as Fayçal\nC. in official statements, had been released. And with that the best hope so\nfar of piecing together the terrorist plot and perhaps identifying other plots\nin the works had suddenly evaporated. The three other people so far identified\nas directly involved in last week’s attacks — two brothers, Ibrahim and Khalid\nel-Bakraoui, and the suspected bomb-maker, Najim Laachraoui — are all\ndead.“The evidence that had led to the arrest of the man named Fayçal C. was\nnot substantiated by the evolution of the ongoing investigation,” Thierry\nWerts, another spokesman for the federal prosecutor, said in a statement.\n“Consequently, he has been freed by the investigative judge.”Belgians writing\non Twitter in Dutch expressed outrage over the latest turn of events. “We got\nhim but it was the wrong guy #painful,” said one. Another fumed: “Cheffou the\nnew hero of the Left on Twitter. I’m going to be sick.” Others, mostly writing\nin French, pilloried the authorities for having arrested Mr. Cheffou in the\nfirst place.Mr. Cheffou had been picked out of a photographic lineup by a\ncabdriver who shuttled three men to Brussels Airport, where two of them —\nIbrahim el-Bakraoui and Mr. Laachraoui — blew themselves up at 7:58 a.m. last\nTuesday. Mr. Bakraoui’s younger brother, Khalid, blew himself up at 9:11 a.m.\nat the Maelbeek subway station.The death toll from the attacks rose on Monday\nto 35, as the authorities reported that four victims who had been hospitalized\ndied from their injuries. The toll, which was reported by the Belgian health\nminister, Maggie De Block, did not include the three suicide bombers.In an\ninterview on Sunday, Yvan Mayeur, the mayor of the City of Brussels, the\ncentral borough of the 19 municipalities that make up the Belgian capital,\nsaid that the taxi driver had identified Mr. Cheffou in a police photo lineup,\nbut that the authorities were still waiting for DNA confirmation that he was\nthe bomber.Mr. Mayeur added that he did not know whether Mr. Cheffou had been\ninvolved in terrorism, but did know him to be a local troublemaker who had\nrepeatedly disrupted a camp of refugees in Parc Maximilien, near the Gare du\nNord railway station.Mr. Cheffou, he said, often harangued and got into fights\nwith volunteers from Belgian nongovernmental organizations, denouncing them\nfor not being Muslims and urging migrants in their care to rebel.“He tried to\nget the refugees to turn against NGOs because they were ‘nonbelievers,’ ” Mr.\nMayeur recalled.In September, after prosecutors declined to intervene, the\nmayor issued a municipal order barring Mr. Cheffou from the migrant\nencampment, which was later shut down.His written order accused Mr. Cheffou of\nwreaking havoc at the camp, alleging that four of his underlings had tried in\nSeptember to force a 17-year-old female migrant to spend the night with “the\nchief.” She escaped with help from volunteers. It also said he had denounced\nBelgian workers at the camp as being infidels, collaborators with the state\nand, in one case, in the pay of Israel.\n\n","title":"Man Arrested as ‘Third Bomber’ in Brussels Attack Is Freed; Hunt Is Renewed - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Belgium admits it arrested wrong man in Brussels terror attack https://t.co/iCSHYchv1z","date":"Tue Mar 29 06:01:02 +0000 2016","favs":195,"id":{"$numberLong":"714693833351684098"},"retweets":256},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1RMcTvc"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014dc"},"content":"ON Aug. 31, 1772, a hurricane devastated the island of St. Croix, the home of\nthe teenage Alexander Hamilton. In a letter one week later, he described the\nforce of the storm and the destruction it caused as “sufficient to strike\nastonishment into angels.”His letter included this plea for help for his\ncountrymen: “O ye, who revel in affluence, see the afflictions of humanity and\nbestow your superfluity to ease them. Say not, we have suffered also, and\nthence withhold your compassion. What are your sufferings compared to those?\nYe have still more than enough left. Act wisely. Succour the miserable and lay\nup a treasure in Heaven.” So vivid was his account of the disaster that the\nletter was published in a newspaper in the Virgin Islands, The Royal Danish\nAmerican Gazette, and used to support relief efforts for the island.I’m\ninvoking Hamilton’s words today, in this plea for relief for Puerto Rico.Much\nhas been said about the dire economic situation pressing down on Puerto Rico.\nI am the son of Puerto Rican parents. What can I say to persuade elected\nofficials and policy makers to act? What influence do I have to change the\nminds and hearts of those in Congress to put aside their differences and deal\nwith the crisis confronting 3.5 million American citizens in the Caribbean?\nI’m not a politician or an economist. I’m a storyteller.More than 150 schools\non the island have closed. San Jorge Children’s Hospital, Puerto Rico’s\nlargest pediatric hospital, has been forced to close two wings and 40 rooms,\nand cannot afford to hire the nurses it needs. It’s estimated that a doctor a\nday leaves the island. Engineers, accountants, blue-collar workers and entire\nfamilies are emigrating daily. According to the census, Puerto Rico has lost 9\npercent of its population in the last decade, with 84,000 leaving last year\nalone.This is not the Puerto Rico I remember. Every summer my sister Luz and I\nstayed with our grandparents in Vega Alta, a small town on the northern coast.\nMy grandfather managed the town credit union — a real-life George Bailey if\never there was one. My grandmother owned a travel agency, Viajes Miranda. My\naunt Yamilla owned the school supply store next door, and I sold candy to\nreturning students in August.In Vega Alta, I was “el nene de Luisito, que se\nfue a Nueva York” (“The son of Luisito, who left for New York”) but welcomed\nevery summer as a cherished member of the community, despite my halting\nSpanglish. I walked from one end of town to the other, waving at the business\nowners, many of whom went to church with my grandparents, feeling a sense of\ncommunity that often eluded me back in New York.Today, most of those\nstorefronts — the school supply shop, the travel agency and many more — are\nboarded up, with little hope of housing new businesses. Residents like the\ntown’s mayor, Isabelo Molina, and my uncle Elvin, who heads a Pentecostal\nchurch there, are working hard to change that. They have learned to stretch a\ndollar as far as it can go. But Puerto Rico’s $72 billion debt, which is equal\nto about 68 percent of the island’s gross domestic product, thwarts efforts\nfor economic development.There are remedies when governments run up debt. If\nPuerto Rico were an American city, it could declare bankruptcy, as Detroit did\nin 2013. If it were a state, the federal government would surely have already\ndeclared emergency measures to help the most vulnerable. But since it is a\nterritory of the United States, there is no system in place to handle the\nfinancial and humanitarian crisis that is happening right now.Please let us\nnot get bogged down in Puerto Rico’s status. If a ship is sinking, you don’t\nask, “Well, what type of ship is it and what type of ship should it be?” You\nrescue the people aboard.What Puerto Rico needs, as a first step, is what\nalmost any other company or government has — the ability to restructure its\ndebt. Congress can make that happen. The island is in danger of defaulting on\nsome of its larger loans and it is already being sued by creditors. An act of\nCongress in support of restructuring would help bring creditors to the table\nto develop a workable plan that could satisfy debtholders and relieve the\npunishment of the people of Puerto Rico.This is not a Republican issue. This\nis not a Democratic issue. This is an American issue. When 3.5 million of our\ncitizens face the consequences of financial collapse, we should act. Because\nPuerto Ricans can vote neither for the president nor for congressional\nrepresentatives, it falls to us of Puerto Rican heritage in the continental\nUnited States to amplify their plea.By chance, I picked up Ron Chernow’s\nbiography of Alexander Hamilton in 2008 and found the inspiration that changed\nmy life. I recognized, in Hamilton’s ability to write his way out of his\ndifficult circumstances, a kindred spirit. I write about Puerto Rico today\njust as Hamilton wrote about St. Croix in his time. Congress, please don’t\nplay politics with the lives of 3.5 million Americans. Succor the miserable\nand lay up a treasure in heaven. We are counting on you.\n\n","title":"Lin-Manuel Miranda: Give Puerto Rico Its Chance to Thrive - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Alexander Hamilton fought for his island home.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014dd"},"content":"ATLANTA — In a striking defeat to religious conservatives, Gov. Nathan Deal of\nGeorgia said Monday that he would veto a bill intended to protect critics of\nsame-sex marriage.“In light of our history, I find it somewhat ironic that\nsome in the religious community today feel that it is necessary for government\nto confer upon them certain rights and protections,” Mr. Deal said at the\nState Capitol, where he had faced intense pressure from the bill’s supporters\nand critics.“If indeed our religious liberty is conferred upon us by God, and\nnot by man-made government, perhaps we should simply heed the hands-off\nadmonition of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.”Mr. Deal,\na Republican in his second term, announced his decision less than two weeks\nafter the General Assembly easily approved House Bill 757, which its\nsupporters named the Free Exercise Protection Act. The vote tallies from March\n16, when the House of Representatives and the Senate considered the bill over\na stretch of just hours, suggest that Mr. Deal’s veto will probably stand, but\nRepublicans said that they were discussing the possibility of a special\nsession to challenge the governor’s decision.Shortly before Mr. Deal spoke,\nthe outcome of last week’s special legislative session in North Carolina moved\ninto federal court. There, a coalition of individuals and civil liberties\ngroups filed a challenge to a measure that overturned local protections for\ngay and transgender people. Critics of the law, which bars transgender people\nfrom using public bathrooms that do not match the sexes stated on their birth\ncertificates, said the measure violated the Constitution and federal anti-\ndiscrimination laws.That lawsuit might stretch for many months, and companies\nhave already warned that the North Carolina law may endanger the state’s\nprospects for new or recurring business. With his veto here in Georgia, Mr.\nDeal most likely sidestepped the type of economic backlash that Indiana faced\nlast year after its governor signed a so-called religious liberty measure.\n(After a national outcry, Indiana officials rewrote the law.) A number of\nbusinesses and sports organizations, including Coca-Cola and the National\nFootball League, had warned Mr. Deal, explicitly or implicitly, that a\ndecision to support the bill could jeopardize economic opportunities in\nGeorgia.The Georgia bill was intended to offer protections to faith-based\ngroups if they, absent certain conditions, refused to provide “social,\neducational or charitable services that violate” their religious beliefs. The\nmeasure also would have allowed such groups, without legal repercussions, to\navoid hiring anyone whose religious beliefs conflicted with those of the\norganizations.Gay rights groups argued that the bill would have cloaked\ndiscrimination as a form of religious liberty.Mr. Deal’s decision left the\nbill’s supporters, most of them Republicans, dismayed.“We control all the\nconstitutional offices, we control the legislature, and today, the governor\nhas turned his back on millions and millions of people who have very real\nconcerns about what their religious freedom looks like in the wake of a very\nfluid legal environment,” said State Senator Josh McKoon, a\nRepublican.Proponents of the bill, some of whom had urged supporters to lobby\nMr. Deal, argued that the measure would not have allowed discrimination, and\nthey said that it would have offered necessary reassurance to people\nfrustrated or even frightened by the United States Supreme Court opinion last\nsummer that recognized a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.“The\nmessage that’s been sent by this veto is essentially that it’s open season on\npeople of faith in Georgia,” Mr. McKoon said.Critics, who had organized their\nown campaign, said they were elated at what they believed was a landmark\nlegislative victory that sent a message to lawmakers in the Deep South.“Today,\nGovernor Deal heard the voices of Georgians, civil rights organizations, as\nwell as the many leaders in the entertainment industry and private sector who\ncondemned this attack on the fundamental rights of L.G.B.T. people, and he has\nset an example for other elected officials to follow,” Chad Griffin, the\npresident of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group, said in a\nstatement.Some of the most influential names in Georgia business also welcomed\nMr. Deal’s decision. The Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce said Mr. Deal’s\n“thoughtful deliberation and consideration on this issue has led to an outcome\nthat preserves Georgia’s positive business climate, encourages job growth and\nsustains our quality of life, and is truly in the best interest of all\nGeorgians.”Critics of the North Carolina bill relied on many of the same\nthemes, even as they turned to the courts. In a lawsuit, filed in a Federal\nDistrict Court, opponents of the North Carolina law said it “violates the most\nbasic guarantees of equal treatment and the U.S. Constitution.”Graham Wilson,\na spokesman for Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina, said in a statement on\nMonday that “the governor respects the right of any legal challenge; however,\nhe does not respect the continued distortion of the facts by the groups\nchallenging this law and by many members of the state and national media.” Mr.\nWilson said the governor, a Republican, would “counter a coordinated national\neffort to mislead the public” and defend “a common sense resolution to local\ngovernment overreach.”The bills that moved through the legislatures in Georgia\nand North Carolina this month reflect the continuing unease about gay rights\namong many people in the South, where religious values have an outsize\ninfluence on public policy. There were also displays of the tensions between\nresidents of the largest cities in those states, in places like Atlanta and\nCharlotte, and the millions of people who live in more rural communities.In\nGeorgia, the bill that Mr. Deal will veto emerged after weeks of negotiations\nand warnings, and its swift passage set into motion sweeping campaigns to\npressure the governor, who must also reach a decision about a proposal\nconcerning firearms on college campuses. Message logs, obtained through an\nopen records request, showed that Mr. Deal’s office had received thousands of\ncomments about the two measures.Even if lawmakers do not return to Atlanta for\na special session, the clash about religious liberty is already poised to re-\nemerge and might shadow Mr. Deal until his term ends in 2019. Standing outside\nMr. Deal’s office on Monday morning, Dave Baker, the executive director of the\nFaith and Freedom Coalition of Georgia, which supported the legislation, said,\n“We’re going to continue to press to make sure that we have the same\nprotections in our state law that citizens in other states have.”But the\ngovernor, at least on Monday, said he had little reason to approve the\nproposal that conservatives like Mr. Baker championed.“I do not think,” Mr.\nDeal said, “that we have to discriminate against anyone to protect the faith-\nbased community in Georgia, of which I and my family have been a part of for\nall of our lives.”\n\n","title":"Georgia Governor Rejects Bill Shielding Critics of Gay Marriage - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Georgia's governor plans to veto a bill intended to shield critics of gay marriage https://t.co/FyZU5AAd89 https://t.co/1MAfjMqbAd","date":"Tue Mar 29 05:19:42 +0000 2016","favs":332,"id":{"$numberLong":"714683427988107264"},"retweets":151},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21PHtn1"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014de"},"content":"_Why are the two companies spending billions to build offices that look lifted\nstraight from the 1960s?_For all the talk of “disruption” coming out of\nSilicon Valley, one thing that has tended to remain stubbornly stuck in the\npast is tech companies’ architecture. Many of today’s most innovative\ncompanies are housed in deadly dull, boxy and glassy suburban campuses: Google\nlives in the rehabbed buildings once occupied by Silicon Graphics, Facebook in\na laboratory from the 1960s. Though the interiors might have advanced lighting\nsystems, state-of-the-art fitness facilities and cafeterias serving farm-to-\ntable fare, the exteriors — flat, unarticulated facades; ribbon windows; hard\nright angles — could come from any suburban office corridor anywhere in the\ncountry, and from any moment in the past half-century.This is why the recently\nrevealed plans for the new campuses of Google, in Mountain View, Calif.,\ndesigned by Bjarke Ingels and Thomas Heatherwick, and Apple, in Cupertino,\nfrom Sir Norman Foster, are so striking: They, like the companies they will\nhouse, point to the future — the future, that is, as it looked in the 1960s.\nImages of the projected Apple campus — a four-tiered ringlike structure\nnestled in a thickly wooded landscape — evoke the landing of an alien\nspaceship. The central structure in Ingels’s and Heatherwick’s design is\ncanopied by a sinuous glass membrane, a protective bubble or amniotic sac,\nshielding an entire section of the campus — not just buildings but bike paths\nand desks — while letting the abundant Northern California light stream in. In\naerial renderings it looks like larvae, incubating a new and possibly\nterrifying future.Like the rest of Silicon Valley, however, this future is in\nfact rooted in the past. It comes, transfigured, from the wrecked dreams of\ncommunal living, of back-to-the-land utopias, of expanding plastic spheres and\ngeodesic domes that populated the landscape of Northern California around the\ntime (and around the same place) that the first semiconductors were being\nperfected. This is the world of what a recent exhibit at the Walker Art Center\nin Minneapolis has termed “Hippie Modernism.” Out of the ferment of the ’60s\ncame a spectacular brew of experiments that softened the edge of the\nbureaucratic architecture of Modernism and explored new shapes and styles of\nbuilding, new ideas about how to live and work. In the world of the\ncounterculture, round and pliant was good; sharp and angular was bad. These\nconcepts found their way into the cinema — into the soft plastic finishes of\nthe circular, rotating space station in Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space\nOdyssey,” where it was the antithesis of the sourceless, death-bringing black\nslab monolith, itself almost the clone of that icon of corporate Modernism,\nMies van der ­Rohe’s Seagram Building. Now those same undulations have found\ntheir way back to us, in the form of impregnable corporate campuses for the\nfuture-plotting, world-dominating, “don’t be evil” tech industry.It may sound\nunlikely, but there is in fact a strong connection between the utopian\nmovements of the ’60s and the tech industry; it’s a topic that’s been well\nexplored by academics, most notably in Stanford professor Fred Turner’s\nwonderful 2006 history “From Counterculture to Cyberculture.” Turner’s book\ncenters on the role played by Merry Prankster-turned-designer Stewart Brand,\nwhose magazine The Whole Earth Catalog, started in 1968 and regularly\npublished through 1972, advocated ’60s ideals of autonomy, do-it-yourself\ndesign and deep ecological thinking. The cover of the first issue was an image\nof the earth — another sphere — taken from space, exemplifying its spirit of\nholism. Brand advertised where you could get tools to build out the new\nsociety, among them, critically, new technology, from calculators to Moog\nsynthesizers, which connected him, and the counterculture, to the burgeoning\ntech scene. Kevin Kelly, a co-founder of Wired and one of the editors of The\nWhole Earth Catalog, thought that the magazine’s ethos of sharing products and\ncommunications, even its cobbled-together design, prefigured the blog. The\nyoung Steve Jobs, for one, was a huge fan. “On the back cover of their final\nissue,” Jobs told graduating Stanford students in a 2005 commencement speech,\n“was a photograph of an early morning country road, the kind you might find\nyourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words:\n‘Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.’ ” Brand himself would later call Jobs one of the\nexemplary fusers of the counterculture and technology.Brand was also an\nenthusiast for countercultural design ideas as a way to build a new society.\nIn an issue from 1971, he called for the creation of an “Outlaw Area,” a\nterritory removed from civilization, where human community could be\nreinvented. “Any design fantasy is just loose talk until it happens,” he\nwrote, suggesting that the Outlaw Area would transform our understanding of\nwhat human beings were capable of, “bending reality off into unimaginable\ndirections with no restrictions save the harsh ones of nature.”The designers\nwho followed up on Brand’s injunctions over the next decade would create forms\nthat startlingly presage the new office worlds being designed by Google and\nApple. Above all, they would take to heart the idea of “bending reality,” with\ntheir embrace of soft, flexible, organic forms. Architects became attracted to\nfurniture and buildings that resembled bubbles. As the design critic Alastair\nGordon observed in his book “Spaced Out: Radical Environments of the\nPsychedelic Sixties,” not only did the trippy shimmer of the bubble delight\nthe hippies, its transparency and unpredictable movement seemed at once\nstimulating and human. The visionary architect Buckminster Fuller’s famous\nconcept of a “geodesic dome,” a giant all-purpose shelter, drew heavily on\nbubble imagery. Meanwhile, students at Antioch College in Ohio conceived of a\n“Nomadic/Pneumatic Campus,” an outdoor classroom sheltered by a 40-foot-high\npolyvinyl canopy. For a time the “offices” of The Whole Earth Catalog, in\ntheir temporary digs in California’s Saline Valley, were sheltered in just\nsuch a bubble. The fact that they were temporary was the key: Like the\nconversion of garages into tech offices, the bubble shelter was meant to be\nforgiving, improvisatory, for a nomadic and restless society seeking a new\nrelationship with how to fuse life and work.Not that these future society\nplans were limited entirely to the planet. In 1969, Princeton physics\nprofessor, Gerard O’Neill, and his students began to imagine how to create a\nspace colony to house a million people. O’Neill’s vision comprised two\nconcentric cylinders (round forms, again), spinning in opposite directions to\ngenerate gravity, and on which each person would be allotted five acres of\nland. The designer Don Norman did a rendering of the concept, and it bears a\nstriking resemblance to the images of the new Google office: Filled with\ndazzling foliage, plentiful water and bucolic housing, it looks a lot like\nMarin County, placed under glass.These images and experiments fueled the\nimagination of Silicon Valley, even as the young tech entrepreneurs began\nconverting their ramshackle means to far different ends. It was, after all, an\nearth held in common that inspired the hippie Modernists to find new ways of\ndesigning and living. The new unearthly Silicon Valley campuses represent the\ntriumph of privatized commons, of a verdant natural world sheltered for the\nfew. Neither the Google nor Apple campus is open to the public, nor are their\ndesigns replicable on the scale that the ’60s utopians imagined for their\ndesigns. Well after the orchards of Northern California were overwhelmed by\nglass boxes and suburban tracts, the tech companies find themselves looking\nlongingly at an Edenic, prelapsarian moment, when it seemed that — to adapt a\nmore recent slogan — another world was possible. But what was originally borne\nfrom improvisation and a desire to live simply is now borne from unimaginable\nmountains of cash. The new Apple office will cost an estimated $5 billion,\nmaking it possibly the most expensive office building in history. We are\ndealing with a bubble of a different kind.__\n\n","title":"Google and Apple: the High-Tech Hippies of Silicon Valley - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Google and Apple's new headquarters resemble hippie communes https://t.co/5zOisdSu1S https://t.co/UpoqTwZAJE","date":"Tue Mar 29 04:46:03 +0000 2016","favs":361,"id":{"$numberLong":"714674961701539841"},"retweets":203},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1UXGEIB"}

It would be\nimpossible to narrow it down.” Burrell Communications Group, which develops\nproductions that focus on social problems affecting the black population, was\nrecognized with an Advocacy Media award from the American Advertising\nFederation this month for “Black Is Human.”“Our hearts go out to Zarriel and\nhis family,” the company said on its Facebook page. “We wish him a speedy\nrecovery.”\n\n","title":"Chicago Teenager in Video Against Gun Violence Is Shot and Wounded - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"This teen made a PSA against gun violence.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014e0"},"content":"SÃO PAULO, Brazil — Brazil’s former president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva on\nMonday accused the judge overseeing the investigation into the country’s\ncolossal graft scandal of trying to ruin him by releasing intercepts of his\ntelephone conversations.“There’s an objective: trying to destroy the image of\nLula,” Mr. da Silva said, referring to strategies employed by Sergio Moro, the\njudge whose release of the intercepts caused an uproar this month. In the\nprofanity-laced calls, Mr. da Silva is heard discussing ways to constrain the\nwork of investigators.“I hope that God places his hand on his head,” Mr. da\nSilva, 70, long one of Brazil’s most influential politicians, said of Judge\nMoro, who has emerged as a hero among anticorruption activists. “There’s going\nto come a day when someone’s going to have to apologize to me.”Mr. da Silva’s\ncomments, in a wide-reaching news conference here with foreign journalists,\nreflected escalating political tensions as his handpicked successor, President\nDilma Rousseff, battled to remain in office in the face of impeachment\nproceedings.The intercepts, obtained by federal agents in the inquiry into Mr.\nda Silva’s close ties to giant construction companies, offer a rare glimpse\ninto how leading figures in the leftist Workers’ Party are scrambling to keep\ntheir government from collapsing.At the same time, Judge Moro, 43, has come\nunder fire over his release of the intercepts, which include calls between Mr.\nda Silva and Ms. Rousseff during her presidency. Critics of the judge have\nassailed him for what they describe as a partisan attempt to bolster efforts\nto oust Ms. Rousseff.In one of the calls, Ms. Rousseff and Mr. da Silva\nbriefly discussed the former president’s nomination as her chief of staff, a\nmove that would have provided Mr. da Silva with broad legal protections as\nprosecutors in São Paulo State seek his arrest.Since the intercepts were\nreleased, justices on Brazil’s Supreme Federal Tribunal have suspended that\nnomination, citing concerns that Mr. da Silva’s nomination could obstruct\nJudge Moro’s investigation, which has already resulted in the imprisonment of\nconstruction magnates, oil executives and confidants of Mr. da Silva.Still,\nMr. da Silva appeared sanguine Monday about his chances of assisting Ms.\nRousseff, who insisted last week that she would not resign. Dressed in a crisp\nsuit and tie and looking more robust than he had recently, he said he was\nprepared to serve as an unpaid adviser to the president in the area of\n“economic and social development.”Mr. da Silva also expressed indignation over\nthe corruption inquiries that have placed him on the defensive, a stunning\nturnaround from just a few years ago, when he left office with soaring\napproval ratings after presiding over an economic boom.Federal prosecutors say\nfive of the construction companies engulfed in the graft scandal surrounding\nPetrobras, the national oil company, paid him the equivalent of about $2.7\nmillion for speeches since he left the presidency.Investigators are also\nlooking into renovations paid for by construction companies of a country\nestate and a beachfront apartment, properties that they contend the former\npresident has controlled. On Monday, Mr. da Silva again denied owning the\nproperties, but state prosecutors in São Paulo have charged him with money\nlaundering and misrepresentation of assets in connection to the apartment in\nthe seaside city of Guarujá.Mr. da Silva remarked that such inquiries were\nmade possible by the policies of his government to bolster the independence of\nthe country’s judiciary. But he asserted that some investigators were\noverstepping their authority by seeking to oust Ms. Rousseff.“We know what’s\nhappening with these targeted leaks against the Workers’ Party,” Mr. da Silva\nsaid, referring not just to the intercepts but also to revelations from plea\ndeals that are filtered into the Brazilian news media.He said opponents of the\ngovernment were trying to taint the entire party, formed by leftists in the\n1980s in organized resistance to Brazil’s military dictatorship, comparing the\nprocess to the way “Mussolini criminalized the democrats of Italy.”Still, Mr.\nda Silva acknowledged that he and Ms. Rousseff had their work cut out for them\nin confronting Brazil’s worst economic crisis in decades. And he recognized\nthat corruption had spread into the executive suites of Petrobras, arguably\nBrazil’s most powerful company.Contending that no government was immune to\nwrongdoing in its ranks, he compared Brazil’s political crisis to the scandal\nin the 1970s that forced the resignation of the West German chancellor Willy\nBrandt, after a Brandt aide was found to be an East German spy. “My\ntranquillity persists,” Mr. da Silva said, “in the thinking that those who\nmade mistakes should pay the price for them.”\n\n","title":"‘Lula,’ Ex-President of Brazil, Lashes Out at Judge Overseeing Corruption Inquiry - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesworld: ‘Lula,’ ex-president of Brazil, says judge heading corruption inquiry is trying to ruin him: https://t.co/4P8y0KbZwJ http…","date":"Tue Mar 29 04:23:00 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714669161453117441"},"retweets":236},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21QcZkR"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014e1"},"content":"Thirty years ago, Bob Ebeling drove to the headquarters of the aerospace\ncontractor Morton Thiokol in Brigham City, Utah, to watch the launch of the\nspace shuttle Challenger. On the way, he leaned over to his daughter Leslie\nand said: “The Challenger is going to blow up. Everyone’s going to die.”Mr.\nEbeling (pronounced EBB-ling), an engineer at Thiokol, knew what the rest of\nthe world did not: that the rubber O-rings designed to seal the joints between\nthe booster rocket’s segments performed poorly in cold weather. A severe cold\nsnap in Florida was about to subject the O-rings to temperatures more than 30\ndegrees lower than at any previous launch.During the afternoon and evening\nbefore the launch, Thiokol engineers, relying on data provided by Mr. Ebeling\nand his colleagues, argued passionately for a postponement of the launch in\nconference calls with NASA managers at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida and\nthe Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. They were overruled not\nonly by NASA, but also by their own managers.On the morning of Jan. 28, 1986,\nsitting in a conference room with his daughter and Roger Boisjoly, Thiokol’s\nchief seal expert, Mr. Ebeling watched on a large projection screen as the\nChallenger cleared the launching pad. “I turned to Bob and said, ‘We’ve just\ndodged a bullet,’” Mr. Boisjoly told The Guardian in 2001.A minute later, the\nO-rings failed and the Challenger exploded in a ball of fire, killing all\nseven crew members aboard. Among them was Christa McAuliffe, a schoolteacher\nfrom New Hampshire who had been chosen to be the first citizen passenger in\nspace.Mr. Ebeling never recovered from the disaster. “I’ve been under terrible\nstress since the accident,” he told The Houston Chronicle in 1987. “I have\nheadaches. I cry. I have bad dreams. I go into a hypnotic trance almost\ndaily.”He soon left Thiokol and the engineering profession. For the rest of\nhis life he faulted himself for not doing enough to prevent the launch.At\ntimes, he seemed to carry the entire burden of the disaster on his shoulders,\nalthough it was he, on the afternoon before the launch, who made a critical\nphone call to Allan J. McDonald, the Thiokol engineer in charge of the solid\nrocket motor project at the Kennedy Space Center, alerting him to concerns\nabout the O-rings.“I think this was one of the mistakes that God made,” Mr.\nEbeling told Howard Berkes of NPR in January, on the 30th anniversary of the\nevent. “He shouldn’t have picked me for that job. I don’t know, but next time\nI talk to him, I’m going to ask him, ‘Why? You picked a loser.’”Mr. Ebeling\ndied on Monday in Brigham City at 89. His daughter Leslie Serna recalled the\nmorning of the launch in an interview on NPR that day. Robert Vernon Ebeling\nwas born on Sept. 4, 1926, in Chicago. His father, Ado, an auto mechanic, took\nthe family to San Diego when Robert was a boy. After graduating from high\nschool he was called up by the Army — his mother, the former Irene Kramer, sat\non the local draft board — and served as an infantryman in the Philippines\nduring World War II.He returned to San Diego after his discharge and in 1949\nmarried Darlene Popejoy, who survives him. In addition to his daughter Leslie,\nhe is also survived by three other daughters, Kathleen Ebeling, who confirmed\nhis death, Judy Kirwan and Terrie Johnston; 12 grandchildren; 16 great-\ngrandchildren; and two great-great-grandchildren.Mr. Ebeling enrolled in\nCalifornia Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, earning a degree\nin mechanical engineering in 1952, and went to work for Convair, a San Diego\nmanufacturer of airplanes, rockets and spacecraft. The company made the first\nAtlas rockets used by Project Mercury, NASA’s manned orbital flight\nprogram.Mr. Ebeling joined Thiokol, as it was then known, in 1962. A supplier\nof rockets and missile propulsion systems, the company in 1974 won the\ncontract to build solid rocket boosters for the space shuttle program. Mr.\nEbeling was manager of the ignition system and final assembly for the shuttle\nboosters.After leaving Morton Thiokol, Mr. Ebeling became a volunteer at the\nBear River Migratory Bird Refuge near his home in Brigham City. In 1989, in\nresponse to damage caused by flooding of the Great Salt Lake, he created\nFriends of the Bear River Refuge, which raised money to restore the sanctuary.\nDrawing upon his engineering background, he also helped repair dikes and\nwater-control structures.In 1990, President George Bush presented him with the\nTheodore Roosevelt Conservation Award for his work. In 2013, he was named the\nNational Wildlife Refuge System’s volunteer of the year by the National\nWildlife Refuge Association and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.Mr.\nEbeling’s anguished interview with NPR in January moved hundreds of listeners\nto send expressions of support and sympathy.Mr. McDonald, his former boss at\nThiokol, called him. “I told him that he was not a loser, that a loser was\nsomeone who has a chance to act but doesn’t, and worse, doesn’t care,” Mr.\nMcDonald said in an interview on Thursday.“He really did do something,” he\nadded. “I told him that if he had not called me, we never would have had the\nopportunity to try to avert the disaster. They would have just gone ahead with\nthe launch. At least we had the opportunity to try to stop it.”The public\nresponse to Mr. Ebeling’s interview eventually had an effect, especially after\na former Thiokol executive and a NASA official contacted by Mr. Berkes of NPR\nwrote words of encouragement. In a follow-up piece, Mr. Berkes asked Mr.\nEbeling if he would like to respond.Mr. Ebeling said: “You helped bring my\nworrisome mind to ease. You have to have an end to everything.”\n\n","title":"Robert Ebeling, Challenger Engineer Who Warned of Disaster, Dies at 89 - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The NYT obituary for Robert Ebeling, the Challenger engineer who warned of the disaster https://t.co/smB2in9zOR","date":"Tue Mar 29 04:12:02 +0000 2016","favs":343,"id":{"$numberLong":"714666400388890624"},"retweets":290},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1RMcVmN"}

The school will replicate the model of Capital Preparatory Magnet,\na year-round school in Hartford that says it has high graduation and college\nacceptance rates.The founder of the Hartford school, Steve Perry, said in an\ninterview on Monday that it was unclear what role Mr. Combs would play in the\nnew school. Beginning in 2011, Mr. Combs recruited Mr. Perry to bring his\neducational model to Harlem, provided office space and quietly rallied support\nin the community, Mr. Perry said.“It’s important to note it was he who\ninspired our team to come in and expand into New York,” Mr. Perry said. “It\nstarts there, and the rest of the role will develop over time.”The school is\nset to open for the 2016-17 school year, with 160 students in sixth and\nseventh grades. School officials said it would expand one grade per year,\neventually enrolling 700 students in grades six through 12. It is currently\naccepting applications for students and staff members.Mr. Perry said that he\ninitially resisted Mr. Combs’s suggestion of opening another school —\nsuggesting an after-school program or a scholarship instead — but that Mr.\nCombs was adamant.“I think that there’s a lot to be found in the fact that you\nhave someone such as Combs, who is highly visible within our community, who\nhas decided that his major push is going to be with our model and in\neducation,” Mr. Perry said.Last year, Mr. Combs was arrested on a charge of\nassault with a deadly weapon — a kettlebell — after an altercation at the\nAcosta Athletic Training Complex of University of California, Los Angeles,\nwhere his son is a member of the football team.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014e3"},"content":"LAHORE, Pakistan — Riaz Masih and Nasreen Riasat had been married for four\nyears, with their first child on the way in just a month, when they decided a\nslow walk in the park would be just the thing to enjoy a pleasant Sunday\nevening in Lahore.In a moment of calculated cruelty, they were thrust into the\nlong roll call of families victimized by a jihadist suicide bomber on the\nEaster holiday, and among the vast accounting of terrorism’s toll on a country\nracked by extremism, again and again, for years.“I can’t figure out what\nhappened!” Mr. Masih said, his voice choking with grief as he lay in a bed at\nLahore’s Jinnah Hospital on Monday. Ms. Riasat, his wife, was torn apart by\nthe bomber’s blast, she and their soon-to-be-born child among the dozens\nkilled. “Within minutes, I lost my wife. I couldn’t save her.”Muhammad Kasim,\na 25-year-old mechanic from out of town, was buying tickets to the children’s\nrides in the park for a group of family and friends when he felt the\nexplosion. Running to the corner where his relatives were waiting, he found\nhorror: an aunt killed, along with the excited 2-year-old daughter of a\nfriend.“Twelve of my relatives are wounded and under treatment,” he said,\nexhausted and still wearing his bloodstained shirt on Monday at the\noverwhelmed hospital. “I haven’t slept since yesterday, and I have no time to\neat since I am the only one attending to my wounded relatives.”Shock and grief\nenveloped Pakistan on Monday as the official death toll from the attack in\nLahore a day earlier rose to at least 72, with 341 people reported wounded by\nofficials.In a televised address to the nation, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\nvowed to fight terrorism “until it is rooted out from our society.” And the\ncountry’s powerful military, credited with greatly reducing militant attacks\nover the past two years, said that it was beginning a new round of operations\nin Punjab Province, Pakistan’s most populous region and the home to\nLahore.Extremist groups have long made a campaign of attacking religious or\nethnic minorities in Punjab. The attack on Sunday was claimed by\nJamaat-e-Ahrar, a splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban, which said it was\ntargeting Christians who had gathered in the park for Easter. But Pakistani\nofficials went to pains to say the toll was unselective, with Muslims and\nChristians among the dead and bereaved. Most of the victims were working-\nclass, or poorer.The attack came just days after the National Assembly adopted\na resolution to recognize Easter and the Hindu festivals of Holi and Diwali as\npublic holidays, in what some here saw as a vital call for tolerance and\nothers saw as offensive in a state officially built on Islam. That gesture,\ntoo, was marred by the bomber’s strike.Lahore is a magnet on spring weekends,\nwith crowds drawn to the city’s famous parks and monuments, and its shopping\ncenters. Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park, where the bomber struck after pacing its\ncrowded parking lot, is one of the largest and most popular public parks\nhere.Facing heavy criticism on Monday, officials acknowledged that while\nsecurity measures had been intensified around mosques and, especially,\nchurches on Sunday, little attention had been paid to the public parks.On\nMonday, the city shut down around its pain. All public parks and the Lahore\nZoo were closed, as were most of the shopping and commercial centers. A spring\nfestival was canceled.But at Lahore’s hospitals, distraught relatives were\npouring in. And at the city’s cemeteries, the funerals began.In Youhanabad, a\nsuburb with a large Christian population, funeral services were held for three\nteenagers. Four others from the neighborhood were wounded. Yousaf Samuel\nBenjamin was at a service to mourn a young family friend, a 17-year-old named\nAaron, even as he and others awaited word about the teenager’s brother, Sherry\nPatras. “No one knows whether Sherry is still alive,” he said, “or whether he\nwas also shattered into pieces.”Inayat Masih, a grieving father, demanded to\nknow why his 17-year-old son, Wasif, and two of the son’s friends deserved\ndeath. “They were innocent!” Mr. Masih said. “I can only pray that they find\npeace wherever they are now.”Rashida Bibi, 50, who was being treated for head\ninjuries, said she and 32 members of her extended family had come to Lahore\nfrom Sahiwal, another city in Punjab, to enjoy their Sunday. “We were at the\nswings,” she said. “Suddenly there was a blast and I fell down. I cannot\ndescribe the terrible scenes.”Naveed Ahmed, 33, a power loom worker from\nFaisalabad, said two of his nephews were badly wounded in the explosion. “My 9\n-year-old nephew, Owais, was so close to the blast that the explosive material\nseverely bruised his body, and doctors had to operate on his lower abdomen and\nthroat,” Mr. Ahmed said.A cousin, Adnan, 15, had both legs fractured. Mr.\nAhmed said he was shocked to see some men begin stealing even as people lay\nhurt and screaming for help. “I am deeply saddened and unable to understand\nhow even after such a tragedy — how could some people start stealing?” he\nsaid. Owais, who was still conscious after the blast, was trying to call his\nmother when a thief snatched his phone away.Others recounted how rescue\nworkers struggled to save the wounded at a scene of utter chaos, with the\npower cut and victims writhing and screaming.One of the rescuers, Mohammad\nAhmad, remained deeply shaken on Monday.“It was very difficult,” he said. “We\nfelt as if we were standing on a pool of blood and strewn body parts. “The\ngiant skywheel at the park had stopped working and people were stuck. Their\nscreams are still haunting me.”On Monday afternoon, shoes and shreds of\nclothing were still strewn about in the parking lot, framed behind a police\ncordon.\n\n","title":"Keen Pain in Pakistan Over Lives ‘Shattered Into Pieces’ - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesworld: Family members of Pakistan bombing victims describe lives \"shattered into pieces.\" https://t.co/pd4XplpV8k https://t.co/i…","date":"Tue Mar 29 03:51:05 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714661127146180608"},"retweets":123},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PC5Y07"}

There was the momentous farewell announcement; a run\nof sold-out shows, including a three-hour-plus spectacle at Madison Square\nGarden; and a documentary, “Shut Up and Play the Hits,” chronicling the\nheartache with which the frontman, James Murphy, decided to step away from the\nstage, seemingly forever.But we are living in the reboot era, and so, on\nSunday, scarcely five years after LCD Soundsystem broke up, it played its\nfirst reunion show, at Webster Hall in the East Village, with another on\nMonday. The performances were in preparation for the group’s headlining set at\nthe Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival next month, and they were a\nsurprise, announced only three days before. Tickets were awarded via lottery,\nconnections and luck, and even this warm-up bill was treated as a seminal\nevent by music industry insiders and exuberant fans. As electronic dance\nmusic, or E.D.M., rules the airwaves and LCD’s disco-punk sound seems more\nprescient than ever, the revival was largely embraced, even if it was also a\nforegone conclusion.“I knew they were lying” about disbanding, said David\nSchoonmaker, a longtime fan who came to Webster Hall in a homemade LCD\nbaseball cap. Mr. Schoonmaker, 47, who works in health care advertising, said\nthe band’s short retirement was just long enough: “They didn’t need more than\nfive years to prove to people that they’re still magical.”Mr. Murphy didn’t\nseem so sure. “This is very weird,” he said, a few songs in, after greeting\nthe crowd. (“It’s been a hot minute.”) In a rambly letter explaining the\ncomeback, posted on the band’s website, he had acknowledged that some fans\nmight feel “betrayed” by its quick reversal, so he thanked everyone, too, a\nlot. “We are humbled by your enthusiasm and kindness,” he said, adding, “Thank\nyou guys for doing whatever you had to do to be here.”The group, which\nperformed as a seven-piece and includes Nancy Whang on keys and Pat Mahoney on\ndrums, has promised new music — an album is due this year. But the two-hour\nset was entirely old material, including an updated “Daft Punk Is Playing at\nMy House”: “Pharrell’s in the band now,” Mr. Murphy deadpanned.His acute self-\nawareness has always been part of the appeal; LCD’s first single, “Losing My\nEdge,” released in 2002, offered a wry take on indie-rock cooler-than-thou-\nness, and it found an eager audience in the music blogosphere. Pitchfork,\nwhich streamed and posted Snapchats from Sunday’s show, had at least three\ncorrespondents there, live-blogging by minute: “11:57 p.m.: Murphy is face\ndown on the snare drum, singing into the mic.”But the crowd mostly came to\nmove; even through some technical difficulties caused by an errant keyboard\ncontroller, the capacity audience throbbed under an oversized disco ball that\nlit up on cue during “Us v Them.”“I prepared with all my flying colors, to\nemulate all the joy I feel inside,” said Annie Garneva, 26, who wore a\nsequined top and silver shoes, and pink-and-blue leggings printed with trees.\nFrom the opening song, “Get Innocuous!,” the floor bounced under all the\npogoers. Mr. Murphy, who ditched his trademark black jacket almost immediately\nas he roamed the stage, chimed in on snares and cowbells, and repeatedly\ndropped to his knees to fix errant gear.Ms. Garneva, a Brooklynite who works\nat a nonprofit organization, said she once saw Mr. Murphy on the street in\nWilliamsburg, “and I screamed that I loved him.” For her, the band expresses\n“the fundamental and natural parts of being human — just being anxious or\nconfused or loving, and how you can be all those things at the same time,” she\nsaid.Audience members, who ranged from their 20s to their 50s, seemed split\nbetween LCD dance floor newbies and veterans, and included some boldface\nnames, like Aziz Ansari and Spike Jonze. The art dealer Jeffrey Deitch, who\nonce employed Ms. Whang as a gallery assistant, estimated that he had seen the\ngroup 30 times. “They’re the greatest contemporary band to come out of New\nYork,” he said.Tickets on the secondary market were going for upward of $500.\n“I spent two-and-a-half days having an anxiety attack and talking to scalpers”\nonline, said Reinhardt Wende, 27, a nurse, who arrived with hundreds in cash\nfor a ticket but got a tip that the band was selling extras at a nearby bar,\nand spent only $40. Amman Badlani, 37, who works in digital marketing, was\neven luckier: After an hour and a half standing outside with a sign pleading\nfor tickets, he was spotted by the band’s tour manager and swept inside, on\norders from Mr. Murphy.“The way Stephen Sondheim is Mr. New York for a general\naudience, James Murphy is Mr. New York for a very niche audience,” said Kat\nRyals, 28, an artist, and Brooklyn transplant from Nashville.In the five years\nthat LCD was on hiatus, its bandmates branched out into other projects and\nmanaged DFA Records, its label. Mr. Murphy, 46, an in-demand producer and\nD.J., also dabbled: he cooked; he created a craft coffee line; opened a wine\nbar; and promoted his long-held vision of making the subway turnstiles play a\ntune.But Mr. Murphy said he was overflowing with song ideas and missed his\nband, and besides, he’s keyed into the pleasures of supply and demand. “If we\ndo it again, I’m going to freak out,” he sang. “So do it again.”Even for the\nencore, there was no pretense of coyness. “Whether you clap or not, we’re\ngoing to come back,” he teased. And they did, to do two of their most beloved\nsongs, “Dance Yrself Clean” and “All My Friends.”“Minus the technical\ndifficulties, it was everything I wanted it to be and more,” Chase Dominick,\n28, a TV producer, said after the show. He discovered the band only after it\ndisappeared, and had gotten in to the gig through a roommate who works at the\nFour Horsemen, Mr. Murphy’s wine bar. “I’m really glad they’re back,” he said.\n“We need them.”In gritty-turned-glossy Williamsburg, where Mr. Dominick lives,\n“they’re folk heroes,” he explained, reminders of what the scene was about:\n“not giving all the right damns.”\n\n","title":"LCD Soundsystem, Split Up in 2011, Joins the Reunion Circuit - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesarts: Tickets to LCD Soundsystem's reunion gigs were awarded via lottery, connections and luck https://t.co/Ag9rGFy9aO https://t…","date":"Tue Mar 29 03:31:05 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714656096095444994"},"retweets":43},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PBIAQg"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014e5"},"content":"WASHINGTON — President Obama delivered a forceful critique on Monday of\npoliticians and the journalists who cover them, lamenting the circuslike\natmosphere of the presidential campaign and declaring, “A job well done is\nabout more than just handing someone a microphone.”Speaking at a journalism\nprize ceremony in honor of Robin Toner, a longtime political reporter for The\nNew York Times who died in 2008, Mr. Obama said the 2016 campaign had become\n“entirely untethered to reason and facts and analysis,” a coarse spectacle\nthat he said was tarnishing the “American brand” around the world.“I was going\nto call it a carnival atmosphere,” the president said, “but that implies\nfun.”“The No. 1 question I’m getting as I travel around the world or talk to\nworld leaders right now is, ‘What is happening in America about our politics?’\n” Mr. Obama continued. “They care about America, the most powerful nation on\nearth, functioning effectively and its government being able to make sound\ndecisions.”Mr. Obama’s references to Donald J. Trump, the New York real estate\ndeveloper turned Republican front-runner, were unmistakable in his criticism\nof “divisive and often vulgar rhetoric,” frequently aimed at women and at\nethnic and racial minorities. But he also turned his fire on the news media,\nsaying it had given an uncritical platform to those pronouncements, in part\nbecause of relentless economic pressures that have changed the way news\norganizations operate.The president suggested that the news media had not done\nenough to question the promises made by politicians — an apparent reference\nnot only to Mr. Trump, but also to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the\nindependent who is challenging Hillary Clinton, Mr. Obama’s former secretary\nof state, for the Democratic nomination. Mr. Sanders has promised free public\ncollege education and national health care coverage, ambitious social programs\nthat critics say could never be enacted.“When people put their faith into\nsomeone who can’t possibly deliver his or her own promises,” Mr. Obama said,\n“that only breeds more cynicism.”The president denounced what he called the\npractice of drawing “false equivalences” between competing claims made by\npoliticians. “If I say the world is round and someone else says it’s flat,\nthat’s worth reporting,” Mr. Obama said. “But you might also want to report on\na bunch of scientific evidence that seems to support the notion that the world\nis round.”Addressing an audience that included newspaper proprietors in\naddition to editors and reporters, the president said that despite their\nshrinking newsrooms and profit margins, they needed to plow money into\ninvestigative journalism. He warned them to avoid the ephemeral blandishments\nof the digital age — “slapdash” Twitter posts that disappear from iPhone\nscreens within seconds — in favor of in-depth coverage of the issues.“Just\nbecause something is substantive doesn’t mean it is not interesting,” Mr.\nObama said.The president invoked the legacy of Ms. Toner, saying she had not\nshied from delving into the complexities of health care reform or the\nintricacies of the tax code. Nor did she shrink from asking tough questions of\nMr. Obama when he was a young senator starting his aspirational bid for the\npresidency. “She cast a critical eye from the very beginning,” he said.Mr.\nObama has discussed the coarse tone of the campaign before, as well as the\neconomic realities of the corporate media world. But rarely has he spoken with\nsuch passion about what he views as the unmet promise of the news media. He\nspoke nostalgically about returning to his house in Chicago to sift through\nstacks of old newspapers, left on his desk, from the months before he was\nelected president.“The curating function has diminished in this smartphone\nage,” he said.Mr. Obama acknowledged that his relationship with the news media\nhad not been unruffled during his years in the White House, but he suggested\nthat he followed daily news coverage closely, saying, “You should not\nunderestimate the number of times I’ve read something that you did and called\nsomebody up and said, ‘What’s going on here?’ ”The president singled out\nJeffrey Goldberg, the national correspondent for The Atlantic magazine, for a\nlengthy article he wrote on Mr. Obama’s foreign policy that caused ripples\naround the world. Mr. Obama made clear the quotes attributed to him were\naccurate (they included blunt criticism of American allies like Saudi Arabia\nand Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain).The article, Mr. Obama said, had\ncome up in a conversation he had with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.\nMr. Putin, evidently, was surprised by the candid tone of his comments.“Unlike\nyou, Vladimir, I don’t get to edit the piece before it’s published,” Mr. Obama\nsaid with a grin.\n\n","title":"Obama Urges Journalists to Cover the Substance of the Campaign - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Obama Urges Journalists to Cover the Substance of the Campaign https://t.co/ZP1Cy6J708","date":"Tue Mar 29 03:27:12 +0000 2016","favs":341,"id":{"$numberLong":"714655116285067264"},"retweets":217},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22JdumE"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014e6"},"content":"A dream of science fiction, which is how Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg describes\nvirtual reality, is about to come true.Oculus, the virtual reality company\nthat Facebook acquired for $2 billion two years ago, released its much-hyped\nOculus Rift system on Monday. With a headset, camera and game controller, the\nsystem, which costs $1,500 when bundled with a powerful computer, is the first\nvirtual reality product of its kind to reach consumers, before similar ones\ncoming this year from HTC and Sony.“People who try it say it’s different from\nanything they’ve ever experienced in their lives,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote in a\nFacebook post when he announced the Oculus acquisition. “But this is just the\nstart. Imagine enjoying a courtside seat at a game, studying in a classroom of\nstudents and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-\nface — just by putting on goggles in your home.”Over the last week, I tested\nthe Rift and many pieces of content for the system to see how true Mr.\nZuckerberg’s words might ring. I can report that while the Rift is a well-\nbuilt hardware system brimming with potential, the first wave of apps and\ngames available for it narrows the device’s likely users to hard-core gamers.\nIt is also rougher to set up and get accustomed to than products like\nsmartphones and tablets.Here’s a tour through my early experiences of the\nRift:The Rift works with technology that some might find anachronistic: a\nWindows PC, monitor, keyboard and mouse. With many people shifting away from\ndesktop computers toward laptops, tablets and smartphones, finding a place to\ninstall the Rift and those other components may be a challenge. In my modest\nSan Francisco apartment, I set up the system in the living room next to my\ntelevision set. What an eyesore.On first use, the Rift felt sturdy and well\nmade. The adjustable straps made it easy to fit around my head, and the built-\nin headphones create deep, high-quality sound. My main issue, which I suspect\nhad to do with my face shape, was that I could not adjust the headgear to\nblock out a small space right beneath my nose — I resorted to taping a piece\nof paper over it.Emil Rodriguez, an Oculus spokesman, said the headset is\ndesigned to take weight off the nose, which is why some people see a tiny\nspace at the bottom of the headset.Getting started with the device took about\nan hour. Oculus instructs you to run an app that walks you through the\nprocess, which includes plugging in the headset and camera, synchronizing an\nXbox controller and strapping on the headset.The biggest holdup was finding\nand downloading content through the Oculus app store. Many games are large\ndownloads of more than 6 gigabytes, so a game took up to half an hour to\ndownload.After the “install” button was clicked to enable Windows to finish\ninstalling a game, there was another hangup: I couldn’t run a game and\ndownload another one simultaneously. Instead, I had to quit whatever I was\ndoing in the Rift to download something new. That means it will take many\nhours to start a nice collection of Rift games.Gamers who play on PCs,\nPlayStation or Xbox are familiar with these more demanding setups. But those\nused to unwrapping, say, a smartphone, and getting started after a few taps\nmay find the Rift’s setup laborious.Mr. Rodriguez said only some apps needed\nto be installed using the computer mouse; most should be able to be installed\ndirectly through the headset. He said downloads were paused while apps were\nrunning on the Rift to avoid compromising performance.I stood alone in an\nempty room beside a ferocious dinosaur. A few seconds later, I was crowding\naround a campfire with a fox, a deer and a rabbit. Then I was perched atop a\nskyscraper, looking down.These are some of the environments that Oculus places\nyou in in a simulation it calls Dreamdeck, which serves as an introduction to\nvirtual reality. As in an incoherent dream you might have after consuming a\nbatch of special brownies, you jump from one disconnected scene to another.The\nDreamdeck app is symbolic of the state of content for the Rift. The first\nbatch of apps and games added up to a confusing, disjointed virtual reality\nlandscape. In my tests, my reaction was more often “Why would I want to be\nhere?” or “Why is this in virtual reality?” rather than “Wow.”One example was\nthe Rift’s most prominent game, EVE: Valkyrie, in which you take on the role\nof a spaceship pilot killed in battle. Since your consciousness was captured\nwhen you died, it gets injected into a new body for every fight. The game,\nwhich involves steering a spaceship and shooting guns and missiles at other\nonline players, was impressive and stimulating, and dying was appropriately\nstressful.But a reality in which you are a dead pilot enslaved to fight and\ndie over and over? Hard-core gamers may love this, but I prefer to be in a\nless depressing place when escaping from actual reality. Put me on a beach\nwhere I can look at whales.Another game, Adventure Time, based on the\nchildren’s cartoon of the same name, took place in a more lighthearted\natmosphere. It involved moving the protagonist, Finn, through a three-\ndimensional space, with the goal of jumping around through multiple levels in\npursuit of a bad guy, Magic Man, to break a curse. The game was cute and fun,\nbut it could easily have been played on a television set. The virtual reality\nheadgear didn’t provide clear benefits.A better use of the virtual reality\nheadgear was Farlands, a game that involved visiting foreign planets to gather\ninformation about alien creatures and plants by taking photos of them.\nStepping toward the Oculus camera moved me closer to an alien so I could\ntighten the frame of the photo. Looking at a place and pressing a button on\nthe game controller teleported me to that location.If you purchase the Rift,\nyou had better have thick skin. The aesthetic of the headgear — it looks like\na pair of black ski goggles with air traffic controller headphones built into\nthe sides — is not designed to get you a date. And since wearing the Rift\nmakes users less aware of the outside world, videos and photos of them donning\nthe contraption — and taken without their knowledge — may end up on Instagram\nor Facebook. I became a subject of ridicule when my partner was watching TV\nand I crouched in the middle of the living room while playing the dead space\npilot game.The Rift has other consequences for the mind and body. I felt\nmentally drained after 20-minute sessions. My eyes felt strained after half an\nhour, and over a week I developed a nervous eye twitch.Oculus recommends Rift\nowners ease into the headset: Use it a few minutes at a time initially, then\ngradually increase the amount of time. All Rift users should take short breaks\nafter every 30 minutes of use, the company said.The headset may also leave\nlasting impressions, or what I call “nerd paint,” on your face. After a long\nsession, the Rift left two sets of parallel horizontal lines under my eyes.The\nRift’s graphics, sound and head tracking, which is the device’s ability to\nfollow where the viewer looks, do feel like something out of science fiction.\nWhile the system’s setup is somewhat complex, the smoothness of the graphics\nand the high-quality design of the headgear make virtual reality feel ready\nfor prime time.And yet there may be a higher reward for those who wait to buy\nthe Rift.For one, Oculus has delayed the release of its motion-based\ncontrollers, called Touch, until later this year. In my experience, the motion\ncontrollers felt much more natural to use in virtual reality applications than\na game controller.It would also be wise to see what games become available\nwhen PlayStation VR, Sony’s virtual reality headset that connects to a\nPlayStation, arrives in October. Analysts say PlayStation VR has an edge\npartly because of its lower cost — about $800 when combined with accessories\nand a PlayStation 4, or nearly half the price of a full Rift system.When it\ncomes down to it, I don’t disagree with Mr. Zuckerberg that this is just the\nbeginning of virtual reality. With about 30 games and a few apps available at\nRift’s introduction, there isn’t much to do with the system yet. Oculus will\neventually need a larger, more diverse set of content to transcend its initial\naudience of gamer geeks.I, for one, will be waiting.\n\n","title":"Oculus Rift Review: A Clunky Portal to a Promising Virtual Reality - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"We tested the Oculus Rift.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014e7"},"content":"The N.H.L.’s top officials have privately acknowledged that fighting could\nlead to concussions and long-term health problems, including depression, and\nthat so-called enforcers frequently use pills “to ease the pain,” according to\nemails unsealed during a continuing court battle with former players.The\nexchanges, mostly between Commissioner Gary Bettman and his top lieutenants in\n2011, contradict what the league has said publicly and what it has argued in\ndefending itself from a class-action lawsuit brought by dozens of former\nplayers over the effects of concussions.After three N.H.L. enforcers died\nbetween May and August 2011 — all either by suicide or accidentally while\nstruggling with personal problems — league officials contemplated in a series\nof emails whether to eliminate fighting from the league.“An interesting\nquestion is whether being an NHL fighter does this to you (I don’t believe so)\nor whether a certain type of person (who wouldn’t otherwise be skilled enough\nto be an NHL player) gravitates to this job (I believe more likely),” Bettman\nwrote in an email on Sept. 3, 2011.The email was sent to Deputy Commissioner\nBill Daly and to Brendan Shanahan, then the league’s senior vice president for\nplayer safety and hockey operations. Shanahan, now president of the Toronto\nMaple Leafs, started the email chain by sharing a link to an article in the\nnewspaper The Globe and Mail of Toronto, with the headline “Getting Rid of\nHockey’s Goons.”“I tend to think its a little bit of both,” Daly replied to\nthe others. “Fighting raises the incidence of head injuries/concussions, which\nraises the incidence of depression onset, which raises the incidence of\npersonal tragedies.”A few minutes later, Bettman responded.“I believe the\nfighting and possible concussions could aggravate a condition,” Bettman wrote.\n“But if you think about the tragedies there were probably certain\npredispositions.”The “tragedies” were the deaths of Derek Boogaard, Rick\nRypien and Wade Belak. Boogaard, then with the Rangers, died of an accidental\noverdose of prescription painkillers and alcohol at age 28. Rypien, 27, and\nBelak, 35 and recently retired, both reportedly committed suicide.The\nunsealing of the emails and their substance was reported earlier Monday by the\nCanadian sports network TSN. The New York Times obtained the files from\nlawyers for the former players.In the emails, Bettman added that the “bigger\nissue” was whether the N.H.L. Players’ Association “would consent to in effect\neliminate a certain type of ‘role’ and player. And, if they don’t, we might\ntry to do it anyway and take the ‘fight’ (pun intended).”The N.H.L. did not\ntake action on eliminating fighting from the game, but the number of fights\nhas dropped in recent years. This season, according to Hockeyfights.com, which\ntracks fighting in the N.H.L. and other leagues, there have been 317 fights in\nthe N.H.L., down from 645 in 2010-11.Hockey has a history of permitting\nplayers to stop the game to fight, usually costing the players time in the\npenalty box, that dates back more than 100 years.The N.H.L. is fighting a\nclass-action lawsuit brought by former players in United States District Court\nin Minneapolis. Plaintiffs argue that the N.H.L. failed to warn them of the\nshort- and long-term effects of concussions. The N.H.L. has argued that there\nis no link between hockey and brain damage, including the degenerative brain\ndisease chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., which has been found in\nseveral dead players, including Boogaard.As part of the litigation, lawyers\nfor the players argued that emails between N.H.L. officials should be\nunsealed. The league has fought the motions. But the emails about fighting\nfrom September 2011 were among those that were unsealed by Judge Susan Richard\nNelson.“The documents speak for themselves,” Charles Zimmerman, a lead lawyer\nfor the players, said in an email on Monday. “We do believe the N.H.L. should\nlead on player safety and health issues. Fighting and concussions and head\nhits, we all know, cause cumulative and progressive cognitive harm. We want\nthese risks and tragedies to be minimized and cared for by the N.H.L. when and\nif they harm the players who made the sport great.”An N.H.L. spokesman did not\nrespond to an email request for comment.The emails that were unsealed included\nsome from 2014 in which Gary Meagher, the N.H.L.’s vice president for\ncommunications, wrote that the league had taken a different stance toward\nsafety from that of the N.F.L., which “is in the business of selling that they\nare making the game of football safer at all levels — it is smoke and mirrors\nbut they are masters of smoke and mirrors.”“The N.H.L. has never been in the\nbusiness of trying to make the game safer at all levels and we have never\ntried to sell the fact that this is who we are,” Meagher added.But the most\nprovocative communication string in the latest set of released emails came\nfrom those between Bettman, Daly and Shanahan, who wrote that the present-day\nenforcers were, in some ways, different from those of a generation ago — but\nalso much the same.“This is not the same role as it was in the 80’s and 90’s,”\nShanahan wrote. “Fighters used to aspire to become regular players. Train and\npractice to move from 4th line to 3rd. Now they train and practice becoming\nmore fearsome fighters. They used to take alcohol and cocaine to cope.\n(Kordic) Now they take pills. Pills to sleep. Pills to wake up. Pills to ease\nthe pain. Pills to amp up. Getting them online.”Boogaard, for example,\nobtained painkillers and other prescription drugs easily from team doctors and\nsources on the street, and he died of an overdose while under the care of the\nleague’s substance-abuse program. He was posthumously found to have C.T.E. The\nN.H.L. is also fighting a wrongful-death lawsuit filed by his family.\n\n","title":"In Emails, N.H.L.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014e8"},"content":"NEW ORLEANS — One of the benefits when people think that you are dead is that\nyou do not have to attend social occasions. This is how Arthur Kern sees it,\nthough he has been so detached from local art circles for so long that he was\nunaware that some of his former colleagues had assumed the worst.But since his\nretirement as a Tulane University art professor in 1996 — and for many years\nbefore that — the reclusive Mr. Kern has been working quietly in his basement\nstudio, sculpting exquisitely grotesque bodies and surreal horses out of\nfiberglass, filling up his shelves and mantels and a large homemade storage\nshed in the backyard. Few were aware he was working at all. With the exception\nof a small show in Lafayette, La., in 2005, Mr. Kern, 84, has not put his work\non display for decades.That changed on March 19, when “Arthur Kern: The\nSurreal World of a Reclusive Sculptor,” a major retrospective of his work,\nbegan at the Ogden Museum of Southern Art here in New Orleans, his first solo\nshow since the 1970s. The exhibition, which runs through July 17, is being\ncurated by John Berendt, the author of “Midnight in the Garden of Good and\nEvil” and a part-time New Orleans resident.“What I loved about it was not just\nthe sculpture but the sculptor himself,” said Mr. Berendt, who encouraged Mr.\nKern to consider an exhibition after he heard about his work from a friend who\nhad heard about it from one of Mr. Kern’s cousins.Mr. Kern, who had already\nbeen mulling what to do with his life’s work, agreed. Sort of.“I wasn’t sure I\nreally wanted a show,” he said in an interview at his modest but sculpture-\nfilled house. “I’m still not, to tell you the truth.”If this all came about\nsomewhat unintentionally, so did much of Mr. Kern’s artistic career. He grew\nup in New Orleans, drawing and painting seriously but not exactly consumed\nwith ambition, at one point during an interview comparing the urge to create\nart to having a disease.“I was not all that gung-ho about being an artist,”\nsaid Mr. Kern, a slight and soft-spoken man with a gray thumbprint of a\nmustache. “It just happened to be something I did all the time.”In the late\n1950s, after a couple of years of military service, he went to work as a\ndesigner at a flooring company in Pennsylvania. He was good at it, and he\ndryly joked that other artists would envy how widely his work had been seen,\nthough it had mainly been viewed beneath shoes in elevators and office\nbuildings.Still, it was here where Mr. Kern was introduced to epoxies that\nwere left as samples by traveling salesmen. He began using epoxy to add\ntexture to his artwork — later turning to polyester resin, which is cheaper\nand, as it goes into boat building, easy to find. During his years in the\nflooring business, Mr. Kern never stopped painting, displaying his work in\nsolo and group shows, including as part of a 1962 group exhibition at the\nMuseum of Modern Art.But after he left Pennsylvania to teach art at the\nUniversity of Louisiana at Lafayette in the late 1960s, Mr. Kern destroyed\nvirtually all of his paintings and drawings. Though he would teach painting\nfor the next three decades, he devoted his private time exclusively to\nsculpture.Most of his work is still molded out of polyester resin in a process\nsimilar to old-fashioned bronze casting. All of the sculptures feature either\nhumans or horses.“He’s chosen forms that go back to the early cave paintings,”\nsaid Bradley Sumrall, the chief curator for the Ogden Museum, who compared Mr.\nKern’s work to pieces ranging from ancient Chinese statuary to Luis Jimenez\nsculptures to steampunk art.“We went wild over it,” he continued, recalling\nhis first visit to Mr. Kern’s house. “As someone who’s worked in the art world\nfor 20 years, I was shocked that he’d never come up in conversation.”Some of\nthe works feature the human figure, often with some macabre distortion or a\nportion peeled away to expose an eerily lifelike eye underneath. A large room\nof the exhibition is dedicated to the horse sculptures, some life-size, some\npurse-size, all surreal variations on a small horse model he made in the early\n1970s because, he said, “one day I decided now I’m going to make a\nhorse.”Perhaps most striking are the strange contraptions that look like\nstanding spotlights, but in place of the bulbs, there are faces, distorted by\ntransparent but thick molded lenses. Depending on where you stand, the face\nbehind the lens looks different, just as you would look different to the face\ninside as you moved around to look at it. Though Mr. Kern is stubbornly\nresistant to interpretation, he eventually volunteers an idea about these.“I\ncan never get into somebody else’s brain or their experience,” he said. “We\nare all isolated in that sense in our own worlds.”It is fair to say that Mr.\nKern has been more isolated than most, having long ago decided that “divorcing\nmyself from everyday life would allow me to let things happen.” He did not\nshow and did not sell, except a piece here and there, and did not hire an\nassistant, preferring to work alone in his dark studio with his bizarre tools:\nreconfigured cheese graters, kitchen knives and dental instruments.Though Mr.\nKern is fine with the term hermit, it could be somewhat misleading; he may\nhave withdrawn from the art world, but he has a wife of 60 years, three\ndaughters and a friendly manner. He also has a cousin in town, who several\nmonths ago happened to have photographs of Mr. Kern’s work lying on her coffee\ntable, where they were spotted by her friend Dr. Brobson Lutz, a physician in\nNew Orleans with a keen appreciation for the uncommon.Dr. Lutz is a friend of\nMr. Berendt’s, and several days later, they were visiting Mr. Kern’s house.\nEager museum officials soon followed, and now Mr. Kern is having to decide how\nhe is going to make it through the next few weeks.“A lot of the things that\nare going on, and what will go on, are the very things I tried to escape from\nbefore,” he said, apparently referring to the interview he was giving at that\nvery moment. “I’m 84 years old and I have never given a talk about my work.”\n\n","title":"At 84, an Artist Tries Something New: Displaying His Work - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"At 84, an artist tries something new: displaying his work https://t.co/uw4nwGinGo https://t.co/BqPHmvNMah","date":"Tue Mar 29 02:36:03 +0000 2016","favs":374,"id":{"$numberLong":"714642247401254913"},"retweets":134},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1UXWK59"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014e9"},"content":"Donald Trump might use nuclear weapons to go after Islamic State terrorists.\nOr maybe not. In a recent spate of interviews, including with The Times, he\nwas unable or unwilling to clarify his disturbing views on this and other\ncritical national security issues, which sometimes shift from one minute to\nthe next.The recent horrific terrorist attacks around the world have provided\na new opportunity for Mr. Trump to fan fears and throw out his alarming\nprescriptions for dealing with the world’s most complex challenges. On\nWednesday, Mr. Trump was asked if he would use tactical nuclear weapons\nagainst the Islamic State. “I’m never going to rule anything out — I wouldn’t\nwant to say. Even if I wasn’t, I wouldn’t want to tell you that because at a\nminimum, I want them to think maybe we would use them,” he said on the\nBloomberg Politics program “With All Due Respect.”He was more measured in his\ncomments to The Times on Friday, saying nuclear weapons are “the biggest\nproblem the world has” and he would use such weapons only as “an absolute last\nstep.” Even if Mr. Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate,\ndoesn’t really believe that nuclear weapons should be used against a terrorist\ngroup, the fact that he has voiced it lends weight to this insane notion and\ncould make it easier for other nuclear-armed states to think about that\npossibility.The consequences of using a nuclear weapon in terms of lives lost,\nphysical destruction and cost to American moral standing would be devastating.\nThe United States and Russia have significantly reduced their nuclear\narsenals, and the threat that either would ever use the weapons has greatly\nreceded, in part because advanced conventional weapons can destroy almost any\nmilitary target. Equally bizarre was Mr. Trump’s casual attitude in endorsing\nthe idea of Japan and South Korea developing their own nuclear weapons, which\nwould reverse America’s longstanding efforts to prevent the number of nuclear-\narmed states from expanding.Mr. Trump also challenged decades of American\npolicy by calling NATO “obsolete.” Since the Cold War, the alliance has\nundergone reforms and remains the primary organization that can deal with\nmilitary threats. It is central to the stability of Europe, which is\nvulnerable to terrorist attacks, weak economies and the flood of refugees from\nthe Syrian war. With Russia’s aggressive movements in Ukraine and threats to\nthe Baltics, this is no time to suggest that Washington is rethinking its\nstrongest commitments to its allies. Although Mr. Trump said he doesn’t want\nto pull America out of NATO, he said it has to be changed so the United States\nbears less of the cost.Mr. Trump is confronting most of these issues for the\nfirst time, and many of his thoughts are contradictory and shockingly\nignorant. In speaking with The Times, for instance, he complained that one\nproblem with the Iran nuclear deal is that American businesses are now losing\nout to Europe on lucrative deals with Iran. He did not know that that is\nbecause Congress has insisted on keeping American sanctions in place.Mr. Trump\nclaims he is not an isolationist and wants to “make America great again.” It\nis hard to see how he achieves that when he describes a completely unhinged\nview of international engagement that denigrates Muslims and other foreigners\nand international organizations, including the United Nations. Mostly, his\nvision of cooperation with allies depends largely on how much they would pay\nthe United States for protection.In his interviews, Mr. Trump has said\n“unpredictability” is central to his thinking. He seems to have no inkling\nthat operating in a dangerous world — one in which the United States is\nmilitarily involved in many conflict zones — requires some ability to\ncommunicate intelligently and forthrightly with both allies and enemies. It\nalso seems to have escaped him that American voters deserve to know what a\ncandidate is actually proposing.\n\n","title":"Mr. Trump’s Dangerous Babble on Foreign Policy - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytopinion: Mr. Trump's dangerous babble on foreign policy is contradictory and shockingly ignorant. https://t.co/6Ov4OuguCN https://t.…","date":"Tue Mar 29 02:26:03 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714639729384361984"},"retweets":509},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1qcur7G"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014ea"},"content":"Ted Cruz was naming friends.Seated for an interview inside a stately Midtown\nManhattan library, just south of Trump Tower, the Texas senator leaned forward\nin his chair, ticking off the unlikely coalition drifting his way.There was\nJeb Bush, who announced his endorsement in a terse predawn news release, and\nMitt Romney, who initially said his support applied only to his voting\npreference in Utah.Mr. Cruz had swung Mike Lee, his greatest ally in the\nSenate, nearly a year after his campaign began, and Mark Levin, a conservative\nradio host who recently made his longstanding admiration on the airwaves\nofficial.“They are coming to us,” Mr. Cruz said. “We welcome their support\nwith open arms, but my positions, my policies have not changed.”Nor has Mr.\nCruz’s reputation, particularly.As Mr. Cruz seeks to unite the disparate\nfactions of the Republican Party that are bonded only by their dead-set\nopposition to Donald J. Trump, a high-wire act is required: welcoming the top\nranks of the same establishment he has spent years excoriating while not\nabandoning the hard-line conservatives who like him in part because of his\nattacks on party leaders.While the Romney and Bush endorsements drew\nheadlines, what has been just as striking is the sound of silence from the\nvast majority of Republican elected officials and leading donors. Nearly two\nweeks after Senator Marco Rubio dropped out of the race, there has been no\nmass rush to Mr. Cruz, even as he appears to be the last line of defense\nagainst a Trump nomination.The decision by so many leading Republicans to\nremain on the sidelines is all the more notable because it appears inversely\nproportional to the scale of concern about Mr. Trump. His recent attacks on\nMr. Cruz’s wife and soaring unpopularity among women, minorities and college-\neducated voters have left many in the party more convinced than ever that,\nwith Mr. Trump as their standard-bearer, they are churning toward a political\niceberg this fall.But this fear has not been enough to coax them in Mr. Cruz’s\ndirection.“They’re afraid of Trump’s voters and they hate Cruz,” explained\nSenator Lindsey Graham, who has tried to rally his colleagues behind Mr. Cruz.\n“But if I can swallow my pride, they can, too.”Part of Mr. Cruz’s challenge is\nthat Gov. John Kasich of Ohio remains in the race, providing cover for some\nRepublicans who cannot abide Mr. Trump but cannot bring themselves to support\nMr. Cruz.Mr. Graham said he intended to sound out Mr. Kasich’s supporters\nabout whether the governor may be willing to join forces with Mr. Cruz.“A\nCruz-Kasich ticket is the best way we can stop Trump,” he said. “It’s time to\nthink big here.”If they will not run together, said Mr. Graham, they at least\nneed to form “an alliance” in which they divvy up states to not drain votes\nfrom each other — something neither seems willing to do. “The main thing is\nwe’ve got to get into the convention with Trump under 1,237 delegates.”Yet\nother top Republican officials are not nearly as dedicated to plotting this or\nany strategy to deny Mr. Trump a majority before the party gathers in July in\nCleveland.Even those who have signaled they are likely to support Mr. Cruz are\ndragging their feet. Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, who has spoken favorably\nof Mr. Cruz, said he would not announce his choice until closer to his state’s\nApril 5 primary — for “maximum impact.”Mr. Rubio, who praised Mr. Cruz as “the\nonly conservative left in the race” after his exit, has been perhaps the most\nconspicuous holdout. He is one of the few Republican senators who gets along\nwell with Mr. Cruz, and the two have been in touch since Mr. Rubio withdrew\nfrom the race.But Mr. Rubio is likely to run again for president in 2020\nshould Republicans lose the White House this year, and, in making scores of\nthank-you calls to donors in recent days, he has been discouraged by some\nparty financiers from supporting Mr. Cruz, according to a Republican\nstrategist briefed on the calls.Without Mr. Rubio’s imprimatur, many of his\nbackers seem disinclined to back Mr. Cruz.Compounding the problem is Mr. Cruz\nhimself. He often portrays this election as akin to 1980, when Ronald Reagan\nwon in a landslide. But he appears to be privately grappling with whether he\nwould be better off playing the 1976 version of Reagan, who carried the banner\nof unadulterated conservatism against the eventual Republican nominee all the\nway to the convention, fell short and won four years later.Though Mr. Cruz has\nadjusted his public tone, calling for party harmony and appealing to “our\nbetter angels” in a moment of political discord, senior Republican officials\nsay Mr. Cruz has made little effort to repair relationships, particularly in\nthe Senate.Senator John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican senator and Mr.\nCruz’s fellow Texan, privately lobbied Mr. Cruz to attend a Senate Republican\nluncheon in the Capitol and soothe feelings, according to a Republican\nstrategist briefed on the request. But after a CNN report in which some\nRepublican senators suggested that Mr. Cruz apologize to the Senate majority\nleader, Mitch McConnell, whom Mr. Cruz called a liar on the Senate floor, Mr.\nCruz’s campaign became irritated and backed off a peacemaking lunch.Mr. Cruz\nand Mr. McConnell have still not spoken, according to an aide to Mr.\nMcConnell.“I’m not sure there’s anything to apologize for,” Jason Johnson, Mr.\nCruz’s chief strategist, told reporters recently.Mr. Cruz’s allies argue his\nreticence to publicly embrace the establishment is understandable given the\nsuccess of Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz and the fact that Mr. Cruz’s political brand\nis premised on anti-Washington fervor and conservative purity. But even\nRepublican senators in states that have yet to vote and should favor Mr. Cruz\n— such as Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska — have not received overtures,\naccording to aides.When party leaders, including Mr. Lee, the Utah senator,\nlobbied for a so-called “unity ticket” that would make Mr. Rubio the\npresumptive running mate for Mr. Cruz, the Cruz campaign demurred.“We don’t\nreally talk to that many Beltway people,” said Jeff Roe, Mr. Cruz’s Houston-\nbased campaign manager, when told the idea of a Cruz-Rubio ticket was setting\n“the Beltway” ablaze.What could rouse the establishment, and convince leaders\nthat Mr. Trump can be stopped at a convention, is a strong Cruz victory next\nweek in Wisconsin.“If he can pull out Wisconsin, I think Cruz draws more\ninterest,” said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a longtime Republican\nstrategist.For now, though, Mr. Cole said most in the establishment wing of\nthe party saw little upside in boosting someone they have little regard for,\ndo not think can win a general election and whose prospects they think will be\nhelped little by their endorsement.“Why stick your name and your neck out\nthere when you don’t think it will make much of a difference?” Mr. Cole\nsaid.In the interview, Mr. Cruz noted he has been nothing if not\nconsistent.“With me,” he said, “you know what you’re going to get.”\n\n","title":"Ted Cruz Names Friends, but Silence From G.O.P.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014eb"},"content":"A 39-year-old Wall Street executive, Andrew Caspersen came from a life of\nprivilege and opportunity: Groton, Princeton and then Harvard Law School,\nwhere the student center is named after his family because of a generous gift\nfrom his father.But the father had a secret that emerged only after he\ncommitted suicide in 2009: Finn M.W. Caspersen, a noted financier and\nphilanthropist, was at the time being investigated by federal authorities,\nsuspected of hiding tens of millions of dollars in a tax shelter.Now it\nappears that his son, a former Blackstone Group managing principal, may have\nhad his own secret.Andrew Caspersen was arrested at La Guardia Airport on\nSaturday evening. On Monday, federal prosecutors working for Preet Bharara,\nthe United States attorney for Manhattan, charged him in a criminal complaint\nwith securities and wire fraud in what they called a “brazen” scheme to\ndefraud investors — including a foundation affiliated with a major New York\nhedge fund — of up to $95 million.The Securities and Exchange Commission filed\nparallel civil charges.The authorities contend the executive used a fraudulent\ninvestment vehicle and fake emails to dupe the unidentified hedge fund\nfoundation to sink $25 million into the scheme last fall.Up until last week,\nMr. Caspersen was still trying to persuade other institutional investors to\ngive him money.So persuasive was his pitch that an employee at the hedge fund\nfirm also invested $400,000 with Mr. Caspersen, who lives with his wife in a\nhome they recently bought in Bronxville, N.Y.But the authorities said that he\nblew through most of that money “as a result of aggressive options trading” in\nhis personal brokerage account.Daniel Levy, Mr. Caspersen’s lawyer, declined\nto comment.Mr. Caspersen was a partner at the Park Hill Group, which\nspecializes in raising money for private equity firms and hedge funds. The\nManhattan firm fired Mr. Caspersen on Monday and promptly removed his profile\nfrom its website.Until last fall, Park Hill was part of the sprawling empire\nof the private equity giant the Blackstone Group. It is now part of PJT\nPartners, the advisory firm that was spun out of Blackstone and is run by the\ninvestment banker Paul J. Taubman. PJT said in statement that it was “stunned\nand outraged” to learn of the allegations. The firm added that it was\ncooperating with the authorities.The case highlights the broader issue of how\nmuch research and checking institutional investors actually do when making an\ninvestment, and how much of it comes down to a personal connection and\ntrust.“This action amply demonstrates that even sophisticated institutional\ninvestors are not immune to financial scams,” said Andrew M. Calamari,\ndirector of the New York office of the Securities and Exchange Commission,\nwhich brought a civil complaint against Mr. Caspersen.It may also raise\nquestions about the internal controls in place at Park Hill, given that the\nauthorities say Mr. Caspersen’s scheme went on for months before it was\ndetected.Shares of PJT Partners plunged nearly 11 percent on the news of the\ncharges. Late Monday, Block \u0026amp; Leviton, the securities litigation firm,\nsaid it was investigating whether PJT and its officers and directors violated\nfederal securities laws. The firm represents large institutional investors.PJT\nsaid it believed Mr. Caspersen acted on his own. After learning of potential\nimproper behavior, the firm conducted an internal investigation and reported\nthe matter to federal prosecutors in Manhattan.Mr. Caspersen grew up mainly in\nan exclusive suburb in western New Jersey before attending the Groton School\nin Massachusetts, one of the most expensive boarding schools in the country.\nHe was a captain of the football team and he also rowed.After graduating from\nGroton in 1995, he went to Princeton University where he met Catherine F.\nMacRae, who was the daughter of a founding partner of the law firm LeBoeuf,\nLamb, Greene \u0026amp; MacRae, which later merged to form Dewey \u0026amp; LeBoeuf. The\ntwo dated for several years.Ms. MacRae, a research analyst at Fred Alger\nManagement, was killed on Sept. 11, 2001, when terrorists crashed two planes\ninto the World Trade Center. She had worked in Fred Alger’s offices on the\n93rd floor of the north tower.Together with Ms. MacRae’s family, Mr. Caspersen\ncreated a memorial fund to benefit education programs for children from low-\nincome families.Mr. Caspersen’s father, Finn M.W. Caspersen, was a prominent\nphilanthropist and the heir to the Beneficial Corporation fortune. The elder\nMr. Caspersen was chairman and chief executive of the consumer finance company\nfor nearly two decades before selling the firm in 1998 for $8.6 billion to\nHousehold International, which was later acquired by the London-based bank\nHSBC.In 2008, Finn Caspersen pledged $30 million to Harvard Law. A year later,\nhe killed himself at age 67 with a single gunshot to the head. About 800\npeople attended his funeral in Morristown, N.J.Mr. Caspersen was known to be\nbattling kidney cancer when he killed himself. But soon after it emerged that\nhis name had surfaced in a federal government crackdown on overseas banks that\nwere helping wealthy Americans shelter money to avoid paying taxes.Finn\nCaspersen was an active supporter of New Jersey Republicans like former Gov.\nTom Kean. Mr. Caspersen was also well known in equestrian circles and was said\nto have competed with Prince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth, in\nWindsor, England.The scheme of the younger Mr. Caspersen, federal authorities\nsay, began last summer and ended only a few weeks ago. It is not clear why the\nexecutive, who arguably was successful and wealthy in his own right, may have\nneeded the money.Still, last summer Mr. Caspersen, who had previously lived on\nthe Upper East Side of Manhattan, set up a shell company called Irving Place\nIII SPV LLC that he soon began seeking to raise money for from institutional\ninvestors, the authorities said.The shell company was similar to the name of a\nlegitimate investment vehicle that Park Hill was raising money for at the time\ncalled Irving Place Capital Partners III SPV. Irving Place Capital was\noriginally a private equity fund of Bear Stearns, the Wall Street firm that\nimploded in 2008.Mr. Caspersen, who previously worked for Coller Capital, a\nfund that buys private equity fund assets, never told prospective investors\nthe shell company was controlled completely by him, the authorities said. Mr.\nCaspersen made up email accounts and invented employees and even went as far\nas to create a fake domain name to further the scheme, they said.The scheme\nbegan to fall apart this month when the foundation affiliated with the hedge\nfund asked for its $25 million plus interest to be returned, the authorities\nsaid. On March 11, Mr. Caspersen said the funds would be returned by the end\nof the month. The foundation has not yet received the money, the authorities\nsaid.A few days later, on March 14, Park Hill learned that Mr. Caspersen was\nraising money for his own investment vehicle when an unidentified firm\ncomplained about it. Park Hill then hired lawyers from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,\nWharton \u0026amp; Garrison, including litigation partner Aidan Synnott, to conduct\nan internal investigation. The law firm notified federal prosecutors of its\nfindings the next day.By March 18, authorities said the account where the\nhedge fund’s foundation had wired its $25 million had a balance of roughly\n$40,000.Mr. Caspersen was released on Monday after he posted a $5 million bond\nco-signed by three people and secured by two residences.\n\n","title":"Wall Street Scion Is Accused of Faking Investments - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"A former executive at a private equity firm has been charged with faking investments in a $95 million fraud https://t.co/D87tdr8nPa","date":"Tue Mar 29 01:58:24 +0000 2016","favs":157,"id":{"$numberLong":"714632769020772353"},"retweets":223},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1UqLz6f"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014ec"},"content":"MADISON, Wis. — Hillary Clinton seized on the struggle over the Supreme Court\nvacancy on Monday, issuing a scathing indictment of congressional Republicans\nand blaming their “extremist tactics” in opposing President Obama for Donald\nJ. Trump’s rise as the leading Republican candidate.“If you want to know where\nthat kind of obstructionism and recklessness leads, just look at the\nRepublican race for the presidency,” Mrs. Clinton said in a speech at the\nUniversity of Wisconsin here as she sought to capitalize on the tumult\nunfolding in the Republican primary. She also offered an impassioned plea in\nsupport of Mr. Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to replace\nJustice Antonin Scalia, who died in February.“They say a Trump nomination will\nset their party back decades. I agree,” Mrs. Clinton told the crowd. “But\nDonald Trump didn’t come out of nowhere.”She reminded the audience of Mr.\nTrump’s previous calls to see Mr. Obama’s birth certificate and of\ndeclarations by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, that\nthe Supreme Court vacancy should not be filled until after Mr. Obama leaves\noffice.“When you have a party dead set on demonizing the president,” Mrs.\nClinton said, “you may just end up with a candidate who says the president\nnever legally was the president at all. Enough is enough.”Mrs. Clinton has\noften expressed support for Mr. Obama’s policies, which can endear her to a\npresident who remains widely popular among Democrats.But extending that\nsupport to the Supreme Court vacancy also signals that she is looking beyond\nthe Democratic primary against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and is\nseeking to use the issue to appeal to independents and even moderate\nRepublicans who might be wary of a Trump administration.“As scary as it might\nbe, ask yourselves, what kind of justice will a President Trump appoint?” Mrs.\nClinton asked, to gasps from the audience.“As you know, he believes Muslims\nshould be banned from entering the country because of their faith,” she said.\n“What would that mean for a nation founded on religious freedom?” The struggle\nto replace Mr. Scalia has provided Mrs. Clinton with an opportunity to thrust\nthe Supreme Court to the top of voters’ concerns.In her speech on Monday, she\nnoted that two Supreme Court justices will be older than 80 when the new\npresident takes office, and she urged voters to “please make sure the court\nfactors into your decision.”“Whoever America elects this fall will help\ndetermine the future of the court for decades,” Mrs. Clinton said, listing a\nrange of issues — from voting rights and abortion, to immigration, climate\nchange and money in politics — that could reach the court in coming\nyears.Republicans, she said “are fighting hard to make sure the Supreme Court\nincludes as many right-wing justices as possible.”Fifty-three percent of\nAmericans say the Senate should hold a vote on Mr. Obama’s nominee, while 42\npercent said the Senate should wait until next year for the new president to\nnominate someone, according to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll. And\nwhile most voters have not yet formed an opinion about Mr. Garland, a vast\nmajority — 68 percent — said that who sits on the Supreme Court is at least\nvery important to them.A spokeswoman for Mr. Trump did not immediately return\nan email request for comment on Monday. But some conservatives quickly\nrebuffed Mrs. Clinton’s speech, accusing her of politicizing the court. “If\nHillary Clinton is criticizing you, you must be doing something right,” said\nAdam Brandon, the chief executive of FreedomWorks, an advocacy group aligned\nwith the Tea Party. “The Senate is performing its constitutional\nresponsibility” in delaying the process until a new president takes office.The\nissue is just the latest over which Mrs. Clinton has tried to portray Mr.\nTrump as dangerous. Last week, the day after the deadly terrorist attacks in\nBrussels, she took a break from fund-raising in Palo Alto, Calif., to deliver\na sharp rebuttal of Mr. Trump’s foreign policy prescriptions, saying that his\nproposals to rethink the United States involvement in NATO and to bar non-\nAmerican Muslims from entering the country would alienate allies and empower\nenemies.“Slogans aren’t a strategy. Loose cannons tend to misfire,” Mrs.\nClinton said on Wednesday. “What America needs is strong, smart, steady\nleadership to wage and win this struggle.”Hours after Mr. Scalia died last\nmonth, Mr. McConnell said he would not schedule hearings on a nominee until\nafter Mr. Obama left office, a proposal endorsed by Mr. Trump, who declared,\n“Delay, delay, delay.”Mrs. Clinton promptly called Mr. McConnell’s stance\n“totally out of step with our history and our constitutional principle.”But on\nMonday, she went further, accusing Mr. McConnell of undermining Mr. Obama and\nignoring the American people.“We chose a president. We chose him twice,” Mrs.\nClinton said. “And now Republicans in the Senate are acting like our votes\ndidn’t count and that President Obama is not, still, our nation’s leader.”The\nSupreme Court vacancy also gave Mrs. Clinton a chance to take aim at another\nadversary, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of\nthe Senate Judiciary Committee.Mr. Grassley has been one of the key\nRepublicans investigating Mrs. Clinton’s use of a private email server while\nshe was secretary of state and has focused on the “special government\nemployee” status of one of her closest aides, Huma Abedin, now the vice\nchairwoman of the Clinton campaign.“He says we should wait for a new president\nbecause, and I quote, ‘The American people shouldn’t be denied a voice,’ ”\nMrs. Clinton said of Mr. Grassley. “Well, as one of the more than 65 million\nAmericans who voted to re-elect President Obama, I’d say my voice is being\nignored right now.”\n\n","title":"Hillary Clinton Attacks G.O.P. for Not Acting on Obama’s Supreme Court Pick - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Hillary Clinton attacks GOP for not acting on Obama’s Supreme Court pick https://t.co/37WJV0PYih","date":"Tue Mar 29 01:36:04 +0000 2016","favs":291,"id":{"$numberLong":"714627152541515777"},"retweets":133},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1UYAIPD"}

I hadn’t\nbeen to a restaurant with cloth napkins since my younger daughter was born in\nJuly 2014.Upland, while beautiful and glittering, was a curious toddler’s\ndream and a parent’s nightmare. Wine glasses and giant jars of preserved\nlemons were stacked everywhere. When the hostess escorted us downstairs to the\nprivate room for lunch, I was only slightly disappointed when I realized that\nwe would not get the full dining experience. At least I wouldn’t spend the\nnext three hours whispering threateningly, “Please, do _not _touch.” (Nibble\nand Squeak usually rents out the entire restaurant.)The room was packed with\nstrollers and people — about 20 mothers and 20 children, most under 2 years,\nand a few fathers. I had expected the ladies-who-lunch crowd, but it was an\ninteresting mix of stay-at-home moms, new mothers on maternity leave and a few\nwho work full time but took the day off.Rebecca Vaccarelli, who works in\nalumni relations at the Juilliard School, was one of those who skipped work\nfor a day. She and her husband, Mike, an auditor with the General Services\nAdministration, attended with their 10-month-old son, Tony. Once avid\nrestaurantgoers, they had given up since becoming parents. “It was like, ‘Why\nbother reading the reviews anymore?’” Ms. Vaccarelli said.Nibble and Squeak\nprovided them the opportunity to eat at a restaurant they had been wanting to\ntry. And Tony, they learned, likes broccoli rabe with ’nduja.It wasn’t cheap.\nPrices vary per event; ours was $74 for each adult, with tips, drinks and the\nchildren’s meals included. (If I had dined alone upstairs, the tab would have\nrun about $50 to $60, including tip.)But the food was abundant: three courses\nserved family style. Thankfully, the menu wasn’t dumbed down; our dishes were\nsome of the same on the regular menu. Pasta, the perennial child’s favorite,\nmade an appearance, but in a form new to my daughter: pappardelle with spicy\nsausage ragù, kale and parmigiano. She loved it, but eschewed the skirt steak\nwith romesco (“too squishy on the inside”) and the smoked cod with spring\nonion soubise.Melissa Elders, mother to 16-month-old Serena, dreamed up Nibble\nand Squeak last July after she moved back to New York after 10 years in\nLondon. “I had experienced firsthand how difficult it was going to nicer\nrestaurants” with a young child, she said. “But I had also experienced that\nthe best way to make it less stressful was to have a support system of family\nmembers or other mothers with kids.”Since the service began in January, Ms.\nElders said, she has heard from people all over the world — Chicago,\nPhiladelphia, Amsterdam, Hong Kong — looking to host Nibble and Squeak events\nin their city. Nibble and Squeak’s first London event is on April 9.Throughout\nour three-hour meal, babies cried, mothers nursed, toddlers shrieked and farro\ngrains flew, but the atmosphere was surprisingly leisurely. There was no\nreason to be self-conscious about a crying-nursing-dancing child because\neveryone knew every other parent was in the same boat. Or would be in a few\nseconds. So we relaxed and ate.This is not fine dining as I once knew it, and\nthat’s O.K. That’s what date night is for. But my daughter got her first\nlesson in how to behave at a fancy restaurant. And I got to finish a delicious\nmeal while it was still warm, toddler in tow._Nibble and Squeak’s next events\nare April 20 at Luksus, in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and April 23 at Landmarc Time\nWarner Center; nibbleandsqueak.com._\n\n","title":"Let Them Make Noise: A ‘Dining Club’ Invites Toddlers - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Let them make noise: a new \"dining club\" invites toddlers https://t.co/7BotAVUQ9w","date":"Tue Mar 29 01:16:06 +0000 2016","favs":133,"id":{"$numberLong":"714622124070146049"},"retweets":44},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1XZisF3"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014ef"},"content":"It was about 9 p.m. on a recent Saturday, the first I had off in two months,\nand I was sipping an organic vodka and rosemary cocktail at a restaurant in\nFort Greene, Brooklyn.My cellphone rang. Bernie Sanders wanted to talk. He was\nworried that reporters were starting to conclude that he had no chance of\nwinning the Democratic presidential nomination.“I don’t want to disturb the\nmedia narrative too much,” he said wryly, with his unmistakable Brooklyn\ninflection. “But don’t write us off.”The Sanders campaign is unlike any other\nthis election cycle. The packed rallies of liberals, young people and union\nworkers; the anger at Wall Street; the indie rock anthems; and the kiwi slices\nconsumed aboard his campaign plane characterize a movement that feels both\nunexpected and yet perfectly aligned with this cultural moment.Covering Mr.\nSanders is at times like watching a man almost surprised by his success and\neager to make it last. And Mr. Sanders, a senator from Vermont who rarely\nattracted more than a handful of reporters on Capitol Hill, is now trying to\nconvince the news media that, despite his lagging delegate tally, his cause is\nnot lost.Unlike our colleagues, especially those who cover Hillary Clinton, we\nin the Sanders press corps rarely lack access to the candidate. Mr. Sanders\nholds midair and plane-side news conferences regularly, taking questions from\nas many as a dozen journalists. I went hiking with his campaign aides through\nthe Grand Canyon before the Arizona primary, and have chatted extensively with\nhis wife, Jane, who sometimes serves bags of trail mix to reporters on late-\nnight flights. Mr. Sanders learned early on how to pronounce my name, which\nnot everyone gets right. (It’s YAH-MEESH.)It may not surprise you to hear that\nMr. Sanders rarely strays from his message, even as reporters traveling with\nhim search for fresh angles amid his laments about “millionaires and\nbillionaires” and his promise of a “political revolution.” But he can be aware\nof the limits of his endless recitations.I remember talking with him in a\nsmall side room in January in Iowa as hundreds of supporters waited for him to\nspeak. As our conversation wrapped up, I asked Mr. Sanders how he would tailor\nhis message to voting blocs in the coming state primaries and caucuses.\nInstead of responding directly, he began repeating part of his stump speech,\nwhich I have now heard more than 90 times, explaining that the American middle\nclass is disappearing and that almost all of the new income is going to the\ntop 1 percent.When I repeated my question, he did something I didn’t expect:\nHe acknowledged that he hadn’t really answered me. And then gave me a direct\nresponse, saying that he would target groups, for instance, by focusing on\ncriminal justice reform with South Carolina’s large black population.Once, on\na flight to Minnesota, I questioned him for 15 minutes, pressing him about\nwhether he was in the race to bring attention to important issues, or to win.\nHe frowned at my questions, nibbling on wedges of cheese during most of the\ninterview, but he still answered gamely.The night of his big win in Michigan,\nhe was in Florida and we spoke by phone. “What’s the latest?” he asked, still\na bit unsure of victory as the votes were being counted. I told him Michigan\nseemed to be heading in his favor.There are ups and downs in Mr. Sanders’s\nmoods, of course. After the Michigan win, I rushed to Miami from New York and\nmet with him by the pool of his hotel, where his 4-year-old grandson played\nnearby. He was happy. I asked him a question, and then sensed he was reverting\nto the stump speech. When I redirected him, he smiled playfully: “O.K., O.K.,\nO.K.,” he said.But this month, as Mrs. Clinton was on her way to winning all\nfive of the states that were voting that day, from the Midwest to Florida, Mr.\nSanders delivered an hourlong speech to 7,200 people in Phoenix without\nmentioning any of those contests. Before reporters could question him, Mr.\nSanders walked offstage and straight to a car heading for Sedona.He can be\nstubborn. And I have seen him get snappish and sarcastic, most memorably when\nreporters questioned him on his plane about comments made by a supporter, the\nrapper Killer Mike, asserting that “a uterus does not qualify” a person to be\npresident. It was widely viewed as a cheap shot at Mrs. Clinton. “Anything\nelse to talk about?” he said after being questioned repeatedly by the\ncorrespondents aboard.Mr. Sanders, in speeches over the years, has railed\nagainst “the corporate media,” and has suggested that big news organizations\nignore issues that do not reflect their own economic interest.But in person,\nMr. Sanders, a former freelance journalist for The Vermont Freeman, an\nalternative weekly that flourished in the 1970s, is mainly unflagging in his\nefforts to get coverage.Last month, I reported that the filmmaker Spike Lee\nhad come out in support of Mr. Sanders, a significant development given Mr.\nLee’s high profile and the senator’s struggles to win over black voters.I\nwanted to get Mr. Lee on the phone. I emailed his production company and tried\nto track down his assistant or public relations people. No luck.Mr. Sanders,\nonce accustomed to being ignored, understood my plight. So he left a message\non Mr. Lee’s cellphone, asking him to call me.Mr. Lee has yet to call, and the\nDemocratic race has largely moved on from that moment. But Mr. Sanders is\nstill pushing ahead, winning states and making his case.\n\n","title":"Covering Bernie Sanders, as He Keeps His Spirited Campaign Alive - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"What it's like to cover Bernie Sanders as he keeps his spirited campaign alive https://t.co/nnDywVkGlB https://t.co/NEN9WdonMs","date":"Tue Mar 29 00:41:52 +0000 2016","favs":349,"id":{"$numberLong":"714613508852355074"},"retweets":151},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21PyQZK"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014f0"},"content":"PHOENIX — A protester was led off in handcuffs from the visitors’ gallery of\nthe Arizona Legislature on Monday amid a fractious debate over Primary Day\nlast week, when a drastic cutback in polling locations left tens of thousands\nof Arizonans unable to vote, forced to cast provisional ballots or made to\nwait in long lines for hours in the high heat.As the anger bubbled over within\na packed State Capitol, a sheepish election official blamed the chaos on poor\nplanning and a misguided attempt to save money by closing poll locations.“I\napologize profusely — I can’t go back and undo it,” said Helen Purcell, the\nMaricopa County recorder, during a hearing of the Arizona House Elections\nCommittee on Monday as more than 100 voters listened.Maricopa County, which is\nArizona’s most populous and includes the greater Phoenix area, had slashed the\nnumber of polling places by 70 percent from 2012.Ms. Purcell, a Republican\nholding the office since 1988, tried to offer explanations for what went wrong\nas the county reduced the number of polling places to 60 from 200 — one site\nfor roughly 21,500 voters — but the capacity crowd was having none of it.One\nman said, “Not good enough.” The audience cheered.More than 100 voters filled\nthree interconnected rooms, and more than 30 signed up to testify. Security\npersonnel stood on the sides, and at one point a handful of state troopers\nmoved inside, threatening to remove anyone who was disruptive.The hearing\nended in mid-session at 1:30 p.m. because committee members had to move to\nanother hearing to vote on a campaign finance bill. One of the members, Ken\nClark, a Democrat, urged audience members to follow them, and they did. A\nmasked man screamed from the gallery; troopers soon surrounded him and took\nhim outside in handcuffs, delaying the hearing’s start.Ms. Purcell had already\nsaid that her office would make new plans for November, presumably adding more\npolling sites.Meanwhile, Michelle Reagan, the Arizona secretary of state — who\ntold reporters before the hearing that she had known about the cutback in\npolling places, but had not wanted to “second-guess” the county’s decision —\nsaid she planned to hold four community meetings in the areas most affected by\nthe long lines, all but one in heavily Hispanic parts of the county.Election\nofficials said the location and number of polling places in Maricopa County\nhad been determined by informed assumptions, using turnout by mail and at the\npolls from 2008, when the state hosted its last contested primary.In the end,\nthe math did not hold up, foretelling some of the problems Arizona could face\nahead of the November elections. Fewer voters mailed in their ballots, more\npeople who had received ballots by mail showed up to vote in person and\nthousands of independents lined up to vote, unaware they were not allowed to\nparticipate in the state’s closed presidential primaries.Though small, the\ndiscrepancies were significant enough to overwhelm the polling sites, proving\nthat there just were not enough of them, Ms. Purcell said.“There’s also the\nfactor of money,” which was not going to be enough for a “full-blown\nelection,” she said. “So we had to downsize.”The changes that caused the havoc\nwere some of the first made in Arizona since the Supreme Court annulled a\nprovision of the Voting Rights Act requiring federal approval for\nmodifications in elections rules and requirements here and in 15 other\nstates.Voters in majority-minority South Phoenix, a working-class enclave,\nstood in line for several hours; the last ballot at South Mountain Community\nCenter, the area’s sole polling site, was cast at 12:12 a.m. on Wednesday,\nwell past the polls’ closing time. In North Scottsdale, one of the county’s\nmost affluent communities, waits were nowhere nearly as long.Some angry voters\ncalled for Ms. Purcell’s resignation and even for a recount.“Stop pretending\nyou represent us,” Patrick Seifter, 30, who lives in Central Phoenix, said at\nthe hearing, pointing at Ms. Purcell. “We don’t want platitudes — we want\naction and accountability.”The mayor of Phoenix, Greg Stanton, has sent a\nletter to the Justice Department seeking a federal investigation, a call\nechoed by many of the voters attending the hearing.One after another, they\nstood up to register their complaints at the hearing as the committee’s\nchairwoman, Representative Michelle Ugenti-Rita, a Republican, sometimes\nchided them, sometimes egged them on.“See how messed up this is?” she said at\none point.Danny Robinson, 61, spoke on behalf of his daughter, whom he said\ncould not vote because she ran out of time to wait in line — she had to go\nback to work.The Rev. Jarrett Maupin, a Baptist pastor, urged the congregants\nwho called him to “hold the line, hold the line,” he said, even if it meant\nwaiting well into the evening, as many of them did.“We delivered water, we\ndelivered fruits, we delivered granola bars and we delivered encouragement —\ndo not give up,” Mr. Maupin said. “Our right to vote is sacred and we have to\nkeep on fighting for it.”Krista Pacion, 39, gave up twice before finally\nshowing up ready for the long wait: She brought her 3-year-old daughter in a\nwagon loaded with water and snacks.“Whatever it took, I was going to vote that\nday,” Ms. Pacion said.\n\n","title":"Arizona Election Official Apologizes for Long Wait at Polls - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Arizona voting official apologizes for problems at polls during primary https://t.co/VxTM4MXRAd https://t.co/aGv9lPswfd","date":"Tue Mar 29 00:31:04 +0000 2016","favs":340,"id":{"$numberLong":"714610793489244161"},"retweets":187},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1RLTevn"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014f1"},"content":"If Kafka had lived in today’s New York, he might have recognized the nasty\nlittle tale of Nicholas Bowen and the wrongful warrant that would not go\naway.The story opens on a Wednesday night in November 2008. Mr. Bowen, an\nunemployed Brooklyn man in his early 50s, spent the evening at a friend’s\napartment in public housing in the Bronx. The next morning, he took his\nfriend’s son to school and then, as he walked back into the project, was\narrested on suspicion of trespassing.Though Mr. Bowen’s criminal citation was\neventually dismissed (on the condition that he not commit a crime for a year),\nState Supreme Court in the Bronx, for unknown reasons, issued a warrant for\nthe charge. Mr. Bowen claims he never knew about the warrant until almost\nthree months later when he received a call about it from the police. Shortly\nafter the call, he said, he went to court again, and on Feb. 11, 2009, a\nsecond judge determined that the warrant was erroneous and the matter was\ndismissed.“I thought it was over,” Mr. Bowen, now 58, said the other day. “But\nit just went on and on and on and on.”That, if you were counting, was four ons\n— one, as it turns out, for each of the arrests that the ostensibly excised\nwarrant led to over the next several years. The first occurred a few months\nafter Mr. Bowen’s February court date when, according to a police report, he\nwas riding his red Schwinn bicycle to a psychiatrist’s appointment and pulled\nup onto the sidewalk near Linden Boulevard and Euclid Avenue in Brooklyn. He\nwas stopped by the police, who asked for his identification. And when the\nofficers ran it through the system, they found the warrant.Mr. Bowen spent\nseveral days on Rikers Island before having a hearing about the warrant, and\nwhen he finally saw a judge, court papers say, he was summarily\nreleased.Months passed. Then, on Nov. 13, 2010, Mr. Bowen was stopped by the\npolice a second time. On this occasion, records show, he received a summons\nfor public drinking. Once again, an officer asked for his ID. Once again, Mr.\nBowen produced it. Once again, he was arrested on suspicion of evading the\nopen warrant. And once again, when he finally appeared in court, a judge\ndetermined that the warrant should never have been issued and had, at any\nrate, already been closed. The judge even gave Mr. Bowen an official document\nthat said the warrant had been dismissed. According to court records, the\njudge advised Mr. Bowen to show the piece of paper to the police if they tried\nto arrest him again over the warrant.Which is exactly what he did on Sept. 2,\n2012, when he was stopped by the police for a third time — for being at a\nplayground after dark. The earlier situations were repeated: Mr. Bowen was\nasked for his ID and the warrant was found in the system. But even when he\nproduced the judge’s letter, the police ignored it, court papers say. Mr.\nBowen was arrested and taken into custody overnight.“It was always the same,”\nhe said. “They’d ask for my ID. I’d show them my ID. Then off I’d go.”The\nfinal episode took place in July 2013 when Mr. Bowen and a girlfriend were\nriding home from Coney Island on the subway. It was a sweltering afternoon,\nthe air-conditioning in their car was out and Mr. Bowen, still recovering from\nrecent hernia surgery, was suffering from the heat. So he, his girlfriend and\nseveral other passengers, he said, walked between two cars while the train was\nin motion. The police were in the second car, he said, and saw them. According\nto a police report, Mr. Bowen was stopped, asked for his ID and taken into\ncustody over the warrant. But as he was being booked, he told the police that\nbecause of his surgery, he needed medication.So an officer took him to New\nYork Methodist Hospital where, court papers say, he was placed in shackles and\neventually fell asleep. When he woke up, the police ordered him to leave,\naccording to the lawsuit Mr. Bowen later filed. When Mr. Bowen said he had\nmore questions for a doctor, the police removed him from gurney and dragged\nhim, in handcuffs, more than 40 feet, the papers say.On the morning after the\nfracas, Judge Craig S. Walker of Criminal Court in Brooklyn looked into the\nwarrant, finding it erroneous, and Mr. Bowen’s exculpatory letter, finding it\nauthentic. Turning to the defendant, he said, “So hopefully, Mr. Bowen, this\nwill fully take care of it.”It did not, and with the warrant still pending,\nMr. Bowen sued New York City in federal court in Manhattan on Oct. 15, 2014,\nsaying that he had been repeatedly and wrongfully arrested. The case was moved\nto Brooklyn, and in March 2015, on his first appearance before Judge Lois\nBloom, the defendant-turned-plaintiff, acting as his own lawyer, laid out the\nstory.“I’m hoping to accomplish some justice,” he explained. When Judge Bloom\ntold Mr. Bowen that she would help him find a lawyer, he broke down in tears.\n“It’s just every time I go through this here,” he said, “I get upset.”The next\nmonth, at a second hearing, Judge Bloom became upset. “This is a case that\nreally needs attention,” she told a lawyer for the city. “That he has to carry\naround a paper from a judge saying that a warrant is a mistake should not be\nthe way any citizen has to live.”The city’s Law Department said in a statement\nlast week that the police removed the warrant from their system as soon as\nthey had been informed of the error. But that did not happen until last April,\nafter Mr. Bowen filed suit. City officials alerted Judge Bloom to the change\nwith a note bearing the prolix title: “Letter respectfully informing the court\nthat plaintiff’s open warrant has been removed from the Automated Database\nWarrant System.”Though Bowen v. the City of New York is only one man’s story,\nthe case happens to be moving through the courts as local law enforcement\ntries to reform the warrant system. The Police Department says there are now\nmore than one million open criminal warrants, some dating back to the 1980s.\nThis month, the city started an initiative to issue summonses to — rather than\narrest — offenders with warrants for quality-of-life crimes like littering,\nunreasonable noise and public urination. The Brooklyn district attorney’s\noffice has undertaken a similar effort called Begin Again, through which\ndefendants can close their pending warrants simply by showing up to\nacknowledge them.As for Nicholas Bowen, belated relief has been mixed with\nincredulity.“It’s a joke — the whole thing’s been a joke,” he said the other\nday with a disbelieving laugh. “I didn’t really think that it was happening,\nuntil it happened over and over again.”\n\n","title":"Cleared of a Crime but Hounded by a Warrant - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Years after his warrant had been dismissed, a Brooklyn man continued to get arrested over it https://t.co/dA2Ufps99s","date":"Mon Mar 28 23:31:03 +0000 2016","favs":98,"id":{"$numberLong":"714595687233622017"},"retweets":99},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1XYXDJO"}

She specialized in public procurement contracts.As part of her legal\neducation at the Université Catholique de Louvain, Ms. Visart participated in\na student exchange with Laval University in Quebec. “She was an intelligent\nstudent,” recalled Marc Verdussen, a scholar of constitutional law at\nUniversité Catholique de Louvain, in a tribute on Facebook. “She was all\nsmiles and bubbly enthusiasm.”Many Belgians got to know Ms. Visart — who was\nkilled in a suicide attack on March 22 at the Maelbeek subway station in\nBrussels — after her father, Michel, gave a moving interview to the public\nbroadcaster RTBF.“This is a pain, I think, that we cannot describe,” he said,\nwhile expressing empathy for the relatives of terrorism in Paris, Tunis and\nelsewhere.Mr. Visart recounted how he started to worry when his daughter’s\ncolleagues called him on the morning of the attacks, not having heard from\nher.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014f4"},"content":"Vladimir Nabokov once observed that “a writer should have the precision of a\npoet and the imagination of a scientist.” The geobiologist Hope Jahren\npossesses both in spades. Her engrossing new memoir, “Lab Girl,” is at once a\nthrilling account of her discovery of her vocation and a gifted teacher’s road\nmap to the secret lives of plants — a book that, at its best, does for botany\nwhat Oliver Sacks’s essays did for neurology, what Stephen Jay Gould’s\nwritings did for paleontology.Ms. Jahren, a professor of geobiology at the\nUniversity of Hawaii, conveys the utter strangeness of plants: these machines,\n“invented more than 400 million years ago,” that create sugar out of inorganic\nmatter — wondrous machines upon which human life itself depends.She describes\nthe sound of plants growing in the Midwest: “At its peak, sweet corn grows a\nwhole inch every single day, and as the layers of husk shift slightly to\naccommodate this expansion, you can hear it as a low continuous rustle if you\nstand inside the rows of a cornfield on a perfectly still August day.”She\ndescribes the miraculous ability of a cactus to sit, under a blazing desert\nsun, waiting years for rain: It sheds “its roots to prevent the parched soil\nfrom sucking all the water back out of it,” then begins to contract, until its\nspines “form a dense and dangerous fur protecting what is now a hard, rootless\nball of plant.”She explains why the leaves at the top of a tree are smaller\nthan those below, allowing “sunlight to be caught near the base whenever the\nwind blows and parts the upper branches.” And she explains why most forests\nhave natural boundaries: Centimeters outside their borders, “we find too\nlittle water, too little sun, too much wind or cold for just one more tree.”By\ncrosscutting between chapters about the life cycle of trees and flowers and\nother green things, and chapters about her own coming-of-age as a scientist,\nMs. Jahren underscores the similarities between humans and plants — tenacity,\ninventiveness, an ability to adapt — but, more emphatically, the radical\notherness of plants: their dependence on sunshine, their inability to move or\ntravel as we do, the redundancy and flexibility of their tissues (“a root can\nbecome a stem if need be, and vice versa”).Ms. Jahren’s own childhood in a\nsmall Minnesota town, where there was snow on the ground nine months of the\nyear and where most residents worked for a huge slaughterhouse, was filled\nwith silences. Her great-grandparents had arrived there from Norway, and she\nwrites that “vast emotional distances between the individual members of a\nScandinavian family are forged early and reinforced daily.” It was not unusual\nfor her and her brothers “to go days without anything to say to each\nother.”Her sanctuary was the laboratory of her father, who taught introductory\nphysics and earth science at a local community college. There she discovered\nthe rituals and magic of science: She embraced its rules and procedures and\nthe attention to detail it demanded. Science gave her what she needed: “a home\nas defined in the most literal sense, a safe place to be.”A workaholic who\nalso had manic-depression, Ms. Jahren chronicles her progress through college\nand graduate school and a succession of teaching jobs, conveying both the\nobsessive fervor she brought to her work and the often absurd hoops that\nresearch scientists must jump through to obtain even minimal financing for\ntheir work.She communicates the electric excitement of discovering something\nnew — something no one ever knew or definitively proved before — and the\nboring scientific grunt work involved in conducting studies and experiments:\nthe days and weeks and months of watching and waiting and gathering data, the\nall-nighters, the repetitions, the detours, both serendipitous and\nunfruitful.For more than two decades, her co-conspirator in these adventures\nhas been the steady, loyal and eccentric Bill Hagopian, her lab manager and\nalter ego. Together, the pair scour Salvation Army stores to find old camping\nequipment to use in their first lab, take students on some hilariously awful\nfield trips, burrow through rotting leaves in the Canadian Arctic, and trek\nthrough Ireland ( a place “so saturated with green that it is the things that\nare not green that catch one’s eye”), carefully gathering more than 1,000 moss\nsamples that will be cavalierly dumped in the garbage by an airport security\nofficer.Ms. Jahren writes about her single-minded dedication to her work — her\ndetermination to “_make_ my life into something” — and then suddenly falling\nin love, at 32, with another scientist named Clint Conrad, whom she will\nmarry.She speaks of the “great cosmic fire” that overtakes her during manic\nepisodes and her fears of navigating pregnancy without her usual medications.\nAnd she writes of her fears about balancing life and work, and the surprise of\nhaving “the truly valuable pieces” of her life “fall from the sky\nundeserved.”Along the way, she comes to realize that her work as a scientist\nis also part of a larger enterprise. She is not like a plant, but like an ant,\n“driven to find and carry single dead needles, one after the other, all the\nway across the forest and then add them one by one by one to a pile so massive\nthat I can only fully imagine one small corner of it.”As a scientist, she goes\non, she is indeed just an ant, “insufficient and anonymous, but stronger than\nI look and part of something that is much bigger than I am”: She is part of\nthe continuum of scientists who have each built upon their predecessors’ work\nand who will hand down their own advances to the next generation.\n\n","title":"Review: ‘Lab Girl,’ Hope Jahren’s Road Map to the Secret Life of Plants - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @michikokakutani: Lab Girl - a captivating memoir about a life in science \u0026amp; a teacher's guide to the secret lives of plants.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014f5"},"content":"Susan Sarandon hobbled into the restaurant in a cast boot and shiny Teamsters\njacket emblazoned with the name “Sue.” But Senator Cory Booker’s first\nquestion for the actress was about a tattoo that runs down her back. (“It’s my\nkids’ initials — and my granddaughter’s,” she replied.)When she returned the\nfavor, challenging him to show his tattoos, Mr. Booker unbuttoned precisely\none shirt button before admitting he didn’t have any. “I’m boring that way,”\nhe said.Ms. Sarandon, 69, had fractured her ankle while hiking in Colombia.\nBut the injury scarcely slowed her down, as befits a busy actress and perhaps\neven more prolific activist. Her film career spans more than 45 years and\nincludes “The Rocky Horror Picture Show,” “Bull Durham,” “Thelma \u0026amp; Louise”\nand “Dead Man Walking,” for which she won an Academy Award as best actress in\n1996, her fifth nomination. Her latest film, “The Meddler,” will be released\nnext month.Ms. Sarandon has also spoken out on a wide range of social,\nenvironmental and political causes, including hunger and homelessness,\nH.I.V./AIDS, sex trafficking, the death penalty and mass incarceration. She\nhas served as a Unicef Goodwill Ambassador since 1999.Mr. Booker, 46, has also\nbeen a longtime activist for social justice. After Stanford University, where\nhe played tight end on the football team, he was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship\nto Oxford University and earned a law degree from Yale in 1997. He moved to\nNewark, where he first worked as an advocate for low-income tenants.The\nfollowing year, Mr. Booker won a seat on the Newark City Council, and in 2006\nhe was elected to the first of two terms as mayor. In 2013 he won a special\nelection to fill the seat of Frank R. Lautenberg, who died in office, making\nMr. Booker the first African-American to represent New Jersey in the United\nStates Senate. He went on to win the regular election the next year.Famous for\nengaging his constituents and others on Twitter, Mr. Booker, a Democrat, has\nvowed to meet with all of his Republican colleagues in the Senate. His best-\nselling book, “United,” about finding common ground in a divided world, was\npublished last month.Over an early lunch at Il Cantinori in Manhattan, the\npair traded notes about what brought them both to genealogy television shows,\nthe forces that led them to activism (as well as acting and politics) and\ntheir thoughts about “political correctness” in this election year.**Philip\nGalanes:** Let’s start with your creation myths. In high school, Cory sets up\na whiteboard in his bedroom and writes his goals on it. That’s drive!\nMeanwhile, Susan gets her first film by accident, tagging along with her then-\nhusband to his audition. True?**Susan Sarandon:** That’s a legitimate\nexplanation of how I got into the business. I wasn’t interested in acting. But\nit was the ’60s. I was a seeker. And what acting depends on is imagination,\nwhich creates empathy and also leads to activism.**PG:** You weren’t being\ndemure, like Lana Turner, getting discovered at the lunch counter?**SS:** No.\nAnd it turned out that acting was a good approach to being in my life.**PG:**\nTell us about that whiteboard.**Cory Booker:** That whiteboard isn’t my origin\nstory. That’s like starting in the third act. My story starts with my dad, a\nblack boy born to a single mother in a small town in North Carolina. It starts\nwith my parents meeting in Washington, D.C., in the ’60s, at a time of\nincredible activism.**PG:** Fair enough. But why the whiteboard?**CB:** I\nwrote things down because I was a black kid from the first black family to\nlive in an all-white town [Harrington Park, N.J.]. My parents had to fight to\nlive there — literally, physical fights. And they were always pushing me to\ntake advantage of my blessings.**SS:** The whiteboard was his system. You were\nexternalizing something that some people would have said in prayers.**PG:**\nTell us one thing you wrote.**CB:** I wrote down the grades I wanted in every\nclass. My parents were obsessed with my education. And I knew that sports\nwould be my ticket to opportunity. Those were my two main goals in high\nschool.**PG:** Were your parents focused like that on you, Susan?**SS:** My\nparents had no idea what parenting was. I’m the oldest of nine kids. My mother\nwas raised in foster care in an orphanage. And my dad’s father died when he\nwas young, and his mother was crazy. So these two met and, thanks to Catholic\nindoctrination on birth control, started having all these kids. Everyone did\nwhere I grew up. And I had to take care of them.**CB:** My parents may have\ncrisscrossed the race lines, but there was so much unfinished business. My\nfather was not going to let me sit back and just consume my blessings. He\nwanted me to contribute, and to do that, you have to be mission\noriented.**PG:** Hence the whiteboard. Here’s a weird coincidence: You both\nappeared on TV genealogy shows, looking for a missing ancestor.**CB:** My\nfather and [maternal] grandfather both grew up not knowing who their fathers\nwere. It left a stigma on them. I can still remember my grandfather’s anguish\nwhen he confessed it to me — and the word he used, “bastard.” It turned out\nthat a white doctor had impregnated his mother when she was 14. That’s a\ncommon story in the twisted history of African-American families. Skip Gates\n[Henry Louis Gates Jr., the host of “Finding Your Roots” on PBS] explained to\nme that most African-Americans have some white blood in them. Same with white\nfolks. There was lots of mixing in those family trees.**SS:** And I had always\nbeen told that my grandmother, my mother’s mother, had been such a terrible\nparent that her kids were taken away from her and put into foster care. But it\nturned out that she was knocked up at 12 by my grandfather, who was in his 20s\nand lived next door. She pretended to be 15 so they could get married. Pretty\namazing, right? Then she disappeared and got connected with the mafia. She\nwent to the track in limousines, and jazz clubs, and dated Frank Sinatra. But\nnot a kind thought was given to the fact that she was just a kid.**PG:** It’s\na big moment in our relationship with our parents, when we see how deeply\naffected they were by their parents.**CB:** And it shows how connected we all\nare in ways we don’t understand.**PG:** Which brings me to the big similarity\nbetween you: seeing others with compassion, whether they’re film characters,\nlike prostitutes or death-row inmates, or citizens held down by generations of\npoverty.**SS:** We’re all afraid of the same things. We all need the same\nthings, too. I’m lucky to be in a business that’s almost forced compassion. I\nget to show you that you can identify with someone you never thought you’d be\nable to feel for. That’s what “Dead Man Walking” is about. We all make\nmistakes. But by connecting with the divine in each other, we can be\nredeemed.**CB:** And as I get more decades under my belt, I see how small acts\nof decency ripple in ways we could never imagine. How could the civil rights\nmarchers in Selma have predicted that by crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge,\nthey would trigger a bunch of lawyers in New Jersey to fight for fair housing\nfor black families — one of them being mine? That connectivity inspires me\nevery day. I take my job in the Senate very seriously. But there’s an old\nsaying: Change doesn’t come from Washington, it comes to Washington.**PG:**\nHave you always felt the need to speak up, no matter the cost?**SS:** Even as\na kid, I rotated my dolls’ dresses so every one got a chance to wear the good\none. I think it’s innate. Or maybe it’s about being the oldest kid in the\nfamily, the caretaker? But I suffer more from having an opportunity to speak\nup, and letting it pass, than I ever have from losing a role or being\nthreatened or having people say nasty stuff about me.**PG:** Were you ever\ntempted to take a high-priced job in a big law firm?**CB:** I reject the idea\nthat the guy who comes out of Yale and goes to work in the projects in Newark\nis good, and the guy who goes to work for a white-shoe law firm is bad. We’re\nall mountain rangers. We all have peaks and valleys. I know a lot of people\nwho work at nonprofits with men and women coming out of prison. But I also\nknow lawyers at major law firms who help tremendously through pro bono work.\nLet’s not judge. Let’s draw inspiration from each other’s stories — successes\nand failures — and realize we’re all connected.**SS:** I knew Sister Helen\n[Prejean] for about a year before Tim [Robbins] started working on “Dead Man\nWalking.” She didn’t come to the death penalty like Arnold Schwarzenegger in\nan action movie. She started by simply writing a letter to a man on death row.\nIt was a small act of kindness, nothing heroic.**PG:** That reminds me of the\ncharacter in your new movie, “The Meddler”: a “smother mother” whose little\nacts of kindness change her life after her daughter tells her to back\noff.**SS:** I have to admit, it’s completely self-serving. I do what I can to\nhelp, mostly by drawing attention to issues. But the people I see working in\nthe grass roots, for years and years, they’re the people who give me hope, who\nshow me the goodness in human beings.**PG:** Let’s shift to an issue you’re\nboth involved with: the mass incarceration of black men and boys. Cory wrote a\nmoving chapter in his book about disproportionate arrests and sentencing, and\nthe challenges of post-prison life. It’s a scary problem.**SS:** What are you\nafraid of? You’re a privileged white guy. You’ll get off.**CB:** That’s\nactually a good question. What are you afraid of?**PG:** The scale of the\nproblem: the number of inmates, the racial bias, the years in the\nmaking.**CB:** But mass incarceration has only been a problem since 1980.\nSince then, our prison population has grown about 800 percent, 500 percent at\nthe federal level. Before that, we expected our prison population to shrink.\nThis problem is the result of policies we made in our lifetime.**PG:** The\nharsh drug laws?**SS:** Not to mention privatizing prisons that let companies\nand lobbyists make money by rounding up a population without a voice.**CB:** I\ndon’t want people to think, “It’s such a huge problem, what can I do about\nit?” We can’t allow our inability to do everything undermine our determination\nto do something.**SS:** Well said.**CB:** In California, they’ve gotten rid of\n“three strikes and you’re out” laws that were giving people life sentences for\nminor crimes. And it’s saved California taxpayers millions of dollars. We have\nstates that have banned the death penalty. We can make big differences. We\njust can’t surrender to cynicism or feeling overwhelmed.**SS:** It’s amazing\nthat some of these guys, who made a mistake when they were 16, are getting out\nnow. They’re telling their stories in documentaries and articles. Boys who\nlearned to shave in prison. Because when you take a person and turn him into a\nconcept, be it “the incarcerated” or “the refugee” or whatever, you’re denying\nhis humanity. And that’s an act of violence. These are people, just like\nus.**PG:** Can we take a stab at “political correctness,” a popular topic\nlately? The idea that people feel inhibited from saying what they think\nbecause it’s not socially acceptable. Is it better to have the ugly thing out\nin the open?**SS:** Give me an example.**PG:** When I was in school, I was\nalmost relieved when someone called me a “fag.” I mean, I hated it, but I knew\nexactly where we stood.**SS:** But that’s just normalizing hatred.**PG:** But\nthe hatred is already there. It’s not going away because they’re not saying\nit.**SS:** Words are powerful. And whether we’re talking about kids in school\nor people running for president, slurs affect not only the person they’re\naimed at, but also the person saying them and the people who hear them. When\nyou had Trump being laughed at for making fun of people at rallies — and not\nbeing called on it for months — I blame our corporate media for a lot of that.\nIt should have been talked about.**CB:** There are always going to be people\nwith hateful words in their mouths, and worse. Between 20 and 30 transgender\nAmericans were killed last year for who they were. We had a church in South\nCarolina where someone walked in to kill black people specifically. But what\nconcerns me more are all the good people who sit silent in the face of what’s\ngoing on. We all have a choice. We can do nothing and accept things as they\nare, or we can stand up and take responsibility for changing them.**SS:**\n“Politically correct” is almost as good an expression as “right to life.”\nThere’s nothing political about hatred, and there’s nothing correct about it,\neither. We need to have a dialogue about where the hatred comes from.**CB:**\nTo me, being silent in the face of injustice is the greatest threat we\nhave.**PG:** O.K., last question: As you may know, Susan is the co-founder of\nSpin, a Ping-Pong club in New York City and elsewhere.**CB:** What?**SS:** You\nhave to come. It’s fun.**PG:** But in a matchup with Cory, without a cast on\nyour foot, would you beat him?**SS:** Probably not.**CB:** You sure?**SS:**\nMaybe if we drank some tequila first.\n\n","title":"When Washington Met Hollywood: At Lunch With Cory Booker and Susan Sarandon - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Cory Booker and Susan Sarandon discuss their childhoods, careers and activism https://t.co/q6rlPrp4T1 https://t.co/lOF4wZBqs2","date":"Mon Mar 28 21:46:07 +0000 2016","favs":433,"id":{"$numberLong":"714569282143854592"},"retweets":144},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1UXZ63I"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014f6"},"content":"WASHINGTON — The brothers who carried out suicide bombings in Brussels last\nweek had long, violent criminal records and had been regarded internationally\nas potential terrorists. But in San Bernardino, Calif., last year, one of the\nattackers was a county health inspector who lived a life of apparent suburban\nnormality.And then there are the dozens of other young American men and women\nwho have been arrested over the past year for trying to help the Islamic\nState. Their backgrounds are so diverse that they defy a single profile.What\nturns people toward violence — and whether they can be steered away from it —\nare questions that have bedeviled governments around the world for\ngenerations. Those questions have taken on fresh urgency with the rise of the\nIslamic State and the string of attacks in Europe and the United States.\nDespite millions of dollars of government-sponsored research, and a much-\npublicized White House pledge to find answers, there is still nothing close to\na consensus on why someone becomes a terrorist.“After all this funding and\nthis flurry of publications, with each new terrorist incident we realize that\nwe are no closer to answering our original question about what leads people to\nturn to political violence,” Marc Sageman, a psychologist and a longtime\ngovernment consultant, wrote in the journal Terrorism and Political Violence\nin 2014. “The same worn-out questions are raised over and over again, and we\nstill have no compelling answers.”When researchers do come up with possible\nanswers, the government often disregards them. Not long after the attacks of\nSept. 11, 2001, for instance, Alan B. Krueger, the Princeton economist, tested\nthe widespread assumption that poverty was a key factor in the making of a\nterrorist. Mr. Krueger’s analysis of economic figures, polls, and data on\nsuicide bombers and hate groups found no link between economic distress and\nterrorism.More than a decade later, law enforcement officials and government-\nfunded community groups still regard money problems as an indicator of\nradicalization.When President Obama announced plans in 2011 to prevent\nhomegrown terrorism, the details were sketchy, but the promise was clear. The\nWhite House would provide warning signs to help parents and community\nleaders.“It’s going to be communities that recognize abnormal behavior,” Denis\nMcDonough, the deputy national security adviser at the time, said. As an\nexample, he cited truancy, which he said was an indicator of possible gang\nactivity. “Truancy is also going to be an early warning sign for violent\nextremism,” he said.But the years that followed have done little to narrow the\nlist of likely precursors. Rather, the murky science seems to imply that\nnearly anyone is a potential terrorist. Some studies suggest that terrorists\nare likely to be educated or extroverted; others say uneducated recluses are\nat risk. Many studies seem to warn of the adolescent condition, singling out\nyoung, impatient men with a sense of adventure who are “struggling to achieve\na sense of selfhood.”Such generalizations are why civil libertarians see only\ndanger in government efforts to identify people at risk of committing crimes.\nResearchers, too, say they have been frustrated by both the Bush and Obama\nadministrations because of what they say is a preoccupation with research that\ncan be distilled into simple checklists, even at the risk of casting\nunnecessary suspicion on innocent people.“They want to be able to do things\nright now,” said Clark R. McCauley Jr., a professor of psychology at Bryn Mawr\nCollege who has conducted government-funded terrorism research for years.\n“Anybody who offers them something right now, like to go around with a\nchecklist — right now — is going to have their attention.“It’s demand driven,”\nhe continued. “The people with guns and badges are so eager to have something.\nThe fact that they could actually do harm? This doesn’t deter them.”Europe,\ntoo, is grappling with these questions, but there is no clear answer. Hans\nBonte, the mayor of the Belgian town of Vilvoorde, attended a White House\nsummit meeting on radicalization last year and described efforts to stem a\nsteady tide of angry young men leaving to join the Islamic State. In Britain,\nthe government encourages or requires people to alert the authorities about\npeople who could become risks. That has spurred debate abroad, and has raised\nquestions in the United States about whether the Constitution would allow the\ngovernment to keep tabs on lawful political or religious speech.“I understand,\nfrom an American standpoint, that can be troubling,” said Lorenzo Vidino, the\ndirector of the Program on Extremism at the Center for Cyber and Homeland\nSecurity at George Washington University. “But the European model, for most\ncountries, is to intervene early, as soon as you see the first sign of\nextremism.”Researching terrorism is admittedly difficult. It involves tough\nquestions about who qualifies as a terrorist, or as a rebel or a soldier.\nNelson Mandela? Palestinian suicide bombers? The Taliban of today? The Afghan\nmujahedeen when the C.I.A. supported them?Researchers seldom have access to\nterrorists, and scientific methods, such as control groups, are rare. In 2005,\nJeff Victoroff, a University of Southern California psychologist, concluded\nthat the leading terrorism research was mostly just political theory and\nanecdotes. “A lack of systematic scholarly investigation has left policy\nmakers to design counterterrorism strategies without the benefit of facts,” he\nwrote in The Journal of Conflict Resolution.When the government does give\nadvice about what to look for, the origin of that information is often\nimpossible to know. A 2012 National Counterterrorism Center report, for\ninstance, declared that anxiety, unmet personal needs, frustration and trauma\nhelped drive radicalization. “Not all individuals who become radicalized have\nunmet personal needs, but those who do are more vulnerable to radicalization,”\nthe document said, citing no sources.Finding terrorism’s roots was supposed to\nhelp turn people away from violence. But even when someone comes to the\ngovernment’s attention, there is no policy on what the response should be. The\nObama administration envisions a network of counselors, religious figures and\nexperts who can step in to help. With rare exceptions, such a network has not\nmaterialized.The White House recently put the Department of Homeland Security\nin charge of a task force to coordinate those efforts, an acknowledgment that\nthe loose alliance of the past several years had suffered from a lack of goals\nand coordination. George Selim, the Homeland Security official leading the\neffort, said the administration had never intended to dictate policies. The\ngovernment, Mr. Selim said, has successfully started conversations and\nfostered relationships between communities and law enforcement groups.In\nMinneapolis, one of the pilot cities for the administration’s counter-\nradicalization efforts, Andrew M. Luger, the United States attorney for\nMinnesota, has built relationships with the Somali community. He said that a\nprevention program was coming soon, and that interventions were farther\noff.“It’s taken a lot of time,” he said. “We’re at a point where a lot of it\nis beginning to come to fruition.”Though the government plays down its use of\nchecklists, the Justice Department offers grants for the development of “a\nrapid assessment” tool to help the authorities “gauge the potential” for\nextremism. Last year, the Intercept news organization revealed a government\nchecklist to score people in terrorism investigations based on factors,\nincluding whether they feel mistreated by the government, distrust law\nenforcement or suffer from discrimination.Mr. McCauley said many of his\ncolleagues and peers conducted smart research and drew narrow conclusions. The\nproblem, he said, is that studies get the most attention when they suggest\nwarning signs. Research linking terrorism to American policies, meanwhile, is\nignored.As a practical matter, scientists note, checklists are mathematically\ncertain to fail. Even a test with 99 percent accuracy would be wrong far more\noften than right. It is a counterintuitive thought, but in a country with a\nhuge population and a tiny number of terrorists, even a nearly perfect test\nwould flag many more innocent people than actual terrorists.In social\nservices, this problem all but disappears. There are few consequences for\nseeking help for someone who appears to be suicidal but is not. When the\nF.B.I. is the only option, the ramifications can be severe.“We talk a very\ngood game,” said John Horgan, a professor at Georgia State University who has\nconducted numerous government-funded studies. “But from the national security\nstandpoint, we still have a scorecard mentality of early identifications and\nsting operations.”In Montgomery County, Md., a Washington suburb, a Muslim-led\ninterfaith organization called Worde thinks it may have a solution. Organizers\nhave provided families and faith leaders with lists of warning signs:\ndepression, trauma, economic stress and political grievances. Anyone who spots\nthese indicators signs can call Worde, which will arrange mental health or\nreligious counseling.Police officers become involved only when there is a\nthreat of imminent danger, said Hedieh Mirahmadi, the group’s president.\nIdeally, she said, people get help without being stigmatized or placed on\ngovernment watch lists.The program is unproven; a nearly complete study on its\neffectiveness gives it high marks for building community relationships but\ndoes not assess whether the group reduces violent extremism. And while Ms.\nMirahmadi said “nobody would disagree” with her warning signs, researchers are\nfar less certain that they are indicators of potential radicalization. Still,\nthe Obama administration believes Worde could be a model and has awarded it\n$500,000 in grants.Faiza Patel, a lawyer with the Brennan Center for Justice,\nremains skeptical. Worde has not released its intervention protocols or its\nmethod for assessing things like political grievances. Ms. Mirahmadi said such\ntools would be too easily misunderstood.But, she said, it is a start. She said\nher group had counseled about 20 people, providing help that otherwise did not\nexist. Whether any of these people would have become violent, she said, is\nimpossible to know.\n\n","title":"Who Will Become a Terrorist?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014f7"},"content":"WASHINGTON — The police on Monday shot a man who pointed a gun at them in a\nscreening area just outside the United States Capitol, briefly unnerving the\ncity a week after the bombings in Brussels.As the scene unfolded in the\nentrance to the Capitol Visitor Center and law enforcement officials swept the\nCapitol complex, employees and visitors inside were forced to stay in place\nfor almost an hour. Others who were on the grounds were asked to evacuate as\nthe police cordoned off the site and nearby streets.The man, identified by the\npolice as Larry R. Dawson of Tennessee, and a female bystander who suffered\nminor injuries were taken to a nearby hospital, law enforcement officials\nsaid. Mr. Dawson was in stable but critical condition, according to the\nauthorities.Law enforcement officials quickly ruled out terrorism, saying that\nthey were convinced that Mr. Dawson had acted alone. “There is no reason to\nbelieve that this is anything more than a criminal act,” said Chief Matthew\nVerderosa of the United States Capitol Police.Mr. Dawson was charged with\nassault with a deadly weapon and assaulting a police officer while armed.He\nhad been arrested in Washington in October after entering the House chamber\ngallery and yelling that he was “a prophet of God.” The police had ordered him\nto stay away from the Capitol grounds, and when he did not show up for a court\ndate in November, a warrant was issued for his arrest.With Congress on recess\nthis week, few lawmakers or their staff members were in the Capitol at the\ntime of the shooting. But for the families, school groups and others who were\ntouring the complex, the episode turned an otherwise calm spring day into a\nchaotic afternoon.David Espinosa, a contractor working to restore the\nCapitol’s exterior, was on scaffolding when he heard screaming from the plaza\nbelow. When he looked down, he said, he saw police officers with guns drawn\nmoving past fleeing visitors. Mr. Espinosa, 27, said he then saw law\nenforcement officials wheel a stretcher out of the Capitol.Dave and Sue Jones,\nof Long Valley, N.J., were in a visitor center auditorium watching an\nintroductory video about the Capitol when they heard a commotion.“There was\nshouting that was definitely not part of the movie,” Ms. Jones, 66, said a few\nminutes after being escorted from the Capitol. “And I could hear that through\nthe walls.”Most of her fellow visitors, including schoolchildren, remained\ncalm after officials put the room on lockdown and offered a brief explanation\nof what was going on, Ms. Jones said.Ms. Jones, a teacher who has brought more\nthan two dozen groups to the Capitol over the years, said she was glad to be\nthere alone with her husband this time.“I thought of my students immediately,”\nshe said, “because they would be all over the building.”At a news conference\nabout two hours after the shooting, Chief Verderosa said that the authorities\nhad recovered a weapon that was believed to be his, and located a vehicle that\nbelonged to him on the Capitol grounds. Chief Verderosa said the authorities\nwere obtaining a warrant to search the car.The episode was similar to one in\n1998, in which two police officers were killed when a man opened fire in the\nCapitol. After that, Congress initiated plans for a new visitor center that\nexpanded its security perimeter and created the screening center where\nMonday’s shooting occurred.Chief Verderosa, who took over the department this\nmonth, told reporters that those security measures worked and gave officers an\nopportunity to confront the man before he entered the building. The visitor\ncenter was expected to open as usual on Tuesday.\n\n","title":"Police at U.S. Capitol Shoot Man With Gun at Screening Point - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"A gunman near the U.S. Capitol was shot by police and taken to a hospital, officials said https://t.co/qOuaYBffNh https://t.co/jy0j28ZQ5X","date":"Mon Mar 28 20:00:45 +0000 2016","favs":239,"id":{"$numberLong":"714542765137403904"},"retweets":396},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25sU0By"}

The country’s largest Islamic political party had\ndeclared a nationwide strike on Monday, and Sunni Muslim groups had staged\nprotests demanding that the hearing be called off.They need not have worried.\nA swarm of lawyers had barely taken their seats when Justice Naima Haider\nruled that the group of 15 petitioners, 10 of whom had died as the case\nnavigated the court bureaucracy, had no standing to raise the issue with the\ncourt.Subrata Chowdhury, the lawyer who filed the original petition 28 years\nago, looked lost as he listened to the judge.“Without a hearing, without\ngiving any chance,” he said helplessly. Later, back at his office, he\ncommiserated with a circle of stunned colleagues.“I’m very disappointed. This\ncase was our baby,” he said. “I’ve never seen anything like this. At least a\nproper hearing should have taken place. We had prepared so much.”After winning\nindependence from Pakistan in 1971, Bangladesh was declared a secular nation,\nbut a military ruler amended the Constitution in 1988 to make Islam the state\nreligion. The 1988 petition challenging this decision went nowhere until the\ngoverning Awami League, which positions itself as a secular party, took power\nin 2009.The court’s ruling on Monday came at an anxious time. Attacks on\nreligious minorities have become more frequent over the last year, leading to\nfears that Islamic fundamentalism is on the rise. Kamal Hossain, the\npolitician who drafted Bangladesh’s original Constitution, said he was\nuncertain why the case was being heard now after so many years, and at such a\nsensitive time.The decision to dismiss the case was greeted jubilantly by\nMuslim leaders, who linked arms and flashed victory signs for television\ncameras as they left the court.Mufti Masum Billah, the chairman of the\nBangabandhu Ulema Foundation, a religious nonprofit, said there was no need to\nworry about Islam’s status as a state religion, since the Constitution\nprotects freedom of religion.“Bangladesh has a state flower — it’s the water\nlily,” he said. “We have a state fruit — the jackfruit.

The Newark area had more\nthan 20, while New York City, Boston, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington\neach had more than 10.Called Project Shadowfire, the operation was conducted\nunder the banner of Operation Community Shield, an initiative begun in 2005 by\nthe immigration agency to target violent gangs. Regular sweeps over the past\n11 years have resulted in more than 40,000 gang-related arrests and the\nseizure of more than 8,000 firearms, officials said.In the latest campaign,\nconducted in tandem with local and state law enforcement agencies, officials\nseized more than 20 kilograms of narcotics — including marijuana, cocaine,\nheroin — illicit cash and weapons, Ms. Rodriguez of I.C.E. said.Some experts\nhave observed a shifting emphasis by drug smugglers away from marijuana as the\ndrug has been decriminalized across the United States in recent years. Data\nreleased by the United States Border Patrol showed that marijuana seizures\nalong the southwest border with Mexico fell to their lowest level in at least\na decade in 2015, even as other data suggested a rise in methamphetamine\nimports.Most of those arrested in the immigration agency’s sweep were American\nnationals, but about 240 were natives of countries in Latin America, Europe,\nAsia and the Caribbean, officials said.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014fb"},"content":"BEDFORD, Mass. — In a small room banked by refrigerators of preserved brains,\na pathologist held a specimen up to the light in frank admiration. Then it was\ntime to cut — once in half and then a thick slice from the back, the tissue\ndense and gray-pink, teeming with folds and swirls.It was the brain of a\nprofessional running back.“There,” said Dr. Ann McKee, the chief of\nneuropathology at the V.A. Boston Healthcare System and a professor of\nneurology and pathology at Boston University’s medical school, pointing to a\nkey area that had an abnormal separation. “That’s one thing we look for right\naway.”Over the past several years, Dr. McKee’s lab, housed in a pair of two-\nstory brick buildings in suburban Boston, has repeatedly made headlines by\nrevealing that deceased athletes, including at least 90 former N.F.L. players,\nwere found to have had a degenerative brain disease called chronic traumatic\nencephalopathy, or C.T.E., that is believed to cause debilitating memory and\nmood problems. This month, after years of denying or playing down a\nconnection, a top N.F.L. official acknowledged at a hearing in Washington that\nplaying football and having C.T.E. were “certainly” linked.His statement\neffectively ended a very public dispute over whether head blows sustained\nwhile playing football are associated with the disorder. But it will not\nresolve a quieter debate among scientists about how much risk each football\nplayer has of developing it, or answer questions about why some players seem\nfar more vulnerable to it than others.Some researchers worry that the rising\ndrumbeat of C.T.E. diagnoses is far outpacing scientific progress in\npinpointing the symptoms, risks and prevalence of the disease. The American\nAcademy of Clinical Neuropsychology, an organization of brain injury\nspecialists, is preparing a public statement to point out that much of the\nscience of C.T.E. is still unsettled and to contend that the evidence to date\nshould not be interpreted to mean that parents must keep their children off\nsports teams, officials of the group say.“I’ve had parents come into my\npractice, their child had a single concussion and they think he or she has\npermanent brain damage,” said Karen Postal, the organization’s president and\nan instructor at Harvard. “There’s no basis for that.”Dr. Postal has been\njointly designated by the N.F.L. Players Association, which represents the\nplayers, and the league as a neutral expert available to assess players as\npart of the injury grievance process. Dr. Postal said she had not received any\nresearch support from the N.F.L. or the players. The organization she heads\nincludes some members who have worked for N.F.L. teams; most have not, she\nsaid.The Boston lab, which has amassed the largest C.T.E. brain bank in the\nworld, contends that anyone playing a head-jostling sport like football,\nhockey, rugby or soccer runs some level of risk, and that it is cumulative\nexposure to head hits, not only concussions, that is most critical. But others\nin the field contend that far more study is needed.“The problem is that these\nfindings are being put out there too fast, and stated too strongly, by one\ngroup, before we understand who gets C.T.E., how it evolves over time, what’s\nthe risk — any of that,” said Dr. Lili-Naz Hazrati, a brain pathologist at the\nUniversity of Toronto who said she had received no financial support from\neither the N.F.L. or the Players Association.Members of the Boston lab say\nthey have raised the alarm for a good reason — the risk is real — but agree\nthat the C.T.E. story is far from complete. “This research is in its infancy,”\nsaid Robert Stern, a professor of neurology and neurosurgery at the Boston\nUniversity School of Medicine, who works with Dr. McKee. “There are many\noutstanding questions, but we’re now working to answer them and making some\nprogress.” The National Institutes of Health has committed some $20 million to\nresearch, and the N.F.L. more than $70 million.The group has made its\ndiagnoses of C.T.E. with authority, often stating them in terms of “stages”\nsimilar to a cancer diagnosis. Dr. McKee has determined four pathological\nstages, which she has linked to psychological problems, like depression or\nexplosive anger. She said the stages themselves are clearly distinguishable on\npost-mortem slides of brain tissues, but she acknowledged that their proposed\nlink to specific symptoms is “totally preliminary; it probably won’t hold up.\nWe don’t know yet how the pathology stages predict behavior.”Part of the\nchallenge in answering these questions is that doctors can only diagnose\nC.T.E. after death, by dissecting a brain. That process allows them to\nidentify a subtle pattern of a brain protein called tau, clumped in critical\nareas.It was only last year that a panel of experts, convened by the federally\nfunded National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, agreed that\nthis tau pattern was definitively distinct from patterns of tau that signal\nother conditions like Alzheimer’s disease or age-related decline.“That was a\nfirst step, nothing more,” said Dr. Walter Koroshetz, the institute’s\ndirector. “We had to establish minimal criteria,” so that all researchers were\nusing the same standards. The agency is now funding research into detecting\nC.T.E. in living people and clarifying the link between its stages and\nsymptoms.The medical literature generally describes C.T.E. as closely related\nto punch-drunk syndrome, or “dementia pugilistica” — the stiffness, tremors\nand early dementia first found in some professional boxers a half-century ago.\nBut when Dr. Bennet Omalu, a pathologist in Pittsburgh, reported the telltale\npathology in a deceased football player in 2005 — which became the basis for\nthe 2015 movie “Concussion” — the research took a different turn. Team contact\nsports produce different kinds of blows to the head than boxing, and research\ninto those athletes accelerated.Dr. McKee and Dr. Stern had studied\nAlzheimer’s disease for decades. After Dr. Omalu’s report, Dr. Stern was\ngiving a lecture about dementia when he met Chris Nowinski, a former wrestler\nand football player who spoke to him about C.T.E. “He said, ‘Look, this is a\nbig problem, are you interested in looking into it?’ ” Dr. Stern said.Dr.\nStern and Dr. McKee said they immediately saw an opportunity to make a\ncontribution in the relatively unexplored area. Dr. McKee had been running\nbrain banks for years, including one for the landmark Framingham Heart Study,\nand Dr. Stern had been studying brain trauma as a risk factor for later\ndementia.By 2014, Mr. Nowinski had helped their lab collect more than 100\nbrains from athletes, and the team found the tau signature in dozens of them.\nPerhaps their most explosive finding was a report released last fall, which\nfound that 76 of the 79 pro football players’ brains they examined showed\nevidence of C.T.E.But the Boston group’s collection of brains is not\nrepresentative of the pro-football population, as the researchers there\nacknowledge. The brains were given to the center by families of athletes who\nwere showing severe symptoms of the injury, and not from former players who\nwere not. “We can’t say from this sample whether the rate of C.T.E. in pro\nplayers is 1 percent or what; we have no idea,” Dr. McKee said.“But,” she\nadded, “I don’t think it’s extremely rare. I would have to have some golden\ntouch to see this many, if it were.”In the best study to determine risk so\nfar, published in December, a research team at a Mayo Clinic bank in\nJacksonville found C.T.E. in 21 of 66 brains of people who had played contact\nsports. It found no evidence of the disorder in 198 people with no record of\nplaying such sports. But the authors said they had no way to know whether\nthose 21 former athletes had symptoms linked to C.T.E.; some had other\nneurological disorders as well when they died.“These are very early days, and\nwe badly need larger studies, that include both athletes and nonathletes,”\nsaid Dr. Dennis Dickson, the study’s senior author.Another uncertainty is\nindividual susceptibility to risk. The Boston group has found C.T.E. in people\nwho played only high school football and in Tyler Sash, the 27-year-old former\nNew York Giant who was found dead of an apparent drug overdose in September.\n“These are young people; what are they doing in my lab?” Dr. McKee said. “This\ntells me that some people are at high risk.”Four of the brains from pro\nplayers in her lab had no evidence of the disorder. Half the 22 athletes in\nthe University of Toronto’s bank did not have C.T.E., including the former\nhockey “enforcer” Todd Ewen, the researchers reported last month.“These are\nextremely important cases,” Dr. Hazrati, the University of Toronto\npathologist, said. “Some people are clearly resistant to developing this, for\nreasons we don’t understand.”Others may be living with the telltale signature\nbrain scarring of C.T.E. without having any related symptoms, Dr. Hazrati and\nothers said. This also happens with the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer’s\ndisease: some people’s brains are found to be riddled with them, even though\nthey showed no evidence of dementia while alive.The answers to these questions\nare likely to be slow in coming, most scientists said.Researchers are now\ntesting methods of diagnosing C.T.E. in living people, including a brain scan\nintended to identify the tau signature. In a just-concluded study funded by\nthe National Institutes of Health, Dr. Stern and a research team compared\nabout 100 living former N.F.L. players with 30 healthy men of the same age.\nThe team is still analyzing the data.Dr. Stern and another team have also\nbegun a second study funded by the National Institutes of Health to follow 120\nformer N.F.L. players, 60 former college players, and 60 healthy men of the\nsame age who had not played football. “What we’d like to know, in addition to\npredicting risk, is whether we can pick it up early, whether we can intervene,\nto stop it from getting worse — or, is it reversible?” Dr. Stern said.Until\nthen, athletes and parents will have to weigh the real but poorly understood\nrisk of C.T.E. against the upsides of contact sports. Dr. Postal, the Harvard-\naffiliated neuropsychologist, has two boys who play football and a 7-year-old\ndaughter in a flag league. “If she wants to play tackle, I’ll be delighted,”\nDr. Postal said.The Boston group’s Dr. Stern has a son who played football in\nhigh school but decided not to play in college. “In retrospect, I am very glad\nthat he did not play in college,” Dr. Stern said, “and, if he were in high\nschool now, he would not be playing football.”\n\n","title":"On C.T.E. and Athletes, Science Remains in Its Infancy - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"These scientists say football's risk to the brain is real but agree the story is incomplete https://t.co/VItir9yN0L https://t.co/e38Uyyl6uD","date":"Mon Mar 28 17:20:07 +0000 2016","favs":216,"id":{"$numberLong":"714502340439633920"},"retweets":105},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21OWCFn"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014fc"},"content":"There wasn’t much to look at in terms of set design during Rihanna’s Sunday-\nnight concert at Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Oversized plastic cocoons\nthrobbed with pulsing air on either side of the stage. About two-thirds into\nthe show, a huge shower curtain dropped from the ceiling; for a while, it\ndisplayed multicolored psychedelic swirls, and shortly after, foam came\ntumbling down it from the top, as if Rihanna had let the world’s largest\nwashing machine overflow.These didn’t feel like strategic choices so much as a\nresult of needing literally to fill space — vertical, horizontal,\nintellectual, psychological.But there was one exceedingly potent and poetic\nvisual gambit early in the night, one that required just as little thought but\nwas endlessly rich. Rihanna began the concert on a platform at the opposite\nend of the arena from the stage. After one song there, she boarded a clear\nfloating catwalk and soared above the crowd, slithering through erotic numbers\nlike “Woo” and “Sex With Me” while striking one hard pose after the next. She\nwas moving laterally, and also undulating, and also pausing for effect. Songs\nwere playing, she might even have been singing them, but in those minutes, all\nthat mattered was her mastery of space.She could have done the whole show like\nthis, truly — staring down upon her faithful, bent at various angles, part\ntent preacher and part dominatrix. Rihanna is exceptional at being famous, and\nshe needs very little in the way of help to fascinate a room.At this show,\nthough — the first of two sellouts at Barclays Center on her world tour\ncelebrating “Anti” (Roc Nation), her eighth album, which was released in\nJanuary — she aimed for more, which she doesn’t always do. The concert was\narranged thematically, split into sections that showcased different parts of\nher catalog — bombastic, anthemic, somewhat Caribbean, very Caribbean — if not\nof her personality. About two dozen songs were compressed into around 90\nminutes, a warp-speed recent-career overview that played something like a\nworkout video: tightly controlled with mild variations designed only to\nobscure the fact that, really, there are no variations.That was echoed in the\nwardrobe, which utilized a restrained, mature palette — beige, ivory, taupe,\nolive — on garments designed for druids, a look that channeled 2013-era Kanye\nWest and suggested a concert at the hottest club on Tatooine.Neutrality is not\nanonymity, though. Rihanna, the 28-year-old pop star, was the most present\nshe’s ever been onstage, and maybe the most confident. (Although in the past\nshe has managed to pull off a supremely confident disengagement.)She wasn’t\nparticularly animated by the particulars of performing — her dancing was still\ncasual, her lip-syncing not always spot on. But she appeared to be finding joy\nin singing — when she was doing it, which was only some of the time — a part\nof pop fame that has not always been her strength. Often, performers will\nfront load their sets with songs that demand the most vocally, but Rihanna\nwaited until the concert’s final leg to push herself: an ecstatic “Diamonds,”\na bare-bones “FourFiveSeconds,” a melodramatic “Love on the Brain.” As people\nbegan to stream out of their seats to head home, Rihanna aimed to pull them\nback with her humanity.This represented, in so much as is possible, Rihanna\nwith her guard down. The rollout of “Anti” was scattershot and messy, and the\nalbum lacks a center. But it also includes some of Rihanna’s most thoughtful\nand invested singing ever. She is doing something extremely rare in pop:\ntrying harder the more famous she’s become.She surrounded herself with worthy\nallies here: a gaggle of outstanding dancers, including voguers and bone\nbreakers, and a crack band, initially submerged on four square platforms\narranged evenly onstage and eventually raised to sea level. The drums were\ntough and synthetic, the keyboards tingling. The band alternated between\nfaithfulness to the source material and disruption, excelling on a space-funk\nversion of “Birthday Cake” that was colder and dreamier than the original.It\nalso delivered an expertly rendered but unfortunate run of dance music, a\nworld Rihanna occasionally visits with a big smile and a pinched nose: a\nnitrous-injected version of Drake’s “Take Care,” followed by “We Found Love” —\non which her vocals were unsteady enough that they were clearly live,\nsomething that humanized the song’s assault — followed by “Where Have You\nBeen.”This, the most energized portion of the night’s show, was also the most\ndisjointed. Each person onstage was operating in his or her independent\nuniverse; from a distance, it all suggested an Off Broadway play about an\narena show, where each person surrounding the star harbors a provocative inner\nlife but is trapped in an endless performance. In the middle of it all,\nRihanna moved a little, but not much — everyone else’s physical scramble for\nattention only made her reluctance more entrancing.\n\n","title":"Review: Rihanna on Tour, Part Preacher, Part Dominatrix, All Human - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Rihanna on tour: Part preacher, part dominatrix and all human https://t.co/BkEcFsmTH3","date":"Mon Mar 28 16:55:01 +0000 2016","favs":157,"id":{"$numberLong":"714496022878273536"},"retweets":57},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21P7anW"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014fd"},"content":"HAVANA — The White House made sure the wireless signal inside the Grand\nTheater of Havana was strong and fast last week as President Obama made his\ncase for change to the Cuban people. He spoke of evolution and burying old\nwounds from before he was born. He bluntly challenged President Raúl Castro of\nCuba, sitting across the hall, to change his ways.Outside that theater and\nthroughout Cuba, Internet access ranges from sluggish to nonexistent, and\nchange is equally slow. The wounds that Mr. Obama spoke of are the defining\ngrievances of Mr. Castro’s lifetime and that of his older brother, Fidel.The\n30 years between Mr. Obama, 54, and Mr. Castro, 84, help explain the vast gulf\nthat separates the two leaders, on vivid display last week as the American\npresident made a historic visit to Cuba.Mr. Obama’s trip was calculated to\nhighlight the generational contrast and appeal to a younger cohort both in\nCuba and in the United States, presenting his vision for a thaw as the\ninevitable way of the future, and the hostility and isolation that came before\nas the stale remnant of another century.“He moved with this fluid, lanky,\nyouthful movement, and that contrasted so strongly with Raúl and his stiff\nmilitary bearing,” said Richard Feinberg, a senior fellow in the Latin America\ninitiative at the Brookings Institution, who traveled to Cuba last week to\nwitness the visit.“His speech constantly focused on generational shift, youth,\nthe future, let’s put the past behind us,” Mr. Feinberg added. “A lot of these\nthings didn’t have to be said — you had the visual representation that sent\nthe message.”At a news conference last Monday at the Revolutionary Palace, Mr.\nObama was confident and in his element as he addressed reporters and fielded\nquestions, while Mr. Castro, unaccustomed to such an exchange and apparently\nirritated with his translation headset, showed his age.“The iconic image was\nCastro getting all huffy about some pretty anodyne critiques of the human\nrights situation in Cuba,” said Michael C. Desch, a political-science\nprofessor at the University of Notre Dame.“The gestalt of the visit for Obama\nwas very much ‘I know you’re on your way out, and I’m going to speak to the\nCuban population about what the future looks like after you.’”It was a message\nthat Mr. Obama delivered visually as much as verbally. In Cuba, where two-\nthirds of the population is black or mixed-race — and Mr. Castro and the vast\nmajority of his government are white — a mixed-race American president\nembodied possibilities that most Cubans consider out of reach.Mr. Obama, who\nbuilt his first presidential campaign around support from younger voters and\nthemes of generational change, gravitates to youths wherever he travels.\nForums at universities or with young leaders active in their communities are\nstaples of his foreign trips, and Cuba was no exception.At an entrepreneurship\nevent in Havana, Mr. Obama offered encouragement to young Cubans working to\nestablish their own businesses within their country’s state-run economy. He\nbrought along Brian Chesky, the 34-year-old founder of the online booking\ncompany Airbnb, telling the audience, “You can see how young he is.”Later, at\nhis speech to the Cuban people at the Grand Theater, Mr. Obama pressed the\ngenerational argument on Mr. Castro, who sat listening in a balcony across the\nroom.“If you can’t access information online, if you cannot be exposed to\ndifferent points of view, you will not reach your full potential, and over\ntime, the youth will lose hope,” Mr. Obama said.“I know these issues are\nsensitive, especially coming from an American president,” he added.Mr. Obama’s\nmessage is grounded in the political reality of a changing Cuban population,\nboth in the United States and on the island.While older Cuban-Americans tend\nto harbor lingering feelings of anger and resentment about that country’s\nCommunist government, leading them to favor embargo and isolation, a younger\ngeneration has less emotional investment in those decades-old disputes.\nLikewise, while many members of older generations who remained on the island\nhave a visceral connection to the revolution and all that followed, their\nchildren and grandchildren may have little memory of the roots of resentment\ntoward the United States.Speaking directly to their perspective, Mr. Obama\nsaid in his speech: “I know the history, but I refuse to be trapped by it.”A\nNew York Times/CBS News poll conducted before the president’s trip and\nreleased last week illustrates the divide. Among respondents in the United\nStates ages 18 to 29, fully 64 percent said they approved of Mr. Obama’s\nhandling of Cuba, compared with 49 percent of those 30 and older. While the\npoll showed majority support over all for his approach, with 52 percent\napproving of it and 30 percent opposed to it, people 65 and older were\nsubstantially more negative, with 42 percent of them disapproving.Lopsided\npercentages of young people said re-establishing relations with Cuba would be\ngood for the United States, according to the poll, while a smaller majority of\nolder people did.Mr. Obama moved around Havana in the sleek black limousine\nknown as “the Beast,” through streets that appeared frozen in time, packed\nwith classic American cars of the mid-20th century.“You drive around Havana\nand you say, ‘This economy is not working,’” he said later. “It looks like it\ndid in the 1950s.”Likewise, the theater where he spoke to the Cuban people\nlooks very much as it did 88 years ago, when Calvin Coolidge, the last sitting\nAmerican president to go to Cuba, spoke there to a Western Hemisphere summit\nmeeting.This time, though, Mr. Obama’s staff made sure there was plenty of\nInternet connectivity for his message of change and transformation to be\nposted on Twitter, streamed and broadcast as widely as possible.And then, just\nas quickly, the president finished speaking, and the signal strength died. Mr.\nObama left Cuba not long after, his motorcade passing by signs bearing old\nrevolutionary slogans and portraits of Fidel in younger days as it went.\n\n","title":"Along With President Obama, the 21st Century Visited Cuba - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Along with President Obama, the 21st century visited Cuba https://t.co/4c1GxmZRX8 https://t.co/vdHIYb9piQ","date":"Mon Mar 28 16:45:09 +0000 2016","favs":164,"id":{"$numberLong":"714493541473460224"},"retweets":249},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1Mvob4I"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014fe"},"content":"The Caesar, done right, is a multiplatform salad. Beyond the taste of the\nthing — which is spectacular — it is experienced across all the senses, a riot\nof contrasts, cold and crunch.First, cool watery leaves against thick, savory\ndressing. The hard crunch of croutons against the soft crunch of salad greens.\nThen sharp mustard against rich cheese; salty anchovies against bright lemon;\nand biting garlic against soothing egg.Sadly, it’s rare to find a Caesar on\nthe open market that gets even a couple of those elements right. So many\natrocities are presented under that name: baby greens suffocated under an\navalanche of fake cheese; wilting spinach leaves drowned in milk-bland\ndressing; innocent romaine crammed into plastic containers with unspeakable\nproteins.That’s why a perfect Caesar is the one you make at home. And our\nfavorite modern version is one with more greens going for it than romaine.\nRomaine has become the standard choice, and it’s a fine one, but the original\nformula called for strong, bitter leaves to stand up to the rich, salty\ndressing.In a 1947 report about the flaring popularity of Caesar salad in\nCalifornia, The New York Times’s Los Angeles bureau chief, Gladwin Hill, wrote\nto the newspaper’s food editor, Jane Nickerson, in New York. “The fundamentals\nare one or more flavorsome greens like romaine, endive, or escarole,” he\nwrote. “Bland lettuce is not permitted.”So don’t worry that piling raw kale\ninto a Caesar salad is painfully trendy. It’s practically a conservative\nchoice. And another great benefit of using sturdy greens: The salad can be\ndressed and seasoned hours before serving and returned to the refrigerator,\nwith no fear of the Total Salad Breakdown that would happen if you tried the\nsame shortcut with most green salads.But even the staunchest lovers of strong\ngreens can find an all-kale salad too bitter. (This is why so many kale salads\nare garnished with rich avocado, sweet dried cranberries, toasted almonds and\nthe like.)Our preferred solution: Balance the kale with other greens, making\nthe salad juicier and brighter. The combination of forest-green lacinato kale\nand mint-green romaine gives great visual contrast. Pale yellow hearts of\nescarole tossed with kelly-green curly kale would be beautiful on another\nday.At Acme, the recently rebooted bistro in NoHo, the chef Brian Loiacono\ngoes full brassica in his Caesar salad, combining coins of Tuscan kale with\nshaved-to-order brussels sprouts. “Once you have a good strong dressing, you\ncan use greens you wouldn’t think about for salad,” he said. Letting the salad\nsit after tossing, he said, even for a few minutes, helps soften and season\nthe leaves.Any kind of kale will work; it’s only a question of how small to\ncut it. Tougher, bumpy-leaved types, like lacinato kale (also known as\ndinosaur or Tuscan kale), should be about the size of a postage stamp. Curly\nkale can be as big as a business card.There is no need to “massage” the kale\nto tenderize it; the lemon in the dressing and time in the refrigerator will\ntake care of that.This recipe will certainly work without kale, but it won’t\nwork with, say, Bibb lettuce or mesclun. Tender salad greens like those will\nsink under the weight of Caesar dressing, but kale gives back as good as it\ngets.If using romaine, leave all but the biggest, floppiest leaves whole.\nWhole leaves and spears give the salad the most crunch. (Caesar salad should\nalways be served with a knife and fork.)Once you have your greens picked out,\nswish them clean in a giant bowl or a sink full of very cold water. A few ice\ncubes aren’t a bad idea; the cold water helps stiffen any greens thinking of\nwilting. This is best done several hours or a day ahead, to give the leaves\nthe chance to dry completely.Mr. Loiacono washes them the night before in ice\nwater, and lays each leaf on a towel-lined tray before refrigerating\novernight. (Access to giant refrigerators is one of the tricks that help chefs\nseem like better cooks than the rest of us.)I dry them in tea towels, then put\nthem in a deep bowl, with a bag of ice in the bottom and another one lying on\ntop, to get the leaves really cold.For the dressing, as long as the\nfundamental ingredients are all present — garlic, Parmesan, lemon,\nWorcestershire sauce or anchovies, olive oil, black pepper and mustard (not\npart of the original recipe, but helpful for flavor and emulsification) — the\nproportions should be adjusted to your liking. Taste as you go: The original\nCaesar salad, like steak tartare and guacamole, was mixed tableside to the\ncustomer’s taste.There’s one stipulation: in the end, your dressing should be\nsalty, creamy, tart and _spicy_ — an element that often gets lost in\nrestaurants, where Caesars are ever more timid. In the classic dressing, the\nmustard is eye-wateringly spicy; the raw garlic is mouth-scouringly spicy; the\nfreshly ground black pepper is sneeze-inducingly spicy. It is not a\nstraightforward chile heat, but a layered one, assaulting all the senses.And\nall that heat is balanced with lashings of rich oil, cheese and egg, giving\nthe salad its distinctive mouth feel and flavor.Caesar Cardini, the glamorous\nItalian-American restaurateur who popularized the salad from his Prohibition-\nera outpost in Tijuana, Mexico, could not have known it, but much of the\nappeal of his namesake salad comes from umami. The “fifth taste,” umami, is\nthe mouthfilling, savory flavor first identified by Japanese scientists in the\nearly 20th century, then quickly synthesized into the additive monosodium\nglutamate.Long before any chef in the Western Hemisphere had considered umami,\nCardini’s salad was a powerful, natural delivery system for it, via Parmesan,\nWorcestershire sauce and garlic.Even without that knowledge, the Caesar\ncatapulted to fame in the 1930s, talked up by salad-mad Californians who\ntraveled to Tijuana to score a gin martini and a Caesar — to this day, one of\nthe world’s great pairings. And by 1947, Hill reported, the Caesar was being\nextolled in Los Angeles as “possibly the greatest advance in salad fabrication\nin centuries.”Could the half-kale, half-romaine Caesar be the next benchmark\nin that glorious tradition?Recipe: Kale-Romaine Caesar Salad_Julia Moskin is\non hand to answer any Caesar salad questions in the comments field.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f014ff"},"content":"Whatever one may think about the current president and the two Democrats\nduking it out to replace him, you have to admit that they have, by and large,\nconducted themselves with an admirable level of civility and couth becoming of\nthe office.Not so for their Republican counterparts.Indeed, the entirety of\nthe Republican Party seems dead set on convincing voters that it has lost its\nway and is spinning out of control, consumed with anger and devoid of\nanswers.The two leading Republican presidential candidates engaged last week\nin a crude, sophomoric tiff involving insults of each other’s spouses. A nude\npicture of the front-runner’s wife was used in a Facebook ad. (I guess folks\nwill have to get over their weird obsession with Michelle Obama’s bare arms if\na fully bare naked cover model becomes first lady). One man threatened to\n“spill the beans” about the other’s wife; the other responded with a\n“sniveling coward” quip.It was all so depressingly lowbrow.And this all played\nout as some Republicans went apoplectic in the wake of the Brussels terror\nattack when President Obama attended a baseball game in Cuba and danced the\ntango in Argentina.Obama responded to those criticisms like a thoughtful\nadult, saying at a press conference: “It is very important for us to not\nrespond with fear.” He continued, “A lot of it is also going to be to say:\n‘You do not have power over us. We are strong. Our values are right.’ ”Obama’s\nresponse to personal attacks against him stood in stark contrast to the\nresponse of the Republican presidential candidates to personal attacks.The\ntruth is that there really is no contest when it comes to being\npresidential.The poor choices and poor behavior of Republicans are not\nconfined to the presidential candidates. Senate Republican leaders still\nhaven’t agreed to grant a hearing for the president’s Supreme Court pick,\nMerrick Garland, even when a new CNN/ORC poll found that approximately two-\nthirds of Americans want Garland to get a hearing and 57 percent agree that\nPresident Obama was right to make the appointment to fill the seat.As CNN\nreported after the poll was released: “Congressional approval stands near its\nall-time low in CNN polling, with just 15 percent approving. That’s down 6\npoints since last February, and just a few points above the 10 percent low\npoint hit in September 2013 just ahead of a partial government shutdown.\nAnother finding from the poll, released earlier last week, found the\nRepublican Party’s favorability also at its lowest point since that\nshutdown.”And then there is what’s happening on the state level. On Wednesday,\nin a special session of the Republican-led North Carolina legislature,\nlawmakers pushed through a bill that a New York Times editorial called\n“appalling” and “unconstitutional.” The bill “bars transgender people from\nusing public restrooms that match their gender identity and prohibits cities\nfrom passing antidiscrimination ordinances that protect gay and transgender\npeople.” The Republican governor, Pat McCrory, signed the bill into law on\nWednesday and tweeted: “Ordinance defied common sense, allowing men to use\nwomen’s bathroom/locker room for instance. That’s why I signed bipartisan bill\nto stop it.”Now please tell me who is going to do the policing of gender and\nhow exactly will examinations be conducted? Will you now have to show a birth\ncertification to claim a stall?Business interests have already signaled their\ndispleasure with the bill.Earlier this month, Republican lawmakers in Georgia\npushed through a so-called Religious Liberty Bill. As Reuters put it:“The\nGeorgia bill, reworked several times by lawmakers amid criticism that earlier\nversions went too far, declares that no pastor can be forced to perform a\nsame-sex wedding. The bill also grants faith-based organizations — churches,\nreligious schools or associations — the right to reject holding events for\npeople or groups of whom they object. Faith-based groups also could not be\nforced to hire or retain an employee whose beliefs run counter to the\norganization’s.”Georgia’s governor has yet to sign the legislation, but as\nReuters pointed out: “More than 300 large corporations and small businesses,\nincluding Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola, have signed a pledge decrying the\nGeorgia legislation and urging the state lawmakers to drop it.”When Republican\nofficials aren’t being infantile, they’re being archaic.The future of this\ncountry bends toward more inclusion and acceptance, regardless of our\noccasional regression. This country needs a president who doesn’t pout or get\nlost in puerile protestations.I understand that Republican voters are filled\nwith an insatiable anger stemming from unbridled electoral enthusiasm that\nstill failed to halt unremitting social change, or elect their hopelessly\nunimpressive recent presidential candidates. But they are allowing themselves\nto be led out of the mainstream, over a cliff and into oblivion.America is\nwatching the Republican Party demonstrate its headstrong desire to self-\ndestruct. I’m guessing most of America is not amused.\n\n","title":"Republican Self-Destruction - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytopinion: .@CharlesMBlow: When Republican officials aren’t being infantile, they’re being archaic. https://t.co/KueKJxhVdE","date":"Mon Mar 28 16:22:53 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714487938965487621"},"retweets":65},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21OBrmS"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01501"},"content":"Deadly summer heat waves in the eastern United States may be predictable\nnearly two months before they occur, giving emergency planners and farmers\nmore time to prepare, scientists reported on Monday.The key to such an advance\nforecast, scientists said, is the occurrence of a distinctive pattern of water\ntemperatures across a wide stretch of the North Pacific Ocean. While the\nexistence of the pattern does not guarantee that a heat wave will occur, it\nsignificantly increases the odds of one happening as much as 50 days\nlater.From 1999 to 2010, about 620 people died each year, on average, from\nheat-related illness in the United States, according to the Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention. Some heat waves have been especially lethal,\nlike the one in Chicago in 1995 when more than 700 people, most of them old or\ninfirm, died over five days.Given more lead time, emergency planners could\ntake measures like establishing more cooling centers at schools and other\nbuildings, and stepping up programs to track homeless people and homebound,\nchronically ill older Americans. Farmers could arrange for more irrigation for\ncrops and extra water and shade for livestock.In a study published on Monday\nin the journal Nature Geoscience, the researchers first identified extremely\nhot summer days in the eastern half of the country from 1982 to 2015. Then\nthey looked at temperature data for sea surfaces — specifically, the extent to\nwhich temperatures were above or below normal — for the same period.“The\npattern popped out at us really clearly,” said Karen A. McKinnon, a\npostdoctoral researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, in\nBoulder, Colo., and the lead author of the study. Not only did it exist on\nthose hot days — defined as about 12 degrees hotter than normal summer\ntemperatures — “but importantly, up to seven weeks before,” Dr. McKinnon\nsaid.Randall Dole, a senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric\nAdministration who has studied heat-wave predictability but was not involved\nin the study, said the results provided “a tantalizing hint for more long-lead\npredictability of some extreme weather events than we might otherwise have\nanticipated.”Heat waves can be predicted with confidence in short-term\nforecasts, but these become increasingly unreliable beyond several days. Most\nlonger-term, seasonal forecasts, which look at weather probabilities a month\nor more in the future, do not focus on heat waves or other extreme events.The\nnew technique may help with those seasonal forecasts. “We’ve really gone in\nwith a focus on these high-temperature extremes,” Dr. McKinnon said. “If we do\nsee the pattern, we can say how similar is this to the one that leads to a\nheat wave.”To test their approach, the researchers looked at the summer of\n2012, when three heat waves occurred in the East in June and July.Seasonal\nforecasts had predicted that normal temperatures would be most likely that\nsummer in the Northeast and Midwest. But in examining the ocean data\nretroactively, Dr. McKinnon said, “as early as mid-May, we saw the imprint of\nthis pattern in the Pacific.”Peter Huybers, a climate scientist at Harvard\nUniversity and an author of the study, said that it was not yet clear why\nthere was a connection between temperatures in the North Pacific and heat\nwaves in the East.One possibility, he said, is that the temperatures on the\nsea surface lock in undulations in the jet stream that lead to a large mass of\nhigh-pressure air settling over the region, allowing it to bake.\n\n","title":"Scientists Find a Way to Predict U.S. Heat Waves Weeks in Advance - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Scientists find a way to predict U.S. heat waves weeks in advance https://t.co/zeMAHmG3iS","date":"Mon Mar 28 15:40:56 +0000 2016","favs":140,"id":{"$numberLong":"714477380161703936"},"retweets":96},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22HB1EB"}

Some were\nexiles fleeing fighting.They shared an opposition to the war, societal norms\nand hierarchies in the arts.Nationalistic tendencies, they believed, had\ncaused the war. In abstraction, they found a universal language to respond to\nwarfare.Rejecting a strict definition of “art,” they experimented with new\nmaterials and innovative techniques. Montages, collages and found objects were\nfavored. That’s how a urinal — Marcel Duchamp’s “Fountain” — became an icon of\n20th-century art.Some believe that the word Dada originated from the Romanian\nfor “yes, yes,” so it skewers yes-men, but it also invites anyone to join and\ndefine art as they wish. Tristan Tzara, a Dada founder, was Romanian.The\nmovement waned in the 1920s.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01503"},"content":"The thing about dictators is they don’t have to answer any stinking questions\nfrom the press. We call it undemocratic; they call it job security.That’s why\nPresident Obama’s joint news briefing with President Raúl Castro of Cuba last\nweek was so extraordinary. For the first time since the earliest days of the\nrevolution, independent reporters posed tough questions to a Cuban president\nnamed Castro on Cuban soil for a Cuban television audience, live. It was a\nmoment all of us would have talked a lot more about had ISIS not intruded with\nmass murder in Brussels.The first question came from Jim Acosta of CNN, whose\nfather fled the island on the eve of the Cuban missile crisis, and he made\nsure the opportunity didn’t go to waste. “Why do you have Cuban political\nprisoners?” he asked. “And why don’t you release them?”You could watch in real\ntime as Mr. Castro came to terms with the idea that this was actually\nhappening. He stammered and got himself into a muddle over how this whole news\nconference deal works, anyway. Was the question directed at _him_? It was only\nwith prompting from President Obama that he finally answered Mr. Acosta,\nthough by demanding a list proving that any such prisoners even existed.\n(Happy to help you out with that, Sir.)Mr. Castro made sure his Cuban audience\ndid not forget who was in charge when he chastised the reporter from state\ntelevision who attempted to join the fun with his own anodyne series of\nquestions. “You are asking too many questions to me,” Mr. Castro told the\neager beaver. “I think questions should be directed to President Obama.”So,\nno, the island’s major daily newspaper, Granma, is not about to do a five-part\nseries on domestic wiretapping. But you really couldn’t begrudge President\nObama for winking at the camera during the news briefing and taking a mini\nvictory lap afterward, telling David Muir of ABC News, “Today, itself, was an\nexhibition of what happens when we have this kind of engagement.” It was, at\nleast, a tiny step forward for transparency and press freedom in Cuba.And that\nis truly great, really. Now, much as I hate to break up the festivities, Mr.\nPresident. ...What Mr. Obama helped enable in Cuba, albeit briefly, he and his\nadministration are helping to erode back home.He’s got company, and I’ll get\nto that. But let’s begin with the latest regressive news from the United\nStates press freedom front, which came by way of The Associated Press just two\ndays before Air Force One took off for Havana. The A.P. reported that this\nadministration had set a  record for failing to fulfill requests made under\nthe Freedom of Information Act, which requires federal agencies to answer all\nreasonable inquiries, with some exemptions for national security, privacy and\nlaw enforcement matters.The act often provides the best tunnel into the\notherwise impenetrable federal bureaucracy, exposing wrongdoing and\nincompetence. It can be vital if you want to find out how your town’s water\nbecame undrinkable, for example, or how the administration arrived at the\nlegal justification for the targeted drone killing of an American citizen\nabroad.It was more than a little disappointing when the White House press\nsecretary, Josh Earnest, gave The A.P. an answer that was not all that\ndifferent from the one Mr. Castro offered in Havana; he was not familiar with\nThe A.P.’s numbers on F.O.I.A. requests, Mr. Earnest said, so he did not speak\nto them directly.You could write off the whole affair as bureaucratic\nbungling, if it did not fit a broader pattern during Mr. Obama’s two terms —\nthe criminal investigations into government leakers and whistle-blowers by his\nJustice Department; related incidents of snooping into reporters’ phone\nrecords and emails; and a more general press strategy that frequently puts the\npresident in front of opinion writers and non-journalist media personalities\nbut rarely provides formal interviews to the reporters who cover him daily,\nmany of whom work for traditional newspapers and wire services.Granted, his\nWhite House has been savvy in using new and alternative media in ways the\ncurrent crop of presidential candidates would be wise to follow. Appearances\nlike the one with the comedian Zach Galifianakis on the website Funny or Die,\nand on the comic Marc Maron’s “W.T.F.” podcast, expose Mr. Obama to audiences\nthat are tuning out traditional media.But the strategy can produce awkward\nresults, as it did last week just hours after the Brussels attacks. His main\nsit-down interview of the day was with ESPN, at an exhibition baseball game.\nBy necessity, the conversation toggled between the horror in Brussels and the\nuniversal injustices of home-field officiating.More subtle — and important —\nby avoiding the press corps that covers him daily, Mr. Obama undercuts the\ntraditional journalism that he says he holds dear, which is already fighting\nfor its survival against the wave of new media that the president is riding\nwith such agility.His aides argue that the president can do it all,\ntraditional and upstart. And he will possibly speak for himself about it on\nMonday night when he addresses reporters at the annual Toner Prize  dinner,\nnamed in honor of our deceased Times colleague Robin Toner, who passionately\nbelieved that basic journalistic priorities — substance over noise — should be\ninviolate.But his speech will be a coda. What matters more now is what comes\nnext. The emeritus CBS News anchor Bob Schieffer has a theory I’ll call\nSchieffer’s Law:“Every administration becomes more secretive and more\nmanipulative than the previous one,” he told me, campaign promises\nnotwithstanding. “Each one learns from the one that came before.”Hillary\nClinton, the Democratic front-runner, has faced questions about her openness\nbecause of the private email server she kept as secretary of state and her\nlong stretches between news conferences. (Her opponent for the Democratic\nnomination, Bernie Sanders, has made himself plenty accessible, though he has\nyet to be tested with similar scrutiny, a sign to some of his supporters of\nmedia neglect.)The Republican front-runner, Donald J. Trump, is available\nbeyond what any political reporter could have expected. But he is also running\non a promise to make it easier to sue journalists for libel.And then, there\nare the stringent terms the Trump campaign set back in November for how the\nfive major television networks could cover his rallies, guidelines that still\nstand (and that I learned about in detail last week). The TV personnel are to\nenter their designated pens 15 minutes before he speaks and stay there until\nhe is done. Then, they can roam the crowd but they cannot freely approach the\n“rope line” where Mr. Trump shakes hands and chitchats with his supporters,\nsaying who knows what. The campaign cited safety and the candidate’s desire to\nconnect with his voters without cameras intruding.Still, I was surprised that\nnetwork executives agreed to go along with such constrictive terms, which do\nnot apply to Clinton and Sanders rallies. In interviews, executives said it\nwas the price of admission for their cameras, correspondents and crews, but\nthey would keep arguing for fewer restrictions. “This is an ongoing process,”\nChris Isham, the CBS News Washington bureau chief, told me. “We’re continuing\nto push on a number of different fronts.”That’s heartening. But Mr. Obama’s\ntrip to Havana was a good reminder of what’s in jeopardy. Our press freedoms\nwere so hard-won that we should be careful not to volunteer any of them away.\nJust ask Tamoa Calzadilla, an investigative reporter who toiled in Venezuela\nuntil recently joining the Spanish-language network Univision in Miami earlier\nthis year. Ms. Calzadilla’s work at home had led to government interrogation,\nsuspicious break-ins and, ultimately, a fear for her life. She had a message\nfor the United States: “I want to tell the journalists, and the people, that\nthey must be constantly aware of the danger of a less-free press.”I met Ms.\nCalzadilla last week while visiting Univision in Miami, where there was a\nlingering excitement from the Castro news conference. Many journalists at the\nnetwork have covered repressive regimes in their native countries and have\nstories that are similar to Ms. Calzadilla’s. When Mr. Castro asked for a list\nof political prisoners, which came with a promise to release any that came to\nhis attention, they sprang into action to post a list online. Shocker: Nothing\ncame of it.Yet, it was a start. And isn’t that something? As one of the\nWestern Hemisphere’s last communist strongmen begins to ever so slightly lower\nthe barriers for reporters, his free-market neighbors, led by the ultimate\ncapitalist, increasingly herd them into quarantine.\n\n","title":"A Castro Met a Free Press, and the World Watched It Live - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesbusiness: What Obama helped enable in Cuba, he and his administration are helping to erode back home https://t.co/0oc66ddwDi htt…","date":"Mon Mar 28 13:46:59 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714448703235428353"},"retweets":69},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21OW2Y3"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01504"},"content":"He said he’d be all right, right?“The Walking Dead” flirted with inciting a\nriot to close out the penultimate episode of Season 6, spraying the lens with\nwhat sure looked like Daryl’s blood before fading to black. Dwight, the\nPhantom of the Backwoods, appeared to blast him at close range, flipping the\nscript on the revenge-driven bow-slinger and probably reclaiming the bow from\nhim to boot.“It’s gonna go wrong out here,” Glenn had warned Daryl earlier,\nspeaking for all of us. And so it did.I hedged in my interpretation above\nbecause, as with the notorious Schrödinger’s Glenn  arc from the first half of\nthe season, the show was tricky about how it presented the final scene. I\nassume Dwight shot Daryl and I assume it wasn’t fatal, partly because of\nDwight’s assurance — though he could’ve been talking to Rosita or someone else\nwhen he said “You’ll be all right” — but mostly for the same reason I never\nquite believed Glenn was dead. The writers know how emotionally invested\nviewers are in the core characters and I don’t think they would kill one off\nin vague fashion. Secondarily, I sense a semi-decency within Dwight, despite\nwhat we saw with Denise last week, and don’t think executions are his style.Of\ncourse, I’ve been wrong before, so perhaps Carol can spare a few grains of\nsalt from her go bag. Do I find the gamesmanship kind of lame after the Glenn\nshenanigans last fall? Yes, but I’m not going to dwell on it.The shooting was\nthe only somewhat surprising aspect of a misguided vengeance mission that we\nknew, from the moment we heard Daryl fire up his motorcycle, was going to go\nawry. From there — as Rosita let him go, in a tacit endorsement of the plan,\nand then piled into the van with Glenn and Michonne — it was clear the episode\nwas all about getting people captured for next week’s showdown with Negan.\nThat made it feel sort of perfunctory, though there were some exciting moments\nwith Carol.I laughed out loud watching her drive down the road in her little\nporcupine hatchback, which was like some Fury Road version of Garth Algar’s\nMirthmobile. But things got unfunny in a hurry.We know Carol wants to stop\nkilling people. We also know that even if you leave a community that needs\nprotecting, you’ll still be required to protect yourself. And in the “Walking\nDead” world that usually includes killing.Carol has to know this, too — I\nimagine her hope is to increase her odds of avoiding conflict by going solo.\nBut in case it wasn’t clear, it took just over 12 klicks of driving to remind\nher that wherever she goes, violence will probably follow. After an oncoming\ngroup of Saviors shot out her tires, Carol went into little bird mode, Melissa\nMcBride again blurring the lines between real angst and artifice.“I’m not\ngoing anywhere,” she whimpered. You got that right, replied a cocky Savior\ncalled Jiro, a name (pronounced “hero”) designed, I’m guessing, to further\nplay with the good-guy bad-guy distinctions that have been a theme\nlately.Carol pleaded and dangled her crucifix from one sleeve, the better to\ndistract her targets as she blasted them with the other, which concealed what?\nAn Uzi? Some sort of hand-held Gatling gun? It didn’t look like there was\nenough room. Any theories about this? I was reminded of Rose McGowan in\n“Grindhouse,” but I don’t think Carol had enough time between Alexandria and\nthe showdown to make the necessary modifications.She dispatched one last\nSavior with a car spike and then wandered off, having notched another few\nkills in spite of her best efforts (that brings her to 23 or 25, I believe).\nWas she shot or otherwise wounded? I didn’t see it, but the camera seemed\nobsessed with puddling blood on the pavement, and then there was the blood\ntrail waiting for Morgan and Rick when they arrived.Rick didn’t even wait for\nthe mortally wounded Hiro to die before putting a knife into his brain. (That\nbrings him to 23 or 25,000, I believe.) “I don’t take chances anymore,” he\ntold Morgan later. Well O.K. then.The leisurely pursuit gave Rick and Morgan a\nchance to catch up, the latter finally coming clean about his basement Wolf.\nPeople can change, he said, per usual. I let that Wolf live, and he saved\nDenise, which allowed her to save Carl. He glossed over the fact that Denise\nwouldn’t have needed saving if he’d just killed the Wolf in the basement, or\nin the forest last season. But Morgan’s never been one to let dialectical\ncoherence get in the way of his sanctimony.We’ll perhaps have another case\nstudy to work with if the guy Morgan kept Rick from shooting comes back,\neither to help or harm the group. But the bottom line is you just never know\nhow things are going to go down, whether you’re Carol trying to swear off\nbloodshed or Rick not taking chances or Morgan clocking people with sticks\ninstead of blades because he thinks all life is precious.Like some commenters\npredicted last week, Morgan eventually sent Rick home and went after Carol by\nhimself, seeming to feel partially responsible for her recent change of heart.\nWho knows what he’ll find next week, but something tells me he’ll be happy he\nhas that gun after all.Finally there was Maggie, who got herself a mom-cut but\nmight not need it.The precariousness of Maggie’s pregnancy has been a\npersistent subplot this half of the season, through the Battle of Alexandria,\nthe assault on the Saviors and her subsequent captivity and abuse. We peeped\ninto her and Glenn’s shower on Sunday and saw the bruising on her torso, and I\ncan’t decide whether that makes it more or less likely that her pregnancy is\nin real danger. (Was the show foreshadowing a miscarriage, or was it\nmisdirection?)But I know one thing that won’t help: The doctor took an arrow\nin the eye last week. Is this when we discover that Enid has a Doogie Howser-\nlike precocity in the medical arts? Or will a finale we already know is going\nto go badly be even darker than we feared?So it’s finally here: Negan will\narrive next Sunday and it seems pretty certain someone we like is going away,\nin brutal fashion. I hope I’m wrong but I don’t think I am — even Robert\nKirkman, the “Walking Dead” creator, is saying the episode will be shocking\nand heartbreaking.I suspect a minor clue lay in the happy couples montage in\nthe early part of Sunday’s episode, which included scenes of Glenn and Maggie,\nAbraham and Sasha, Rick and Michonne. I’m pretty sure it will be one of them\nwho gets it. “The world is ours and we know how to take it,” Rick told\nMichonne. “Everything we need is right here inside these walls, and we’re not\nlosing any of it again.” (Somebody knock on wood!)That said, let’s take a\nbrief look at the most likely candidates to get Negan’d next week, starting\nwith the one who isn’t paired off. (I realize Rosita is among the captured and\nothers below are not, but I don’t think her loss would be wrenching enough to\nhonor what was a huge moment in the comics. Sorry, Rosita.)**Daryl** Could you\nsee him being badly injured, sacrificing himself by goading Negan into taking\nhim out in order to save someone else and also put him out of his misery? I\nsure could. But something tells me his injury takes him out of the running.\nThe Saviors are all about statement kills, and a wounded guy seems too easy.\n(Of course, Daryl could already be dead, but in that case “Walking Dead” fans\nwill be too busy rioting for any of this to matter.)**Michonne** This would\ndefinitely be a heartbreaking loss and things don’t tend to work out so well\nfor Rick’s love interests. And who knows, maybe Danai Gurira is ready to move\non and focus on her thriving theater career. But again, though Michonne is a\nfearsome warrior, from an optics perspective she doesn’t strike me as the most\nimpressive person to take out.**Glenn** Perhaps the odds-on favorite for a\nvariety of reasons, some of which I won’t get into for potential spoiler\nreasons. Did you catch that portentous shot on Sunday of Maggie in the van’s\nrearview mirror as Glenn drove off? Was that the last time he will ever see\nher? Could the whole “Is Glenn Dead?” business last fall have been a way to\nremind fans to appreciate him before he’s cruelly ripped away? Perhaps. But\nsomething about him seems too obvious.**Abraham** I made a case for him a few\nweeks ago. I think Abraham came into this show ready to die and reached a sort\nof inner peace during that fight at the Hilltop. Sure, he told Sasha last week\nthat it “could be 30 years for us here,” but even that might have been a\nmisdirection. And Sasha aside, the show has been subtly cutting his emotional\nties: first Rosita, and then Eugene last week, who told Abraham he didn’t need\nhim anymore. Abraham is also the biggest, fiercest looking of the Alexandrians\nand also the one most likely to fire off a hilariously derisive jibe at a\nbrute with a baseball bat. Even though he’s currently safe in Alexandria, if I\nwas a betting man, this is where I’d put my money.Of course it could end up\nbeing more than one, or none, of the above. Who do you think is going to get\nit? Please share your theories, or anything else that seems relevant, in the\ncomments.\n\n","title":"‘The Walking Dead’ Season 6, Episode 15: Who Won’t Survive the Season? - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesarts: #TheWalkingDead recap: “It’s gonna go wrong out here,” Glenn warned.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01505"},"content":"SHAXI, China — The woman shuffled around her shop in the village square,\ntelling visitors how she came to be selling wooden swords and woven slippers\nto tourists rather than tending to her fields.He Yuqing, 60, wore a blue tunic\nand apron, common among older ethnic Bai women of this verdant valley in the\nHimalayan foothills. In the plaza outside, afternoon sunlight fell across\ncobblestones on which horse caravans once trod.She said she had been renting\nthe shop from the local government for eight years. If an international\narchitecture team had not restored the square’s ramshackle wooden buildings,\nshe said, she would be doing hard labor among her fields of corn, fruit and\ngrains.“Before they restored this, it just wasn’t as beautiful,” she said.\n“They did a good job.”In a project little known outside China, a Swiss-led\nteam worked for years to renovate the square of Sideng Village. The square was\nthe site of the main market in Shaxi, a valley dotted with Bai villages in the\nHengduan Mountains of southwest China.The renovators aimed to remake Sideng’s\nformer marketplace to be fully consistent with historical design and artwork,\na commitment rare in China. They say the project could be a model for other\nvillage renovation efforts in the country. It has been praised by Unesco, the\nUnited Nations cultural agency.The restored buildings include a centuries-old\nBuddhist temple that had been converted to government offices after the\nCommunists took over China in 1949. Facing the temple is a four-story theater\nwith soaring eaves and an outdoor performance terrace for local orchestras.\nEvery June, valley residents converge on the plaza to hold the Torch Festival,\nin which they erect and light on fire a towering pine trunk.The village square\nis now considered by some to be one of the most beautiful in China. It evokes\nthe era when the Tea and Horse Caravan Trail passed through the valley. This\npart of Yunnan Province lies east of the Tibetan plateau, and Tibetans traded\nhorses for tea that was then transported across the plateau, all the way to\nLhasa.Yet, Shaxi remains free of the tourist hordes that swarm the streets of\nLijiang, a drive of just a couple of hours to the north, and Dali, a couple of\nhours to the south. They, too, have renovated ancient town centers, but the\nnew homes and storefronts there were built haphazardly.“When the Chinese do\nthis, they think, ‘How can I attract as many people as possible to this\nplace?’” said Chris Barclay, the American owner of a boutique guesthouse, the\nOld Theatre Inn, in the countryside outside the Sideng square. “None of that\nhas happened here, which is great.”Mr. Barclay and his wife have been using\ntheir own money to renovate the Pear Orchard Temple, mainly in thanks to the\nfertility aspect of the goddess Guanyin there. His Thai wife, a Buddhist,\nbecame pregnant at age 45 after praying to Guanyin on a visit; their first\nchild had died years earlier.Mr. Barclay said he had also been inspired by the\nmarketplace work done in Sideng.That project began with Jacques Feiner, a\nSwiss conservation expert who had worked on the old city in Sana, Yemen.\nAround 2000, he was looking for a project along the South Silk Road and\nsettled on the Shaxi Valley because the scale of the Sideng marketplace was\nmanageable, said Huang Yinwu, a team leader and Swiss-trained architect.At Mr.\nFeiner’s urging, the World Monuments Fund, based in New York, added the\nmarketplace to its 2002 watch list of 100 Most Endangered Sites. The Swiss\nFederal Institute of Technology in Zurich and the government of Jianchuan\nCounty put together a conservation team.Mr. Huang, originally from Hubei\nProvince, joined the team and came to Shaxi in 2003. The team had an advantage\ndoing conservation here: The local Bai carpenters are considered among the\nmost skilled in China and get commissions across the country.“In this process,\nthe main purpose was to understand the local tradition, the local knowledge,\nthe local craftsmanship,” Mr. Huang said. “We wanted to see how far we could\ngo with the local knowledge.”The team restored low-slung wooden facades around\nthe old marketplace and a 100-year-old caravansary. Most of the plaza’s\nbuildings are just a century old because they have been repeatedly rebuilt —\nbandits burned down the buildings in constant raids.When the project began,\nmost of the buildings had been abandoned. In 2006, the buds of commerce\nappeared. A couple from faraway Shenzhen asked to rent one of the smaller\nbuildings near the theater; they wanted to live there and turn it into a\ncafe.Mr. Huang said this went against his idea for the plaza — he had intended\nfor the fronts to be shops and the interiors to be courtyards open to the\npublic.“I didn’t agree to that,” he said with a laugh as he sat in the square\none recent morning, pointing to the Old Tree Cafe run by the couple. “The\ngovernment wanted them to move in, so they started living there and running\nthe business there.”The Xingjiao Temple took four years to refurbish. A fierce\nblue guardian deity and a red one flank the main entrance. The Bai here\nworship local gods and practice Esoteric Buddhism.“Having the temple and\ntheater together facing each other is a local custom,” Mr. Huang said. “The\nlocals think the Buddha should enjoy the performances along with the people.\nI’m working on another temple in Shaxi where there is a stage in the main\ntemple area. You move a wooden god to face the stage.”That temple, Chenghuang,\nis part of the next phase of the renovation project, as envisioned by Mr.\nHuang: founding community centers across Shaxi to help residents tap into the\ntourist economy.Mr. Huang, who still lives in Shaxi even though his Swiss\nteammates have left, said the first such center would be at Chenghuang Temple.\nHis plans call for the centers to have computers where villagers can go\nonline; tourists following cycling and walking routes through the valley would\nmingle with the villagers at those centers.Thirteen villages would be part of\nthis network, and residents might start homegrown industries like craft beer\nto appeal to the tourist crowds, he said.“We can have Internet-based\neducation,” he said. “This is a way to help people to understand more and get\nthe capability to develop things on their own.”Guesthouses and cafes have\nboomed in Sideng Village, but they are mostly run by outsider Chinese rather\nthan locals.The Shaxi Horse Pen 46 Youth Hostel next to the central theater\nwas opened in 2010 by Huo Wanfei, 36, who moved here from Sichuan Province\nafter visiting as a backpacker. Now that the Swiss-led team is done with the\nplaza, these Chinese outsiders are the main force behind renovating buildings,\nmostly to start tourist businesses.Ms. Huo said she had employed local\ncarpenters and completed the renovation after much trial and error.“It made me\nrealize there’s a way in nature that makes things work out,” she said.The\nevolution of the village is beginning to mirror what happened in Lijiang. The\nlocals are renting out their homes to outsiders and moving elsewhere. So\nvisitors to Sideng increasingly meet Chinese outsiders and not Bai locals like\nMs. He.“The market is driving Shaxi in this direction,” Mr. Huang said. “This\nis not something in our control. That is why I’m doing this new project to\nencourage a community economy.”\n\n","title":"An Ancient Caravan Town in China Is Reborn - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"An ancient caravan town in China is reborn https://t.co/OkaMHLgqno https://t.co/cBu7v1BJf6","date":"Mon Mar 28 12:29:05 +0000 2016","favs":260,"id":{"$numberLong":"714429101575168000"},"retweets":118},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21OTwRz"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01506"},"content":"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — A suicide bomber set off a powerful blast close to a\nchildren’s swing set in a public park on Sunday evening in the eastern city of\nLahore, killing at least 69 people and wounding around 300, rescue workers and\nofficials said.The blast occurred in a parking lot at Gulshan-e-Iqbal Park,\none of the largest parks in Lahore, said Haider Ashraf, a senior police\nofficial in the city. The bomb was detonated within several feet of the swings\nin a park crowded with families on Easter.Jamaat-e-Ahrar, a splinter faction\nof the Pakistani Taliban, claimed responsibility for the blast. Its spokesman,\nEhsanullah Ehsan, said in a statement that Christians were the target.It was\nthe third bombing in Pakistan in this month alone, a reminder that even as the\nmilitary has cracked down on extremists over the past two years, Islamist\ngroups remain a potent threat.The bombing came as large protests were held in\nother parts of the country to protest the execution in February of the man who\nmurdered a secular politician five years ago. While public opinion has largely\nbeen galvanized by attacks on civilians by jihadists, particularly the killing\nof 150 people at a school in Peshawar in 2014, the protests are a sign that\nwidespread sympathy remains for extremist groups in Pakistan.The\nJamaat-e-Ahrar spokesman, Mr. Ehsan, said the bombing “was also to give a\nmessage to government that it cannot deter us even in their stronghold,\nLahore.” Lahore, the capital of Punjab Province, is the hometown of Pakistan’s\nprime minister, Nawaz Sharif; his younger brother, Shahbaz Sharif, is the\nchief minister of the province.Even though Pakistani officials rebutted the\nclaim that Christians were the target, a large number of Christian families\nwere in the park because of the Easter holiday, the local news media reported.\nThe 67-acre park has walking paths, as well as rides for children.As the\ncountry reeled from this latest spasm of violence, the civilian and military\nleadership huddled separately to deal with the precipitating sense of crisis.\nPrime Minister Sharif held a four-hour meeting with his top ministers while\nGen. Raheel Sharif, the army chief, who is not related to the prime minister\nor his brother, directed intelligence agencies to investigate the attack and\nbring the perpetrators to justice.Victims described a scene of chaos and\ndevastation soon after the blast.“I was standing near the roller coaster when\nthe blast occurred,” said a 10-year-old boy who gave his name as Usman Ghani,\nand who was being treated for minor injuries at Shaikh Zayed Hospital. “I saw\nfire afterward. There were a lot of people in the park. It was so crowded that\npeople had to break the boundary wall near the gate to cross over and run\naway.”“I wish I hadn’t brought my daughter to the park today,” said Kamran\nBhatti, 34, a frequent visitor to the park. “This is the only recreation we\ncan afford for her. What is her fault?”He continued: “While we were running\nout of the park, my daughter slipped and rolled over. She’s injured, but I\nthank my God that we are not crying for a lost child.”His daughter, 7, was\nbeing treated for an injury to her leg at Jinnah Hospital on Sunday\nnight.Yousaf Masih, 50, who said he is Christian, said: “We came to the park\nafter the Easter church services. We brought our food basket along with us,\nand like the usual outing on our festivals, we were spending our day.”“There\nwas a lot of rush due to Easter,” Mr. Masih said, adding that “a majority” of\nthe people in that area of the park were Christian. “My children were playing\ncricket when we heard a huge blast on the main gate of the park. It was\nmayhem. Everyone was running for their lives. On our way out, we saw the body\nof the suicide bomber in the parking area.”Others said security at the park\nwas lax.“There was no security, as such, at the gates,” said Azhar Shah, 23, a\nstudent. “The guard sitting at the main gate was not checking anyone.”Mr.\nAshraf, the police official, said of the park: “It was a soft target. Innocent\nwomen and children and visitors from other cities have been targeted.”The\nState Department condemned the attack. “Attacks like these only deepen our\nshared resolve to defeat terrorism around the world, and we will continue to\nwork with our partners in Pakistan and across the region to combat the threat\nof terrorism,” it said in a statement.The explosion coincided with violence in\nother parts of the country as hundreds of protesters took to the streets to\ncondemn the Feb. 29 execution of Malik Mumtaz Hussain Qadri for the 2011\nkilling of a governor, Salmaan Taseer. Mr. Taseer had campaigned for changes\nin the country’s blasphemy laws, saying they were used to persecute religious\nminorities, but to many in Pakistan, the idea of altering the country’s\nblasphemy laws is itself criminal, and Mr. Qadri has become a revered figure\nto his supporters.Protesters clashed throughout the day with police officers\nin Islamabad, the country’s capital, marching on the main avenues of the city\nand trying to force their way into the city’s “red zone,” a high-security area\nthat includes the Parliament, the Supreme Court and many diplomatic missions.\nThey set several vehicles, including a fire truck, on fire and damaged public\nproperty. The police used tear gas to disperse the protesters, but appeared to\nbe overwhelmed by their numbers. Army troops were called in to secure\ngovernment buildings.Pakistan has been shaken by a series of attacks this\nyear. A suicide attack on a court in Peshawar was carried out early this month\nin retribution for Mr. Qadri’s execution, killing 16. The attack was also\nclaimed by Jamaat-e-Ahrar. Also this month, a bomb left on a bus carrying\ngovernment employees in Peshawar killed 14.A state of emergency was imposed on\nhospitals in Lahore after Sunday’s blast. Private television networks\nbroadcast images of rescue workers and ambulances rushing to the park and\nferrying victims to hospitals.

He\nwas 78.The cause was heart failure, his publisher, Grove Atlantic, said on\nMonday.A native of Michigan, Mr. Harrison lived most recently during the\nsummers in the wild countryside near Livingston, Mont., where he\nenthusiastically shot the rattlesnakes that colonized his yard, and during the\nwinters in Patagonia, where he enthusiastically shot all kinds of things.In\nboth places, far from the self-regarding literary soirees of New York, for\nwhich he had little but contempt, and the lucre of Hollywood, where he had\ndone time as a dazzlingly dissolute if not altogether successful screenwriter,\nhe could engage in the essential, monosyllabic pursuits that defined the\nborders of his life: to walk, drive, hunt, fish, cook, drink, smoke, write.The\nresult was prodigious: 21 volumes of fiction, including “Legends of the Fall”\n(1979), a collection of three novellas whose title piece, about a Montana\nfamily ravaged by World War I, became a 1994 film starring Brad Pitt; 14 books\nof poetry; two books of essays; a memoir; and a children’s book.His most\nrecent book of fiction, “The Ancient Minstrel,” was published this month. A\nbook of poetry, “Dead Man’s Float,” was published this year.[ Read an\nappraisal of Jim Harrison’s writing ]In Mr. Harrison’s fiction, especially,\nlay some of the most vivid, violent and evocative writing of its day — work\nthat in the estimation of many critics captured the resonant, almost mythic\nsoul of 20th-century rural America.“His books glisten with love of the world,\nand are as grounded as Thoreau’s in the particulars of American place — its\nrivers and thickets, its highways and taverns,” Will Blythe wrote in The New\nYork Times Book Review in 2007, reviewing Mr. Harrison’s novel “Returning to\nEarth.” He added, “Bawdily and with unrelenting gusto, Harrison’s 40 years’\nworth of writing explores what constitutes a good life, both aesthetically and\nmorally, on this planet.”Though not strictly a household name, Mr. Harrison\nwas long esteemed by a large, devoted cohort of readers in North America. He\nwas also hugely popular in Europe — especially in France, where he was\nvenerated as a cult author.Considered a master of the novella, a rarely\ncultivated discipline, Mr. Harrison was also known for his essays on food: He\nwas perhaps the leading exponent of the small subgenre in which shotguns and\nshoe leather play a far greater role than balsamic reduction.His food writing,\nmuch of which first appeared in Esquire, was collected in his 2001 book, “The\nRaw and the Cooked,” whose title invokes the anthropologist Claude Lévi-\nStrauss’s volume of that name. Mr. Lévi-Strauss’s book is about myth and\nritual. Mr. Harrison’s is about rituals that include his flying to France for\nthe sole purpose of having lunch — a lunch that spanned 11 hours, 37 courses\nand 19 wines.Because of his books’ hypermasculine subject matter, their\nfrequent setting amid the woods and trout streams of the Upper Peninsula of\nMichigan and his own knockabout life, Mr. Harrison was chronically, and to his\nunrelieved disgust, compared to one man.In fact, his prose is nothing like\nHemingway’s: It is jazzier, more lyrical and more darkly comic. His\ncharacters, more marginal and far less self-assured — many abandon jobs and\nfamilies to light out in search of meaning they never find — are handled with\ngreater tenderness.“Driving out of the woods I felt a new and curious calm but\ndoubted it would last,” the rootless narrator of Mr. Harrison’s first novel,\n“Wolf” (1971), says as he returns reluctantly to civilization after a sojourn\nin the wild. He continues:“When I reached the main road I would stop at a gas\nstation and make a reservation at a hotel in Ishpeming and when I got there I\nknew I would shower and go down to the bar and drink myself into the comatose\nstate I knew I deserved. Maybe King David drank heavily in his canopied tent\nthe night before battle.”At bottom, Mr. Harrison was not so much like\nHemingway as he was like something out of Hemingway. Or, more accurately,\nsomething out of Rabelais — a mustachioed, barrel-chested bear of a man whose\nunapologetic immoderation encompassed a dazzling repertory:There was the\neating. Mr. Harrison once faced down 144 oysters, just to see if he could\nfinish them. (He could.)There was the drinking. One fine summer, he personally\ntested 38 varieties of Côtes du Rhône. (“It was like a small wine festival.\nJust me, really,” he told The Washington Post afterward.)There was the\ndrugging, in his Hollywood period, when he wrote the screenplays for films\nincluding “Revenge” (1990), starring Kevin Costner and based on Mr. Harrison’s\nnovella of that name.There was the hobnobbing with his spate of famous\nfriends, including Jack Nicholson, John Huston, Bill Murray and Jimmy\nBuffett.All these ingredients were titanically encapsulated in a dinner Mr.\nHarrison once shared with Orson Welles, which involved, he wrote, “a half-\npound of beluga with a bottle of Stolichnaya, a salmon in sorrel sauce,\nsweetbreads en croûte, a miniature leg of lamb (the whole thing) with five\nwines, desserts, cheeses, ports” and a chaser of cocaine.But constructing Mr.\nHarrison merely as a rough-and-ready man of appetite — a perennial conceit of\nprofile writers, and one he did relatively little to dispel — ignores the deep\nintellectualism of the writer and his work. In conversation, he could range\neasily and without affectation over Freud, Kierkegaard, Stravinsky, Zen\nBuddhism, Greek oral epic and ballet.An acclaimed poet before he began writing\nfiction — his collections include “Plain Song” (1965), “The Theory \u0026amp;\nPractice of Rivers” (1989) and “Songs of Unreason” (2011) — Mr. Harrison\nreceived a Guggenheim fellowship for his poetry in 1969.Throughout his work,\nMr. Harrison was intensely concerned with the natural world, though he was\nprobably America’s least effete nature writer. There are no dewy prospects in\nhis poetry and prose, but rather looming, unfathomable landscapes with the\npower to unleash an almost biblical violence.Yet for all this — and for all\nits man-made violence (in “Legends of the Fall,” for instance, one character\nkills another with a pitchfork) — the world of his fiction is an eminently\nmoral place, one in which vengeance follows violation with a ruthless internal\nlogic.Counterbalancing the undertow that pulls at Mr. Harrison’s characters\nare food, alcohol, sex and outdoorsmanship, ideally in combination. As he\noften said, this restorative cocktail was his own remedy of choice for the\nbouts of deep depression from which he had suffered all his life.“If you’ve\nknown a lot of actresses and models,” he once confided with characteristic\nplain-spokenness to a rapt audience at a literary gathering, “you return to\nwaitresses because at least they smell like food.”What united Mr. Harrison’s\nliterary output was an acute awareness of the sustenance that close\nobservation of ordinary things can offer, as well as an essential truth he\nsummarized in a 1980 interview with The Washington Post:“I’m always having a\nman in desperate straits trying to help somebody else out with no apparent\nsuccess,” Mr. Harrison said, “because nobody can be helped by anybody.”That\ntruth became evident when he was very young. James Thomas Harrison was born on\nDec. 11, 1937, in Grayling, in northern Michigan, the son of Winfield Harrison\nand the former Norma Walgren; he was reared in Reed City, 90 miles\naway.Winfield Harrison, a county agricultural agent, passed on to his son a\nlove of books as well as more pragmatic endowments that would be useful in\nlife and in literature. (“When you sit in a bar,” the elder Mr. Harrison\ncounseled, “never curl your feet under the rungs of a bar stool in case you’re\nsucker punched.”)When Jim was 7, as he recounted in a memoir, “Off to the\nSide” (2002), a neighborhood girl ended a quarrel by thrusting a broken bottle\ninto his face, permanently blinding his left eye. For years afterward, he\nsought solace alone in the woods.He also found solace in fiction — his father\nhad turned him on to Faulkner, which became a lifelong passion — and by the\ntime Jim was a teenager, he was determined to be a writer. His father\nencouraged him, buying him a typewriter for about $15.When Jim Harrison was in\nhis early 20s, his father and his 19-year-old sister, Judith, were killed on a\nhunting trip, when their car was struck by a drunken driver. Jim had also been\ninvited but had vacillated before choosing not to go.The decision probably\nsaved his life. But in delaying the start of the trip, which put his father\nand sister on the road at precisely the wrong moment, he felt he had caused\ntheir deaths.Mr. Harrison earned a bachelor’s degree in comparative literature\nfrom Michigan State University, where his classmates included the future\nnovelist Thomas McGuane, followed by a master’s in the field there. In the\nmid-1960s, he taught briefly at the State University of New York at Stony\nBrook before turning his back on academe for the writing life.It was a life of\nreal poverty at first. His first three works of fiction — “Wolf” was followed\nby the novels “A Good Day to Die” (1973) and “Farmer” (1976) — were well\nreviewed but not hugely successful commercially. There was no security in\npoetry.By then a husband and father, Mr. Harrison was earning barely $10,000 a\nyear. He considered suicide.He pulled himself through by starting work on\n“Letters to Yesenin,” published in 1973 and widely considered his finest\nvolume of verse. Its title invokes the great Russian poet Sergei Yesenin, who\ncommitted suicide in 1925, at 30.In a poem from the collection, Mr. Harrison\nwrestles with the decision the poet confronted. But, addressing Yesenin, he\nreaches a far different conclusion:With the publication in 1979 of Mr.\nHarrison’s fourth volume of fiction, “Legends of the Fall,” he found his\nmétier in the novella — and with it the commercial success that had long\neluded him.Mr. Harrison had his detractors. With its boozing and brawling and\nbedding, his fiction was often called misogynistic. He did himself no favors\nwith a 1983 Esquire essay in which he called his feminist critics “brie\nbrains” and added, in gleeful self-parody, “Even now, far up in the wilderness\nin my cabin, where I just shot a lamprey passing upstream with my Magnum, I\nwouldn’t have the heart to turn down a platter of hot buttered\ncheerleaders.”But by all accounts he redeemed himself with several later works\nnarrated by strong female protagonists: the novels “Dalva” (1988), about a\nNebraska woman searching for the child she gave up for adoption, and “The Road\nHome” (1998), which continues Dalva’s story; and the novella “Julip” (1994),\nabout a woman trying to free her brother from jail.Mr. Harrison’s wife, the\nformer Linda King, whom he married in 1959, died in October.His survivors\ninclude two daughters, Jamie Potenberg and Anna Hjortsberg; a sister, Mary\nDumsch; a brother, David; and three grandchildren.In an essay in “The Raw and\nthe Cooked,” Mr. Harrison neatly summed up the modus vivendi that had long\nsustained him. He was talking about food, but the imperative clearly applied\nto any of his variegated passions:“The idea,” Mr. Harrison wrote, “is to eat\nwell and not die from it — for the simple reason that that would be the end of\nyour eating.”\n\n","title":"Jim Harrison, Poet, Novelist and Essayist, Is Dead at 78 - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The NYT obituary for Jim Harrison, the free-spirited writer of \"Legends of the Fall\" https://t.co/taPWGHrYRe https://t.co/6EeXVY3dQM","date":"Mon Mar 28 10:40:01 +0000 2016","favs":229,"id":{"$numberLong":"714401653722652672"},"retweets":193},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21NSNQD"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01508"},"content":"Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, who turned 86 on Saturday, has many achievements\nto her name, including serving as a state senator in Arizona and becoming the\nfirst woman appointed to the Supreme Court, where she served for almost a\nquarter-century.Now she can add an accomplishment for the digital era: video\ngame impresario.Justice O’Connor is behind an animated civics education game\ncalled Win the White House, whose latest edition was recently released. The\ngame has been played by more than 250,000 students just this month and is\nbarnstorming its way through middle schools across the United States.In the\ngame — timed to this election cycle — students take on the role of imaginary\npresidential candidates who must learn how to compete civilly against\nopponents with divergent views on issues like immigration and gun control.That\nJustice O’Connor would become an interactive game enthusiast may seem\nunexpected. Until a few years ago, she had never watched a video game — let\nalone played one.“I was one of the uneducated adults,” she joked in a recent\ntelephone interview from her home in Phoenix. Speaking of the learning\nobjective of Win the White House, she explained, “We have to have a system\nthat allows young people to approach problem solving from many different\nviewpoints.”Justice O’Connor became involved in digital games after retiring\nfrom the Supreme Court in 2006. She started iCivics, a nonprofit civics\neducation group, in 2009.The group has since released 19 free online games,\nalong with accompanying lesson plans, with the idea of making civics education\nless about rote learning and more about giving middle school students an\nanimated glimpse into how different branches of government and the\nConstitution work. About 3.2 million students played iCivics games last year,\nthe group said.Justice O’Connor is getting colleagues involved in the effort\nas well. Justice Sonia Sotomayor joined iCivics’ governing board last\nNovember.In a phone interview on Friday, Justice Sotomayor said she thought it\nwas “brilliant of Justice O’Connor to realize that computer games could be a\nvery successful way to interest kids in civics education.” Justice Sotomayor,\nwho said she developed an early interest in law after watching the “Perry\nMason” television show, said she had incorporated iCivics into her own\nfrequent visits to schools, where she encourages students to learn how\ngovernment works and to get involved in their communities.“I thought this was\nreally in keeping with my message to kids about how laws affect you every\nsingle day,” Justice Sotomayor said, adding that she has played the games.\n“They’re fun. I’ve challenged my clerks to play them to see how they do.”The\ninvolvement of the two justices in digital educational games underscores a\ngrowing belief among educators that interactive tools may improve students’\nengagement in their own learning. In January, Microsoft introduced an\neducational version of Minecraft, the popular game in which players use blocks\nto construct elaborate virtual worlds. Last fall, Google unveiled Expeditions,\na virtual reality system for classroom use that takes students on simulated\nfield trips around the world.Teachers who have used Win the White House said\nthe game helped their students experience and understand the complicated\ntrade-offs that candidates often make.Anna Nelson, assistant principal at\nBronx Latin, a high school in New York City, recently divided her 12th-grade\nhonors civics class into Democratic and Republican teams and assigned them to\nplay the game. Along the way, her students learned the difference between\nconservative and liberal political beliefs, and that candidates had to stick\nto the platforms they had chosen, she said. They also learned to select\nrunning mates from different backgrounds to broaden their appeal with\nvoters.“It taught them so many things in one short simulation,” Ms. Nelson\nsaid. Now, when they come to class, they want to discuss new developments in\nthe actual presidential primaries with her, she said.Justice Sotomayor\nsuggested parents play the games with their children as well. “Do you know how\nmany adults don’t know anything about civics?” she said.Justice O’Connor said\nshe started iCivics out of concern that many schools had abandoned the idea of\nteaching students to become engaged citizens. She said she worried that\nstudents would not grow up to become good leaders, or even active voters, if\nthey did not understand, say, the importance of an independent judiciary or\ntheir right to due process.“A quarter of students cannot demonstrate a\nproficient knowledge of how our government works,” Justice O’Connor said,\nwhile “their knowledge of TV shows like ‘American Idol’ is way up there.”She\nsaid she began to seriously investigate the idea of educational games after\nconsulting with James Gee, a professor of literacy studies at Arizona State\nUniversity and the author of a book titled “What Video Games Have to Teach Us\nAbout Learning and Literacy.”“I explained to her that games were not about\nshooting people,” Professor Gee said. “They were about problem\nsolving.”Filament Games, a learning games company in Madison, Wis., one of\nwhose founders is a former student of Professor Gee, designed the games for\niCivics, which is based in Cambridge, Mass. Justice O’Connor’s own passions\nand priorities were central to the development of a number of the games —\namong them Supreme Decision, in which students take on the role of an\nimaginary Supreme Court justice who must cast the deciding vote in a case.In\none of the most popular iCivics games, called Do I Have a Right?, students run\na fictional constitutional law firm, taking on clients, figuring out which\nrights apply to them and arguing their cases. Although the game could not have\nanticipated recent contentious issues like the iPhone privacy fight between\nApple and the F.B.I., it covers topics that may give students insights into\ncurrent events or their own experiences.“I was struck that many students did\nnot know their rights,” said Danny O’Sullivan, a 17-year-old high school\nsenior in Washington. The son of one of Justice O’Connor’s former clerks, he\nhelped test the iCivics game with students at a different local high school.\n“They didn’t know that if a cop stopped them and searched them without a\nreason, it was illegal,” he said.The game also has playful elements. Students\nwho collect enough points to buy a virtual coffee maker for their imaginary\nlaw firm will find that the game speeds up, in a nod to the availability of\nvirtual caffeine.Justice O’Connor said it was important for the games to be\ninclusive and nonpartisan.Students who play Win the White House may choose\navatars, male or female; blond or brunet; goateed or clean-shaven; Democratic\nor Republican; beige or brown. But whether players decide to support, say, gun\nrights or gun control, the game provides neutral explanations of each\nstance.Justice O’Connor will go down in the annals of American history for\nbeing the FWOTSC — her nickname for First Woman on the Supreme Court — not to\nmention the swing vote in Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court case that\neffectively settled the contested 2000 presidential election. But these days,\nshe likes to say her efforts to encourage students to understand and\nparticipate in government represent her most important legacy.When she\nattended a recent reunion of her former clerks, she insisted that they bring\nlaptops so she and their children — she calls them the grandclerks — could\nplay iCivics games together.“Government isn’t handed down in the genes,”\nJustice O’Connor said. “It has to be taught through every generation.”\n\n","title":"A Supreme Court Pioneer, Now Making Her Mark on Video Games - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's latest accomplishment: video game producer https://t.co/e2thlj6Kgz","date":"Mon Mar 28 10:25:03 +0000 2016","favs":112,"id":{"$numberLong":"714397886553964544"},"retweets":99},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1q9OovL"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01509"},"content":"Senator Bernie Sanders routed Hillary Clinton in all three Democratic\npresidential contests on Saturday, infusing his underdog campaign with\ncritical momentum and bolstering his argument that the race for the nomination\nis not a foregone conclusion.Mr. Sanders found a welcome tableau in the\nlargely white and liberal electorates of the Pacific Northwest, where just\ndays after resoundingly beating Mrs. Clinton in Idaho he repeated the feat in\nthe Washington caucuses, winning 73 percent of the vote. He did even better in\nAlaska, winning 82 percent of the vote, and in Hawaii, he had 71 percent with\na few precincts still be counted, according to The Associated\nPress.Washington, the largest prize Saturday with 101 delegates in play, was a\nvital state for Mr. Sanders, whose prospects of capturing the nomination\ndimmed after double-digit losses to Mrs. Clinton across the South and weak\nshowings in delegate-rich Ohio, Florida and North Carolina this month. As of\nSaturday evening, Mrs. Clinton had roughly 280 more pledged delegates, who are\nawarded based on voting, and 440 more superdelegates — party leaders and\nelected officials — than Mr. Sanders.At a rally in Madison, Wis., late\nSaturday afternoon, Mr. Sanders assured supporters that his victories had\ncleared a viable path to the nomination. “We knew from day one that\npolitically we were going to have a hard time in the Deep South,” Mr. Sanders\nsaid. “But we knew things were going to improve when we headed west.”Noting\nthe “huge” voter turnout — in Washington, party officials estimated more than\n200,000 people participated on Saturday, close to the record set in 2008 — he\ntold the crowd, “We are making significant inroads into Secretary Clinton’s\nlead.”The victories on Saturday only slightly narrowed the gulf with Mrs.\nClinton in the quest for the 2,382 delegates needed to clinch the Democratic\nnomination.But the wins are likely to bestow on the Sanders campaign a surge\nof online donations with which to buy advertising in the expensive media\nmarkets of New York and Pennsylvania, which hold primaries next month. The\nvictory will also embolden Mr. Sanders to stay in the race and continue\nchallenging Mrs. Clinton on her ties to Wall Street and her foreign policy\nrecord.Republicans did not hold any contests on Saturday. The next nominating\nbattle for both parties will be the April 5 primaries in Wisconsin, followed\nby the April 9 Democratic caucuses in Wyoming, another contest that plays to\nMr. Sanders’s strengths.His victories on Saturday were not unexpected. All\nthree states have relatively low percentages of the black and the Latino\nvoters who have bolstered Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, and Washington and Alaska\nheld caucuses, the type of voting in which he has done well.Yet the results\nalso highlighted the uphill climb Mrs. Clinton would face in winning over the\nyoung and liberal voters who have flocked to the Vermont senator, and who\noften express concerns about her fund-raising and speechmaking practices.On\nSaturday morning, the auditorium at Eckstein Middle School in North Seattle\nburst with more than 1,400 caucusgoers holding lattes, pushing strollers and\nwearing “H” or “Bernie” lapel pins. Bleachers were set up onstage to\naccommodate the crowd. “This is what democracy looks like,” Janet Miller, the\ncaucus organizer, said from the auditorium’s stage.Mr. Sanders won that\nprecinct on Saturday, and many others. “I appreciate Bernie’s fervor and\nhonesty,” said Ian Forrester, 25, a barista and rock musician who caucused for\nMr. Sanders. “We’ve all seen the poor and the middle class suffer during this\neconomic downfall, and we need someone who cares about them, not about\ncorporations.”The Sanders campaign blanketed Washington with $1 million in\nads. Mr. Sanders found a sweet spot of support among Seattle’s young voters. A\nvideo clip of his rally on Friday, just over the state line in Portland, Ore.,\nwent viral after a delicate songbird perched on his podium, inspiring the\nTwitter hashtag #BirdieSanders. “I think there may be some symbolism here,”\nMr. Sanders said to a roar of applause.Mrs. Clinton will have a chance to\nregain momentum, and a wash of delegates, when the Democratic primary moves to\nher adoptive home state, New York, on April 19. Her national campaign\nheadquarters is in Brooklyn; on Saturday, Mr. Sanders opened an office in the\nborough’s Gowanus neighborhood, just a few miles from where he grew up.Lately\non the campaign trail, Mrs. Clinton, bracing for some losses in the caucus\nstates, seemed to have grown annoyed by the commentary from political rivals\nthat Mr. Sanders’s campaign has drawn far more enthusiastic supporters. “I\ntotally respect the passion of my opponent’s supporters, absolutely respect\nit,” Mrs. Clinton said while campaigning on Tuesday in Washington.“And here’s\nwhat I want you to know,” she continued, “I have, as of now, gotten more votes\nthan anybody else, including Donald Trump. I have gotten 2.6 million more\nvotes than Bernie Sanders,” and “have a bigger lead in pledged delegates, the\nones you win from people voting, than Barack Obama had at this time in\n2008.”Mrs. Clinton has shifted her focus and her words to taking on the\nRepublicans in November, but given Mr. Sanders’s influence over liberal voters\nshe would need in a general election, she has been cautious how she discusses\ndomestic and foreign policy.With Mr. Sanders’s focus on income inequality and\ntaking on Wall Street, Mrs. Clinton has continued to reach out to working-\nclass voters, including holding a rally on Tuesday at a machinists and\naerospace workers union hall at the Boeing factory in Everett, Wash.“I was\nmade an honorary machinist some years ago, so I feel a particular connection\nhere to my brothers and sisters in the machinists,” she told the crowd. “I am\nno person new to this struggle. I am not the latest flavor of the month. I\nhave been doing this work day in and day out for years.”She also knocked Mr.\nSanders for not supporting the Export-Import Bank, the government-backed\nagency that provides low-interest loans to help companies doing international\nbusiness, like Boeing, and which Mr. Sanders and some Republicans, including\nSenator Ted Cruz of Texas, have opposed as “corporate welfare.”And as Mrs.\nClinton sought to demonstrate her toughness and preparedness to be commander\nin chief in response to the terrorist attacks on Tuesday in Brussels, she also\nhad to avoid inflaming liberal primary voters who still associate her with her\n2002 Senate vote to authorize the Iraq war.On Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton said the\nresponses to the Brussels attacks by the leading Republican candidates, Donald\nJ. Trump and Mr. Cruz, amounted to “reckless actions” that would alienate\nAmerican allies, demonize Muslims and embolden Russia.Mr. Sanders ran an\nemotional 90-second ad in Hawaii, called “The Cost of War,” featuring\nRepresentative Tulsi Gabbard, a veteran from Hawaii who reminded viewers that\nMr. Sanders voted against the Iraq war.“Bernie Sanders will defend our country\nand take the trillions of dollars that are spent on these interventionist,\nregime change, unnecessary wars and invest it here at home,” an impassioned\nMs. Gabbard said, against scenic views of Hawaii.Foreign policy was what\nmotivated Warren Jones, 65, a retired software engineer, to caucus for Mr.\nSanders on Saturday in Seattle. “She was wrong on Iraq, and proved she didn’t\nlearn from that experience, but was wrong on Libya, too,” Mr. Jones said. “I\nthink in large part she is responsible for ISIS, though there’s plenty of\nblame to go around.”\n\n","title":"Bernie Sanders Seizes 3 States, Sweeping Democratic Contests - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Bernie Sanders routed Hillary Clinton in all 3 Democratic contests this past weekend https://t.co/A26tzILKSf https://t.co/hjxVyczWkm","date":"Mon Mar 28 10:10:02 +0000 2016","favs":349,"id":{"$numberLong":"714394105908957187"},"retweets":168},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1RIr44q"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0150a"},"content":"**THE LITTLE RED CHAIRS**  \nBy Edna O’Brien  \n299 pp. Little, Brown \u0026amp; Company. $27.Edna O’Brien’s boldly imagined and\nharrowing new novel, “The Little Red Chairs” — her 23rd work of fiction since\n“The Country Girls” (1960) — is both an exploration of those themes of Irish\nprovincial life from the perspective of girls and women for which she has\nbecome acclaimed and a radical departure, a work of alternate history in which\nthe devastation of a war-torn Central European country intrudes upon the\n“primal innocence, lost to most places in the world,” of rural Ireland. Here,\nin addition to O’Brien’s celebrated gifts of lyricism and mimetic precision,\nis a new, unsettling fabulist vision that suggests Kafka more than Joyce, as\nher portrait of the psychopath “warrior poet” Vladimir Dragan suggests Nabokov\nin his darker, less playful mode. Should we not recognize immediately the\nsinister “Dr. Vladimir Dragan of Montenegro,” the author has placed this\npoignant passage as an epigraph:“On the 6th of April 2012, to commemorate the\n20th anniversary of the start of the siege of Sarajevo by Bosnian Serb forces,\n11,541 red chairs were laid out in rows along the 800 meters of the Sarajevo\nhigh street. One empty chair for every Sarajevan killed during the 1,425 days\nof siege. Six hundred and forty-three small chairs represented the children\nkilled by snipers and the heavy artillery fired from the surrounding\nmountains.”Like a figure in a malevolent Irish fairy tale, a mysterious\nstranger appears one day seemingly out of nowhere on a bank of a tumultuous\nriver in western Ireland, in a “freezing backwater that passes for a town and\nis called Cloonoila.” The stran­ger is himself “mesmerized” by the “manic\nglee” of the deafening water.Soon, the curious, credulous inhabitants of\nCloonoila fall one by one under the spell of Dragan, “Vuk,” or “Dr. Vlad,” a\nprofessed poet, exile, visionary, “healer and sex therapist.” To one, he\nresembles a “holy man with a white beard and white hair, in a long black\ncoat”; so priestly, one might “genuflect.” To another, he is a figure of hope:\n“Maybe he’ll bring a bit of romance into our lives.” Schoolchildren think he\nlooks “a bit funny in a long black smock, with his white beard,” but consider\nhim harmless. The village schoolteacher is suspicious, suggesting that the\nstran­ger may be a kind of Rasputin, another notorious “visionary and a\nhealer,” but no one chooses to listen. The young Catholic priest Father Damien\nis initially wary of Dr. Vlad only because the outsider represents a threat to\nchurch authority and because he has advertised himself as a sex therapist:\n“This is a Catholic country, and chastity is our No. 1 commandment.” O’Brien’s\nportraits of Irish priests are rarely flattering, and Father Damien is a font\nof clichés and empty rhetoric. “You see,” he says of the local residents,\n“many feel a vacuum in their lives . . . marriages losing their mojo . . .\nInternet dating . . . nudity . . . hedonism . . . the things I have heard in\nconfession.” The presumed spiritual leader of the community is as readily\ntaken in by Dr. Vlad as the others, confiding in him that “repentance and\nsorrow for sin is woven into our DNA.”In these briskly satirical exchanges\nO’Brien can be as wittily lethal as Muriel Spark eviscerating the foolish, but\nO’Brien’s sympathy is more fully engaged by those women — lonely, childless,\nnaïve — who fall more deeply under the spell of Dr. Vlad. There’s Sister\nBonaventure, a nun who pays for a massage from the practitioner of “holistic\nhealing in Eastern and Western disciplines”: “She felt a flash of blinding\nlight and was transported to the ethereal.” More crucially, there is the “town\nbeauty” Fidelma, married to a man much older than her and desperate to have a\nchild, who contrives to be impregnated by the charlatan therapist, but with\ndisastrous results both for her marriage and for herself. Their union, after\nFidelma tells him the legend of a playboy who promises to kiss girls “unto\ntheir necklaces,” verges on the surreal, it is so self-consciously mythic:“\n‘Unto your necklace,’ he said and kissed her and they lay down, his body next\nto hers, seeking her with his hands, with his mouth, with his whole being, as\nif in the name of love, or what she believed to be love, he could not get\nenough of her. Her breath came in little gasps, their limbs entwined, the\nhealer and she, the stran­ger and she, like lovers now, as in a story or in a\nmyth.”Later, Fidelma will feel that the union with Dr. Vlad has brought a\n“terrible curse” on her village — like a union with the Devil. For her\naudacity, which (the reader knows) is a consequence of naïveté, not lust,\nFidelma will be viciously punished, as in a fairy tale in which consequences\nare wildly disproportionate to causes. (The scene of Fidelma’s punishment by\nbetrayed allies of Dr. Vlad is not for the fainthearted; O’Brien does not\ngloss over details.) Yet, somehow, perhaps not altogether plausibly, Fidelma\nregains not only her health and strength but acquires a confidence she had\nlacked; by the novel’s end she is determined to expiate the curse of a union\nwith the Devil by dedicating herself to the aid of desperate, displaced\npersons at a shelter for the homeless in London: “I could not go home until I\ncould come home to myself.”The most boldly imagined element of “The Little Red\nChairs” is, of course, the positing of an alternate universe in which a Balkan\nWar criminal, the object of an international search for years, turns up in a\nremote Irish village in the hope of establishing a new, much-­diminished life\nas a healer-therapist. In a more conventional work of fiction, and certainly\nin a work of genre mystery, the exact identity of Dr. Vlad would constitute\nthe plot, and his outing would be the consequence of detection on the part of\na canny protagonist among the villagers. One can well imagine a sly Nabokovian\nhide-and-seek with the reader in which the man’s exact identity is never quite\nestablished and we are confronted with the possibility that Dr. Vlad, like the\nmad narrator of “Pale Fire,” may be imagining his own lurid history. Instead,\nin an audacious move in which every creative-writing admonition is tossed\nblithely aside, the author simply presents seven pages of densely iterated\nexposition in the (again, audaciously awkward) form of a dream of Dr. Vlad’s\nin which he is chastised by an old, now-dead “blood brother” and comrade in\nthe genocidal Serbian onslaught against Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Croatian\ncommunities in the early 1990s: “You had been christened Young Torless because\nof the two terribly contrasting aspects of your character, the sane, the\nreasonable and the other so dark, so vengeful.” Later, the “Beast of Bosnia”\nwill argue in his own defense at his trial in The Hague: “If I am crazy, then\npatriotism itself is crazy.” (“Dragan David Dabic” was a false identity for\nthe leader of the Serb Republic in Bosnia, Radovan Karadzic, apprehended in\nSerbia in 2008 after 13 years in hiding; known as the Butcher of Bosnia,\nKaradzic was tried in The Hague by the United Nations war crimes tribunal for\nwar crimes including genocide. While he was in hiding, Karadzic practiced\n“alternative healing.”)But O’Brien is not interested in sensationalizing her\nmaterial, and “The Little Red Chairs” is not a novel of suspense, still less a\nmystery or a thriller; it is something more challenging, a work of meditation\nand penance. How does one come to terms with one’s own complicity in evil,\neven if that complicity is “innocent”? Should we trust the stranger who\narrives out of nowhere in our community? Should we mistrust the stranger? When\nis innocence self-destructive? Given the nature of the world, when is\nskepticism, even cynicism, justified? Much is made of innocence in fiction, as\nin life, but in O’Brien’s unsentimental imagination the innocent suffer\ngreatly because they are not distrustful enough; and usually these innocents\nare girls and young women, as in O’Brien’s compelling novel “Down by the\nRiver” (1997), in which a young rural Irish girl is ­impregnated by her father\nand further humiliated by being forced to endure the public politicization of\nher pregnancy by people on both sides of the abortion debate. As one of\nO’Brien’s female characters has said of her native Ireland: “Ours indeed was a\nland of shame, a land of murder and a land of strange sacrificial women.”“The\nLittle Red Chairs,” much farther reaching in its historic scope, much more\nterrifying in its portraiture of the unrepentant war criminal, yet shares with\nother works of O’Brien the pervading sense of guilt that is “woven into our\nDNA” and a determination to be free of this guilt. Initially one of Dr. Vlad’s\ndupes, Fidelma evolves into O’Brien’s most resourceful heroine as she throws\noff her very identity to live amid the homeless in London and to remake\nherself by painful degrees (chambermaid, dog kennel worker) into a woman\nstrong enough to help others. In her new awareness she hears stories told by\nrefugees in a homeless shelter: displaced persons, victims of unspeakable\nhorrors. “It is essential to remember,” one says, “nothing must be forgotten.”\nShe finds her community in a place that promises “We Help Victims Become\nHeroines.”In her wonderful memoir, “Country Girl,” O’Brien describes her\nconvent-girl background and her infatuation with one of her nun-teachers; it\nis not difficult to see how this early idealization of a life of service has\nenriched her fiction. The religious vocation, in the service of others, is\nessentially what her courageous heroine Fidelma undertakes, in the midst of\nmuch struggle, choosing “not to look at the prison wall of life, but to look\nup at the sky.”\n\n","title":"‘The Little Red Chairs,’ by Edna O’Brien - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"‘The Little Red Chairs,’ by Edna O’Brien https://t.co/U9fHAcD3eo","date":"Mon Mar 28 09:56:01 +0000 2016","favs":79,"id":{"$numberLong":"714390578432225280"},"retweets":41},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22GWai1"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0150b"},"content":"Since they were old enough to understand words, I’ve been trying to teach my\ndaughters the nature of permanence, as it relates to the World Wide Web. The\nInternet is forever, I tell them; the public is brutal, and they need to keep\ntheir clothes on whenever a camera-equipped device is around. Those spring\nbreak pictures on Facebook will be the first thing the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee sees when it’s deciding whether to approve their nomination.At\nleast, that’s what I grew up believing. After all, Miss America Vanessa\nWilliams was forced to give up her crown in 1984 after nude photos of her\nappeared in Penthouse. Nudity had consequences and, for women, they weren’t\ngood ones.But now, in the worlds of politics and pop culture, boudoir shots\nand even sex tapes have gone from guaranteed embarrassments to occasional\nassets to, sometimes, barely mattering at all. Watching the events of the past\nfew weeks unfold, I wonder if maybe I’ve gotten it wrong. When is a naked\npicture a problem for a woman? Maybe never — so long as she’s the one wielding\nthe camera, or she looks good, and her husband’s not upset.As the world knows,\nlast week, our Republican presidential contenders quit tussling over whose\nprivate parts are bigger, and moved on to the equally compelling question of\nwhose wife is hotter.To briefly recap: Before last Tuesday’s primaries, a\n“super PAC” called — you really can’t make this stuff up — Make America\nAwesome ran ads on social media targeting Mormon voters in Utah. The spots\nshowed images of Donald J. Trump’s wife, from a 2000 photo shoot with British\nGQ. “Meet Melania Trump. Your Next First Lady,” read the text, over a shot of\na sultry, nude Mrs. Trump, curled up on a fur. “Or, You Could Support Ted Cruz\non Tuesday.” (Ted Cruz was not pictured.)Even though the ad didn’t come from\nthe Cruz camp, Mr. Trump was furious — which was more than a little ironic,\ngiven the vigor with which he’s been posting provocative shots of his nemesis,\nthe Fox anchor Megyn Kelly, who posed for GQ in a short black slip dress and\nred high heels. Mr. Trump has retweeted one of his supporters, who called Ms.\nKelly a “bimbo,” and has said she lacks the gravitas to question the\ncandidates. Evidently, in Trumplandia, being scantily clad means you’re no\nlonger qualified to be a journalist, but being naked means you’re perfectly\nqualified to be first lady.And on it went. On Tuesday, Mr. Trump slammed\n“Lyin’ Ted” for being behind the Melania ad, and threatened to “spill the\nbeans” on Mr. Cruz’s wife, Heidi. The next day, no beans were spilled, but Mr.\nTrump retweeted a meme of a picture of Melania, looking appropriately model-\nrific, juxtaposed beside Heidi Cruz, looking probably a lot like I do when I\nneed my roots touched up and I’ve had it with my kids. “No need to spill the\nbeans,” text with the photos said. “The images speak for themselves.”And what\ndo those images say, exactly? Oh, right: Mr. Trump is obviously better\nqualified to run our country, because his wife was a professional model.Mr.\nCruz was swift to defend Heidi Cruz’s honor, tweeting, “Donald, real men don’t\nattack women. Your wife is lovely, and Heidi is the love of my life.” It\nsounded chivalrous, until Mr. Cruz kept talking. He called Mr. Trump a\n“sniveling coward” and a “New York bully,” and praised Heidi as “an\nunbelievable mom.” Mr. Cruz denied that his wife was the object that Trump\nsupporters were calling her — an unattractive woman — by saying that, in fact,\nshe was a different kind of object: the love of his life, important and\nvaluable primarily in terms of her relationship to him, and “off bounds,” and\nin need of protection, just like their children.By Friday, Mr. Cruz had moved\nfrom defending his wife’s honor to defending his own, calling a tabloid report\nthat accused him of extramarital affairs “garbage” and blaming the Trump camp\nfor the story. Which means that soon the Twitter mob will probably stop\nscrutinizing Heidi Cruz and start in on the rumored mistresses.In this\nstrangest of primary seasons, women exist primarily in terms of their\nrelationships to the men they marry or question or critique. They can either\nbe beauties or beasts or “the love of my life.” They can be “crazy” or\n“losers,” “fat pigs” or “dogs.” They can be mothers and daughters. They can be\nthe currency with which you buy voters’ belief in your machismo and alpha-\nmaleness, or they can be the sand you kick in the face of a “New York bully.”\nIn every case, whether they are assets or liabilities, they are objects. In no\ncase are they people.What’s the political significance of a naked lady? When\nthe Utah ad went public, it wasn’t long before the predictable calls to leave\ncandidates’ families out of the fray were joined by charges of slut-shaming,\nand the insistence that a grown woman can pose as she wishes; that as long as\nit’s her choice, it’s empowering.Melania Trump might have chosen to pose for\nGQ, but there’s nothing empowering about the way her husband’s opponents have\nrepurposed her modeling portfolio as revenge porn. Which is precisely what Mr.\nTrump has done with Megyn Kelly’s GQ shots. Neither woman deserves to suffer\nfor having made the choice to get in front of a camera.MY guess is that\nneither one will. Twenty years ago — or even as recently as 2004, when the\nFederal Communications Commission fined CBS $550,000 after Janet Jackson’s\nSuper Bowl halftime “wardrobe malfunction” — to be female and naked was to be\nafraid. But now, our biggest reality TV star is Kim Kardashian, a woman who\nspun a sex tape into gold, a woman who posts nude selfies, then twirls on her\nhaters, while her fans come roaring to her defense, claiming that she has\nsubverted the male gaze because she’s the one creating the image and she’s the\none sharing the shot.When a collection of naked celebrity pictures were\nspirited out of the cloud, then leaked to the public in 2014, it was the\nhacking that shocked people, not the existence of the pictures. Not even a\nDisney princess like Vanessa Hudgens had her career derailed by repeated\nleaked nudes.The would-be first ladies will survive nudity, and mockery, but\nboth of them have been diminished, stripped of their personhood and reduced to\nobjects. They have been flattened into human baseball cards, to be rated and\ntraded, compared and assessed, and their worth depends not on who they are or\nwhat they do, but on how good they look and how much their husbands love\nthem.Never mind that Melania Trump speaks multiple languages and is a\nsuccessful businesswoman, or that Heidi Cruz has an M.B.A. from Harvard and\nhad made a name for herself in the worlds of both politics and finance. What\nmatters is that Melania is hot and that Heidi is beloved.It’s enough to make a\nliberal feminist, a mere spectator to the Republican debates, long for the\ndays of Carly Fiorina. At least then the Republican primary could boast one\nwoman who was a candidate, not just a wife and a mother, or a face and a\nfigure — a person, instead of a thing.\n\n","title":"Naked Lady Politics - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Melania Trump and Heidi Cruz have been \"flattened into human baseball cards, to be rated and traded\" https://t.co/aswIligInB via @nytopinion","date":"Mon Mar 28 09:50:02 +0000 2016","favs":210,"id":{"$numberLong":"714389072903585792"},"retweets":159},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1XWLLrQ"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0150c"},"content":"HOTCHKISS, Colo. — This mountain town of coal miners and organic farmers\nwasted no time in saying no to marijuana. After Colorado’s 2012 vote\nlegalizing marijuana, local leaders concerned about crime and the character of\ntheir tranquil downtown twice voted to ban the recreational and medical pot\nshops springing up in other towns.But then coal crumbled. One mine here in the\nNorth Fork Valley has shut down amid a wave of coal bankruptcies and\nslowdowns, and another has announced that it will go dark. The closings added\nto a landscape of layoffs and economic woes concussing mining-dependent towns\nfrom West Virginia to Wyoming. And as Hotchkiss searches for a new economic\nlifeline, some people are asking: What about marijuana?“If we could get it\nlegalized right now, we could create some jobs, and we need the tax revenue,”\nsaid Thomas Wills, a town trustee who runs a used-book store and supports\nallowing some marijuana stores. “Downtown’s not going to be all flashing green\ncrosses and dancing marijuana leaves. You can make it as unobtrusive as you\nwant.”Next month, Hotchkiss will vote on whether to undo its ban and welcome\nmarijuana shops and the traffic and taxes that could come with them. With\ncannabis sales soaring to nearly $1 billion across Colorado, and big states\nsuch as California poised to embrace legalization, wary towns like Hotchkiss\nare looking at the economics of marijuana and starting to reconsider.“It’s an\nevolving discussion in a lot of communities,” said Kevin Bommer, deputy\ndirector of the Colorado Municipal League, which tracks local debates on the\nissue. Six Colorado towns are voting in April on whether to scrap their\nprohibitions on marijuana stores, and in January, another narrowly voted to\nlift a moratorium and approve wholesale marijuana growers.Though 23 states and\nthe District of Columbia now allow some forms of recreational or medical\nmarijuana, legalization is still a checkerboard, with marijuana retailers and\ncultivations clustered in big cities such as Seattle or Washington and\nscattered randomly through rural areas.As scores of cities and counties banned\nmarijuana sales, they cited worries about public safety, property values,\nyouth use and the image problems that might come with becoming their county’s\ngo-to source for legal marijuana. Others passed moratoriums to wait and see\nhow legalization unfolded in neighboring towns that plunged in.“There were a\nlot of questions and unknowns,” said Mayor Joel Benson of Buena Vista, a town\nin Colorado’s central mountains that allows medical marijuana and is weighing\nwhether to allow recreational sales. “It was really just to give people time\nto wrestle with the ins and outs.”Places like Pierce County, south of Seattle,\ndiscovered that simply banning dispensaries did not keep out marijuana. In\nFebruary 2015, the police shut down an illegal grow house next to a day care\ncenter in Gig Harbor. The County Council passed a series of what it called\ntight regulations, and in December repealed its ban on marijuana sales and\nproduction in unincorporated corners of the county.Here in Hotchkiss, the push\nto allow marijuana has touched off conversations about the soul of the town.\nIt is tucked into a sunny mountain valley draped with peach orchards and\nvineyards. But the coal mines up the valley were an economic mainstay for\ngenerations, and people say that tourism and boutique agriculture cannot\nreplace good-paying mining jobs. Unemployment here in Delta County is 5.3\npercent higher than the statewide average of 3.2 percent.“People have been\ntightening the belt or just plain moving away,” said Robbie Winne, who runs\nthe Rose, a secondhand clothing shop along Hotchkiss’s main street. She said\nshe supported the marijuana plan as a way to entice more visitors, or at least\ncapture some traffic as people passed through on their way to ski towns.Ms.\nWinne said that although pot was no panacea, at least it could perk up\nbusiness and tax revenue. Colorado collected about $135 million in taxes and\nfees from marijuana sales last year, and small governments have taken in\nmillions from local sales taxes. In the tiny town of DeBeque, near the Utah\nborder, officials told Colorado Public Radio that they were considering using\nthe tax money from marijuana to start a scholarship fund or repair streets,\ncurbs and gutters.Wendell Koontz, a coal mine geologist and the mayor of\nHotchkiss, said the price was not worth it. He said he worried about whether\nthe three-person marshal’s office and small town staff could deal with the\ncomplications of new marijuana businesses, and about the reputation of a place\nthat proclaims itself the “Friendliest Town Around.”“There’s a concern that\nkind of atmosphere could be lost,” he said. “And once it’s gone, it’s\ngone.”Others say it is time for a bold move. Mary Hockenbery, a New Mexico\ntransplant who runs an eclectic art gallery in an old church, has been a\nleading voice behind the initiative. Coal is not coming back, she said, and\nthough she and others have tried to spruce up the main street with cosmetic\nmeasures like new flower boxes, the town needs more.“We’re dying,” she said.\n“This town needs an infusion of cash. Anything will help.”\n\n","title":"As Coal Prospects Decline, a Colorado Town Reconsiders Marijuana - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The mine closed. The jobs left town.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0150d"},"content":"SYDNEY, Australia — Since he was arrested in 2010, Matthew Ng has lost his\n$100 million business, his health and his family.He has been kept apart from\nhis wife and three younger children, whom he sees only sporadically. His\neldest daughter fell into a deep depression, stopped eating and died.An\nAustralian businessman who had been working in China, Mr. Ng was sentenced by\na Chinese court in 2011 to more than 12 years in prison on bribery and fraud\ncharges. His lawyer contends that the case was fabricated to allow a Chinese\nstate-owned company to confiscate his business.In 2014, he was transferred to\nAustralia under a bilateral treaty that allows prisoners to serve their\nsentences in their home countries.Since then, he has been incarcerated at a\nstate prison in rural Australia for crimes he probably did not commit, and\nwhich his lawyer says would not even be crimes in Australia.“Australia has\nimprisoned in Australia one of its own citizens as a result of the injustice\nand disregard of human rights within the Chinese legal system,” said the\nlawyer, Tom Lennox.In China, he said, “You can complain but it makes no\ndifference. But in Australia it should be different.”Mr. Ng has petitioned\nAttorney General George Brandis for a pardon and his immediate release from\nthe prison, St. Helier’s Correctional Center in Muswellbrook, about 150 miles\nnorth of Sydney.Mr. Brandis declined to comment on the case, but his office\nsaid in an email that the prisoner swap treaty between Australia and China\ndoes not allow the Australian government to make “any judgment as to the\nreasonableness or otherwise of the sentence imposed by the foreign\ncountry.”Mr. Ng’s problems began when he tried to sell a travel company he had\nstarted in Guangzhou, in southern China. In the process of building the\ncompany, Et-China, he bought a majority stake in a struggling state-owned\ncompany, GZL, for $10 million. GZL was a subsidiary of Lingnan, a hotel and\ntravel conglomerate owned by the Guangzhou government.In 2010, the Swiss\ntravel giant Kuoni offered to buy Mr. Ng’s company for $125 million.Lingnan\nthen demanded to buy back its GZL shares at the original selling price. Mr. Ng\nrefused.He was arrested and jailed for 13 months before he was finally tried.\nHe was convicted of misappropriating company funds, misstating his company’s\nregistered capital and bribing a director.Mr. Ng’s trial lawyer, Chen Youxi,\ncalled the charges ridiculous. The bribery allegation, for instance, involved\npayments to a company director that had been publicly reported and taxed.“The\ncourt does not have either enough evidence or legal basis for the sentence,”\nMr. Chen said after the trial.A separate civil case in 2013 stripped Mr. Ng of\nhis business assets.Lingnan ended up acquiring Et-China’s assets “lock, stock,\nand barrel,” said Christopher Rose, an Australian businessman who managed the\ncompany after Mr. Ng’s arrest. “It would be worth in excess of $1 billion\ntoday,” he said.After Mr. Ng lost his appeal in the criminal case in 2012, his\neldest daughter, Isabella, then 15, fell into a deep depression and became\nanorexic. She died in 2013.His wife, Niki Chow, who Mr. Lennox said was\nharassed by the Chinese authorities, developed breast cancer, and was forced\nto bring her three youngest children home to Sydney without their father.Since\nhe was transferred to Australia, Mr. Ng has been able to see them occasionally\nand make phone calls to them limited to six minutes each.His children\n“understand that I was charged in China and they know that China is a\nCommunist country,” he said. “But they don’t understand why I am locked up\nhere.”At 49, he is scarred and brittle, friends say. His physical health has\nimproved in Australia, but he remains despondent.“He is mentally fragile,”\nsaid a longtime friend, David Marquard, a director at Ernst \u0026amp; Young\nAustralia. “He has been in jail far longer than he ever should have been, even\nif you believe he has done something wrong, which I don’t.”Corrective\nServices, the state prisons agency, denied a request to visit or interview Mr.\nNg. The agency said it prohibits the news media from visiting jails and\ninterviewing prisoners.Through his lawyer, Mr. Ng protested his innocence.“I\nhave never confessed,” he said. “I would never tarnish my own name saying I\ndid something that I did not do.“Despite all they did to me and my family in\nChina, I did not break. But now I am here, I must have a free hand to regain\nmy life. I must have meaningful contact with my children and wife, and I must\nclear my name.”Mr. Ng could qualify for release on parole this year, a\nconcession under Australia’s sentencing laws. In China, he would have likely\nserved his entire sentence. His parole would last until 2021.He wants to\nrejoin his wife and children, pay his respects to Isabella and go back to\nbusiness, which would be difficult as a parolee.“With a criminal record I\nwon’t be able to travel,” he said. “And hanging over my head is that I could\nbe thrown back into jail during that parole period. Once you’re in jail, you\ncan get lost in the system. No one looks out for you.”As the first prisoner\ntransferred under the 2011 treaty with China, his chances of review or a\npardon are slim, according to several lawyers and a former official.The\nattorney general’s office said that while a transferred prisoner could apply\nfor a pardon, the treaty’s success depends on “mutual respect for each\ncountry’s sovereignty” and the desire to allow prisoners to be close to family\nand rejoin Australian society.According to Mr. Lennox, Mr. Brandis holds that\nthe government has no right to review the case or the sentence.Several other\nlawyers agreed that the treaty obliged Australia to administer foreign\nsentences even when they may be repugnant to Australian values.“If we agree to\nthe terms of the treaty,” said Bret Walker, a Sydney lawyer and former\npresident of Australia’s Law Council, “we have to accept the fact of criminal\nguilt for that conduct and the infliction of that length of imprisonment as a\nsentence, even though either or both of those aspects are quite outside the\nway Australia would approach the matter.”Donald R. Rothwell, the dean of the\nAustralian National University College of Law, said that Australia has some\n“capacity” under the treaty “to revisit” the sentence, but the bigger\nobstacles were political and diplomatic.He and other lawyers warned that if\nAustralia was not seen as upholding its side of the treaty, it could\njeopardize the prospects for the 41 Australians now serving sentences in\nChinese jails.“Australia would need to be very careful that if it was to\nrevisit and make adjustments that it was on very clear ground because of the\npotential impact it could have down the track for future prisoner transfers,”\nProfessor Rothwell said.Mr. Lennox disagrees. He contends that China no longer\ncares what happens to Mr. Ng. Moreover, he said, such potential consequences\nshould not deprive his client of justice now.“There are grounds in the treaty\nfor Matthew to be released,” he said. “But the government has washed its hands\nof him. It is as if they have moved on and left him stranded.”\n\n","title":"Sent Home to Australia, but Still Jailed for Chinese Crimes - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"A man says he is incarcerated for crimes he did not commit in a nation that would not consider his actions illegal https://t.co/ik8qNY5JoY","date":"Mon Mar 28 08:51:07 +0000 2016","favs":99,"id":{"$numberLong":"714374247326621696"},"retweets":83},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21NVNfP"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0150e"},"content":"The law caught up with a wanted man on the streets of North Carolina this\nweek.The man, James Meyers, was driving his 10-year-old daughter to school in\nConcord, northeast of Charlotte, when a police car pulled him over for a\nbroken brake light.But when the officer ran his license, he confronted him\nwith an older crime, from 14 years ago. “Sir, I don’t know how to tell you\nthis,” the officer began. Mr. Meyers had a 2002 warrant out for his arrest for\nfailing to return a VHS movie rental of “Freddy Got Fingered.”“I just\nlaughed,” Mr. Meyers, 37, recalled.The officer let Mr. Meyers go and told him\nto show up later at the police station, where officers took him to a\nmagistrate’s office, patted him down and put him in handcuffs.The story of Mr.\nMeyers’s ordeal has gained wide attention, spreading from a YouTube video he\nposted to a local broadcaster and, finally, ricocheting around the world on\nsocial media.Fueling the fascination are the quaint technology involved in the\ncrime — a VHS tape, the bulky cassette that seems like such a distant memory\nin the age of Netflix — and the choice of movie. Of all the films to be\nhandcuffed over, “Freddy Got Fingered” is arguably among the most\nawkward.Starring the gross-out comedian Tom Green at the height of his fame,\nthe movie was viciously panned by critics. Some called it among the worst\nmovies ever made. It has, nonetheless, garnered a cult following.In an\ninterview, Mr. Green said he also laughed when he heard about Mr. Meyers’s\ncase.“It is just kind of ridiculous all around,” he said. “I think the fact\nthat the movie was ‘Freddy Got Fingered’ just makes it funnier for some\nreason. I don’t know why.”Mr. Meyers, a caterer who also performs as a dance\nmusic D.J. under the name Mad Influence, said he had no idea what happened to\nthe VHS tape, but he does remember watching it and laughing\nhysterically.Lawyers say arrests for overdue rentals are rare, but cases have\nbeen reported in several states, among them Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas and\nSouth Carolina.In 2012, a woman in New Mexico was arrested in front of her\nfive children and accused of failing to return a “Twilight” DVD set and book\nto a library. She later won a settlement of $7,500 because the city had failed\nto properly notify her about a summons, her lawyer, Eric Dixon,\nsaid.“Arresting people for these petty issues” clogs up the criminal courts,\nMr. Dixon said. Such cases should be decriminalized and handled like traffic\ntickets in civil court, he said.Mr. Meyers was ordered to appear in court on\nApril 27 to answer the charge of “failure to return rental property,” a\nmisdemeanor. His lawyer, Adam Seifer, said Mr. Meyers’s worst-case scenario\nwould be probation and a fine.But the charge would be tough to prove, Mr.\nSeifer added. The video store, J\u0026amp;J’s Video in Salisbury, has closed, and\nthe tape is missing. Further, the state must show that Mr. Meyers intended to\nsteal the tape, and there is no evidence of that, Mr. Seifer said.Mr. Meyers\nsaid he rewatched “Freddy Got Fingered” on Wednesday. About 1:30 a.m., his\nphone rang. On the other end was a voice re-enacting one of the most famous\nscenes from the movie, when Freddy ties sausages to his fingers and chants,\n“Daddy, would you like some sausage.”“I instantly knew who it was,“ Mr. Meyers\nsaid. “I almost died.”Mr. Green, who is on a comedy tour in Australia, told\nMr. Meyers he would help with any fees related to the case.\n\n","title":"Man Rents VHS Tape.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0150f"},"content":"The beams are still bare in Yogasmoga’s first Manhattan store, juice bar and\nfitness studio. But Rishi Bali raves that he is building the next Lululemon —\nonly better.He certainly brings a hip pedigree to the table. Mr. Bali is from\nthe foothills of the Himalayas, a birthplace of yoga, which he says flows in\nhis blood. He honed his business skills at Goldman Sachs, where he was an\noperations executive.And he is off to a fast start. His company, which started\nin 2013 by selling yoga gear online, has already expanded to 12 brick-and-\nmortar stores. He plans to build as many as 25 stores this year, including the\nstore in Manhattan’s chic NoHo neighborhood, which opens in June. He is\ninvesting his venture capital money – he has raised $12.5 million – in high-\ntech performance fabrics and American manufacturing.“We’re going to be better\nthan Lululemon, just more authentic,” Mr. Bali said. “We’re different from\nother brands jumping on that athleisure bandwagon.”That may be easier said\nthan done.Seemingly every clothing brand and retailer wants in on so-called\nathleisure, a category that has become so prevalent that it has won an entry\nin the next update of the Merriam-Webster dictionary: casual clothing meant to\nbe worn both for exercising and for doing almost everything else.Louis Vuitton\nis selling athleisure. So are Victoria’s Secret, Gap, Tory Burch and H\u0026amp;M.\nOnline-only portals have introduced options: Net-a-Porter now runs\nNet-a-Sporter. Gyms and workout companies, like SoulCycle, are creating\nclothing lines.Nike, Under Armour and Adidas, the traditional sportswear\ngiants, are all stepping up their offerings for the yoga-mat-toting\ndemographic, promoting splashy collaborations with celebrities like Pharrell\nWilliams and Rihanna. Sweaty Betty, the fast-growing British athleisure brand,\nis expanding in the United States.A result: The $97 billion athleisure market\n— including athletic apparel, footwear and accessories — is being stretched\nmore than Lululemon’s stretchiest yoga pants.Already, some signs of strain are\nshowing. Nike spooked investors — many of whom had bought into the athleisure\nboom — by reporting slowing sales on Tuesday. The athletics giant warned that\nrevenue growth could slow further this year, to the midsingle digits, down\nfrom initial estimates of almost 10 percent.That came after Urban Outfitters\nin October scaled back its promotion of the company’s athleisure brand, just a\nlittle more than a year after introducing it. Theory said early this year that\nit would not move forward with its stand-alone activewear line, Theory\nPlus.Kit and Ace, the start-up operated by the family of the Lululemon founder\nChip Wilson that specializes in a soft, washable, stretchy fabric it calls\n“technical cashmere,” laid off about 35 people or 10 percent of the staff at\nits headquarters in Vancouver, British Columbia, last month. Even Lululemon,\nthe athleisure pioneer, has been struggling with falling profit margins and\nrising inventory.“There’s a lot of wannabes out there creating noise,” said\nMatt Powell, a sports industry analyst at the NPD Group, a market research\nfirm. “The shakedown’s started. A lot of these brands are going to go\naway.”Few retail and fashion analysts expect that athleisure and active wear,\nas a category, will stall. Surveys show participation in group fitness and\nexercise classes is up among young adults in the United States. A cultural\nshift in the workplace, led by start-ups and other newer companies, has made\nit more acceptable to wear sneakers, and even sweatpants, to the office.In\ncities like New York and Los Angeles, spinning classes are starting to replace\ncocktail bars as after-work hangouts, marketers say. And they say younger\nshoppers increasingly aspire to the idea of a hip, healthful lifestyle — cold-\npressed juice and yoga class, documented and broadcast on Instagram — over a\nnew Coach handbag or MaxMara dress.Retailers have jumped on that trend as a\nway to inject an edgier, younger, experience-based element into their clothes\nand accessories, as a lack of decisive fashion hits has depressed sales.Still,\nthe growing athleisure universe makes it harder than ever for brands to stand\nout. And retailers are finding that the trend does not present a quick or easy\nfix to their woes.“These retailers feel they have to participate, otherwise\nthey’re losing share,” said Lupine Skelly, a retail analyst at Wedbush\nSecurities. “But there’s just a slush of products in the market, and\nrelatively little brand loyalty. How do you differentiate yourself so you’re\njust not competing on price?”Gap’s experience offers one example. Though Gap\ndoes not break out sales for its high-end Athleta activewear, where jogger\npants can go for $79, Ms. Skelly says growth has softened. But the retailer’s\nless expensive label, Old Navy, has found traction with athletics wear\nstarting at less than $20, a trend mirrored in Gap’s core brands.Still, Gap’s\nchief executive, Art Peck, told investors last month that Athleta “is right in\nthe sweet spot of the lifestyle trend.” That was after a quarter in which\ncompanywide comparable sales slid 7 percent from a year earlier, and the\ncompany gave a weak outlook for 2016.Even companies that specialize in the\nathleisure category, like Lululemon, are having to adjust. The company is\nfighting back against the competition by expanding its men’s business and\ngrowing globally. The company has said that it intends to open 60 stores this\nfiscal year, including eight stores each in Europe and Asia, where Lululemon\nruns just a handful of stores. It has 354 stores worldwide.Nike, meanwhile,\nhas struggled with mounting inventory, aggressively marking down its shoes and\nhoodies at factory stores and selling to third-party discounters — both steps\nthe athletics wear giant has historically been loath to take.But Trevor\nEdwards, the Nike brand president, signaled that Nike would double down on\nathleisure trend. “More and more women are blending running, fitness and\nsports style in their lives, and this shift is fundamental to how this\nbusiness operates,” he said on a call with investors on Tuesday.With such a\ndeluge, can Yogasmoga hope to make a mark?Yes, says Mr. Bali. Yogasmoga’s\nshirts and pants are the softest and most durable, made from a line of high-\nend fabric it calls Aurum, a blend of Lycra and Supplex, a pile-resistant type\nof nylon. They are made in the United States, allowing Yogasmoga to respond to\ntrends in real time.The company spent two years developing its Carbon 6 black\ndye for pants Mr. Bali promises will never go see-through, a product mishap\nthat previously plagued Lululemon. And shoppers appreciate Yogasmoga’s\nauthenticity and commitment to social causes, he said: There is no\nPhotoshopping in any of its ads, and the brand has set up a nonprofit\norganization that finances women’s health, education and microfinance projects\nin India.“We’ve put so much love into this,” Mr. Bali said. “We‘re not going\nto be the silly brand nobody remembers in a few years.”\n\n","title":"Products and Competition Stretch Market for ‘Athleisure’ Clothing - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The $330 billion athleisure market is being stretched more than Lululemon's stretchiest yoga pants https://t.co/7K7h417MEN","date":"Mon Mar 28 08:02:15 +0000 2016","favs":146,"id":{"$numberLong":"714361949878935552"},"retweets":76},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1q9OovJ"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01510"},"content":"Mother Mary Angelica of the Annunciation, a cloistered Franciscan nun who\nfounded the largest Roman Catholic television network in the country, and used\nit unstintingly to criticize liberalizing trends in the Catholic Church, died\non Sunday. She was 92.The cause was complications of a stroke, according to a\nstatement posted online by the Eternal Word Television Network, the media\norganization she founded.Mother Angelica began the Eternal Word Television\nNetwork in 1981 with $200, a makeshift studio in a monastery’s garage in\nIrondale, Ala., and one on-air personality, herself.By the time she retired in\n2001 after a series of debilitating strokes, her homespun half-hour program of\nadvice and commentary, “Mother Angelica Live,” was the anchor of a 24-hour\nCatholic programming network reaching over 100 million homes in the United\nStates, South America, Africa and Europe.In a YouTube video announcing her\ndeath, Raymond Arroyo, the managing editor of EWTN News and a biographer of\nMother Angelica, said she was the only woman in television history to found\nand lead a cable network for 20 years.A 1995 profile in Time magazine called\nher “an improbable superstar of religious broadcasting and arguably the most\ninfluential Roman Catholic woman in America.”Archbishop Charles Chaput of\nPhiladelphia, a member of the network’s board of governors, said in its\nstatement that Mother Angelica “succeeded at a task the nation’s bishops\nthemselves couldn’t achieve.”Mother Angelica’s television persona, which\nsurvives in network reruns and perennially popular YouTube clips, was that of\na shrewd yet grandmotherly nun from a seemingly bygone era.Her face framed in\nfull nun’s habit and filling the screen almost edge to edge, she answered\nviewers’ questions at a leisurely, sigh-punctuated pace that accommodated the\nlong digressions that became her trademark.She wisecracked about nuns, once\ndescribing the ones who taught her in parochial school as “the meanest people\non God’s earth.” She dispensed religious opinions sometimes at odds with\nVatican policy. She lectured teenagers on fornication, bishops on theology.\nAnd at her most passionate, she attacked feminists and other liberals she saw\nas undermining the authority of the church.It was a television style that made\nher irresistible to traditionalist Catholics, who never warmed to American\nchurch leaders’ efforts, after the Second Vatican Council of 1962-65, to\ndemystify rituals and nudge congregations toward greater social engagement.\nThat audience contributed generously to her enterprise, donating what The\nNational Catholic Reporter estimated at $25 million annually in 1994.Mother\nAngelica’s outspokenness on church issues — her pet peeves were gender-neutral\nlanguage in the liturgy and a change allowing girls to become altar servers —\nmade her both friends and enemies among the Catholic faithful.It also brought\nher into conflict with members of the church hierarchy.In 1993, when a World\nYouth Day event in Denver featured a woman playing the role of Jesus Christ in\na Passion play, she called it “blasphemous,” and delivered a litany of\ncomplaints during her show about what she called the “ungodly” influence that\nliberals were having on the church.“I am so tired of you, liberal church in\nAmerica,” she said. “I resent you pushing your anti-Catholic, ungodly ways\nupon the masses of this country.”Archbishop Rembert Weakland of Milwaukee, a\nprelate identified at the time with the church’s progressive wing, called her\nremarks “disgraceful, un-Christian, offensive and divisive.” The\nadministrative body of American bishops, then known as the National Conference\nof Catholic Bishops, asked that the segment be pulled from the network’s\nlineup of reruns. Mother Angelica refused.A more significant clash occurred in\n1997, when Mother Angelica criticized Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles\nfor proposing changes in the sacrament of holy communion that she viewed as a\nbreach of core church doctrine.“I’m afraid my obedience in that diocese would\nbe absolutely zero,” she said. “And I hope everybody else’s in that diocese is\nzero.”Cardinal Mahony demanded an apology and a retraction of her call for\ndisobedience. He received a grudging apology, which Mother Angelica then\nobscured with a long on-air explication of her complaint. At the cardinal’s\nrequest, the Vatican began an inquiry into her work. No disciplinary action\nwas taken.In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI awarded Mother Angelica the Cross of\nHonor for distinguished service. It is the highest award a pope can give to a\nmember of the laity, the term by which the church defines everyone except\nordained priests.Mother Angelica was born Rita Antoinette Rizzo on April 20,\n1923, in Canton, Ohio, the only child of John and Mae Rizzo. Her father\nabandoned the family when she was 5, and she spent much of her early life\nplagued by an array of stomach ailments.In 1943, she claimed to have been\ncured by a Catholic faith healer, signaling the beginning of her interest in a\nreligious vocation, according to a 2007 biography written by Mr. Arroyo,\n“Mother Angelica: The Remarkable Story of a Nun, Her Nerve, and a Network of\nMiracles.”After she took vows as a member of the Poor Clares of Perpetual\nAdoration, a contemplative order of Franciscan nuns in Canton, another\nphysical ailment — a spinal injury suffered in a fall, followed by two years\nof chronic pain — led her to promise to build a new monastery if cured. Her\nprayers answered, she set off in 1962 with four other sisters of her order to\nstart Our Lady of the Angels Monastery in Irondale, a place with almost no\nCatholics.There, Mother Angelica began writing booklets and recording\naudiocassettes to introduce Catholicism to her new neighbors. When a local\ntelevision station gave her a half-hour of airtime, her on-camera charisma\nattracted Pat Robertson’s Christian Broadcasting Network, which began airing\nher show on its satellite network.In an interview with The New York Times in\n1989, Mother Angelica described how a visit to a television studio in Chicago\nignited her entrepreneurial drive, and led to the birth of her worldwide\nenterprise.“I walked in, and it was just a little studio, and I remember\nstanding in the doorway and thinking, it doesn’t take much to reach the\nmasses,” she said.“I just stood there and said to the Lord, ‘Lord, I’ve got to\nhave one of these.’”\n\n","title":"Mother Mary Angelica, Who Founded Catholic TV Network, Dies at 92 - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The NYT obituary for Mother Mary Angelica, who founded the Eternal World Television Network https://t.co/L55oKZShOE","date":"Mon Mar 28 07:49:30 +0000 2016","favs":173,"id":{"$numberLong":"714358740401721344"},"retweets":119},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SfQl05"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01511"},"content":"_Over two telephone conversations on Friday, Donald J. Trump, the Republican\npresidential candidate, discussed his views on foreign policy with Maggie\nHaberman and David E. Sanger of The New York Times. Here is an edited\ntranscript of their interview (or just the highlights)._**HABERMAN:** I wanted\nto ask you about some things that you said in Washington on Monday, more\nrecently. But you’ve talked about them a bunch. So, you have said on several\noccasions that you want Japan and South Korea to pay more for their own\ndefense. You’ve been saying versions of that about Japan for 30 years. Would\nyou object if they got their own nuclear arsenal, given the threat that they\nface from North Korea and China?**TRUMP:** Well, you know, at some point,\nthere is going to be a point at which we just can’t do this anymore. And, I\nknow the upsides and the downsides. But right now we’re protecting, we’re\nbasically protecting Japan, and we are, every time North Korea raises its\nhead, you know, we get calls from Japan and we get calls from everybody else,\nand “Do something.” And there’ll be a point at which we’re just not going to\nbe able to do it anymore. Now, does that mean nuclear? It could mean nuclear.\nIt’s a very scary nuclear world. Biggest problem, to me, in the world, is\nnuclear, and proliferation. At the same time, you know, we’re a country that\ndoesn’t have money. You know, when we did these deals, we were a rich country.\nWe’re not a rich country. We were a rich country with a very strong military\nand tremendous capability in so many ways. We’re not anymore. We have a\nmilitary that’s severely depleted. We have nuclear arsenals which are in very\nterrible shape. They don’t even know if they work. We’re not the same country,\nMaggie and David, I mean, I think you would both agree.**SANGER:** So, just to\nfollow Maggie’s thought there, though, the Japanese view has always been, if\nthe United States, at any point, felt as if it was uncomfortable defending\nthem, there has always been a segment of Japanese society, and of Korean\nsociety that said, “Well, maybe we should have our own nuclear deterrent,\nbecause if the U.S. isn’t certain, we need to make sure the North Koreans know\nthat.” Is that a reasonable position. Do you think at some point they should\nhave their own arsenal?**TRUMP:** Well, it’s a position that we have to talk\nabout, and it’s a position that at some point is something that _we_ have to\ntalk about, and if the United States keeps on its path, its current path of\nweakness, they’re going to want to have that anyway with or without me\ndiscussing it, because I don’t think they feel very secure in what’s going on\nwith our country, David. You know, if you look at how we backed our enemies,\nit hasn’t – how we backed our allies – it hasn’t exactly been strong. When you\nlook at various places throughout the world, it hasn’t been very strong. And I\njust don’t think we’re viewed the same way that we were 20 or 25 years ago, or\n30 years ago. And, you know, I think it’s a problem. You know, something like\nthat, unless we get very strong, very powerful and very rich, quickly, I’m\nsure those things are being discussed over there anyway without our\ndiscussion.**HABERMAN:** Will you –**SANGER:** And would you have an objection\nto it?**TRUMP:** Um, at some point, we cannot be the policeman of the world.\nAnd unfortunately, we have a nuclear world now. And you have, Pakistan has\nthem. You have, probably, North Korea has them. I mean, they don’t have\ndelivery yet, but you know, probably, I mean to me, that’s a big problem. And,\nwould I rather have North Korea have them with Japan sitting there having them\nalso? You may very well be better off if that’s the case. In other words,\nwhere Japan is defending itself against North Korea, which is a real problem.\nYou very well may have a better case right there. We certainly haven’t been\nable to do much with him and with North Korea. But you may very well have a\nbetter case. You know, one of the things with the, with our Japanese\nrelationship, and I’m a big fan of Japan, by the way. I have many, many\nfriends there. I do business with Japan. But, that, if we are attacked, they\ndon’t have to do anything. If they’re attacked, we have to go out with full\nforce. You understand. That’s a pretty one-sided agreement, right there. In\nother words, if we’re attacked, they do not have to come to our defense, if\nthey’re attacked, we have to come totally to their defense. And that is a,\nthat’s a real problem.**HABERMAN:** Would you, you were just talking about the\nnuclear world we live in, and you’ve said many times, and I’ve heard you say\nit throughout the campaign, that you want the U.S. to be more unpredictable.\nWould you be willing to have the U.S. be the first to use nuclear weapons in a\nconfrontation with adversaries?**TRUMP:** An absolute last step. I think it’s\nthe biggest, I personally think it’s the biggest problem the world has,\nnuclear capability. I think it’s the single biggest problem. When people talk\nglobal warming, I say the global warming that we have to be careful of is the\nnuclear global warming. Single biggest problem that the world has. Power of\nweaponry today is beyond anything ever thought of, or even, you know, it’s\nunthinkable, the power. You look at Hiroshima and you can multiply that times\nmany, many times, is what you have today. And to me, it’s the single biggest,\nit’s the single biggest problem.**SANGER:** You know, we have an alternative\nthese days in a growing cyberarsenal. You’ve seen the growing cybercommand and\nso forth. Could you give us a vision of whether or not you think that the\nUnited States should regularly be using cyberweapons, perhaps, as an\nalternative to nuclear? And if so, how would you either threaten or employ\nthose?**TRUMP:** I don’t see it as an alternative to nuclear in terms of, in\nterms of ultimate power. Look, in the perfect world everybody would agree that\nnuclear would, you know, be so destructive, and this was always the theory, or\nwas certainly the theory of many. That the power is so enormous that nobody\nwould ever use them. But, as you know, we’re dealing with people in the world\ntoday that would use them, O.K.? Possibly numerous people that use them, and\nuse them without hesitation if they had them. And there’s nothing, there’s\nnothing as, there’s nothing as meaningful or as powerful as that, and you know\nthe problem is, and it used to be, and you would hear this, David, and I would\nhear it, and everybody would hear it, and — I’m not sure I believed it, ever.\nI talk sometimes about my uncle from M.I.T., and he would tell me many years\nago when he was up at M.I.T. as a, he was a professor, he was a great guy in\nmany respects, but a very brilliant guy, and he would tell me many years ago\nabout the power of weapons someday, that the destructive force of these\nweapons would be so massive, that it’s going to be a scary world. And, you\nknow, we have been under the impression that, well we’ve been, I think it’s\nmisguided somewhat, I’ve always felt this but that nobody would ever use them\nbecause of the power. And the first one to use them, I think that would be a\nvery bad thing. And I will tell you, I would very much not want to be the\nfirst one to use them, that I can say.**HABERMAN:** O.K.**SANGER:** The\nquestion was about cyber, how would you envision using cyberweapons?\nCyberweapons in an attack to take out a power grid in a city, so\nforth.**TRUMP:** First off, we’re so obsolete in cyber. We’re the ones that\nsort of were very much involved with the creation, but we’re so obsolete, we\njust seem to be toyed with by so many different countries, already. And we\ndon’t know who’s doing what. We don’t know who’s got the power, who’s got that\ncapability, some people say it’s China, some people say it’s Russia. But\ncertainly cyber has to be a, you know, certainly cyber has to be in our\nthought process, very strongly in our thought process. Inconceivable that,\ninconceivable the power of cyber. But as you say, you can take out, you can\ntake out, you can make countries nonfunctioning with a strong use of cyber. I\ndon’t think we’re there. I don’t think we’re as advanced as other countries\nare, and I think you probably would agree with that. I don’t think we’re\nadvanced, I think we’re going backwards in so many different ways. I think\nwe’re going backwards with our military. I certainly don’t think we are, we\nmove forward with cyber, but other countries are moving forward at a much more\nrapid pace. We are frankly not being led very well in terms of the protection\nof this country.**HABERMAN:** Mr. Trump, just a quick follow-up on that\nquestion. As you know, we discovered in recent years that the U.S. spies\nextensively against its allies. That’s what came up with Edward Snowden and\nhis data trove including Israel and Germany.**TRUMP:** Edward Snowden has\ncaused us tremendous problems.**HABERMAN:** But would you continue the\nprograms that are in place now, or would you halt them, in terms of spying\nagainst our allies?**SANGER:** Like Israel and Germany.**TRUMP:** Right.\nThey’re spying against us. Edward Snowden has caused us tremendous problems.\nEdward Snowden has been, you know, you have the two views on Snowden,\nobviously: You have, he’s wonderful, and you have he’s horrible. I’m in the\nhorrible category. He’s caused us tremendous problems with trust, with\neverything about, you know, when they’re showing, Merkel’s cellphone has been\nspied on, and are – Now, they’re doing it to us, and other countries certainly\nare doing it to us, and but what I think what he did, I think it was a\ntremendous, a tremendous disservice to the United States. I think and I think\nit’s amazing that we can’t get him back.**SANGER:** President Obama ordered an\nend to the spying, to the listening in on Angela Merkel’s cellphone, if that’s\nin fact what we were doing. Was that the right decision?**TRUMP:** Well you\nsee, I don’t know that, you know, when I talk about unpredictability, I’m not\nsure that we should be talking about me – On the assumption that I’m doing\nwell, which I am, and that I may be in that position, I’m not sure that I\nwould want to be talking about that. You understand what I mean by that,\nDavid. We’re so open, we’re so, “Oh I wouldn’t do this, I wouldn’t do that, I\nwould do this, I would do that.” And it’s not so much with Merkel, but it’s\ncertainly with other countries. You know, that really, where there’s, where\nthere’s a different kind of relationship, and a much worse relationship than\nwith Germany. So, you know there’s so, there’s such predictability with our\ncountry. We go and we send 50 soldiers over to the Middle East and President\nObama gets up and announces that we’re sending 50 soldiers to the Middle East.\nFifty very special soldiers. And they now have a target on their back, and\neverything we do, we announce, instead of winning, and announcing when it’s\nall over. There’s such, total predictability of this country, and it’s one of\nthe reasons we do so poorly. You know, I’d rather not say that. I would like\nto see what they’re doing. Because you know, many countries, I can’t say\nGermany, but many countries are spying on us. I think that was a great\ndisservice done by Edward Snowden. That I can tell you.**HABERMAN:** Mr.\nTrump, you have talked about your plans to defeat ISIS, and how you would\napproach it. Would you be willing to stop buying oil from the Saudis if\nthey’re unwilling to go in and help?**SANGER:** On the ground?**TRUMP:** Oh\nyeah, sure. I would do that. The beautiful thing about oil is that, you know,\nwe’re really getting close, because of fracking, and because of new\ntechnology, we’re really in a position that we weren’t in, you know, years\nago, and the reason we’re in the Middle East is for oil. And all of a sudden\nwe’re finding out that there’s less reason to be. Now, now, we’re in the\nMiddle East for really defense, because we can’t allow them, I mean, look, I\nwas against the war in Iraq. I thought it would destabilize the Middle East,\nand it has destabilized it, it’s totally destabilized the Middle East. The way\nObama got out of the war was, you know, disgraceful, and idiotic. When he\nannounced the date certain, they pulled back, and they said, “Oh, well.” As\nmuch as they don’t mind dying, they do mind dying. And they pulled back, and\nthen, you know, it’s a, it was a terrible thing the way he announced that, and\nthen he didn’t leave troops behind so that, you know, whatever there was of\nIraq, which in my opinion wasn’t very much, because I think that, you know,\nthe government was totally corrupt, and they put the wrong people in charge,\nand you know, that in its own way led to the formation of ISIS, because they\nweren’t given their due. But, I think that President Obama, the way he got out\nof that war was unbelievable. I think Hillary Clinton was catastrophic in\nthose decisions, having to do with Libya and just about everything else. Every\nbad decision that you could make in the Middle East was made. And now if you\nlook at it, if you would go back 15 years ago, and I’m not saying it was only\nObama, It was Obama’s getting out, it was other people’s getting in, but you\ngo back 15 years ago, and I say this, if our presidents would have just gone\nto the beach and enjoyed the ocean and the sun, we would’ve been much better\noff in the Middle East, than all of this tremendous death, destruction, and\nyou know, monetary loss, it’s just incredible. ’Cause we’re further, we’re far\nworse off today than we were 15 years ago or 10 years ago in the Middle East.\nFar worse.**SANGER:** But I just want to make sure I understand your answer to\nMaggie’s question. So you said earlier this week that we should use air power\nbut not send in ground forces. That had to be done by the regional Arab\npartners. We assume by that, you mean the Saudis, the U.A.E. and others from\nwhom we might purchase oil or have alliances. I think Maggie’s question, if I\nunderstood it right, was if these countries are unwilling to send in ground\ntroops against ISIS, and so far they have been, despite President Obama’s\nefforts to get them in, would you be willing to say, “We will stop buying oil\nfrom you, until you send ground troops?”**TRUMP:** There’s two answers to\nthat. The answer is, probably yes, but I would also say this: We are not being\nreimbursed for our protection of many of the countries that you’ll be talking\nabout, that, including Saudi Arabia. You know, Saudi Arabia, for a period of\ntime, now the oil has gone down, but still the numbers are phenomenal, and the\namount of money they have is phenomenal. But we protect countries, and take\ntremendous monetary hits on protecting countries. That would include Saudi\nArabia, but it would include many other countries, as you know. We have,\nthere’s a whole big list of them. We lose, everywhere. We lose monetarily,\neverywhere. And yet, without us, Saudi Arabia wouldn’t exist for very long. It\nwould be, you know, a catastrophic failure without our protection. And I’m\ntrying to figure out, why is it that we aren’t going in and saying, at a\nminimum, at a minimum it’s a two-part question, with respect to Maggie’s\nquestion. But why aren’t we going in and saying, “At a minimum, I’m sorry\nfolks, but you have to, under no circumstances can we continue to do this.”\nYou know, we needed, we needed oil desperately years ago. Today, because –\nagain, because of the new technologies, and because of places that we never\nthought had oil, and they do have oil, and there’s a glut on the market,\nthere’s a tremendous glut on the market, I mean you have ships out at sea that\nare loaded up and they don’t even know where to go dump it. But we don’t have\nthat same pressure anymore, at all. And we shouldn’t have that for a long\nperiod of time, because there’s so many places. I mean, they’re closing wells\nall over the place. So, I would say this, I would say at a minimum, we have to\nbe reimbursed, substantially reimbursed, I mean, to a point that’s far greater\nthan what we’re being paid right now. Because we’re not being reimbursed for\nthe kind of tremendous service that we’re performing by protecting various\ncountries. Now Saudi Arabia’s one of them. I think if Saudi Arabia was without\nthe cloak of American protection of our country’s, of U.S. protection, think\nof Saudi Arabia. I don’t think it would be around. It would be, whether it was\ninternal or external, it wouldn’t be around for very long. And they’re a money\nmachine, they’re a monetary machine, and yet they don’t reimburse us the way\nwe should be reimbursed. So that’s a real problem. And frankly, I think it’s a\nreal, in terms of bringing our country back, because our country’s a poor\ncountry. Our country is a debtor nation, we’re a debtor nation. I mean, we owe\ntrillions of dollars to people that are buying our bonds, in the form of other\ncountries. You look at China, where we owe them $1.7 trillion, you have Japan,\n$1.5 trillion. We’re a debtor nation. We can’t be a debtor nation. I don’t\nwant to be a debtor nation. I want it to be the other way. One of the reasons\nwe’re a debtor nation, we spend so much on the military, but the military\nisn’t for us. The military is to be policeman for other countries. And to\nwatch over other countries. And there comes a point that, and many of these\ncountries are tremendously rich countries. Not powerful countries, but – in\nsome cases they are powerful – but rich countries.**SANGER:** One more along\nthe lines of your ISIS strategy. You’ve seen the current strategy, which is,\nyou’ve seen Secretary Kerry trying to seek a political accord between\nPresident Assad and the rebel forces, with Assad eventually leaving. And then\nthe hope is to turn all those forces, including Russia and Iran, against ISIS.\nIs that the right way to do it? Do you have an alternative approach?**TRUMP:**\nWell, I thought the approach of fighting Assad and ISIS simultaneously was\nmadness, and idiocy. They’re fighting each other and yet we’re fighting both\nof them. You know, we were fighting both of them. I think that our far bigger\nproblem than Assad is ISIS, I’ve always felt that. Assad is, you know I’m not\nsaying Assad is a good man, ’cause he’s not, but our far greater problem is\nnot Assad, it’s ISIS.**SANGER:** I think President Obama would agree with\nthat.**TRUMP:** O.K., well, that’s good. But at the same time – yeah, he would\nagree with that, I think to an extent. But I think, you can’t be fighting two\npeople that are fighting each other, and fighting them together. You have to\npick one or the other. And you have to go at –**SANGER:** So how would your\nstrategy differ from what he’s doing right now?**TRUMP:** Well I can only tell\nyou – I can’t tell you, because his strategy, it’s open and it would seem to\nbe fighting ISIS but he’s fighting it in such a limited capacity. I’ve been\nsaying, take the oil. I’ve been saying it for years. Take the oil. They still\nhaven’t taken the oil. They still haven’t taken it. And they hardly hit the\noil. They hardly make a dent in the oil.**SANGER:** The oil that ISIS is\npumping.**TRUMP:** Yes, the oil that ISIS is pumping, where they’re getting\ntremendous amounts of revenue. I’ve said, hit the banking channels. You know,\nthey have very sophisticated banking channels, which I understand, but I don’t\nthink a lot of people do understand. You know, they’re taking in tremendous\namounts of money from banking channels. That, you know, many people in\ncountries that you think are our allies, are giving ISIS tremendous amounts of\nmoney and it’s going through very dark banking channels. And we should have\nstopped those banking channels long ago and I think we’ve done nothing to stop\nthem, and that money is massive. Massive. It’s a massive amount of money. So\nit’s not only from oil, David, it’s from also the bank, the bank. It’s through\nbanks. And very sophisticated channels. They call them the dark channels. Very\nsophisticated channels. And money is coming in from people that we think are\nour allies.**HABERMAN:** Mr. Trump, I also want to go back to something you\nsaid earlier this week about NATO being ineffective. Do you think it’s the\nright institution for countering terror or do we need a new one and what might\nthat new one look like?**TRUMP:** Well I said something a few days ago and I\nwas vastly criticized and I notice now this morning, people are saying Donald\nTrump is a genius. Because what I said – which of course is always nice to\nhear, David. But I was asked a question about NATO, and I’ve thought this but\nI have never expressed my opinion because until recently I’ve been an\nentrepreneur, I’ve been a very successful entrepreneur as opposed to a\npolitician. And – I’d love to ask David, Maggie, if he’s a little surprised at\nhow well I’ve done. You know, we’ve knocked out a lot. We’re down to the\nleftovers now, from the way I look at it. I call them the\nleftovers._(Laughter.)_So anyway, but the question was asked of me a few days\nago about NATO, and I said, well, I have two problems with NATO. No. 1, it’s\nobsolete. When NATO was formed many decades ago we were a different country.\nThere was a different threat. Soviet Union was, the Soviet Union, not Russia,\nwhich was much bigger than Russia, as you know. And, it was certainly much\nmore powerful than even today’s Russia, although again you go back into the\nweaponry. But, but – I said, I think NATO is obsolete, and I think that –\nbecause I don’t think – right now we don’t have somebody looking at terror,\nand we should be looking at terror. And you may want to add and subtract from\nNATO in terms of countries. But we have to be looking at terror, because\nterror today is the big threat. Terror from all different parts. You know in\nthe old days you’d have uniforms and you’d go to war and you’d see who your\nenemy was, and today we have no idea who the enemy is.**SANGER:** If you just\nthink about Maggie’s question about whether it’s the right institution for\nthis, when you go to NATO these days, in Brussels, not far from where we’ve\nseen — just miles from where we saw the attacks the other day —**TRUMP:**\nWhich is amazing, right? Which is amazing in itself. Yes?**SANGER:** What\nthey’ll say to you is that Russia is resurgent right now. They are rebuilding\ntheir nuclear arsenal. They’re [unintelligible] Baltics. We’ve got submarine\nruns, air runs. Things that have at least echoes of the old Cold War. The view\nis that their mission is coming back. Do you agree with that?**TRUMP:** I’ll\ntell you the problems I have with NATO. No. 1, we pay far too much. We are\nspending — you know, in fact, they’re even making it so the percentages are\ngreater. NATO is unfair, economically, to us, to the United States. Because it\nreally helps them more so than the United States, and we pay a\ndisproportionate share. Now, I’m a person that — you notice I talk about\neconomics quite a bit, in these military situations, because it is about\neconomics, because we don’t have money anymore because we’ve been taking care\nof so many people in so many different forms that we don’t have money — and\ncountries, and countries. So NATO is something that at the time was excellent.\nToday, it has to be changed. It has to be changed to include terror. It has to\nbe changed from the standpoint of cost because the United States bears far too\nmuch of the cost of NATO. And one of the things that I hated seeing is\nUkraine. Now I’m all for Ukraine, I have friends that live in Ukraine, but it\ndidn’t seem to me, when the Ukrainian problem arose, you know, not so long\nago, and we were, and Russia was getting very confrontational, it didn’t seem\nto me like anyone else cared other than us. And we are the least affected by\nwhat happens with Ukraine because we’re the farthest away. But even their\nneighbors didn’t seem to be talking about it. And, you know, you look at\nGermany, you look at other countries, and they didn’t seem to be very much\ninvolved. It was all about us and Russia. And I wondered, why is it that\ncountries that are bordering the Ukraine and near the Ukraine – why is it that\nthey’re not more involved? Why is it that they are not more involved? Why is\nit always the United States that gets right in the middle of things, with\nsomething that – you know, it affects us, but not nearly as much as it affects\nother countries. And then I say, and on top of everything else – and I think\nyou understand that, David – because, if you look back, and if you study your\nreports and everybody else’s reports, how often do you see other countries\nsaying ‘We must stop, we must stop.” They don’t do it! And, in fact, with the\ngas, you know, they wanted the oil, they wanted other things from Russia, and\nthey were just keeping their mouths shut. And here the United States was going\nout and, you know, being fairly tough on the Ukraine. And I said to myself,\nisn’t that interesting? We’re fighting for the Ukraine, but nobody else is\nfighting for the Ukraine other than the Ukraine itself, of course, and I said,\nit doesn’t seem fair and it doesn’t seem logical.**HABERMAN:** Mr. Trump,\nspeaking of –**TRUMP:** David, does that make sense to you, by the\nway?**SANGER:** Well, President Obama said the other day in an interview he\nhad that he thought that Russia, over time, was always going to have more\ninfluence over Ukraine than we would or anyone else would just given both the\nhistory and the geography.**TRUMP:** And the location, right. The geography. I\nwould agree with him.**SANGER:** And so in the end do you agree that Russia is\ngoing to end up dominating the Ukraine?**TRUMP:** Well, unless, unless there\nis, you know, somewhat of a resurgence frankly from people that are around it.\nOr they would ask us for help. But they don’t ask us for help. They’re not\neven asking us for help. They’re literally not even talking about it, and\nthese are the countries that border the Ukraine.**HABERMAN:** Mr. Trump\n–**TRUMP:** There doesn’t seem to be any great anxiety over the Ukraine by\neverybody that should be affected and that’s bordering the Ukraine.**SANGER:**\nThere are several countries that have joined NATO in recent times – Estonia,\namong them, and so forth – that we are now bound by treaty to defend if Russia\nmoved in. Would you observe that part of the treaty?**TRUMP:** Yeah, I would.\nIt’s a treaty, it’s there. I mean, we defend everybody. _(Laughs.) _We defend\neverybody. No matter who it is, we defend everybody. We’re defending the\nworld. But we owe, soon, it’s soon to be $21 trillion. You know, it’s 19 now\nbut it’s soon to be 21 trillion. But we defend everybody. When in doubt, come\nto the United States. We’ll defend you. In some cases free of charge. And in\nall cases for a substantially, you know, greater amount. We spend a\nsubstantially greater amount than what the people are paying. We, we have to\nthink also in terms – we have to think about the world, but we also have – I\nmean look at what China’s doing in the South China Sea. I mean they are\ntotally disregarding our country and yet we have made China a rich country\nbecause of our bad trade deals. Our trade deals are so bad. And we have made\nthem – we have rebuilt China and yet they will go in the South China Sea and\nbuild a military fortress the likes of which perhaps the world has not seen.\nAmazing, actually. They do that, and they do that at will because they have no\nrespect for our president and they have no respect for our country. Hey folks,\nI’m going to have to get off here now. Did you –**HABERMAN:** I just had one\nquick follow-up on what you were saying about the South China Sea. How would\nyou counter that assertiveness over those islands? Among other things, it’s\nincreasingly valuable real estate strategically. Would you be willing to build\nour own islands there?**TRUMP:** Well what you have to do – and you have to\nspeak to Japan and other countries, because they’re affected far greater than\nwe are – you understand that – I mean, they’re affected far – I just think the\nact is so brazen, and it’s so terrible that they would do that without any\nconsultation, without anything, and yet they’ll sell their products to the\nUnited States and rebuild China, and frankly, even the islands, I mean, you\nknow, they’ve made so much economic progress because of the United States. And\nin the meantime we’re becoming a third-world nation. You look at our airports,\nyou look at our roadways, you look at our bridges are falling down. They’re\nbuilding bridges all over the place, ours are falling down. You know, we’ve\nrebuilt China. The money they’ve drained out of the United States has rebuilt\nChina. And they’ve done it through monetary manipulation, by devaluations. And\nvery sophisticated. I mean, they’re grand chess players at devaluation. But\nthey’ve done it –**SANGER:** I think what Maggie was asking was how would you\ndeter their activity. Right now _(Crosstalk)_ – But would you claim some of\nthose reef scenarios to try to build our own military –**TRUMP:** Perhaps, but\nwe have great economic – and people don’t understand this – but we have\ntremendous economic power over China. We have tremendous power. And that’s the\npower of trade. Because they use us as their bank, as their piggy bank, they\ntake – but they don’t have to pay us back. It’s better than a bank because\nthey take money out but then they don’t have to pay us back.**SANGER:** So you\nwould cut into trade in return –**TRUMP:** No, I would use trade to\nnegotiate.**HABERMAN:** Oh, O.K. My last question. Sir, my last –**TRUMP:** I\nwould use trade to negotiate. Would I go to war? Look, let me just tell you.\nThere’s a question I wouldn’t want to answer. Because I don’t want to say I\nwon’t or I will or – do you understand that, David? That’s the problem with\nour country. A politician would say, ‘Oh I would never go to war,’ or they’d\nsay, ‘Oh I would go to war.’ I don’t want to say what I’d do because, again,\nwe need unpredictability. You know, if I win, I don’t want to be in a position\nwhere I’ve said I would or I wouldn’t. I don’t want them to know what I’m\nthinking. The problem we have is that, maybe because it’s a democracy and\nmaybe because we have to be so open – maybe because you have to say what you\nhave to say in order to get elected – who knows? But I wouldn’t want to say. I\nwouldn’t want them to know what my real thinking is. But I will tell you this.\nThis is the one aspect I can tell you. I would use trade, absolutely, as a\nbargaining chip.**HABERMAN:** Mr. Trump, how did you come to settle on your\nforeign policy team? I know that it’s still in formation and you’ve said\n–**TRUMP:** Recommended by people. And we’re going to have new people put in.\nIn fact, we have additional people too. You’ve got the one list, I think, but\nwe have – we actually have – I only gave certain names.**HABERMAN:** But did\nyou meet with them?**TRUMP:** We have some others that I really like a lot and\nwe’re going to put them in. Maj. Gen. Gary Harrell. Maj. Gen. Bert Mizuwawa.\n_(Ed. note: It’s Mizusawa.)_**HABERMAN:** These are the additional\nones?**TRUMP:** Rear Adm. Chuck Kubic. Yeah. He’s Navy, retired. Very good,\nnice, supposedly.**HABERMAN:** Interesting. Interesting.**TRUMP:** These are\npeople recommended – people that I respect recommended them. People – I’ve\nheard very good things about them. In addition, we’re going to be adding some\nadditional names that I’ve liked over the years.**HABERMAN:** Ah,\nO.K.**TRUMP:** I have very strong – as you’ve probably noticed – I’ve had very\nstrong feelings on foreign policy and I’ve had very strong feelings on defense\nand offense. And I’ve been right about a lot of the things I’ve been saying.\nI’ve been right about a lot. And The New York Times criticized me very badly\nwith a very major article when I said Brussels is a hellhole, and I talked\nabout Brussels in a very negative way because of what they’re doing over\nthere. And yesterday all over Twitter, as you probably saw, everybody said\nthat Trump is right, The New York Times – You know, The New York Times really\nhit me hard on Brussels when I said recently that it’s a hellhole, and waiting\nto explode. And I didn’t even realize it, and then yesterday all over the\nplace, Twitter was crazy that Trump was right, again, this time about\nBrussels.**HABERMAN:** You mean after the attacks?**TRUMP:** I’ve been right –\nYeah, after the attack. I’ve been right about a lot of different things. So.\nAnyway. You know, in my book I mention Osama bin Laden, and I wrote the book\nin 2000, prior to the World Trade Center coming down and the reason I did is\nthat I saw this guy and I read about this terrorist who was a very aggressive,\nbad dude. And I wrote about it in “The America We Deserve.” I wrote about\nOsama bin Laden. You know, not a lot, but a couple paragraphs – about Osama\nbin Laden. Look at him. You better take a look at him. And a year and a half\nlater the World Trade Center came down. And your friend Joe Scarborough,\ninterestingly, in one of his – you know, somebody had mentioned that, and Joe\nsaid, ‘No way. There’s no way he wrote about it before the fact.’ And they\nsaid no, no, and they sent out for the book, and they put it before him and he\nsaid, ‘Wow, you’re right. Trump wrote about Osama bin Laden before the World\nTrade Center came down. That’s amazing.’ So look, I’ve said a lot. I don’t get\na lot of credit. I do from the people. I don’t from a lot of the media. But\nthat’s O.K. I’d rather keep it that way. Hey David, I’d rather have it that\nway, I guess, right?_(Laughter.)_**SANGER:** You have told us a lot about what\nyour leverage would be over China in trade. Tell us on Iran: I know that\nyou’ve said that you think that the Iran deal was an extremely bad deal. I’d\nbe interested to know what your goals would be in renegotiating it. What your\nleverage would be and what you would renegotiate, what parts of the\nagreement.**TRUMP:** Sure. It’s not just that it’s a bad deal, David. It’s a\ndeal that could’ve been so much better just if they’d walked a couple of\ntimes. They negotiated so badly. They were being mocked, they were being\nscorned, they were being harassed, our negotiators, including Kerry, back in\nIran, by the various representatives and the leaders of Iran at the highest\nlevel. And they never walked. They should’ve walked, doubled up the sanctions,\nand made a good deal. Gotten the prisoners out long before, not just after\nthey gave the $150 billion. They should’ve never given the money back. There\nwere so many things that were done, they were so, the negotiation was, and I\nthink deals are fine, I think they’re good, not bad. But, you gotta make good\ndeals, not bad deals. This deal was a disaster.**SANGER:** So, it’s a deal you\nwould inherit if you were elected, so what I’m trying to get at is, what would\nyou insist on. Are the restrictions on nuclear not long enough, are the\nmissile restrictions not strong enough?**TRUMP:** Certainly the deal is not\nlong enough. Because at the end of the deal they’re going to have great\nnuclear capability. So certainly the deal isn’t long enough. I would never\nhave given them back the $150 billion under any circumstances. I would’ve\nnever allowed that to happen. They are, they are now rich, and did you notice\nthey’re buying from everybody but the United States? They’re buying planes,\nthey’re buying everything, they’re buying from everybody but the United\nStates. I would never have made the deal.**SANGER:** Our law prevents us from\nselling to them, sir.**TRUMP:** Uh, excuse me?**SANGER:** Our law prevents us\nfrom selling any planes or, we still have sanctions in the U.S. that would\nprevent the U.S. from being able to sell that equipment.**TRUMP:** So, how\nstupid is that? We give them the money, and we now say, “Go buy Airbus instead\nof Boeing,” right? So how stupid is that? In itself, what you just said, which\nis correct by the way, but would they now go and buy, you know, they bought\n118 approximately, 118 Airbus planes. They didn’t buy Boeing planes, O.K.? We\ngive them the money, and we say you can’t spend it in the United States, and\ncreate wealth and jobs in the United States. And on top of it, they didn’t,\nthey in theory, I guess, cannot do that, you know, based on what I’ve\nunderstood. They can’t do that. It’s hard to believe. We gave them $150\nbillion and they can’t spend it in our country.**SANGER:** So you would lift\nthe domestic sanctions so they could buy American goods?**TRUMP:** Well, I\nwouldn’t have given them back the money. So I wouldn’t be in that position. I\nwould never have given them back the – that would never be a part of the\nnegotiation. I would have never, ever given it to them, and I would’ve made a\nbetter deal than they made, without the money, and I would’ve made a better\ndeal.**SANGER:** And to stop the missile launches they’ve been\ndoing?**TRUMP:** Well, it’s ridiculous, I mean, now they’re doing missile\nlaunches, and they’re buying missiles from Russia, and they’re doing things\nthat nobody thought were, you know, even permissible or in the deal, and\nthey’re doing them.**HABERMAN:** Mr. Trump, one thing you didn’t talk about\n–**TRUMP:** That deal was one of the most incompetent deals of any kind I’ve\never seen.**HABERMAN:** One thing you talked about at Aipac –**TRUMP:** Right,\nDavid, so I wouldn’t talk in terms of not buying because I would’ve never,\never given them the money. Go ahead.**HABERMAN:** Sorry, sir, one thing that\ndidn’t come up at Aipac, I think in actually anyone’s speeches, but in yours\nalso, I’m curious, in terms of Israel, and in terms of the peace process, do\nyou think it should result in a two-state solution, or in a single\nstate?**TRUMP:** Well, I think a lot of people are saying it’s going to result\nin a two-state solution. What I would love to do is to, a lot of people are\nsaying that. I’m not saying anything. What I’m going to do is, you know, I\nspecifically don’t want to address the issue because I would love to see if a\ndeal could be made. If a deal could be made. Now, I’m not sure it can be made,\nthere’s such unbelievable hatred, there’s such, it’s ingrained, it’s in the\nblood, the hatred and the distrust, and the horror. But I would love to see if\na real deal could be made. Not a deal that you know, lasts for three months,\nand then everybody starts shooting again. And a big part of that deal, you\nknow, has to be to end terror, we have to end terror. But I would say this, in\norder to negotiate a deal, I’d want to go in there as evenly as possible and\nwe’ll see if we can negotiate a deal. But I would absolutely give that a very\nhard try to do. You know, a lot of people think that’s the hardest of all\ndeals to negotiate. A lot of people think that. So, but I would say that I\nwould have a better chance than anybody of making a deal. I’ll tell you one\nthing, people that I know from Israel, many people, many, many people, and\nalmost everybody would love to see a deal on the side of Israel. Everybody\nwould, now with that being said, most people don’t think a deal can be made.\nBut from the Israeli side, they would love to see a deal. And I’ve been a\nlittle bit surprised here. Now that I’m really into it, I’ve been a little bit\nsurprised to hear that. I would’ve said, I would’ve said that maybe, maybe you\nknow, maybe Israel never really wanted to make a deal or doesn’t really want\nto make a deal. They really want to make a deal, they want to make a good\ndeal, they want to make a fair deal, but they do want to make a deal. And,\nalmost everybody, and I’m talking to people off the record, and off the\nrecord, they really would like to see a deal. I’m not so sure that the other\nside can mentally, you know, get their heads around the deal, because the\nhatred is so incredible. Folks, I have to go._Second interview\nbegins:_**TRUMP: **So go ahead, start off wherever you want.**SANGER: **One\nplace that might be a good place to start is where we ended up on the foreign\npolicy advisers. Because we’re trying to figure out how much time you’re\ncutting out now for foreign policy as you said — it’s not an area you focused\non in your business career as much.**TRUMP: **Well I enjoyed it, I enjoyed\nreading about it. But it wasn’t something that came into play as a business\nperson. But I had an aptitude for it I think, and I enjoyed reading about and\nI would read about it.**SANGER: **One question we had for you is, first of\nall, since you enjoyed reading about it, is there any particular book or set\nof articles that you found influential in developing your own foreign policy\nviews?**TRUMP: **More than anything else would be various newspapers including\nyour own, you really get a vast array and, you know a big menu of different\npeople and different ideas. You know you get a very big array of things from\nreading the media, from seeing the media, the papers, including yours. And\nit’s something that I’ve always found interesting and I think I’ve adapted to\nit pretty well. I will tell you my whole stance on NATO, David, has been — I\njust got back and I’m watching television and that’s all they’re talking\nabout. And you know when I first said it, they sort of were scoffing. And now\nthey’re really saying, well wait, do you know it’s really right? And maybe\nNATO — you know, it doesn’t talk about terror. Terror is a big thing right\nnow. That wasn’t the big thing when it originated and people are starting to\ntalk about the cost.**SANGER: **Well it’s geared toward state actors and\nyou’re discussing gearing something toward nonstate actors. Is it possible\nthat we need a new institution that is not burdened by the military structure\nof NATO in order to deal with nonstate actors and terrorists?**TRUMP: **I\nactually think in terms of terror you may be better off with a new\ninstitution, an institution that would be more fairly based, an institution\nthat would be more fairly taken care of from an economic standpoint. You have\nmany wealthy states over there that are not going to be there if it’s not for\nus, and they’re not going to be there if it is for terror. Whether it’s Saudi\nArabia or others. I actually do think, while I’d like to adapt it, I think you\nhave a different set of players, frankly. You have more of a Middle Eastern\nplayer and others but you would have in addition, Middle Eastern\nplayers.**SANGER: **Who are not currently members of NATO. You think the\nmembership of NATO is not set up right for combating terror.**TRUMP: **No, it\nwas set up to talk about the Soviet Union. Now of course the Soviet Union\ndoesn’t exist now it’s Russia, which is not the same size, in theory not the\nsame power, but who knows about that because of weaponry, but it’s not the\nsame size and this was set up for numerous things but for the Soviet Union.\nThe point is the world is a much different place right now. And today all you\nhave to do is read and see the world is, the big threat would seem to be based\non terror and based on what’s going on in 90 percent, 95 percent of the horror\nstories. I think, probably a new institution maybe would be better for that\nthan using NATO which was not meant for that. And it’s become very\nbureaucratic, extremely expensive and maybe is not flexible enough to go after\nterror. Terror is very much different than what NATO was set up for.**SANGER:\n**And requires a different kind of force.**TRUMP: **I think it requires a\ndifferent flexibility, it requires a different speed maybe, watching nations\nor a nation or nations. I think it requires flexibility and speed.**SANGER:\n**So Maggie and I were at the end of our conversation this morning we were\ntalking with you a little bit about your foreign policy advisers. There’s been\na little bit of a sense that you’ve had a hard time attracting some of the\nbigger names of your party. There were a lot of former deputy secretaries of\nstate, of defense, others were out there. And the list of advisers you’ve\nreleased so far has been very strong on having military backgrounds but not\nmany with diplomatic backgrounds. We were wondering whether or not you are\nlooking for a different mix or whether you’re having trouble attracting some\nof the big names.**TRUMP: **It’s interesting, it’s not trouble attracting.\nMany of them that I actually like a lot and that like me a lot and that want\nto do 100 percent, many of them are tied up with contracts working for various\nnetworks, you understand? I mean, I’ve had some that are — I currently have\nsome that are thinking about getting out of their contract ‘cause they’re so\nexcited about it. I’ve had a lot of excitement but there are some that are\ntied up where they have a contract with, as an example, they might have a\ncontract with Fox, they may have a contract with CNN and they can’t do it.\nThey have contracts with the various networks and maybe the media too. I don’t\nknow about The Times but it’s possible — I think less likely, I’m not sure how\nthat structure works with the actual newspapers. But there are some that I’ve\nspoken to that want to do it but they’re tied up with contracts that are with\nsomebody else. There are some that were with campaigns that have now imploded,\nand I think they’re going to be free agents very shortly. Hey, a lot of\ncampaigns have imploded in the last couple of months, which you people perhaps\nhave seen just as vividly as I have. Right? Not as happily as I have, but\nnevertheless just as vividly. So you know there are actually, there are a lot\nof people available, there are a lot of good people available. But some of the\ngood people are currently under contract. Does that make sense to you,\nDavid?**SANGER: **Yup, Maggie, did you having anything more on that before we\nwanted to turn back to Israel?**HABERMAN:** Yeah, Mr. Trump, if you could just\nsay how much time are you devoting a week at this point either to briefings to\nstudying, you know, and if there’s no major change now what it might look like\nin the future?**TRUMP: **I think that you know, what I’ve really had to do is\nget through 17, cause it was really 18 total when we started. So I had to get\nthrough 17 people. I’ve gotten through almost all of the 17 people. But I’m\ndown to two, from 17 to two. And you know many of them were front-runners, and\nthey weren’t front-runners for very long. You can go through the list, you\nknow the list as well as I do. And my primary focus was that.But during the\nperiod I’ve been, I think very well versed on matters as we’re discussing and\nmany more than just what we’re just discussing. Now as it gets — as we get you\nknow closer to the end of the process it‘ll take place more and more. I’m\nsetting up a council, I’m setting up — and I have other people coming in, I\ngave you the other few names I think that we added, we have a few more coming\nin. But I have a few more that are going to come in. I just don’t want to I\njust don’t want to mention them unless they give me approval, meaning they’re\non board.And we’re going to have a very substantial council of very good\npeople. And some of them are military. Look, the military is going to be very\nimportant because we have to do something with ISIS, David, and you know we do\nwant the military. And I think that over the next few weeks I’ll be able to\ngive you some more names. People that are going to be coming in.**SANGER: **Do\nyou fear that if you have too many military on your council, they tend to\nsearch for the military solution first instead of the diplomatic or economic\nsanction solution first?**TRUMP: **Yeah but I’d like to know the military\nsolution and I’m working on the military solution. Because there’s not huge\nnegotiation involved with ISS, because there’s an irrationality that is pretty\n— this is not something, ‘Oh let’s make a deal.’ I don’t see deals being made\nwith ISIS. Nobody knows what ISIS is, nobody knows who is leading it, who is\nalive, who is not alive, I mean we’re really not talking about too many\ndiplomatic solutions. We’re not talking about diplomatic solutions with ISIS,\nlet me put it that way.**SANGER: **I wasn’t referring to that in the ISIS\ncontext, I was referring more in the realm of dealing with our allies, dealing\nwith China, dealing with Japan, the other places that we’ve discussed.**TRUMP:\n**So ISIS I think you’d agree with me on that and the rest will come. I have\nreally strong feelings on China. I like China very much I like Chinese people.\nI respect the Chinese leaders, but you know China’s been taking advantage of\nus for many, many years and we can’t allow it to go on. And at the same time\nwe’ll be able to keep a good relationship with China. And same with Japan and\nsame with — you have to see the trade imbalance between Japan and the United\nStates, it’s unbelievable. They sell to us and we practically give them back\nnothing by comparison. It’s a very unfair situation.**SANGER: **They also pay\nmore for troop support than any other country in the world.**TRUMP: **They do\nbut still far less than it costs us.**HABERMAN:** Would you be willing\n—**TRUMP: **You’re right about that David, but it’s — and they do pay somewhat\nmore, but they pay more because of the tremendous amount of business that they\ndo with us, uneconomic business from our standpoint.**HABERMAN:** Would you be\nwilling to withdraw U.S. forces from places like Japan and South Korea if they\ndon’t increase their contribution significantly?**TRUMP: ** Yes, I would. I\nwould not do so happily, but I would be willing to do it. Not happily. David\nactually asked me that question before, this morning before we sort of\nfinalized out. The answer is not happily but the answer is yes. We cannot\nafford to be losing vast amounts of billions of dollars on all of this. We\njust can’t do it anymore. Now there was a time when we could have done it.\nWhen we started doing it. But we can’t do it anymore. And I have a feeling\nthat they’d up the ante very much. I think they would, and if they wouldn’t I\nwould really have to say yes.**SANGER: **So we talked a little this morning\nabout Japan and South Korea, whether or not they would move to an independent\nnuclear capability. Just last week the United States removed from Japan, after\na long negotiation, many bombs worth, probably 40 or more bombs worth of\nplutonium or highly enriched uranium that we provided them over the years. And\nthat’s part of a very bipartisan effort to keep them from going nuclear. So I\nwas a little surprised this morning when you said you would be open to them\nhaving their own nuclear deterrent. Certainly if you pull back one of the\nrisks is that they would go nuclear.**TRUMP: **You know you’re more right\nexcept for the fact that you have North Korea which is acting extremely\naggressively, very close to Japan. And had you not had that, I would have felt\nmuch, I would have felt differently. You have North Korea, and we are very far\naway and we are protecting a lot of different people and I don’t know that we\nare necessarily equipped to protect them. And if we didn’t have the North\nKorea threat, I think I’d feel a lot differently, David.**SANGER: **But with\nthe North Korea threat you think maybe Japan does need its own\nnuclear…**TRUMP: **Well I think maybe it’s not so bad to have Japan — if Japan\nhad that nuclear threat, I’m not sure that would be a bad thing for\nus.**SANGER: **You mean if Japan had a nuclear weapon it wouldn’t be so bad\nfor us?**TRUMP: **Well, because of North Korea. Because of North Korea.\nBecause we don’t know what he’s going to do. We don’t know if he’s all bluster\nor is he a serious maniac that would be willing to use it. I was talking about\nbefore, the deterrent in some people’s minds was that the consequence is so\ngreat that nobody would ever use it. Well that may have been true at one point\nbut you have many people that would use it right now in this world.**SANGER:\n**For that reason, they may well need their own and not be able to just depend\non us…**TRUMP: **I really believe that’s true. Especially because of the\nthreat of North Korea. And they are very aggressive toward Japan. Well I mean\nlook, he’s aggressive toward everybody. Except for China and Iran.See we\nshould use our economic power to have them disarm — now then it becomes\ndifferent, then it becomes purely economic, but then it becomes different.\nChina has great power over North Korea even though they don’t necessarily say\nthat. Now, Iran, we had a great opportunity during this negotiation when we\ngave them the 150 billion and many other things. Iran is the No. 1 trading\npartner of North Korea. Now we could have put something in our agreement that\nthey would have led the charge if we had people with substance and with\nbrainpower and with some negotiating ability. But the No. 1 trading partner\nwith North Korea is Iran. And we did a deal with them, and we just did a deal\nwith them, and we don’t even mention North Korea in the deal. That was a great\nopportunity to put another five pages in the deal, or less, and they do have a\ngreat influence over North Korea. Same thing with China, China has great\ninfluence over North Korea but they don’t say they do because they’re tweaking\nus. I have this from Chinese. I have many Chinese friends, I have people of\nvast wealth, some of the most important people in China have purchased\napartments from me for tens of millions of dollars and frankly I know them\nvery well. And I ask them about their relationship to North Korea, these are\ntop people. And they say we have tremendous power over North Korea. I know\nthey do. I think you know they do.**SANGER: **They signed on to the most\nrecent sanctions, more aggressive sanctions than we thought the Chinese would\nagree to.**TRUMP: **Well that’s good, but, I mean I know they did, but I think\nthat they have power beyond the sanctions.**SANGER: **So you would advocate\nthat they have to turn off the oil to North Korea basically.**TRUMP: **So much\nof their lifeblood comes through China, that’s the way it comes through. They\nhave tremendous power over North Korea, but China doesn’t say that. China says\nwell we’ll try. I can see them saying, “We’ll try, we’ll try.” And I can see\nthem laughing in the room next door when they’re together. So China should be\ntalking to North Korea. But China’s tweaking us. China’s toying with us. They\nare when they’re building in the South China Sea. They should not be doing\nthat but they have no respect for our country and they have no respect for our\npresident. So, and the other one, and this is an opportunity passed because\nwhy would Iran go back and renegotiate it having to do with North Korea?But\nIran is the No. 1 trading partner, but we should have had something in that\ndocument that was signed having to do with North Korea as the No. 1 trading\npartner and as somebody with a certain power because of that. A very\nsubstantial power over North Korea.**SANGER: **Mr. Trump with all due respect,\nI think it’s China that’s the No. 1 trading partner with North Korea.**TRUMP:\n**I’ve heard that certainly, but I’ve also heard from other sources that it’s\nIran.**SANGER: **Iran is a major arms exchanger with...**TRUMP: **Well that is\ntrue but I’ve heard it both ways. They are certainly major arms exchangers,\nwhich in itself is terrible that we would make a deal with somebody that’s a\nmajor arms exchanger with North Korea. But had that deal not been done and\nthey were desperate to do it, and they wanted to do it much more so than we\nknow in my opinion, meaning Iran wanted to make the deal much more than we\nknow. We should have backed off that deal, doubled the sanctions and made a\nreal deal. And part of that deal should have been that Iran would help us with\nNorth Korea. So, the bottom line is, I think that frankly, as long as North\nKorea’s there, I think that Japan having a capability is something that maybe\nis going to happen whether we like it or not.**SANGER: **O.K.. We wanted to\nask you a little bit, and Maggie maybe you may have something on this as well,\nabout what standards you would use for using American troops abroad. You’ve\nsaid you wouldn’t want to send them in against ISIS, that that should be the\nneighbors. But you did say this morning that if we have a treaty obligation\nunder NATO to protect the Baltics, you would do that. When you think of your\nstandards under which you would put American lives…**TRUMP: ** Well I think, I\ndo think I’d want to renegotiate some of those treaties. I think those\ntreaties are very unfair, and they’re very one-sided and I do think that some\nof those treaties, just like the Iran deal. But I think that some of those\ntreaties would — will be — renegotiated.**SANGER: **Such as the U.S.-Japan\ndefense treaty?**TRUMP: ** Well, like Japan as an example. I mean that’s not a\nfair deal.**SANGER: **Do you have general standards in mind? And, we’re trying\nto understand your hierarchy of threats.**TRUMP: ** Are you talking about\nfor…**SANGER: **For when you would commit American troops abroad?**TRUMP: **\nO.K. You absol — I know you’ll criticize me for this, but you cannot just have\na standard. You cannot just say that we have a blanket standard all over the\nworld because each instance is totally different, David. I mean, each instance\nis so different that you can’t have a blanket standard. You may say… it sounds\nnice to say, “I have a blanket standard; here’s what it is.” Number one is the\nprotection of our country, O.K.? That’s always going to be number one, by far.\nThat’s by a factor of a hundred. But you know, then there will be standards\nfor other places but it won’t be a blanket standard.**SANGER: **Humanitarian\nintervention: Are you in favor of that or not?**TRUMP: ** Humanitarian? Yes, I\nwould be. You know, to help I would be, depending on where and who and what.\nAnd, you know, again — generally speaking — I’d have to see the country; I’d\nhave to see what’s going on in the region and you just cannot have a blanket.\nThe one blanket you could say is, “protection of our country.” That’s the one\nblanket. After that it depends on the country, the region, how friendly\nthey’ve been toward us. You have countries that haven’t been friendly to us\nthat we’re protecting. So it’s how good they’ve been toward us, et cetera, et\ncetera. So you can’t say a blanket. You could say standards for different\nareas, different regions, and different countries.**HABERMAN:** You had said\nearlier, I think, when you called David that you had wanted to elaborate on\nyour answer about Israel and a two-state solution. I just wanted to...**TRUMP:\n** Well, not elaborate. I just put it off because I was running out of time\nand I didn’t want to get into it too much because it’s actually not that. So\nshould we talk about Israel for a little while?**SANGER: **Sure.**TRUMP: ** I\nhave gotten some of the reviews of my speech at Aipac and, really, they’ve\nbeen very nice. They were very nice. Were you there? Were either of you at\nthat speech?**HABERMAN:** I was.**SANGER: **I saw it on TV.**TRUMP: ** You saw\nthe response Maggie, then, from the crowd?**HABERMAN:** I did. I did.**TRUMP:\n** Many, many standing ovations and they agreed with what I said. Basically I\nsupport a two-state solution on Israel. But the Palestinian Authority has to\nrecognize Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. Have to do that. And they\nhave to stop the terror, stop the attacks, stop the teaching of hatred, you\nknow? The children, I sort of talked about it pretty much in the speech, but\nthe children are aspiring to grow up to be terrorists. They are taught to grow\nup to be terrorists. And they have to stop. They have to stop the terror. They\nhave to stop the stabbings and all of the things going on. And they have to\nrecognize that Israel’s right to exist as a Jewish state. And they have to be\nable to do that. And if they can’t, you’re never going to make a deal. One\nstate, two states, it doesn’t matter: you’re never going to be able to make a\ndeal. Because Israel would have to have that. They have to stop the terror.\nThey have to stop the teaching of children to aspire to grow up as terrorists,\nwhich is a real problem. So with that you’d go two states, but in order to go\nthere, before you, you know, prior to getting there, you have to get those\nbasic things done.Now whether or not the Palestinians can live with that? You\nwould think they could. It shouldn’t be hard except that the ingrained hatred\nis tremendous.**HABERMAN:** You had talked, and you’ve talked a lot recently,\nabout wanting to expand laws regarding torture.**TRUMP: ** Yes.**HABERMAN:**\nMuch of that is governed by international law.**TRUMP: **Yes.**HABERMAN:** How\nwould you go about bringing changes to…?**TRUMP: ** O.K., when you see a thing\nlike an attack in Brussels, when you see as an example they have somebody that\nthey’ve wanted very much, and they got him three, four days before Brussels,\nright? Before the bombing. Had they immediately subjected him to very serious\ninterrogation — very, very serious — you might have stopped the bombing. He\nknew about the bombing. Just like the people, just like all of that people in\nthe area where he grew up — where he was housed a couple of houses down the\nroad — they all knew he was there. And they never turned him in. This is what\nI’m saying: there’s something going on and it’s not good. He was the No. 1\nwanted fugitive in the world and he’s living in his neighborhood, and I\nbelieve I saw a picture of him shopping in his neighborhood, right? In a\ngrocery store? You know: shopping! Buying food! I mean, it’s ridiculous they\ndon’t turn him in. Just like in California, the two people, where she probably\nradicalized him but they don’t know, but the two — the married couple — that\nkilled the 14 people: they had bombs all over the floor of their apartment and\nnobody said anything. And many people saw that apartment and many people saw\nbombs. You know, if you walk into an apartment, Maggie or David, you’re going\nto say, “Oh, this is a little strange.”**SANGER: **So would you invest in\nprograms, or help the Europeans invest in programs, for counter-\nradicalization? For finding jobs and so forth for the refugees who come in so\nthat their temptation to go to become radicalized in Europe would be lower? In\nother words do you have a program in mind to stop the radicalization?**TRUMP:\n**The one thing I’d do, David, is build safe zones in Syria. You know this\nwhole concept of us accepting, you know, tens of thousands of people, and you\nsee I was originally right when I said, many more people, you know he was\ntalking about 10,000, you know it’s many more people than 10,000 are coming\nin. And will come in.**SANGER:** And who would protect those safe zones, you\nknow as soon as you build one…?**TRUMP: **O.K., what I would do is this: We\ncould lead it, but I would get the Gulf states and others to put up the money.\nI mean Germany should put up money. Look what’s happened to Germany. Germany’s\nbeing destroyed and I have friends, I just left people from Germany and they\ndon’t even want to go back. Germany’s being destroyed by Merkel’s naiveté or\nworse. But Germany is a whole different place and you’re going to have a\nproblem in Germany. The German people are not going to take it. The German\npeople are not going to take what’s going on there. You have people leaving\nthe country, permanently leaving the country. You have tremendous crime, you\nhave tremendous, you know, you read the same stories that I do. You write\nthem, actually, it’s even better. So you have tremendous problems over there\nbut I do believe in building a safe zone, a number of safe zones, in sections\nof Syria and that when this war, this horrible war, is over people can go back\nand rebuild if they want to and I would have the Gulf states finance it\nbecause they have the money and they should finance it. So far, they’ve put up\nvery little money and they taken nobody in, essentially nobody in. I would be\nvery strong with them because they have tremendous, they have unlimited\namounts of money, and I would ask them to finance it. We can lead it but I\ndon’t want to spend the money on it, because we don’t have any money. Our\ncountry doesn’t have money.**SANGER: **I wanted to take you back to something\nyou said on China earlier because your arguments about China so far have\nreally been, over the years, very much about how to deal with a strong and\nrising China. But what we’ve seen in the past six months to a year has been a\nChina that is economically weakening. I’m sure you see it in your own\nbusinesses there. So do you have a sense...**TRUMP: **Well, they’re down to\nG.D.P. of 7 percent.**SANGER: **If you believe their numbers.**TRUMP: **Yeah,\nif we ever hit 7 percent we’d have the most successful country. We’d be in a\nboom, the likes of which we’ve rarely seen before, right?**SANGER: **What I’m\ngetting at is a weakening China may have different effects on the world and on\nthe United States than a strengthening China. Do you fear a weaker China or a\nweakening China more than a strong China?**TRUMP: **No. I want a strong United\nStates and I hope China does well, but before I worry about China I have to\nworry about the United States and we’re not doing well.**SANGER: **You’ve\ngiven us a lot of your impressions of Vladimir Putin. We haven’t heard you\nvery much on Xi Jinping.**TRUMP: **Well I haven’t said anything. By the way,\nI’ve been really misquoted. Vladimir Putin said, “Donald Trump is brilliant\nand Donald Trump is a real leader. And Donald Trump will be the real leader.”\nO.K.? I didn’t say anything about him other than to say… I said, we were on\n“60 Minutes” the same night, remember? That was six months ago. But I never\nsaid good, bad, or indifferent. I said he is a strong leader, he is a strong\nleader. But I didn’t say that, and I’m not saying that positively or\nnegatively, I’m just saying he’s a strong leader. That’s pretty obvious that\nhe’s a strong leader.**SANGER: **What’s your impression of Xi Jinping?**TRUMP:\n**I think they are in a very interesting position. The economy is going to be,\nI think actually very strong but the economy, I think they’re doing better\nthan people understand. Nobody has manipulated economic conditions better than\nthey have. And I think they’re doing just fine and I think they will continue\nto do just fine. But a lot of it’s being taken out of the hide of our country\nand we can’t allow that to happen. You know if you look at the number of jobs\nthat we’ve lost, it’s millions of jobs. It’s not a little bit, it’s millions.\nAnd if you look at our phony numbers of 5 percent unemployment, even opponents\nwould say that, and would agree to that fact that the jobs that we have are\nbad jobs. They’re not good jobs, they’re bad jobs. We’re losing, you know,\nwhen you see a Carrier move into Mexico, those are good jobs. We’re losing the\ngood jobs. We now have a lot of bad jobs, we have a lot of part-time jobs.\nIt’s not the same country. We’re losing our companies. I mean when we lose\nPfizer to Ireland, when we lose Ford and Carrier and many others to, Nabisco\nas an example from Chicago to Mexico, when we lose all of these companies\ngoing to Mexico and to many other places, we’re going to end up having no\ncomp**— **we’re going to have nothing left. And it has to be stopped, and it\nhas to be stopped fast and I know how to stop it. Nobody else, the politicians\ndon’t know how to stop it. And besides that the politicians are all taken care\nof by the special interests and the lobbyists. Lobbyists for hire. And\nsomebody will get to them and they will pay them a lot of money and the\npoliticians will not do what they have to do, which is keep companies in this\ncountry. Those companies that want to leave will get to the lobbyists and the\nspecial interests and those politicians will do what they want them to do,\nwhich is not in the interest of our country. O.K.**HABERMAN:** Mr. Trump, I\nhave heard you say for years now, including at your CPAC speech back in 2011,\n“Take the oil.” That America should have taken the oil from Iraq.**TRUMP:\n**I’ve said it for years.**HABERMAN:** Why should the American…?**TRUMP:\n**Originally I didn’t say it. Originally I said, “Don’t go into\nIraq.”**HABERMAN:** Right.**TRUMP: **Now, we went in, we destroyed a military\nbase that was equal to, if not greater than, Iran. And we’ve destroyed that\nmilitary, and they were holding each other off for many, you know for decades,\ndecades, and we destroyed one of those military powers. And I said don’t go in\nbecause if you dest — now, I didn’t know that they didn’t have weapons of mass\ndestruction. But on top of everything else they had no weapons of mass\ndestruction.**HABERMAN:** Well, but sir, why should the American approach to\nrebuilding Iraq, or other countries where we have shed blood, why should that\ndiffer from how we rebuilt postwar Japan and Germany in the Marshall\nPlan?**TRUMP: **Well it was much different. We rebuild Iraq and it gets blown\nup. We build a school? Gets blown up. Build it again? Gets blown up. You know,\nit’s a mess. I mean you have government that’s totally corrupt. The country is\ntotally, totally corrupt and corruptible. The leader, I mean one of the big\ndecisions that was made putting the people in charge of Iraq that were in\ncharge of Iraq, and they were exclusionary. They excluded people that\nultimately, you know large groups of people, that ultimately became ISIS.\nBecame stronger than them. And the sad thing is, I always talk about the bad\ndeal that we made with Iran as being one of the worst deals, actually the\nworst deal is what we’ve done again involving Iran, we’ve destroyed the\nmilitary capability of Iraq and destroyed Iraq, period, and Iran is now going\nto take over Iraq, they’ve essentially already done that in my opinion, but\nthey’re going to officially take over Iraq in the very near future.And I mean\nIraqis were already reporting to Iran, but Iran is going to take over Iraq,\nthey’ve wanted to do it for decades. They’re going to take over Iraq, they’re\ngoing to take the oil reserves which are the second biggest in the world,\nextremely high quality oil under the ground, extremely high quality, they’re\ngoing to take all of that over because of us. Because we destroyed —**SANGER:\n**But Mr. Trump you’ve argued many times that you don’t want to have ground\ntroops, but”We take the oil” implies you’re going to have to go in there and\ntake it by force, defend it —**TRUMP: **Well what I said is, I said when we\nleft that we should have taken the oil.**SANGER: **If you want to take the oil\ntoday you’re going to have to go into a country that is now an ally, Iraq,\neven if it’s a dysfunctional one, put your troops on the ground.**TRUMP:\n**Yeah, yeah, O.K.. Ready? I said take the oil. I’ve been saying that for\nyears. And many very smart scholars and military scholars said that’d be a\ngreat thing to do, but people didn’t do it. So, but I have been saying that\nfor years, I’m glad you know that. At least four or five years. When we left I\nsaid take the oil. We shouldn’t have been there, we shouldn’t have destroyed\nthe country, and Saddam Hussein was a bad guy but he was good at one thing:\nKilling terrorists. He killed terrorists like nobody, all right? Now it’s\nHarvard of terrorism. You want to be a terrorist you go to Iraq. But he killed\nterrorists. O.K., so we destroyed that. By the way, bad guy, just so you know,\nofficially, I want to say that, bad guy, but it was a lot better of situation\nthan we have right now. And he did not knock down the World Trade Center,\nO.K.? So officially speaking, he did not, Iraq did not knock down the World\nTrade center. We went in there after the World Trade Center, well he didn’t\nknock down the World Trade Center, so you could say why are we doing this, all\nright, that was another thing. I never felt that he did it, and it turned out\nthat he didn’t. And it’ll be very interesting when those documents are opened\nup and released in the future, I think maybe they should be opened up and\nreleased sooner rather than later.**HABERMAN:** You mean the House, the House\nand Senate report?**TRUMP: **Yes, yes, exactly. It’d be very interesting to\nsee because they must know. They must know, if they’re anything, they must\nknow what happened in terms of who were the people. But it wasn’t Iraq, O.K.?\nYou’re not going to find that it was Iraq. So it was very faulty, but I was, I\nwas talking about, I was talking about taking the oil, now we have a different\nsituation because now we have to go in again and start fighting, you know, at\nthat time we had it and we should’ve kept it. Now I would say knock the hell\nout of the oil and do it because it’s a primary source of money for\nISIS.**SANGER: **So in other words you don’t want to take the oil right now,\nyou want to just destroy the oil fields.**TRUMP: **Well now, we have to\ndestroy the oil. We should’ve taken it and we would’ve have it. Now we have to\ndestroy the oil. We don’t do it, I just can’t believe we don’t do it.**SANGER:\n**So you know Mr. Trump, from listening and enjoying these two conversations\nwe’ve had today which have been extremely interesting, I’ve been trying to\nsort of fit where your worldview and your philosophy here, your doctrine fits\nin with sort of the previous Republican mainlines of inquiry. And so if you\nthink back to George H. W. Bush, the most recent President Bush’s father, he\nwas an internationalist who was in the realist school, he wanted to sort of\nchange the foreign policy of other nations but you didn’t see him messing\ninside those countries and then you had a group of people around —**TRUMP:\n**Well he did the right thing, David, he did the right thing. He went in, he\nknocked the hell out of Iraq and then he let it go, O.K.? He didn’t go in. Now\nI don’t know was that Schwarzkopf, was that, was that —**SANGER: **It was\nGeorge W. Bush himself.**TRUMP: **Or maybe it was him, but he didn’t go in, he\ndidn’t get into the quicksand, right? He didn’t get into the quicksand and I\nmean, history will show that he was right. And with that Saddam Hussein\noverplayed his card more than any human being I think I’ve ever seen. Instead\nof saying “Wow, I got lucky” that they didn’t come in and take this all away\nfrom me. He should’ve just relaxed a little bit, O.K.? And instead he taunted\nBush Sr. He taunted him. And Bush Jr. loves his father and didn’t like what\nwas happening, but I remember very vividly how Saddam Hussein was taunting,\nabsolutely taunting, saying we have beaten the Americans, you know, meaning\nthey didn’t come in so he would tell everybody he beat them. Do you remember\nthat, right?**SANGER: **I do indeed.**TRUMP: **And he was taunting to them, he\nwas saying, and even I used to say “Wow” because I knew that we could’ve gone\nfurther. We went in for a short period of time and just knocked the hell out\nof them and then went back, sort of gave them a lesson, but we didn’t destroy\nthe country, we didn’t destroy the grid, we didn’t, you know, there was\nsomething left. There was a lot left. And instead of just sort of saying he\ngot lucky and to himself, just going about, he was taunting the Bushes. And\nJunior said, “Well I’m not going to take it” and he went in. And you know,\nlook that was —**SANGER: **There was something else to George W. Bush, Bush\n43’s philosophy. If we believed that his father was an internationalist, I\nthink it’s fair to say, at least a lot of the people around George W. Bush\nwere transformational, they actually wanted to change the nature of regime.\nYou heard this in George W. Bush’s second inaugural address.**TRUMP:\n**Yeah.**SANGER: **What you are describing to us, I think is something of a\nthird category, but tell me if I have this right, which is much more of a, if\nnot isolationist, then at least something of “America First” kind of approach,\na mistrust of many foreigners, both our adversaries and some of our allies, a\nsense that they’ve been freeloading off of us for many years.**TRUMP:\n**Correct. O.K.? That’s fine.**SANGER: **O.K.? Am I describing this correctly\nhere?**TRUMP: **I’ll tell you — you’re getting close. Not isolationist, I’m\nnot isolationist, but I am “America First.” So I like the expression. I’m\n“America First.” We have been disrespected, mocked, and ripped off for many\nmany years by people that were smarter, shrewder, tougher. We were the big\nbully, but we were not smartly led. And we were the big bully who was — the\nbig stupid bully and we were systematically ripped off by everybody. From\nChina to Japan to South Korea to the Middle East, many states in the Middle\nEast, for instance, protecting Saudi Arabia and not being properly reimbursed\nfor every penny that we spend, when they’re sitting with trillions of dollars,\nI mean they were making a billion dollars a day before the oil went down, now\nthey’re still making a fortune, you know, their oil is very high and very easy\nto get it, very inexpensive, but they’re still making a lot of money, but they\nwere making a billion dollars a day and we were paying leases for bases? We’re\npaying leases, we’re paying rent? O.K.? To have bases over there? The whole\nthing is preposterous. So we had, so America first, yes, we will not be ripped\noff anymore. We’re going to be friendly with everybody, but we’re not going to\nbe taken advantage of by anybody. We won’t be isolationists — I don’t want to\ngo there because I don’t believe in that. I think we’ll be very worldview, but\nwe’re not going to be ripped off anymore by all of these countries. I mean\nthink of it.We have $21 trillion, essentially, very shortly, we’ll be up to\n$21 trillion in debt. O.K.? A lot of that is just all of these horrible,\nhorrible decisions. You know, I’ll give you another one, I talked about NATO\nand we fund disproportionately, the United Nations, we get nothing out of the\nUnited Nations other than good real estate prices. We get nothing out of the\nUnited Nations. They don’t respect us, they don’t do what we want, and yet we\nfund them disproportionately again. Why are we always the ones that funds\neverybody disproportionately, you know? So everything is like that. There’s\nnothing that’s not like that. That’s why if I win and if I go in, it’s always\nnever sounds — I have a woman who came up to me, I tell this story, she said\n“Mr. Trump, I think you’re great, I think you’re going to be a great\npresident, but I don’t like what you say I got to make America rich again.”\nBut you can’t make America great again unless you make it rich again, in other\nwords, we’re a poor nation, we’re a debtor nation, we don’t have the money to\ndo, we don’t have the money to fix our military and the reason we don’t is\nbecause of the fact that because of all of the things we’ve been talking about\nfor the last 25 min and other things.**HABERMAN:** Mr. Trump, you — I was\nlooking back at your speech in New Hampshire back in 1987 when you were\nreleasing “The Art of the Deal” and a lot of your concerns are very similar to\nthe ones you’re voicing now.**TRUMP: **Right, even similar\ncountries.**HABERMAN:** Right, and I’m just wondering what is the era when you\nthink the United States last had the right balance, either in terms of defense\nfootprint or in terms of trade?**TRUMP: **Well sometime long before that.\nBecause one of the presidents that I really liked was Ronald Reagan but I\nnever felt on trade we did great. O.K.? So it was actually, it would be long\nbefore that.**SANGER: **So was it Eisenhower, was it Truman, was it\nF.D.R.?**TRUMP: **No if you really look at it, it was the turn of the century,\nthat’s when we were a great, when we were really starting to go robust. But if\nyou look back, it really was, there was a period of time when we were\ndeveloping at the turn of the century which was a pretty wild time for this\ncountry and pretty wild in terms of building that machine, that machine was\nreally based on entrepreneurship etc, etc. And then I would say, yeah, prior\nto, I would say during the 1940s and the late ‘40s and ‘50s we started\ngetting, we were not pushed around, we were respected by everybody, we had\njust won a war, we were pretty much doing what we had to do, yeah around that\nperiod.**SANGER: **So basically Truman, Eisenhower, the beginning of the 1947\nnational security reviews, that’s the period?**TRUMP: **Yes, yes. Because as\nmuch as I liked Ronald Reagan, he started Nafta, now Clinton really was the\none that — Nafta has been a disaster for our country, O.K., and Clinton is the\none as you know that got it done, but it was conceived even before Clinton,\nbut you could say that maybe those people didn’t want done what was ultimately\nsigned because it was changed a lot by the time it got finalized. But Nafta\nhas been a disaster for our country.**SANGER:** But you think of that period\ntime that you most admire: late ‘40s, early ‘50s, it was also the most\nterrifying time with the build up of the Cold War, it’s when the Russians got\nnuclear weapons, we got into an arms race, we were —**TRUMP: **But David, a\nlot of that was just pure technology. The technology was really coming in at\nthat time. And so a lot of that was just timing of technology.**SANGER:** It\nwas also a period of time when we were threatening to use nuclear weapons\nagainst the North Koreans and the Chinese in the war. Was that approach you\nsaw of Douglas MacArthur’s approach at that time, so forth, is that what\nyou’re admiring?**TRUMP: **Well I was a fan as you probably know, I was a fan\nof Douglas MacArthur. I was a fan of George Patton. If we had Douglas\nMacArthur today or if we had George Patton today and if we had a president\nthat would let them do their thing you wouldn’t have ISIS, O.K.? You wouldn’t\nbe talking about ISIS right now, we’d be talking about something else, but you\nwouldn’t be talking about ISIS right now. So I was a fan of Douglas MacArthur,\nI was a fan of — as generals — I was a fan of George Patton. We don’t have, we\ndon’t have seemingly those people today, now I know they exist, I know we have\nsome very, I know the Air Force Academy and West Point and Annapolis, I know\nthat great people come out of those schools. A lot of times the people that\nget to the top aren’t necessarily those people anymore because they’re\npolitically correct. George Patton was not a politically correct\nperson.**SANGER:** Yeah I think we can all agree on that.**TRUMP: **He was a\ngreat general and his soldiers would do anything for him.**SANGER:** But the\nother day, I’m sorry, this morning, you suggested to us you would only use\nnuclear weapons as a last resort.**TRUMP: **Totally last resort.**SANGER:**\nAnd what did Douglas MacArthur advocate?**TRUMP: **I would hate, I would hate\n—**SANGER:** General MacArthur wanted to go use them against the Chinese and\nthe North Koreans, not as a last resort.**TRUMP: **That’s right. He did. Yes,\nwell you don’t know if he wanted to use them but he certainly said that at\nleast.**SANGER:** He certainly asked Harry Truman if he could.**TRUMP: **Yeah,\nwell, O.K.. He certainly talked it and was he doing that to negotiate, was he\ndoing that to win? Perhaps. Perhaps. Was he doing that for what reason? I\nmean, I think he played, he did play the nuclear card but he didn’t use it, he\nplayed the nuclear card. He talked the nuclear card, did he do that to win?\nMaybe, maybe, you know, maybe that’s what got him victory. But in the meantime\nhe didn’t use them. So, you know. So, we need a different mind set. So you\ntalked about torture before, well what did it say — well I guess you had\nenough and I hope you’re going to treat me fairly and if you’re not it’ll be\nforgotten in three or four days and that’ll be the story. It is a crazy world\nout there, I’ve never seen anything like it, the volume of press that I’m\ngetting is just crazy. It’s just absolutely crazy, but hopefully you’ll treat\nme fairly, I do know my subject and I do know that our country cannot continue\nto do what it’s doing. See, I know many people from China, I know many people\nfrom other countries, I deal at a very high level with people from various\ncountries because I’ve become very international. I’m all over the world with\ndeals and people and they can’t believe what their countries get away with. I\ncan tell you people from China cannot believe what their country’s, what their\ncountry’s getting away with. At let’s say free trade, where, you know, it’s\nfree there but it’s not free here. In other words, we try sell — it’s very\nhard for us to do business in China, it’s very easy for China to do business\nwith us. Plus with us there’s a tremendous tax that we pay when we go into\nChina, where’s when China sells to us there’s no tax. I mean, it’s a whole\ndouble standard, it’s so crazy, and they cannot believe they get away with it,\nDavid. They cannot believe they get away with it. They are shocked, and I’m\ntalking about people at the highest level, people at — the richest people,\npeople with great influence over, you know, together with the leaders and they\ncannot believe it. Mexico can’t believe what they get away with. When I talked\nabout Mexico and I talked about they will build a wall, when you look at the\ntrade deficit we have with Mexico it’s very easy, it’s a tiny fraction of what\nthe cost of the wall is. The wall is a tiny fraction of what the cost of the\ndeficit is. When people hear that they say “Oh now I get it.” They don’t get\nit. But Mexico will pay for the wall. But they can’t believe what they get\naway with. There’s such a double standard. With many countries. It’s almost,\nwe do well with almost nobody anymore and a lot of that is because of politics\nas we know it, political hacks get appointed to negotiate with the smartest\npeople in China, when we negotiate deals with China, China is putting the\nsmartest people in all of China on that negotiation, we’re not doing that. So\nanyway, I hope you guys are happy.**SANGER:** Thank you, you’ve been very\ngenerous with your time.\n\n","title":"Transcript: Donald Trump Expounds on His Foreign Policy Views - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Donald Trump on his foreign policy views https://t.co/ZsveUibyw7 https://t.co/BFaZtNakAz","date":"Mon Mar 28 07:36:46 +0000 2016","favs":284,"id":{"$numberLong":"714355537404698626"},"retweets":156},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1q9OqUq"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01512"},"content":"Several years ago, when I was working as a reporter based in Haiti, I came\nupon a group of older Christian missionaries in the mountains above Port-au-\nPrince, struggling with heavy shovels to stir a pile of cement and sand. They\nwere there to build a school alongside a Methodist church. Muscular Haitian\nmasons stood by watching, perplexed and a bit amused at the sight of men and\nwomen who had come all the way from the United States to do a mundane\nconstruction job.Such people were a familiar sight: They were voluntourists.\nThey would come for a week or two for a “project” — a temporary medical\nclinic, an orphanage visit or a school construction. A 2008 study surveyed 300\norganizations that market to would-be voluntourists and estimated that 1.6\nmillion people volunteer on vacation, spending around $2 billion annually. A\nfew are celebrities supporting their cause du jour, who drop in to meet locals\nand witness a project that often bears their name. Many more come to teach\nEnglish during high school, college vacations or during a gap year. Others are\nsun-seeking vacationers who stay at beachside resorts but who also want to see\n“the real (name your country).” So they go into a community for an afternoon\nto help local women make beads, jewelry or clothes.Volunteering seems like an\nadmirable way to spend a vacation. Many of us donate money to foreign\ncharities with the hope of making the world a better place. Why not use our\nskills as well as our wallets? And yet, watching those missionaries make\nconcrete blocks that day in Port-au-Prince, I couldn’t help wondering if their\ngood intentions were misplaced. These people knew nothing about how to\nconstruct a building. Collectively they had spent thousands of dollars to fly\nhere to do a job that Haitian bricklayers could have done far more quickly.\nImagine how many classrooms might have been built if they had donated that\nmoney rather than spending it to fly down themselves. Perhaps those Haitian\nmasons could have found weeks of employment with a decent wage. Instead, at\nleast for several days, they were out of a job.Besides, constructing a school\nis relatively easy. Improving education, especially in a place like Haiti, is\nnot. Did the missionaries have a long-term plan to train and recruit qualified\nteachers to staff the school? Did they have a budget to pay those teachers\nindefinitely? Other school-builders I met in Haiti admitted they weren’t\ninvolved in any long-term planning, and I once visited a school built by an\nNGO that had no money left to pay the teachers. If these brick-laying\nvoluntourists overlooked such things in their eagerness to get their hands\ndirty, they wouldn’t be the first.Easing global poverty is an enormously\ncomplex task. To make so much as a dent requires hard, sustained work, and\nexpertise. Even the experts sometimes get it wrong. Critics of the Red Cross’s\npost-earthquake work in Haiti argue that the half a billion dollars the\norganization raised for disaster relief was largely misspent. Multimillion-\ndollar projects undertaken by the U.S. government ultimately failed to help\nHaiti export its mangos or complete a new building for Haiti’s Parliament on\ntime. If smart, dedicated professionals can fail to achieve lasting progress\nover a period of _years, _how then is an untrained vacationer supposed to do\nso in a matter of days?Sometimes, volunteering even causes real harm. Research\nin South Africa and elsewhere has found that “orphan tourism” — in which\nvisitors volunteer as caregivers for children whose parents died or otherwise\ncan’t support them — has become so popular that some orphanages operate more\nlike opportunistic businesses than charities, intentionally subjecting\nchildren to poor conditions in order to entice unsuspecting volunteers to\ndonate more money. Many “orphans,” it turns out, have living parents who, with\na little support, could probably do a better job of raising their children\nthan some volunteer can. And the constant arrivals and departures of\nvolunteers have been linked to attachment disorders in children.There are some\nvolunteers who possess specialized, sought-after skills, of course. In Port-\nau-Prince I lived across from a Catholic guesthouse where groups of mostly\nAmerican volunteers would spend their first nights in Haiti. Often I’d join\nthem for dinner to hear about their experiences. I remember meeting an\nophthalmologist from Milwaukee, who had just spent a week in a remote town in\nHaiti performing laser eye surgery. He recounted the joy he felt at helping\npeople who were going blind from cataracts to see.But not all volunteers come\nwith an expertise like ophthalmology. When I asked one of the women who ran\nthat guesthouse why she moved to Haiti, she told me that “a long time ago I\nfelt called to be here, and I came based on that, not knowing what I was going\nto do.” In many ways, this woman is typical of the sort of voluntourists I’ve\nencountered. Many are religious — the sort of people who cite passages from\nthe Bible, the Torah or the Quran that encourage followers to help those in\nneed. Surely, they say, “love thy neighbor” takes on a different meaning in a\nglobalized world. To many of these people, simply experiencing a foreign\nculture is not enough. They must _change_ that place for the better.Perhaps we\nare fooling ourselves. Unsatisfying as it may be, we ought to acknowledge the\ntruth that we, as amateurs, often don’t have much to offer. Perhaps we ought\nto abandon the assumption that we, simply by being privileged enough to travel\nthe world, are somehow qualified to help ease the world’s ills. Because the\nmantra of “good intentions” becomes unworthy when its eventuality can give a\nSouth African AIDS orphan an attachment disorder or put a Haitian mason out of\nwork.I’ve come to believe that the first step toward making the world a better\nplace is to simply experience that place. Unless you’re willing to devote your\ncareer to studying international affairs and public policy, researching the\nmistakes that foreign charities have made while acting upon good intentions,\nand identifying approaches to development that have data and hard evidence\nbehind them — perhaps volunteering abroad is not for you.\n\n","title":"The Voluntourist’s Dilemma - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Are vacationers who spend spring break volunteering in developing countries really helping anyone? https://t.co/9PKPj3mjRd","date":"Mon Mar 28 07:11:30 +0000 2016","favs":242,"id":{"$numberLong":"714349177694732288"},"retweets":164},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SfbJmn"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01513"},"content":"A few months ago, I wrote an article here on The Upshot discussing the\npotential health effects of alcohol. I pointed out that the scientific\nresearch said moderate drinking isn’t bad for you; indeed, it might even offer\nsome benefits.At the same time, I cautioned that this doesn’t mean I’d treat\nalcohol like medicine, or advise people to start drinking. The take-home\nmessage was that if you’re otherwise healthy, and enjoy no more than two\ndrinks a day, you’re unlikely to suffer from it, and potentially might\nbenefit.However, a new study has been published that is leading some people to\nwrite stories proclaiming that “alcohol may not be good for you after all.” Is\nthat the case?Like any good Bayesian, I use new data and evidence to update my\npriors. In this case, the recent publication isn’t a new trial or experiment.\nIt’s a new systematic review and meta-analysis that argues that it does a\nbetter job than prior work, by excluding a lot of research its authors\ndeclared was flawed.The main problem, they argue, is that a lot of prior work\nlumps people who used to drink but quit and no longer do so with people who\nnever drank. They further assert that many of these people may actually have\nquit because they were sick, and were told to give up alcohol. This would mean\nthat the sickest patients, who had been drinking alcohol, were being counted\nas if they were abstainers, which would bias results in a way to make drinking\nlook healthier than not.They also only looked at studies that examined all\ndeath from all causes considered together. Of the 87 studies they found that\nmet this criterion, only 13 strictly coded lifetime abstainers (and not\nquitters) as the reference group. When they looked at those studies and\ncompared lifetime abstainers with everyday drinkers, there wasn’t a\nstatistically significant difference. Only those who drank at least 65 grams\nof alcohol a day (about 4.5 drinks) had an increased risk of death.The\nresearchers refined their model further, excluding “lesser quality studies,”\nto consider only seven. The results were unchanged. They then excluded one\nmore study that had results heavily favoring alcohol; the remaining six\nstudies suggested that people who drank two to three drinks a day had a\nslightly elevated risk of death. But those who drank one to two, or three to\n4.5 drinks, didn’t.When it comes to observational research, that’s a pretty\nweak finding. But that conclusion is somehow making headlines.If you look\nclosely, it’s clear the authors excluded a lot of studies that seem to have\nalready taken into account their concerns. For instance, one study I cited\nlooked at all-cause mortality for those 55 to 65 years old. It found that,\nafter controlling for the prior drinkers, as well as other confounders, those\nwho drank a moderate amount had a lower risk of death than abstainers as well\nas heavy drinkers. It also cited five different earlier studies (1, 2, 3, 4,\n5) that accounted for the “former drinker” problem, yet still found the\nprotective effect of light-to-moderate drinking against all-cause mortality.\nIt’s unclear to me why these studies didn’t factor in to the new analysis.That\ndoesn’t mean the researchers did anything wrong. You’ve always got to make\njudgment calls about what to include in a meta-analysis. But the researchers\ndon’t clearly explain why they made the judgment calls they did in the text.\nThat makes me concerned they might be cherry-picking.It’s also important to\nrecognize that this is only a study of all-cause mortality. Many other\noutcomes exist. A 2011 meta-analysis, for example, looked at mortality from a\nvariety of cardiovascular causes.This analysis also performed a sub-analysis\nof studies that classified former drinkers correctly. It found that — with or\nwithout this adjustment — active drinkers had both a lower incidence and\nmortality from a variety of cardiovascular disease. In the same vein, other\nstudies have found associations with alcohol and better cognitive function and\nlower rates of diabetes. (The story for cancer is much more mixed.)On top of\nthat, randomized controlled trials suggest that moderate drinking can help\nwith diabetes, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. There’s even a meta-\nanalysis of 63 controlled trials showing alcohol’s positive effects on HDL\n(good) cholesterol. Authors of articles now declaring alcohol to be benefit-\nfree will need to explain why they ignored those trials.At best then, this new\nstudy shows that for those drinking two or fewer drinks of alcohol a day,\nthere’s no association with higher or lower risks of death. At worst, it’s\nleaving out trials that show a benefit.In others words, the study doesn’t make\nme think I should update my priors much at all. The evidence still says that a\nmoderate amount of alcohol appears to be safe, and that it might even be\nhealthy for many people. There’s nothing in this new analysis that would make\nme change my mind.\n\n","title":"In Defense of Moderate Drinking (Again) - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"In defense of moderate drinking (again) https://t.co/xOQ4C9U5Br https://t.co/gboDBRee0z","date":"Mon Mar 28 06:59:03 +0000 2016","favs":190,"id":{"$numberLong":"714346042880352258"},"retweets":86},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1q9OqUg"}

Sasha and\nMrs. Robinson skipped the activities, relaxing at a luxury resort overlooking\nthe lake.It is rare for Mr. Obama to bring his daughters, whose privacy the\nWhite House guards vigilantly, with him on his closely watched trips overseas.\nThis time, with a history-making adventure during school vacation, the\npresident was determined to show them parts of the world they might not\notherwise get to see.“My wife, Michelle, and I brought our daughters — and by\nthe way, they don’t always want to go with us; they’re teenagers now,” Mr.\nObama told reporters in Havana. “They have friends at home and they have\nthings to do, but they wanted to come to Cuba because they understood, and we\nwanted to show them, the beauty of Cuba and its people.”Like many family\nvacations, this one had its ups and downs. What was planned as a leisurely\nfamily stroll through Old Havana became a soaked slog over slippery\ncobblestones on Sunday under an unexpected downpour. Malia and Sasha, grim-\nfaced under large umbrellas, stepped around puddles as crowds of Cubans gawked\nand applauded, yelling, “Obama!”Later, Malia translated Spanish for her father\nat a Cuban restaurant when he chatted with the chef.The daughters appeared\ncheerier in the sun on Tuesday during a baseball game at the Estadio\nLatinamericano, watching the Tampa Bay Rays beat the Cuban national team. But\nwhen Mr. Obama and the rest of his entourage rose to do the wave, Sasha stayed\nseated, her arm over her face as if mortified.** A Presidential Tango **It’s\nnot every day that the leader of the free world engages in a steamy dance\nroutine with a stranger.But on Wednesday at a state dinner in Buenos Aires\nhosted by Mauricio Macri, the Argentine president, Mr. Obama succumbed to one\nof the country’s best-known charms, doing an impromptu tango with a\nprofessional dancer clad in a silver dress.Mora Godoy, a renowned Argentine\ndancer, and a male partner were on hand as entertainment at the elegant\ndinner, which featured a menu of smoked trout, lamb and a dulce de leche\n“volcano.” But after their performance, Ms. Godoy approached Mr. Obama and\nasked him to join her. He initially refused but then, prodded by his Argentine\ncounterpart, relented.What followed was a presidential tango, complete with\ndramatic steps, spins and what appeared to be an aborted dip in which Ms.\nGodoy raised a bent leg high against Mr. Obama’s thigh.Mrs. Obama got in on\nthe fun as well, dancing her own tango with Ms. Godoy’s partner.** Détente’s\nBody Language **They shook hands cheerfully, eyed each other warily, touched\narms awkwardly and locked eyes meaningfully across a crowded theater. Then\nthey donned shades and kicked back together for a baseball game.To watch the\nbody language between Mr. Obama and President Raúl Castro of Cuba this week\nwas to witness the unfolding of a complicated relationship — warm and\nrespectful yet tinged with suspicion, cooperative yet competitive.At an\nextraordinary joint news conference at the Revolutionary Palace, they seemed\nto grapple for control, Mr. Obama gently coaching Mr. Castro on how to handle\nquestions from a free press, and the Cuban president resisting testily.Mr.\nObama leaned indulgently on his lectern at one point when Mr. Castro abruptly\npaused the news conference to confer with an aide over whether to answer an\nAmerican reporter’s question about Cuba’s political prisoners. After several\nmoments, Mr. Obama, with a wry and somewhat impatient look on his face,\nglanced toward Mr. Castro and said, “Excuse me.”All the while, Mr. Castro’s\ngrandson and head bodyguard stood off to one side of the stage, looking ready\nto pounce. The Cuban leader showed flashes of temper, at times yanking at his\ntranslation headset, at others raising his voice.The episode ended with a\nsupremely goofy salute, Mr. Castro clasping Mr. Obama’s limp wrist as they\nappeared to vacillate between handshake and revolutionary fist pump.The next\nday, Mr. Castro smiled broadly and waved from the balcony of the ornate Grand\nTheater of Havana before Mr. Obama’s speech. As the audience cheered him, Mr.\nCastro kept pointing to the stage where Mr. Obama would stand.But Mr. Castro\nsat stonily as Mr. Obama directly admonished him during the speech to open\nCuba’s economy and political system. Afterward, Mr. Obama gazed across the\ntheater and silently mouthed “Thank you” to his host as the Cuban classic\n“Guantanamera” blared.By the start of the baseball game between the Rays and\nthe Cuban team, the two presidents had traded ties for shades. Surrounded by\ntheir families, they sat side by side, an interpreter just behind them, and\nchatted like old friends.** An Invasion of a Different Sort **It was not the\ninvasion that the Cubans have long feared. But when Mr. Obama arrived in\nHavana with hundreds of Americans in his entourage, it did seem a bit like the\nUnited States had taken over the island.Members of Congress milled around the\nParque Central, gawking and snapping pictures like tourists. The White House\npress corps took over a floor in a large hotel, treating it as a filing\ncenter, snack bar and general meeting area.At a Havana restaurant with\nsweeping harbor views and cannons out front, Jimmy Buffett sat with the band\nand Derek Jeter mingled with guests invited by Major League Baseball to\ncelebrate the game.Senior White House staff members stood elbow to elbow with\nthe professional ballplayers, and next to 1950s cars, as waiters passed trays\nof mojitos. Secretary of State John Kerry and Penny Pritzker, the commerce\nsecretary, were also there.Late in the evening, after the state dinner,\nseveral lawmakers joined in, bopping to Mr. Buffett’s music in their cocktail\nattire.As a man hand-rolled Cuban cigars nearby, Representative Nancy Pelosi,\nDemocrat of California and the minority leader, belted out all the words to\n“Margaritaville.”\n\n","title":"Obama Family Spring Break: Making History and Doing the Tango - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Like many family vacations, the Obama Family Spring Break had its ups and downs https://t.co/WwIuC5g4E5","date":"Mon Mar 28 06:33:42 +0000 2016","favs":93,"id":{"$numberLong":"714339665160060928"},"retweets":46},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1q9OovV"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01516"},"content":"MEDICINE LODGE, Kan. — The towering fire approached Don Gerstner’s house last\nweek with such fury that there was no time to pack. All he and his wife,\nCarol, could do was scurry to their Toyota pickup and speed past a row of\nflaming trees toward the relative safety of a nearby road.When the couple\nreturned, the sturdy old home where they had raised their children had been\nreduced to a pile of bricks and ashes. Amid the destruction were the ruins of\na marble-top coffee table, walnut cabinetry and decades worth of pictures and\nmementos. Also lost was a beloved English pointer, whose kennel Mr. Gerstner\nhad tried unsuccessfully to reach.“I’m going to rebuild this house, just\nexactly like it was,” Mr. Gerstner, 87, a carpenter, said Saturday as he\nsurveyed the destruction.The Gerstners’ home on the outskirts of Medicine\nLodge is a mere speck in the nearly 400,000 acres of land that have burned\nsince early last week. The blaze, which started on Tuesday across the state\nline in Oklahoma and by late Sunday had not been fully contained, is said to\nbe the largest recorded wildfire in Kansas history and has prompted a vast\nmobilization of firefighters rarely seen in this state.“We get tornadoes,\nblizzards, floods,” said Gov. Sam Brownback, who declared a state of emergency\nlast week and who toured the damage and met with emergency personnel on\nSaturday. “But big wildfires, we don’t get that often.”All through the\ncountryside, once-lush cattle pastures are now endless piles of black char.\nThe aroma of ashes blows with the stiff prairie wind, and residents remain\nunnerved by smoldering hot spots.But even on a holiday weekend, and even in a\nstate unaccustomed to the type of multiday wildfires so common in Colorado and\nCalifornia, fire trucks from across this state have poured into Medicine\nLodge, seeking to make up in numbers and sheer will what many on the front\nlines lack in experience battling a blaze of such magnitude.Many here credit\nthat speedy mobilization for so far preventing the loss of human life and\nprotecting all but a few houses from burning. Medicine Lodge, a town of about\n2,000 residents, was briefly under a voluntary evacuation order, as were some\nother small communities.“It just could have been a lot worse than what it\nwas,” said Mr. Brownback, a Republican, who praised local responders for\n“heroic” work and called it “astounding” that so many acres had burned with so\nfew buildings destroyed.On Saturday, National Guard helicopters started\ndumping water from the air as crews continued to work on the ground and fire\ntrucks continued to roll into town to offer their services.“Just wanted to\nhelp,” Chief Brian James of the Sherman County Rural Fire Department, in\nnorthwest Kansas, said after putting out a flare-up on Saturday morning near a\ngypsum quarry.Only hours before extinguishing that hot spot in a hilly grove\nof cedar trees, Chief James and two others from his department had arrived\nhere in Barber County after driving through the night in a small brush truck,\na trip of more than four hours. Andy Potterf, the truck’s engineer, said he\ntook time off from his job at a grain elevator to come. The three men said\nthey were prepared to stay in Medicine Lodge for several days if their help\nwas needed.Across the county, where hundreds of firefighters from all corners\nof Kansas and elsewhere stood ready, many uttered similar sentiments.“They\nneed help, we show,” said Chris Swindler, a volunteer firefighter from Helena,\nOkla., who drove more than an hour to assist on Friday, when thick columns of\nsmoke were still billowing from the hills.The outside aid was clearly\nappreciated in Medicine Lodge, where many residents said they had feared\nlosing their town Wednesday, when the fire was at its wildest.All along the\ncity’s brick-paved Main Street, businesses placed signs in their windows with\nmessages like “THANK YOU Firemen and Volunteers” and “We Are Kansas Strong.”At\nFirst Christian Church, the Easter pageant was canceled so the auditorium\ncould be transformed into a feeding center for the hundreds of firefighters,\nmany of whom spent the nights there on cots.And in the surrounding farmland,\ndonated bales of hay arrived by the truckload for ranchers whose cows no\nlonger have grazing land.“That’s rural America,” said Mark Huddler, whose\nranch in a remote corner of this county was almost completely blackened by the\nblaze.Here in Kansas, occasional grass fires are a fact of life, especially at\nthis time of year. But seldom do those fires spread as quickly as this one,\nand almost never do they persist for several days.“Usually, by the time night\nhas fallen, the fire has laid down and often goes out by itself,” said Eric\nWard, a fire-planning specialist with the Kansas Forest Service. But the\ncombination of persistent wind, low humidity and a unique terrain with deep\ncanyons complicated firefighting efforts around Medicine Lodge.“Much of\nKansas, there’s a section of road every mile. You can drive a mile ahead of it\nand take a line” against the fire, Mr. Ward said. “Down here, there’s a lot of\npretty much unbroken country, and the only thing breaking it is the canyons\nyou can’t cross.”Over the weekend, officials were still assessing the extent\nof the damage, including how many cattle had been killed.It was unclear how\nmany firefighters had volunteered their services — many came for a day, worked\na shift, then returned home. But officials said help came from more than 100\ndepartments, from the state’s largest cities and smallest towns.One large\ncontingent of volunteers arrived from Hutchinson Community College, where\nstudents studying to be firefighters had been spending their spring break\npreparing for a controlled burn a few counties away. When word spread of the\nwildfire in Medicine Lodge, they canceled their training session and came to\nhelp with the real thing.Caleb Watts, 20, a Kansas native in the college group\nwho was fighting his first fire, said it was gratifying to be able to help.\nMr. Watts said he hoped to one day be a wildland firefighter, though probably\nnot in his home state. “I’ll probably go west,” he said, “where they normally\nget out of hand like this.”\n\n","title":"Record Wildfire Comes to Kansas, as Do Lifesaving Neighbors - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Record Wildfire Comes to Kansas, as Do Lifesaving Neighbors https://t.co/4JuGfmHEHc","date":"Mon Mar 28 05:57:31 +0000 2016","favs":79,"id":{"$numberLong":"714330560634691584"},"retweets":59},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22GyZVg"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01517"},"content":"BRUSSELS — The stench of chemicals emanating from the sixth-floor apartment\nmade the owner of the building gag. Other odd happenings at the mostly empty\nhousing block in northern Brussels prompted an anxious resident in the area to\nalert the police. A taxi driver who picked up three young men at the block\nsmelled a noxious odor leaking from their curiously heavy luggage as he drove\nthem to Brussels Airport.But not until 7:58 on Tuesday morning did these and\nother strange and, at least in retrospect, alarming dots come together to form\na clear picture of what had been going on for more than two months in the\ndilapidated but spacious top-floor apartment at 4 Max Roos Street in the\nBrussels borough of Schaerbeek.It was then that two homemade bombs — confected\nfrom malodorous and highly volatile chemicals in the living room of the\napartment — exploded in the check-in area of the airport, followed an hour\nlater by another at a busy subway station. Together, the attacks killed 31\npeople.A third bomb was found unexploded at the airport, but the two that were\ndetonated blew holes in the roof and maimed scores of people as they waited to\ncheck their baggage.On Saturday, the airport was still closed, a huge and\nmacabre crime scene instead of a global crossroads and the main entry point to\nthe “capital of Europe,” a city that houses the headquarters of the European\nUnion and NATO.Acting with uncharacteristic — and still unexplained —\nswiftness, Belgian security forces sealed off the area around the apartment in\nSchaerbeek within 90 minutes of the airport attack. The authorities attributed\ntheir speedy reaction to a tip-off from the taxi driver.But the driver was\nsaid to have alerted the police only after a photograph of the suspects in the\nattacks was released hours later, raising questions about whether the police\nhad perhaps already had the building in their sights but, for some reason, had\nnot moved in and smashed through the front door to the sixth-floor apartment\nuntil it was too late.“There were investigations before and after the events”\nof Tuesday, Alexandrino Rodrigues, the owner of the building, said in an\ninterview, suggesting that the police had suspicions before the attacks and\nhad not entirely ignored the report from a concerned neighbor. “You can’t\ncatch a rabbit without knowing where it lives,” he added.A small,\nidiosyncratic and proudly placid country, Belgium has none of the long and\nbloody entanglements in Muslim lands that have made the United States and\nneighboring France such obvious targets for global jihad. Yet with its large\ncommunities of often poor and poorly integrated Muslim immigrants and its own\ndeeply rooted divisions of language, geography and politics, Belgium finds\nitself at the center of Europe’s struggle with terrorism and a glaring example\nof the obstacles blocking the way.How the lengthy preparations for Tuesday’s\nattacks — by militants who either were or should have been on the authorities’\nradar and, in some cases, with ties to the November attacks in Paris — could\ngo undetected has stirred dismay and anger from politicians and also the\npublic, as well as from allies in Europe and beyond.“Why such repeated\ndysfunctions?” Marco Van Hees, a member of the Belgian Parliament, asked the\ninterior minister and two other ministers who were summoned on Friday to\nexplain the failure. “We are certainly not dealing here with just a glitch, a\nlittle bug, but a deep structural problem.”That Belgium has a serious problem\nwith jihadist militancy has been clear for years, particularly since January\nof last year, when the police raided a terrorist hideaway in the eastern town\nof Verviers and foiled what the authorities said was a major plot. That\nsuccess, however, masked rather than solved the problem, which exploded with\nbrutal horror in Paris, when militants, many of them Belgians, killed 130\npeople with guns and with bombs made in the Brussels district of Schaerbeek,\nthe same area that would later house the bomb-making workshop on Max Roos\nStreet.How was it possible, members of Parliament asked, that two of the\nsuicide bombers in the Brussels attacks, Ibrahim el-Bakraoui and his younger\nbrother Khalid, both residents on Max Roos Street since the beginning of the\nyear, had managed to go undetected for so long? And all this despite a record\nof violent crime in Belgium and, in the case of the older brother, a clear\nwarning from Turkey in June that he was on his way back to Europe after being\narrested as a suspected terrorist while on his way to Syria?And was it really\ntrue, the lawmakers demanded, that the authorities had received a precise tip\nin December about the possible whereabouts of Salah Abdeslam, the only known\nsurvivor among the terrorists responsible for the Paris attacks, who was\nfinally captured in Brussels on March 18? He was found at the address cited in\nthe December tip-off, which had not been acted on because it had not been\npassed up the police chain of command.Jan Jambon, the interior minister, told\nlegislators that he could not comment because an inquiry was underway into who\nhad known what and when about the possible location of Mr. Abdeslam, who until\nhis capture on March 18 had been Europe’s most wanted man.At the hearing on\nFriday, questions were also raised about whether the Brussels attacks could\nhave been avoided if Mr. Abdeslam had been subjected to extensive and tough\nquestioning immediately after his arrest. Instead, he was questioned a full\nday later, and then only about the Paris attacks. Insisting he was only a bit\nplayer in Belgium’s jihadist network, he gave no information about any\nimpending attack, the authorities said.The Belgian federal prosecutor’s office\nissued a statement on Friday saying that Mr. Abdeslam, who was shot in the leg\nduring his arrest, was not questioned immediately because of his need for\nmedical treatment.In a sign the Belgian authorities had the Bakraoui brothers\nin their sights before they carried out their attacks, interrogators presented\nMr. Abdeslam with photographs of the siblings after his capture and asked if\nhe knew them. According to excerpts from the March 19 interrogation obtained\nby Le Monde, Mr. Abdeslam firmly denied knowing the men who three days later\nwould subject Brussels to its bloodiest attack since World War II. The\nBelgians dropped the matter.Whether Mr. Abdeslam knew about the attacks being\nplanned for Brussels is still not known, but he certainly knew at least some\nof the militants who carried them out. The most notable was Najim Laachraoui,\n24, who grew up in Schaerbeek and is thought by investigators to have run the\nbomb-making atelier on Max Roos Street and an earlier workshop on Henri Bergé\nStreet where explosives were assembled for the Paris attacks.Mr. Laachraoui’s\nDNA was found on at least two suicide vests used in Paris, providing the most\ndefinitive link so far between the terrorist plots in Paris and Brussels.In\nSeptember, while using a false identity card, he was stopped along with Mr.\nAbdeslam at the Hungarian-Austrian border, but was not detained. He then\nrented a house in Auvelais, Belgium, that was used by the Paris attackers.Mr.\nLaachraoui, like Mr. Abdeslam and the suspected architect of the Paris\nattacks, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, is a veteran of the conflict in Syria. He\ntraveled there in February 2013, helping to blaze a jihadist trail that has\nsince been taken by hundreds of other young Muslims from Belgium, Europe’s\nbiggest source of jihadist fighters relative to population size.Bernard\nClerfayt, the mayor of Schaerbeek, said he had known Mr. Laachraoui had gone\nto Syria but had been at a loss about how to respond. Thinking that Mr.\nLaachraoui would not return to Belgium, he said the Schaerbeek borough had\nstruck him off the electoral roll in 2015 but had been powerless to do\nmore.Unlike Molenbeek, which has been swamped by the police since the Paris\nattacks and was the target of raids during the hunt for Mr. Abdeslam,\nSchaerbeek offers a mix of wealthy and immigrant neighborhoods, a diversity\nthat until the attacks here had spared it from intense scrutiny as a jihadist\nbase.Mr. Laachraoui’s links to and familiarity with the area, where the father\nof the Bakraoui brothers ran a butcher shop, helps explain the choice of\nSchaerbeek for their bomb-making workshop on Max Roos Street.Mr. Rodrigues,\nthe building’s owner, said he saw Mr. Laachraoui visit the building two or\nthree times a week. Bought last year by Mr. Rodrigues, who promptly evicted\nthe previous residents and began renovating the run-down property, it was\nmostly empty except for builders, meaning that young men arriving with barrels\nof chemicals were unlikely to arouse much suspicion.Mr. Rodrigues said that\nIbrahim and Khalid el-Bakraoui were his first tenants, and that they had\nprovided him with fake identity papers and bogus pay slips to obtain a one-\nyear lease. Three others, including a man since identified as Mr. Laachraoui,\nvisited regularly.The smell in their apartment was horrendous, the owner said,\nrecalling how he had seen on the floor two large fans similar to ones found on\nconstruction sites, and an exhaust fan on the wall. Such fans would be useful\nin the final stages of preparing TATP, the homemade peroxide-based explosives\nused in the bombings on Tuesday, and also by the November suicide bombers in\nParis.After breaking into the apartment on Tuesday morning, police officers\nfound 30 pounds of TATP — enough for another powerful bomb — as well as nearly\n40 gallons of acetone and eight gallons of hydrogen peroxide, materials used\nin producing TATP. They also found a suitcase full of nails and metal bolts,\nused to make bombs more lethal, as well as an Islamic State flag.Mr. Rodrigues\nsaid that whenever he visited the apartment, the door to the living room was\nalways shut, while windows throughout the apartment were always open. Mr.\nRodrigues said he would smell a “very strong chemical odor” that he could not\nquite put a finger on. “If it smelled like bleach or drugs, I would’ve\nrecognized it,” he said.Mr. Rodrigues said that while he was mystified by the\nodor, he never reported anything amiss to the police.But at least one resident\nin the area did, not because of the smell but because of strange comings and\ngoings from the building. Rachid Ghaddih, a longtime local resident who lives\naround the corner, said nobody in the neighborhood suspected anything related\nto terrorism but added that the strange goings-on at the building had been\nbrought to the attention of the local agent de quartier, a police officer\nresponsible for keeping a registry of residents and other tasks.The agent de\nquartier, Philippe Swinnen, declined to be interviewed. Mr. Rodrigues said the\nofficer had stopped by the building at least twice to check whether the names\nof residents were properly listed, but never entered because the Bakraouis did\nnot list their names. “It took him three months to figure out that people were\nliving” on the top floor, Mr. Rodrigues said, adding: “But it was too late.\nThat’s how things work in Schaerbeek.”\n\n","title":"In Brussels Bombing Plot, a Trail of Dots Not Connected - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"The significance of chemical odors and other odd hints only became clear after the bombers had struck in Brussels https://t.co/uCRBxF8M5j","date":"Mon Mar 28 05:48:51 +0000 2016","favs":134,"id":{"$numberLong":"714328378187321345"},"retweets":110},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1Pz5GqP"}

Today, a North Korean website. “The United States must choose!

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01519"},"content":"“I was, for a time, supposed to be a grandmaster …”So begins Chuck’s speech to\nthe troops after Donnie’s death, a kind of anti-pep talk to mourn the loss of\ntheir case against Axe Capital and his white whale, Bobby Axelrod. The world\ndoesn’t need another chess metaphor, but this is a rare moment of self-\nawareness for Chuck, who isn’t the type to acknowledge his own flaws readily.\nMen don’t get to his position by virtue of modesty and self-deprecation, but\nChuck takes a big step by acknowledging that confidence and bravado are not\nalways virtues, either.The poker metaphor for this — which the show’s creators\nBrian Koppelman and David Levien know well, having written the movie\n“Rounders” — is “going on tilt,” being so frustrated by a bad run that you\nlose all sense of discipline and overplay your hands. But the chess analogy\nstands, because Chuck is playing a long game against Bobby and it’s not\ncheckmate yet. He can take a breath, reformulate a strategy and return to the\nboard.It’s hard to say what gaming metaphor works for Bobby, because no set of\nrules applies to him. “Quality of Life” goes further than any episode to date\nin revealing the dark, howling chasm where his soul should be. For Bobby to\nuse Donnie as a false “informant” in the case against him shows cunning, but\nfor him to deploy a terminal cancer diagnosis like a dirty bomb is an evil of\na different kind. Maybe he’s a grandmaster for seeing the possibilities in\nDonnie’s illness, just as he seized the chance to make some lucrative moves on\nSept. 11, but he has to be liberated from basic decency to make it happen.\nEven if he could be defended for making a deal with Donnie — $40 million in\nexchange for a few difficult months as a saboteur — he sees far enough ahead\nto make sure Donnie dies on schedule. The “top oncologist out there” is on\nBobby’s payroll, and if the extension of Donnie’s life mucks with his\ntimeline, the good doctor can be compelled to forget the Hippocratic\noath.“Billions” is not a politically minded show per se. Its creators are not\noffering a tsking exposé on Wall Street so much as they’re luxuriating in the\nexcesses of power. But “Quality of Life” imagines Bobby as a creature of pure\ncapitalism, motivated only by the bloodless pursuit of money, without concern\nfor what it means for anyone but himself. In that respect, it’s like the\nsprawling Canadian documentary “The Corporation,” which takes the legal\n“personhood” status granted to companies literally and determines that\ncorporate person to be a sociopath. (And not a harmless sociopath, either.)\nFor all his execrable qualities, Chuck can at least claim to have a prevailing\ninstinct for fairness and social order, whatever underhanded means he uses to\nthat end. Bobby wants only to win, and one of the show’s consistent pleasures\nis witnessing what a man without scruples is capable of accomplishing. It’s\nlike writer’s-room limbo: How low can he go?With the case currently in\nshambles, our two grandmasters can turn to opponents more easily dispatched.\nAfter having the case against “Dollar Bill” Stearn tossed out in court, Chuck\nmoves against a business-friendly federal judge, Whit Wilcox, who didn’t think\n$89 million in profit off a $211,000 investment was worth a hearing. His play\non Wilcox is vintage Chuck, motivated by a mix of punitive rage and genuine\nrighteousness. He couldn’t have known in advance that Wilcox was getting\nkickbacks from a privatized prison system for jailing minorities, but once\nLonnie Watley snuffs it out, Chuck makes a five-course meal out of it. His\nfarewell speech — “Justice, rooted in truth, watered by tenacity and flowered\nby wisdom” — drips delicious sarcasm like sap from a Vermont maple tree, and\nthe honoree fully deserves it. But Paul Giamatti suggests the sadism that\ncolors Chuck’s nobility here: It’s not enough to achieve justice. He needs to\nhumiliate his adversary, too.Having played Chuck and the company for fools,\nBobby also keeps his talons sharp by stalking weaker prey. He may have\nunderstood why investors and protesters were turned off by the Sept. 11\nrevelations, but damned if he’s going to let turncoats get away with\ndefecting. When Stearn makes his triumphant return to Axe Capital, Bobby fakes\na fight with him in order to make it seem like they’re on the outs, making it\nplausible for Stearn to connect with other Axe exiles in their new investment\nfirm, Ionesphere. Compared to the Donnie Caan gambit, it’s a bush league move\nfrom Bobby, but then, Team Ionesphere isn’t as formidable as Chuck Rhoades.\nOne howler of a trade sinks the business, and Bobby swoops in to “save”\nIonesphere by squeezing it under his armpit. Keep your friends close and your\nenemies closer.**Bulls and Bears**• The use of Chumbawamba’s “Tubthumping” to\nunderscore Bobby’s resilience is slyly, bitterly ironic. Most remember the\nband for that song only, with its irresistible singalong chorus (“I get\nknocked down/But I get up again/You’re never gonna keep me down”), but\nChumbawamba was a politically motivated outfit that existed for 17 years\nbefore their one hit and for another 15 years after that. Given the band’s\nleftist/anarchist/anticapitalist leanings, the Bobby Axelrod association is a\ntough one.• Structuring the episode around Donnie’s funeral proves to be an\nawkward device, because it’s not entirely clear where we are in the timeline.\nIt’s a good idea to keep coming back to the funeral, because it\nrecontextualizes different relationships among the attendees, but it isn’t as\nwell organized as it might have been.• “Have them all bury my picture in\nautumn leaves, and as they do, they should make a wish to the world that has\nnothing to do with financial markets.” R.I.P., Donnie. As a tribute to you,\nwe’ll look into investing in an up-and-coming tech outfit called Apple.•\nLara’s Corleone-esque commitment to “family” has brought her into fascinating\nconflict with Wendy, who’s starting to piece together the $40 million deal the\ncompany made with Donnie before he died. That Lara knows about the deal says a\nlot about her character.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0151a"},"content":"It has been a while since Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta tried to choke each other\ninto submission. The brothers took private jujitsu lessons in the early 2000s,\nand at the end of each they were given the chance to try new moves in a dojo\nin Las Vegas. But you reach a certain age (Frank is now 54, Lorenzo is 47) and\nturn up in Forbes (which estimates each brother is worth $1.6 billion), and\nbrawling starts to seem like a bad idea.That does not mean the Fertittas have\ngiven up on combat. After earning their first fortune through an empire of\ncasinos, they spent $2 million to buy the Ultimate Fighting Championship, a\nstruggling mixed martial arts company, in 2001. Since then, the brothers have\nworked tirelessly to bring into the mainstream what critics have long derided\nas “human cage fighting.”Ultimate Fighting Championship events are now\nbroadcast in 158 countries. Until last week, they were legal in all but one\nstate in the union.The lone holdout was New York.The Fertittas have tried\nsince 2007 to persuade lawmakers in Albany to overturn a law that expressly\nprohibits all forms of combat sports, except boxing. Year after year, they\nwere thwarted by an unlikely opponent: a Las Vegas union for kitchen\nworkers.It turns out that Culinary Union Local 226, which represents 55,000\nemployees in Sin City’s hospitality industry, had an ally in — of all people —\nthe former speaker of the New York State Assembly, UFC officials say. That\nwould be Sheldon Silver, long the state’s most effective legislative\ngatekeeper. Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, refused to allow a vote on\nlegalizing mixed martial arts.But he left the Assembly last year after a\nconviction on corruption charges. Then, a UFC triumph was only a matter of\ntime.The time was Tuesday afternoon. With ESPN cameras rolling to capture the\nmoment, the Assembly voted 113 to 25 to overturn the ban.“It’s a terrible,\nnasty, violent sport,” said Michael Benedetto, a Democrat from the Bronx,\nexplaining his highly ambivalent “yes” vote on the Assembly floor. “But it is\neverywhere else.”Through a lawyer, Mr. Silver declined to comment.The “banned\nin New York” stigma was long an impediment to the kind of respectability the\nsport has craved. It kept the UFC from holding events in what it calls the\nlargest and most important media market in the world. It also prevented major\ncompanies from signing sponsorship deals.“A couple have said, ‘We love the\nproduct, we love what you guys do, we love the demo that you deliver,’” said\nLawrence Epstein, a UFC lawyer. “‘But our compliance guys are scaring us,\nasking us how can we sponsor a company that is illegal in New York.’”Creating\na professional sports league is one of the trickiest ventures in the business\nof popular culture. The list of failures in recent decades includes Major\nLeague Volleyball, the National Bowling League and — who can forget? — Pro\nCricket, which expired in 2004, the same year it was born.Against long odds,\nthe Fertittas are well on their way. Today they estimate that 30 million to 40\nmillion people watch their biggest pay-per-view events, in homes or at bars, a\nnumber that far exceeds the audience for any game of the 2015 N.B.A.\nfinals.Unlike the N.B.A., though, the UFC is run almost entirely from one\noffice. It produces its own events, owns its own intellectual property, sets\nthe amounts it will pay its fighters and all but dictates fight nights to its\nathletes, who are independent contractors. It is possibly the most vertically\nintegrated of any sport.The Fertittas are built like former bouncers and they\nclearly enjoy watching a roundhouse kick to the head as much as the next fan.\nLittle else about them fits the profile of a mixed martial arts enthusiast.\nThey wear $5,000 bespoke suits and they are on the ARTnews Top 200 Collectors\nlist, having accumulated a catalog of work by artists like Andy Warhol,\nRichard Prince and Damien Hirst. On a staircase in the UFC’s offices, in a\nnondescript industrial park near an In-N-Out Burger in Las Vegas, there is a\nhuge spin art painting by Mr. Hirst, with “UFC” inscribed in the center.“He’s\nbecome a very good friend,” said Frank, the taller of the brothers, speaking\nof Mr. Hirst. “Sweetheart of a guy. Big fan. Brings his kids to the\nfights.”The brothers were sitting one recent afternoon in the offices of\nStation Casinos, their original business and now a collection of 21\nproperties, mostly in Las Vegas, that they own or manage. With more than\n12,000 employees and $1.55 billion in revenue last year, it is one of the\nlargest gambling companies in the country. If you’ve never heard of it, that\nis because Station caters mostly to residents of Las Vegas, a population that\ntends to shun the extravagant, goofily themed casinos that appeal to\ntourists.Targeting locals was the idea of the brothers’ father, Frank Fertitta\nII, who rose from blackjack dealer to part owner of a 5,000-square-foot\ncasino, which opened in 1976. He taught his sons the casino trade and also\ninstilled in them a love for boxing, bringing them to such classics as Ali vs.\nSpinks and Hagler vs. Hearns.Before they acquired the UFC, the brothers\nbriefly considered entering the boxing business. But they thought the sport\nwas a mess: too many promoters, no long-term vision.“Every boxing match is a\ngoing-out-of-business sale,” Lorenzo said. In other words, promoters seek to\nmaximize revenue — padding their fighters’ records instead of fighting the\nfiercest opponent, for instance — without much regard for the future of the\nsport.Why, Lorenzo asked, did it take so long for Floyd Mayweather Jr. and\nManny Pacquiao to square off, which they did in 2015, five years after\nnegotiations began? “Those guys probably thought they could do other fights\nand milk it,” he said. “We have a different mentality. If the fans want to see\nthe fight, let’s do it.”For the Fertittas, the appeal of the UFC was building\na sport they could control from top to bottom. Initially, though, it was a\nreclamation project. The company was started in 1993, and one of its co-\nfounders was Bob Meyrowitz, best known for creating the King Biscuit Flower\nHour radio program. He hyped the UFC’s reputation for unchecked aggression —\nhair pulling, for instance, was allowed — and reveled in its semi-outlaw\nstatus.In the 1990s, the brothers learned about mixed martial arts through a\nhigh school friend of Lorenzo’s named Dana White, who was training boxers and\nbusiness executives in need of a workout. A hybrid of boxing, judo, taekwondo,\nwrestling and other disciplines, mixed martial arts intrigued the brothers.\nMr. White enrolled them in jujitsu lessons, and the three became regular\nsparring partners.“It was really competitive,” said Mr. White, now the public\nface of the UFC and the one who separates fighters as they taunt one another\nat weigh-ins. “I choked those guys out a bunch of times, and they did the same\nto me.”When Mr. Meyrowitz went looking for a partner, the brothers bought him\nout instead. There was not much to buy, they soon realized. But the league’s\nname, as tarnished as it was, had become synonymous with M.M.A.“We spent $2\nmillion on three letters, basically,” Lorenzo said. “About $660,000 per\nletter.”The brothers created Zuffa, Italian for “fight,” a promotion company,\nto operate the UFC. They took the emphasis off anything-goes savagery. Rules\nwere adopted, 31 in all, including prohibitions against head-butting and\n“groin attacks of any kind.” The brothers grew up in gambling, a highly\nregulated industry, and they decided that the way to build the UFC was to get\nit regulated by state athletic commissions, making the sport palatable to a\nbroader audience.“When we bought the UFC, it’s not on television,” Lorenzo\nsaid. “The only thing you have are live events. Our big push was to get this\nlegalized in all states. And because the gold standard for regulation is\nNevada, that was our first state.”The first few years were disastrous. In\nSeptember 2001, the three flopped in their pay-per-view debut because they did\nnot buy enough airtime. The main event, at the end of the evening, was cut off\nin the second round.“Staffers in our broadcast truck were actually crying,”\nLorenzo said. “We had this elaborate after-party planned. It was worse than a\nfuneral.”The brothers lost $8 million to $10 million a year for the next few\nyears, and briefly considered surrender. In 2005, they opted for a final win-\nor-walk-away push in the form of a $10 million investment to produce a reality\nshow, “The Ultimate Fighter,” which ran on the Spike television channel.\nCombatants lived and trained together in a house and fought one bout per\nepisode.The season finale was “the most epic fight ever,” Lorenzo said. The\nshow lost money, but the corner had been turned. The next year, pay-per-view\nevents were profitable, and in 2007, the UFC had 5.1 million buyers for 11\npay-per-view fights. Last year, UFC took in $600 million in revenue from\nticket sales for live events, TV licensing fees and merchandise. Its athletes\nhave been featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated. One of them, Ronda\nRousey, hosted “Saturday Night Live.”Every Tuesday at 1:30 p.m., major\ndecisions about orchestrating the league and its roster of 523 fighters are\nmade in Zuffa’s offices at a meeting called Match Making. It is held in a\nsecond-floor conference room attached to a kitchen run by a chef lured away\nfrom Nobu, a storied Japanese restaurant. Lorenzo is a fan of the paleo diet,\nand main course options one afternoon included grilled beef tenderloin with\nMeyer lemon zest port wine reduction.Lorenzo sat at the head of the table. A\nlist of coming fights was posted on a white wall. Over the low clatter of\ncutlery, eight executives plotted bouts in the weeks and months ahead. It was\nlike assembling a jigsaw puzzle with living pieces.“She’s not going to jail,”\none participant said, quizzed about a fighter’s availability. Another fighter\nrefused to fly to Brazil to take on a Brazilian. A fighter named Paige VanZant\nwas unavailable because she was on “Dancing With the Stars.” Conor McGregor\nwas the topic of a lot of talk.“You need to talk to him,” someone told\nLorenzo.“He doesn’t wake up until 4 p.m.,” Lorenzo replied.The UFC is like the\nN.F.L. minus the team owners or a players’ union. There are rival leagues\nincluding Bellator MMA, which is owned by Viacom. But the UFC, by its own\naccount, is the leading player.That has led some critics to argue that the UFC\ngrossly underpays fighters. One of them is Ryan Jimmo, a light heavyweight\nfrom Canada.“The talent is being exploited,” Mr. Jimmo said in a telephone\ninterview. “The UFC is basically where the N.F.L. was in the ’60s, before the\nplayers were paid anything close to their current salaries.”Robert Maysey, a\nlawyer in Arizona, has filed a class-action antitrust lawsuit against Zuffa,\nasserting that it has a monopoly on the mixed martial arts business and\nexploits it to keep fighters from earning a fair wage. The case has six named\nplaintiffs, including Mr. Jimmo.Mr. Maysey said entry-level fighters earned\n$12,000 a bout, and $12,000 more if they won. Fighters in title bouts earn\nbase pay of $300,000 to $500,000, and bonuses that could be worth $3 million\nor more at the highest level. Marquee fighters can also earn a cut of pay-per-\nview revenue.“If these fighters were boxers, they’d make $30 million, not $3\nmillion,” Mr. Maysey contends. “Boxing is competitive; promoters have to\ncompete. They’ll pay out 85 percent of revenue to fighters and keep the rest.\nIn mixed martial arts, those numbers are reversed.”The UFC counters that\nbefore the Fertittas, there was no market for M.M.A. fighters. Now competition\nis ferocious, and the UFC can name half a dozen athletes it has lost to rival\ncompanies.“We are proud of the compensation we pay our athletes,” Mr. Epstein\nsaid. “It’s comparable to leagues of our size, like Major League Soccer.”The\ntwo brothers have equal stakes in Zuffa. And while there is no hint of tension\nbetween them, a lawyer insisted that their contract needed a dispute-\nresolution mechanism in case they ever differed over corporate strategy.\nLorenzo had an idea: They would fight.“A sport jujitsu match, three five-\nminute rounds,” he said. “Dana would be the referee. Whoever won got to vote\nthe other guy’s shares.”It has never come close to blows, the brothers say.\nBut privately, each says that if combat were required, the other would win.\n“Frank’s getting ornery in his old age,” Lorenzo said. “Just kidding.”On a\nSaturday night in March, the Fertittas were standing backstage at the MGM\nGrand Garden Arena, getting ready for UFC 196. (All pay-per-view events are\nnumbered.) The Hollywood superagent Ari Emanuel, who handles the brothers’\ntelevision deals, nibbled hors d’oeuvres.In the arena, 16,000 fans were being\nworked into a state of manic anticipation. The Who’s “Baba O’Riley” signaled\nthe start of the night’s five televised bouts. Hundreds of Irish flags waved\nin honor of Mr. McGregor, a featherweight whose attempt to fight in the\nwelterweight division at 170 pounds, 25 pounds above his fighting trim, was\nthe evening’s top attraction.Before Lorenzo took his octagon-side seat, he\nstopped by Mr. McGregor’s dressing room to show him an email from Bono, of U2.\nIt contained a sketch of the fighter with the words, “Conor McGregor,\nunbeatable at any weight.”“That’s brilliant,” Mr. McGregor said, with a grin,\nas an aide taped his hands for the fight.While the UFC’s producers manage\nevery detail of the evening’s staging, they cannot ensure excitement once the\nbell rings. And on this night, fight after fight was dull.Mixed martial arts\nbouts often end quickly — the record is six seconds — but they can also drag\non, with evenly matched athletes circling each other uneventfully. During one\nof the night’s more static matches, the crowd booed.The loser of that fight,\nGian Villante, leaned over the octagon fence, toward Mr. White. “Dana,” he\nyelled over the din. “Dana, I’m sorry.”Mr. White waved him away benignly, but\nhe was stewing. Asked to rate the evening, three fights in, he said, “I give a\nbig fat F!” adding an obscenity to underscore the point.“We need some good\nfights,” Lorenzo said.He got his wish. In the penultimate fight, the\nchallenger, Miesha Tate, whose nickname, Cupcake, seemed more ironic as the\nmatch wore on, squeezed the throat of the champion, Holly Holm, until she lost\nconsciousness.“She sunk in the choke and put Holly Holm to sleep!” shouted Joe\nRogan, the pay-per-view announcer.Then it was the men’s turn. Mr. McGregor\nfaced Nate Diaz, a vegan who had just 11 days to prepare for the fight after\nthe original opponent pulled out with a broken foot.In the first round, it\nlooked as though the fight would be brief. A punch left Mr. Diaz bleeding so\nprofusely from a cut beside his right eye that it was hard to imagine he could\nsee. But in the second round, Mr. Diaz put Mr. McGregor into something called\na rear naked choke.A few seconds later, Mr. McGregor tapped the canvas. Mr.\nDiaz had won by submission, in a huge upset.The crowd howled in wonder and\nelation. It was as though this display of aggression, courage and surrender\nhad transformed people from fans into witnesses. Everyone talked about what\nhappened the way someone would talk after seeing a meteor destroy a\nbuilding.Even fans from Ireland seemed satisfied. “I’ve been to a lot of\nsporting events — boxing, football, rugby,” said William Donnelly, who had\nflown in from Belfast, Northern Ireland, with friends for the fight. “I’ve\nnever experienced anything like that in my life.”Afterward, in the waiting\nroom, Mr. White and the Fertitta brothers were joined by Mr. Epstein, the UFC\nlawyer, who cheerfully reported that he had just met Leonardo DiCaprio.“He\nsaid it was the most exciting night of his life,” Mr. Epstein said. “I was\nlike, ‘Wait a minute, you just won the Academy Award!’”Those who consider\nmixed martial arts excessively brutal would have found much to confirm their\nopinion at UFC 196, if they could bear to watch. As Ms. Holm lost\nconsciousness, she threw sad, eerie little punches into the air, the reflex of\na fighter whose lights were going out.The next day, the Nevada Athletic\nCommission suspended nine fighters for a variety of possible injuries. The UFC\nsaid three fighters were taken to a hospital, as a precaution, and that none\nhad concussions.The company concedes the perils of a sport that allows a move\ncalled the guillotine, but says it is paying for research into concussions and\npoints to a long list of protocols that protect fighters. Medical examinations\nare conducted before and after every fight. Two plastic surgeons were in the\narena the night of UFC 196, for immediate stitch-ups.In the New York Assembly,\ndozens of lawmakers are appalled by mixed martial arts. But this vocal group\ndoes not fully explain why the state rebuffed the UFC for so long.Zuffa\nexecutives maintain that its real problem was the Culinary Union Local 226,\nwhich operates out of a white, pink and blue building in Las Vegas emblazoned\nwith the words “In solidarity we will win!”Labor activists credit the union\nwith making the city one of only a few in the country where waiters, maids and\ndishwashers can earn a living wage. It has contracts with almost every casino\non the Strip. But the Culinary Union has spent more than a decade trying to\nunionize Station Casinos properties, with no success.The Fertittas say that\ntheir employees are happy and note that UFC events hire thousands of union\nworkers annually.According to participants on all sides of the drama, the\nCulinary Union enlisted the help of the New York Hotel and Motel Trades\nCouncil (HTC), an influential lobby in Albany. The Culinary Union and the HTC\nshare a parent group, Unite Here.HTC had a strong relationship with Mr.\nSilver, because it represents 32,000 New Yorkers and because it gave — and\ncontinues to give — generously to the New York State Democratic Assembly\nCampaign Committee, which was for years was controlled by Mr. Silver.The HTC\nand the Culinary Union were rarely public about their opposition to mixed\nmartial arts, though in 2012, the Culinary Union sent lawmakers a mailer\ncriticizing UFC fighters.In the New York Senate, the UFC had no problems.\nEvery year starting in 2010, the Senate passed a bill legalizing mixed martial\narts. But it never came up for an Assembly vote. Zuffa’s representatives and\nmany others have pointed out that Mr. Silver controlled what legislation\nreached the Assembly floor.In effect, the Culinary Union had set up a\nroadblock in Albany from an office 2,500 miles away in Las Vegas, hoping to\nturn Zuffa’s problem in New York into concessions at the Fertittas’ casinos in\nLas Vegas. Zuffa executives said it is no coincidence that they succeeded soon\nafter Mr. Silver was gone.An official from the Culinary Union declined to\ncomment.This wasn’t the first time that the union took a local fight out of\ntown. When Deutsche Bank owned the Cosmopolitan hotel in Las Vegas and would\nnot negotiate with the union, union members poked at a sore spot — in\nWashington. They sent more than 900 postcards to the Federal Reserve featuring\na house with a foreclosure sign, arguing that Deutsche Bank was a bad actor in\nthe American housing crisis.In May 2014, Deutsche Bank sold the Cosmopolitan\nto the Blackstone Group. By February 2015, the casino was a union shop.Even\nafter its loss in Albany, the Culinary Union Local 226 stills shadows the\nFertittas. In coming weeks, an initial public offering is planned for Station\nCasinos. The brothers stand to make more than $100 million each, according to\nthe prospectus, for selling their management company to the casinos. Unite\nHere has created a website to denounce the offering as a sweetheart deal for\nthe Fertitta family.“They don’t give up easily,” said Ruben Garcia, a law\nprofessor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, referring to the Culinary\nUnion. “This is a union that engaged in the longest strike in gaming history,\nthe Frontier Casino strike in the ’90s, which lasted six years and which the\nunion won.”The Fertittas savored their victory in New York on Tuesday with a\nbrief champagne toast. Then it was back to work. The UFC is already starting\nto assemble a fight card for the first mixed martial arts event at Madison\nSquare Garden, tentatively set for November. Even if you do not have a ticket,\nLorenzo promised, you will know something big is afoot.“You’ll see the UFC\ntake over Manhattan,” he said. “It’ll be no different than if the Final Four\nwere in town. The city will be buzzing.”\n\n","title":"Fighting a Cage Match to Turn UFC Into a National Phenomenon - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Two brothers are fighting to bring UFC into the mainstream https://t.co/Pn6mzM0Aaj https://t.co/DcchsYv7f3","date":"Mon Mar 28 04:58:06 +0000 2016","favs":187,"id":{"$numberLong":"714315604761657344"},"retweets":91},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21NSEN4"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0151b"},"content":"Juan F. Masello never intended to study wild parrots. Twenty years ago, as a\ngraduate student visiting the northernmost province of Patagonia in Argentina,\nhe planned to write his dissertation on colony formation among seabirds.But\nwhen he asked around for flocks of, say, cormorants or storm petrels, a park\nwarden told him he was out of luck.“He said, ‘This is the only part of\nPatagonia with no seabird colonies,’” recalled Dr. Masello, a principal\ninvestigator in animal ecology and systematics at Justus Liebig University in\nGermany. Might the young scientist be interested in seeing a large colony of\nparrots instead?The sight that greeted Dr. Masello was “amazing” and\n“incredible,” he said. “It was almost beyond words.”On a 160-foot-high\nsandstone cliff that stretched some seven miles along the Atlantic coast, tens\nof thousands of pairs of burrowing parrots had used their powerful bills to\ndig holes — their nests — deep into the rock face.And when breeding season\nbegan not long afterward, the sky around the cliffs erupted into a raucous\ncarnival of parrot: 150,000 crow-size, polychromed aeronauts with olive\nbacksides, turquoise wings, white epaulets and bright red belly patches ringed\nin gold. Dr. Masello was hooked.Today, Dr. Masello’s hands are covered with\nbite scars. He has had four operations to repair a broken knee, a broken nose\n— “the little accidents you get from working with parrots,” he said. Still, he\nhas no regrets.“Their astonishing beauty and intelligence,” Dr. Masello said,\n“are inspirational.”Dr. Masello is one of a small but unabashedly enthusiastic\ncircle of researchers who study Psittaciformes, the avian order that includes\nparrots, parakeets, macaws and cockatoos. For all their visual splash and\ncartoon familiarity, parrots have long been given scientific short shrift in\nfavor of more amenable subjects like, say, zebra finches or blue tits.But\nthrough a mix of rugged and sometimes risky field work, laboratory studies and\na willingness to shrug off the frequent loss of expensive tracking equipment,\nresearchers are gaining insights into the lives, minds and startling appetites\nof parrots.No, Polly doesn’t want your Triscuits. Got any fig trees to\nsavage?Parrot partisans say the birds easily rival the great apes and dolphins\nin all-around braininess and resourcefulness, and may be the only animals\napart from humans capable of dancing to the beat.“We call them feathered\nprimates,” said Irene Pepperberg, who studies animal cognition at Harvard and\nis renowned for her research with Alex and other African grey parrots.“They’re\nvery good colleagues,” said Alice Auersperg of the University of Vienna, who\nstudies the Goffin’s cockatoo of Indonesia.Many of the recent discoveries are\ndescribed in a new book, “Parrots of the Wild: A Natural History of the\nWorld’s Most Captivating Birds,” by Catherine A. Toft and Timothy F. Wright.\nOthers have been reported in journals or demonstrated through online videos,\nwhich have gone viral or deserve to.Dr. Auersperg and her colleagues have\nfound that Goffin’s cockatoos are among the most spontaneously inventive\ntoolmakers ever described, and that the birds can learn how to fashion the\nlatest food-fetching device after just a single viewing of a master cockatoo\nat work.Studying the yellow-naped Amazon of Costa Rica, Dr. Wright and his\ncolleagues have discovered that different populations of the parrot\ncommunicate with one another in distinct dialects that remain stable over\ndecades, like human languages. Just as with people, young parrots can easily\nmaster multiple dialects while their elders can’t or won’t bother to do\nlikewise.A recent DNA analysis showed that parrots were closely related to\nfalcons, a finding that dovetails with field studies of parrots’ often\nmerciless dietary habits.While falcons are predators in the conventional\nsense, hunting and devouring other animals, parrots turn out to be no less\nbloodthirsty in their approach to feasting on plants. Forget about symbiosis\nor some happy tit-for-tat between flora and this particular fauna.Parrots\npooh-pooh the fruit pulp and home in on the seeds, crushing the casings to\nextract the plant embryos and the cache of fats and proteins intended to help\nthose embryos germinate. “A parrot is a plant carnivore,” Dr. Wright said. “It\ndestroys the seed. It goes right in through the fruit and eats the plant\nbaby.”Or the entire herbaceous brood. Researchers have found that when a flock\nof parrots alights on a fruiting tree, a veritable seed massacre can ensue.In\none study of canary-winged parakeets foraging on the seeds of shaving-brush\ntrees in the Cerrado tropical savanna of central Brazil, scientists determined\nthat the birds destroyed 66 percent to 100 percent of each tree’s fruit in a\nmatter of days. Not a single whole seed could be found on the ground.The\npsittacines are a midsize club of about 360 species, ranging in size from the\npygmy parrots of New Guinea, which are smaller than house sparrows, to the\nbulky, flightless kakapos of New Zealand, which can weigh up to nine\npounds.Most parrots live in the tropics or subtropics, where a mix of habitat\nloss and the depredations of the international pet trade now threaten a third\nof all species with extinction, Dr. Masello said.At the same time, some parrot\nspecies are proving flexible to the point of invasiveness.“Monk parakeets from\nSouth America are doing nicely in New York City,” said Leo Joseph, a parrot\nexpert and director of the Australian National Wildlife Collection in\nCanberra. “Peach-faced lovebirds from Africa are well-established in\nArizona.”Residents of Los Angeles County may spot enclaves of more than a\ndozen different feral parrots, including lilac-crowned Amazons, rose-ringed\nparakeets, macaws and cockatiels. Why some parrots thrive in anthropocentric\nlandscapes while others are on the cusp of oblivion has yet to be\ndetermined.Researchers propose that many of the parrot’s signature traits\nevolved to meet the challenge of seed predation and exploiting a resource that\nplants do everything in their power to defend.The parrot’s muscular jaw and\nhuge bill — specially hinged to allow top and bottom to move independently, up\nand down and from side to side — can crack open even the toughest and woodiest\nshells. The curved points of the bill act rather like lobster picks, ideal for\nscooping out seed meat.Parrots can similarly clip apart leg bands, satellite\nholsters and other animal-tracking devices, which is one reason most\nresearchers have avoided them.Another demand of granivory, or seed predation,\nis the power to withstand the many defensive chemicals that plants pack into\ntheir genetic hope chests. Researchers have lately gathered evidence that a\ndrive to detoxify could explain why parrots often converge on clay flats and\nstart nibbling at the ground.In laboratory experiments at the University of\nCalifornia, Davis, scientists fed orange-winged parrots small doses of\nquinidine, a potentially toxic alkaloid, and followed with what they called a\n“chaser” of Peruvian clay. The researchers found that the clay served a doubly\nsalubrious purpose, first by directly binding to the poison and helping to\nflush it from the body, and then by stimulating the production of a mucus\nshield in the gut.Paradoxically, scientists said, the pursuit of toxic prey\nmay be linked to the parrot’s exceptional longevity. The difficult diet\nprobably selected for a tough constitution, with top-flight immune and DNA\nrepair systems, and tough things tend to last.In addition, the ingested toxins\nmay well have an antimicrobial, anti-parasitic effect, helping parrots to fend\noff disease.However they manage, parrots can live a half century or longer:\nthe record-holder among Moluccan cockatoos, for example, is 92, and a very\nlucky kakapo might make it to 120.Yet seed hunting’s greatest evolutionary\neffect on parrothood may well have been psychosocial, transforming the birds\ninto brainy schmoozers.Fruiting trees are a patchy and unpredictable resource,\nand parrots often fly many miles a day in quest of food. Under such\ncircumstances, searching in groups turns out to be more efficient than\nsolitary hunting, especially when group members can trade tips on promising\nleads.“That can mean the development of a social system, as well as the\nneurological capacity to share information,” Dr. Joseph said. The vocal\ncapacity, too: parrots call to one another continually, squawkishly, over long\ndistances and short.“They are communicating to each other all the time,” Dr.\nMasello said. “Every day, after working in the colony and climbing up the\ncliffs, I’m much more tired from the noise than from the climbing.”The calls\nmay be as much about asserting group identity as exchanging hunting tips.\nSeeking to understand why the yellow-naped Amazons in northern Costa Rica had\na different call from those living 18 miles to the south, Dr. Wright’s team\ntried moving several parrots from one site to the other.The youngest parrot\nquickly mastered the dialect of its new home and began flocking with the\nlocals. The older transplants, however, failed to become adept bilingualists\nand never quite fit in. Instead, they associated with each other.“They formed\na little immigrant enclave,” Dr. Wright said, adding, “Vocal similarity is\nvery important for maintaining social relationships,” in parrots as in\nhumans.Dr. Wright said that captive parrots’ renowned talent for promiscuous\nvocal mimicry — of human speech, a multipart car alarm, a cat’s meow — is\nprobably a byproduct of an innate desire to parrot its own kind.“It’s\nextremely rare to find mimicry of other species in wild parrots,” he said. He\nalso suggested that the ability of some parrots in captivity to move to a\nmusical beat may be an offshoot of vocal mimicry, a generalized motor pattern\ngeared toward synchrony playing out in body or voice.The most celebrated\ndancing parrot is Snowball, a sulfur-crested cockatoo with a trademarked name\nwhose YouTube dance performances to Queen, Michael Jackson and the Backstreet\nBoys have been viewed some 15 million times.Researchers are still getting a\nbead on parrot intelligence, and they are repeatedly surprised by each new\ndisplay of it.Dr. Pepperberg and her collaborators have shown that African\ngrey parrots have exceptional number skills: Alex could deduce the proper\norder of numbers up to 8, add three small numbers together and even had a\nzerolike concept — “skills equivalent to those of a four-and-a-half-year-old\nchild,” Dr. Pepperberg said**.**Dr. Auersperg and her co-workers have found\nthat Goffin’s cockatoos are more geared toward solving technical tasks.\nAlternately using their bills and feet, the birds can systematically make\ntheir way through a lock with five different complex mechanisms on it. Should\nthey discover that one of the steps can be skipped en route to opening a\nchamber with a nut inside, they skip it the next time around.And in an act of\ningenuity that Dr. Auersperg called “sensational” for an animal not known to\nuse tools in the wild, a cockatoo named Figaro one day started carefully\nchipping at the edge of a larch wood frame until he had formed a long, slender\npole, which he then wielded in his bill like a hockey stick to knock out\npebbles and nuts hidden under boxes.“It took him 20 minutes to make his first\ntool,” Dr. Auersperg said. “After that, he could do it in less than five\nminutes.”Other cockatoos that watched Figaro build his tool and then retrieve\nhis nut reward were soon chipping at scraps of wood and batting out\nnuts.Figaro didn’t stop there. Soon he was using sticks to draw patterns in\nthe sand, Dr. Auersperg said.Yes, a cockatoo can doodle, too.\n\n","title":"Parrots Are a Lot More Than ‘Pretty Bird’ - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Parrots may be the only animals apart from humans capable of dancing to a beat https://t.co/SUpd8GGBx2 https://t.co/xOoAClOMuS","date":"Mon Mar 28 04:34:56 +0000 2016","favs":920,"id":{"$numberLong":"714309774704263169"},"retweets":474},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SfbJCF"}

R. Martin and Neil Gaiman\nattended the opening.Upon arrival, guests are told a magical-yet-brief story\nabout the Seligs, the imagined family around which the backstory revolves.\nThey once occupied the house, and then — by appearances, rather suddenly —\nthey left. Visitors are then free to roam the 20,000-square-foot “House,” to\nstitch together the rest of the narrative on their own. Clues range from\nelements of the big picture — about the home’s whereabouts, and what happened\nthere — to the smallest personal details of the former fictional residents.\n(To create authentic environments in the children’s rooms, artists\ncollaborated with local children over many months.) Needless to say, nothing\nabout this work of art is behind velvet ropes. Hands-on exploring — call it\nsnooping — is de rigueur.It’s fitting that even the site of the “House,” where\na cavernous, abandoned bowling alley originally stood, was afforded in large\npart by the fruits of human fantasy. In January 2014, Martin — the “Game of\nThrones” creator and a Santa Fe resident — bought the structure, and provided\nan additional $3 million in renovations, to support the creation of the Meow\nWolf Complex and the House of Eternal Return. Part commentary on what’s real\nand what’s not in an increasingly “virtual” age, and part good old-fashioned\nmystery-solving, the “House of Eternal Return” is Meow Wolf’s first permanent\nexhibit.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0151d"},"content":"DOLOS TOWN, Liberia — As Gaye Dumbai came trudging up the dirt road, heading\ntoward the overgrown cemetery where his mother is buried, villagers came out\nof their houses despite the pouring rain to get a closer look at him.“Aya,\nGaye, you going to your ma grave?” Naomi Tama, a local market woman, called to\nhim, following him up the muddy path until he cut into the bush toward the\ngrave. She trailed after him a few more yards, then stopped, overcome.“Aye,\nman,” she said in a show of sympathy. Then again and again. “Aye, man.”In the\nchronicles of the epidemic that swept through this country like the plague,\nMr. Dumbai, 36, is considered a success story. He is an Ebola survivor. For\nalmost 30 days, he battled the virus, first on his own, covered in a blanket\nand sitting over a pot of hot water steeped with tea leaves, the African way.\nWhen that did not work, he spent six days in a local hospital waiting to get a\ndiagnosis, and 16 days at a hospital in Monrovia fighting the debilitating\nloss of blood and fluid.But when he finally emerged into the daylight, an\nEbola victor, it was to the news that greets so many others who survived the\ndisease: His family was dead. Mr. Dumbai had lost both parents. Two sisters.\nOne brother. Two aunts. Two uncles. Four nieces and nephews.That remains one\nof the biggest curses of the disease that ravaged the West African coast in\n2014 — the punishment it inflicted on entire families. With the exception of\nhealth workers, who contracted the disease by heroically taking care of sick\npeople they did not know, most Ebola victims got sick because they took care\nof loved ones. Consequently, most of the more than 5,000 people in Liberia who\ncontracted, and then beat, the disease have become walking case studies in\ncoping with immeasurable loss.Now, more than a year later, Mr. Dumbai, like so\nmany other survivors of the disease, has his life back. But, like so many\nother survivors of the disease, it is not the same life.He is still selling\nused clothing on the side of the road. He is still living in his same house,\nabout 31 miles from his home in Dolos Town. He is still hoping to get a better\njob, one that will properly use his economics degree from the University of\nLiberia.But Mr. Dumbai’s eyesight seems to fade in and out, a consequence of a\nvirus that continues to flummox the medical world. And like the Scottish nurse\nwho survived Ebola and was recently hospitalized with another Ebola-related\nflare-up, Mr. Dumbai has recurring health issues, including joint pain and\nweakness.Mr. Dumbai, whose demeanor was quiet and reserved even before he had\nEbola, has almost shrunk into himself, friends say. Now hours pass without his\nuttering a sound, even when he is surrounded by chattering people. His\ncellphone rarely rings, an anomaly in a country where everyone seems to relish\nconstant streams of telephone calls and text messages.It is difficult to\nchronicle absence, but for Mr. Dumbai, the silent cellphone is perhaps the\nbest measure. There are no calls from his brother Rashid, a Real Madrid soccer\nfan, to heckle him about Chelsea, Mr. Dumbai’s favorite soccer club.Nor are\nthere phone calls from his sister Miatta’s husband to complain that she is not\ntending to his needs. Mr. Dumbai had often found himself as the de facto\ncounselor for Miatta, who was six months pregnant when she contracted Ebola,\nand her husband during their marital squabbles. He had not really minded\nplaying referee. It kept him connected to his sprawling family.And the phone\nis not ringing with his fiancée on the line anymore, either. Mr. Dumbai ended\ntheir relationship a few months after he got out of the hospital when, during\na fight, she blurted out that his mother did not die of Ebola, but that she\nhad been messing around with spells and that it had backfired. Mr. Dumbai\ncould not listen to that; the pain of losing her was still raw.“My mother\nwasn’t like that,” he said. “She wa’ na like that.”It was his mother’s\nsickness that engulfed the whole family. A year and a half ago, his mother,\nJulia, and one of his aunts paid their respects after the funeral of a\npregnant woman named Patience who had Ebola. As is often the case in Liberia,\nmany people did not accept the medical explanations for Patience’s death.\nPeople said that she had been impregnated by a married man, and that the wife\nof her baby’s father had put a curse on her.At the repast, Mr. Dumbai’s mother\ndipped her hands into the bucket of water that other mourners used to wash\ntheir hands and face. Later, she swore that she had not touched the girl’s\nbody or eaten any of the food there.Mr. Dumbai’s aunt had already come down\nwith the same sickness — fever, vomiting, weakness. His uncle was soon sick,\ntoo, then the couple’s son.All eight of Julia Dumbai’s children came to the\nfamily home in Dolos Town when they heard their mother was sick. The news\nabout Ebola was all over the radio by then in Liberia, and they were fearful.\nThey moved their father, Samuel Dumbai, to another room to sleep, not\nrealizing it was already too late. In the first few days, Julia Dumbai was\ntalking, although she was clearly getting weaker. Mr. Dumbai tried to feed her\nand gave her tea. He remembers the afternoon when his hand touched her\nskin.All around Dolos Town, people were sick and dying. Whispers grew about\nthe wife of the father of the pregnant woman’s baby. Now people said all the\nfood at the funeral had been poisoned.Early Sunday, Aug. 17, 2014, Julia\nDumbai died. Mr. Dumbai’s aunt, uncle and cousin had also recently died. A few\ndays later, Mr. Dumbai’s pregnant sister Miatta was dead.And Mr. Dumbai had a\nfever.Across Dolos Town, people feared answering their cellphones. Every call\nbrought news of death, and then the questions afterward: Did you touch someone\nwho may have touched someone who touched that person? Did you go to a friend’s\nhouse to help when they were sick? Will you pay for that act of kindness now\nwith your life?When the disease finally drained its last victim in Dolos Town\nthree months later, more than 200 people in this village of fewer than 2,000\nwere dead.Feeling sick in August, Mr. Dumbai made his way to the local\nhospital, where he writhed on a mat for six days until the diagnosis he\nalready knew came back. Transported to the John F. Kennedy Medical Center in\nMonrovia, he listened as a fellow patient, a young man named Trocon, urged him\nto hang tough. “God will make it for us to survive,” Trocon told him. “You\nwill see.”Trocon died that night.But Mr. Dumbai was starting to realize that\nhe would beat the disease. As he got stronger, he thought of life without his\nmother and sister Miatta. Who was going to take care of his father? Mr. Dumbai\nstarted making plans.He would talk to Rashid about it, he decided. Rashid had\nnot been picking up his phone, which was strange. To make things worse, when\nMr. Dumbai was discharged in September, the hospital workers destroyed his\ncellphone. The Health Ministry gave him a certificate saying he was free of\nEbola, and a ride to wherever he wanted to go.He needed to get to Dolos Town,\nto start taking care of his “papay,” his father. But then his cousin Samuel\nfound him. “Let’s go into the room,” Samuel said.And that was when Mr. Dumbai\nfound out that his mother, aunt, sister, uncle and cousin were not the only\nones to die. Recalling that day, Mr. Dumbai dropped his voice so low it was\nalmost impossible to hear him, as he chronicled the 13 members of his family\nlost to Ebola.“He told me the papay passed away,” Mr. Dumbai said, revisiting\nthe awful accounting from Samuel. A second sister and another uncle and cousin\nwere dead as well. “Then he told me about Jennifer, my niece, and Sam, my\nnephew,” he said.Those were Rashid’s children. If they had died, he thought,\nthen what about Rashid?The confirmation came. Rashid had died as well.Mr.\nDumbai was still not finished. “Finally he told me about my auntie, my\nmother’s sister,” he said, who had come to Dolos Town when his mother was\nsick, to help take care of her.“She was the last one to die,” Mr. Dumbai\nsaid.More than a year later, as she stared at Mr. Dumbai picking through the\nbush toward his mother’s grave in Dolos Town, Ms. Tama said she still did not\nunderstand how he was coping with the grief of losing so many members of his\nfamily.“I feel too bad for him, man,” she said.Coming from Ms. Tama, that was\nsaying a lot. Because she, too, is one of the Dolos Town walking wounded; a\nyear ago, she had lost her sister and brother-in-law, when the disease raged\nthrough the village.“I have her children now,” Ms. Tama said, wiping tears\nfrom her cheek. “Her twins, Prince and Princess.“They are 8 years old,” she\nsaid.\n\n","title":"Ebola, Ruthless to Families, Leaves Liberian Man Alive and Alone - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"He emerged as an Ebola survivor to news that greets many: His family was dead. https://t.co/codFO8x6o4 https://t.co/8rmvXzAe8J","date":"Mon Mar 28 04:09:48 +0000 2016","favs":212,"id":{"$numberLong":"714303450906013696"},"retweets":149},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25riJ9s"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0151e"},"content":"Improbable as it seemed just two months ago, the one remaining “establishment”\nRepublican presidential candidate in the race is John Kasich, whose last name\nmany voters still can’t pronounce. (Try remembering it this way: “Kasich”\nrhymes with “basic.”) After winning Ohio last Tuesday, Kasich has potentially\ndenied Donald Trump the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination\noutright. And he goes into tomorrow’s primaries (in Arizona and Utah) as an\nantagonist to Ted Cruz, whose quest to close the gap between him and Trump is\ncomplicated by Kasich’s continued presence.But the Ohio governor has amassed\nonly 143 delegates — which means that even if Kasich somehow managed to win\nevery single one of the remaining 1,049 delegates, he would still fall shy of\nthe nomination threshold. Then again, neither Trump nor Cruz is likely to\nclear the bar, either. Should that prove to be the case, then at the G.O.P.\nconvention in Cleveland this July, all delegates will be free to vote for\nwhomever they wish after the first ballot. And although a convention rule\nprecludes consideration of a candidate who, like Kasich, has failed to win\neight states, this provision can possibly be changed.Why would they do so on\nbehalf of a candidate who has finished well behind his two opponents? The case\ngoes like this: Unlike Trump and Cruz, Kasich has more temperate stances on\nimmigration and social issues, which are less likely to turn off moderates,\nindependents, minorities and young voters. National polls currently show him\nbeating Hillary Clinton in November. He is the governor of a crucial swing\nstate. And the upbeat, inclusive manner Kasich has exhibited on the campaign\ntrail may be the only balm for a bitterly divided Republican electorate.Yet\nmost party insiders to whom I’ve spoken flatly reject a draft-Kasich movement.\nPartly this is because he hasn’t earned it. To date he has triumphed only in\nhis home state — which was not a huge surprise, given that he won all 12 of\nhis previous elections (for State Senate, Congress and governor) there. Kasich\nwas something of an absentee candidate in the South and has underperformed in\nthe North and the Midwest outside Ohio. His fund-raising abilities are not\nespecially impressive: He has raised $15.3 million thus far, not much more\nthan the $14.2 million that Marco Rubio raised in the last quarter of last\nyear alone. His quixotically rambling, hug-dispensing campaign manner — the\nconservative columnist John Podhoretz likened him to a “groovy youth minister”\n— borrows more from Jimmy Carter than from Ronald Reagan.Perhaps just as\nimportant, conservatives — particularly in the G.O.P. commentariat — do not\nsee Kasich as one of them. No one questioned his fiscal austerity back in\n1995, when Newt Gingrich, the speaker of the House, named him chairman of the\nHouse Budget Committee. But that was a generation ago. As Ben Domenech,\npublisher of the conservative web publication The Federalist, observes:\n“Kasich had the benefit of being in Congress at a unique moment, when the\neconomic boom during the Clinton years allowed him to do what he did. It’s not\nat all relatable to where we are now.” As governor, Kasich expanded Medicaid\nbenefits in his state, against the wishes of a Republican-controlled\nLegislature. He also embraced Common Core educational standards and today\nfavors a guest-worker program for illegal immigrants. All of these constitute\napostasies to movement conservatives.But there’s a third layer of resistance\nto Kasich, one with which Cruz can identify: Many Beltway Republicans don’t\nlike him. I asked the candidate about this a few months ago. “Look, when you\nbalance budgets, you aggravate a lot of people,” he told me. “When you take on\ntough issues, you’re going to make enemies. And they just wait in the shadows\nto take a whack at you. But over time, I find when I go back to Washington,\nthere’s respect for what I did as a leader.”No doubt Chairman Kasich’s strict\nbudgets made life unpleasant for a few lobbyists. But so did his demeanor —\nwhich, D.C. veterans say, was often sanctimonious and rude. “John had a\nreputation,” says Jim Dyer, the former Republican staff director of the\nAppropriations Committee who counts himself as an admirer, even though the two\noften tussled on budgetary matters. “When he got upset, he’d really blow up.”\nFormer Representative Dave Hobson, one of Kasich’s closest friends in the\nCapitol, recalls: “He’d get really upset with you. Then, two or three days\nlater, he’d say, ‘Goddamn it, Dave, you were right about that.’ ” That Kasich\nis widely regarded as an accomplished legislator distinguishes him from his\ntwo remaining rivals. And several of his former congressional colleagues —\nlike Trent Lott, Vin Weber, Ray LaHood and Pete Hoekstra — have endorsed his\ncandidacy. Still, his past behavior has made the pursuit for allies at the\nRepublican convention in July a more arduous one.It’s unclear whether Kasich\nhas mellowed much since those days. Shortly after being elected governor in\n2010, he warned lobbyists that “if you’re not on the bus, we will run over you\nwith the bus.” He was forced to apologize for publicly describing a policeman\nwho had given him a traffic citation as “an idiot.” State Republicans have not\nforgotten how, in 2013, he lectured the Ohio House speaker Bill Batchelder — a\nRepublican legislator who had served over three decades in the House — about\nhis moral duty to support Kasich’s Medicaid expansion plan: “When you die and\nget to the meeting with St. Peter, he’s probably not going to ask you much\nabout what you did about keeping government small. But he is going to ask you\nwhat you did for the poor. Better have a good answer.”Kasich’s continual\nmoralizing on the subject lost him the support of a key donor, Thomas Patrick,\nthe chief executive of New Vernon Capital, in 2014. Last June, Kasich was\ntouting his record during a speech at a Republican event in Chicago when he\nhappened to see Patrick in the audience. In typically pugnacious fashion, the\ngovernor spoke to Patrick from the lectern: “And so, Tom, what do you think\nabout all of this? Are you still not supporting me?” (Patrick later sent\nKasich a donation of $2,700 — though he has donated far more, $258,100, to\nCruz.)On the campaign trail, Kasich has said that his experience with voters\nat town halls “has changed me.” But just as some in the audience can provoke\nhis empathy, others elicit his derision. (“A chicken in every pot,” he scoffed\nwhen a young New Hampshire woman urged him to support clean energy. He added:\n“The problem, young lady, is that you can’t just make things happen.”) Kasich\nhas also been snappish toward prospective donors. None of this would\nnecessarily set him apart from others in the field, but for Kasich’s at times\npious-sounding calls for civility and for “living a life that’s a little\nbigger than yourself.” As the National Review editor Rich Lowry puts it: “The\nwhole thing about being the country’s healer and giving people hugs is off-\nputting to conservatives who take ideas really seriously. And it’s also\ncounter to the image he has back in Washington — which is why people who are\nin the know roll their eyes whenever they see Kasich’s act.”Kasich’s\nstrategists maintain that the governor’s cantankerousness is proof of his\nunvarnished authenticity. But that impression also lingers in the collective\nmemory of a Republican establishment whose support in July Kasich may need\nperhaps more than he now needs votes. As the candidate says occasionally of\nhimself, in more reflective moments, “Tone matters.”\n\n","title":"Why the Republican Establishment Doesn’t Like John Kasich - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Why the Republican establishment doesn’t like John Kasich https://t.co/VTS6TndanO https://t.co/HJjwumc1ZM","date":"Mon Mar 28 03:56:20 +0000 2016","favs":216,"id":{"$numberLong":"714300062688550912"},"retweets":100},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1q9OqUz"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0151f"},"content":"PHILADELPHIA — The Earth has managed to orbit the sun for the last seven years\nin spite of one of college basketball’s great injustices. Somehow the Final\nFour had been contested each spring since without the presence of North\nCarolina, challenging an enduring belief among its supporters that if God were\nnot a Tar Heel, then why is the sky Carolina blue?For the nation’s most\neminent programs, such a shard of time is like an eon. North Carolina\nidentifies itself by championships won, and after continuing its romp through\nthe N.C.A.A. tournament Sunday, it will pursue another one next weekend in\nHouston.The Tar Heels pounded Notre Dame, 88-74, in the East Regional final,\nrestoring order to a tournament pummeled by upsets.A formless regular season\ngave way to a tournament that, after some early mayhem, unfurled as the\nbracket designers intended, with all four top seeds advancing to the regional\nfinals. But then chaos descended again.As Oregon, Kansas and Virginia all\nsuccumbed this weekend, North Carolina survived, reaching the Final Four for\nthe first time since 2009, when it thrashed Michigan State to win a fifth\ntitle. In a nod to all that bedlam, with 34 seconds remaining, Marcus Paige,\nthe Tar Heels’ calm-as-low-tide guard, gathered his teammates for a huddle.“I\nwas saying, ‘Fellas, I know this feels good, but play 30 more seconds and we\nin the Four,’ ” Paige said on the court afterward. “There’s been some crazy\nthings that have happened. I wanted to make sure we were in.”Oh, they were in.\nFor reasons beyond their seeding or pedigree, these Tar Heels will be\nconsidered the favorite as they try to capture Championship No. 6, to beat\nupstart Syracuse on Saturday and Villanova or Oklahoma thereafter.\nComplemented by Paige, the frontcourt, best in Division I, is powered by a\ncollection of enormous young men whose size belies their agility and\nathleticism.One after another, they tormented Notre Dame on Sunday: the\n6-foot-8 pogo stick Justin Jackson (11 points, 5 rebounds), sinking 3-pointers\nfrom the wing and driving along the baseline; the 6-foot-10 forward Brice\nJohnson (25 points, 12 rebounds), selected as the regional’s most outstanding\nplayer, balancing a dominant low post game with a pillowy jumper; the\n6-foot-10 center Kennedy Meeks, scoreless in the first half but unstoppable in\nthe second.Trailing, 51-40, after Meeks’s fourth straight basket, the Irish\ntrudged to the bench for a media timeout with 15 minutes 47 seconds left in\nthe game. Limping after a spill on the baseline, Demetrius Jackson went back\nout and made a layup, swished a 3-pointer and tossed an alley-oop to Zach\nAuguste, who, fouled, made his free throw.Before the Tar Heels could score\nagain, they had allowed 12 straight points. But before the Irish could score\nagain, they, too, allowed 12 straight points.This is how North Carolina\noperates. It weathers poor stretches and then crushes souls and dreams. The\nTar Heels outrebounded Notre Dame by 32-15 and scored 12 more points — 42 to\n30 — in the lane.Asked why he did not have his players foul when North\nCarolina possessed the ball for nearly a minute late, Notre Dame Coach Mike\nBrey all but shrugged.“Because it was over,” Brey said. “It was over. Our guys\nwere exhausted, too.”They were exhausted by Sunday’s events, but also the last\n10 days collectively. By all good sense, the Fighting Irish should have been\nback in South Bend a week ago, monitoring the school’s burgeoning quarterback\ncontroversy, eliminated in the first round after trailing Michigan by 12 at\nhalftime; or in the second round, after trailing Stephen F. Austin by 6 with\n95 seconds remaining; or in the regional semifinal Friday, after trailing\nWisconsin by 3 with 25 seconds left. In the final minute of each of those last\ntwo victories, Notre Dame outscored opponents by 14-3.The mission for the\nIrish on Sunday was to remain that close, that long. They made nine of their\nfirst 12 shots, and 14 of 24 over all, and still trailed, 43-38, after a first\nhalf that asserted their resilience. Not even three weeks ago, the Irish lost\nto North Carolina by 31 in the semifinals of the Atlantic Coast Conference\ntournament.“Those are ones that you burn, you don’t go back to,” Brey said of\nthe game tape. “But you certainly have to learn from it.”The Irish responded\nby elevating another skilled ballhandler, Matt Farrell, to the starting\nlineup.They refined their ability to compartmentalize. What they could not do\nis consistently crack a North Carolina defense that has morphed into a\nstrength.All season, as North Carolina kept scoring 90 but floundering on\ndefense, Coach Roy Williams reminded his players of a Tar Heel truism: Both of\nhis N.C.A.A. champions, in 2005 and 2009, just suffocated opponents.Implied\nwas a challenge that players took weeks to convert into results. The Tar Heels\ncited a film session after their Feb. 27 loss at Virginia as pivotal. Rarely\ndoes Williams demand his players watch every single second from a game again,\nbut he wanted them to see Virginia’s precision, execution, spirit. Play like\nthat, he told them.But by the later stages Sunday, the coaches were not\nyelling much anymore. They were standing behind Williams, shaking hands and\ndispensing hugs, and after the final buzzer, the party spilled onto the\ncourt.Johnson, clutching a pair of scissors, asked his teammates if he could\ncut the net first. Meeks grabbed a selfie stick and snapped a photo. Williams\nclimbed the ladder to clip the net as regional champion for the eighth time in\n28 seasons as a head coach, only now he sliced his pinkie finger.“He should be\nused to cutting nets,” Paige quipped. “That’s something he’s done several\ntimes in his career.”It has been a while, though — seven long years, as\nWilliams and the Tar Heels can attest.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01520"},"content":"Shana Claudio left the bar on the Upper East Side of Manhattan for her third\nTinder date of the day. She had already met a finance type for brunch that\nSunday in October 2013 through the dating app (he was a bit superficial), and\nshe found the second guy, whom she met for a drink, forgettable.By now it was\nearly evening, and Ms. Claudio, who now works in corporate communications, was\nscheduled to go on a date at a nearby bar with a guy named Ken. He turned out\nto be Ken Andrews, a 33-year-old surgeon in his fourth year of medical\nresidency at N.Y.U., who thought Ms. Claudio was a “total knockout.”After\nthree hours of conversation, Mr. Andrews walked her home, giving her a quick\nkiss at her apartment doorstep. “No way was he coming upstairs and he didn’t\ntry — that’s not why I was on Tinder,” said Ms. Claudio, now 33. They went out\nagain, and they were engaged 10 months later. She is now Mrs. Andrews.Yes,\nthey swiped right and met the one — with hardly a cheap rendezvous in sight,\neven though Tinder, the ubiquitous mobile-dating app, has been written off by\nsome observers as nothing more than a vehicle to promote quick and easy\nhookups.In a 2015 article in Vanity Fair, Nancy Jo Sales argued that Tinder is\nresponsible for a “dating apocalypse,” with several 20-something New York men\nadmitting they use it to prowl for women to sleep with. They call their\nconquests “Tinderellas” and pride themselves on getting women into bed after a\nfew texts.The article set off a firestorm on the Twittersphere, with Tinder\ngoing on the defense — at one point tweeting out 30 responses in just a few\nminutes. Tinder acknowledged that some users just want to hook up, but said\nthat a vast majority were looking for meaningful connectionsTinder users can\nswipe right if they think someone is attractive, or swipe left if they don’t.\nAnd if the right-swiped person approves, then the duo has the ability to\nmessage, and perhaps get to know each other.There’s no lengthy profile. On\nTinder, users see nothing but a photo, a short tagline, someone’s profession\nand perhaps an alma mater. It’s why the app is sometimes called shallow:\nYou’re pretty much judging someone on their picture alone.But despite its\ncritics, the app has catapulted to the top of the dating scene in places\naround the country, from Miami to Manhattan, thanks to its ease of use. You\nsign up, you swipe, you maybe land a date.And what may surprise some cynics is\nthat Tinder is also landing spouses for more than a few of its users,\nincluding a number who have been featured in the Vows section of The New York\nTimes.“Three years ago, Tinder was considered a hookup app,” said Julie Spira,\nan online and mobile dating coach based in Los Angeles, who advises her\nclients to go on three dating sites, including Tinder, if they’re serious\nabout meeting someone. “Now people are joining Tinder because it’s efficient\nand easy to use, and everyone seems to be on it.”Thanks to Tinder’s lowbrow\nreputation, some couples have lied to friends and family members about how\nthey met. Mrs. Andrews admits that she and her husband told people they met at\na bar when they first started dating. “We worried they wouldn’t take us as\nseriously,” she said.Janie Egan, a 21-year-old living in Salt Lake City, met\nher husband, Chris George, on Tinder as a freshman at the University of Utah.\nHer parents had forbidden her to use the dating app, but she thought it was\nfun; Mr. George, 29, was the second guy she met on the app.When she took Mr.\nGeorge, who works in advertising, to a college basketball game with her\nparents, her father asked him, “You’re not one of those Tinder boys, are you?”\nMr. George shook his head no. (They came clean a few weeks later, and it\nbecame a running joke that Mr. George had lied to his father-in-law the first\ntime they met.)Still, the app has become so popular that couples are shedding\nsome of the shame associated with meeting on it. Many are proudly\nincorporating Tinder into their engagement or wedding ceremonies. A spokesman\nfor Tinder said that the company has received wedding invitations via email\nand regular mail, and that Sean Rad, the chief executive, and other members of\nthe Tinder team are often asked if they would like to attend.One couple were\nengaged using Tinder messages. Rachael Honowitz, 35, lived in Manhattan for 12\nyears, working as an event planner for People magazine, before deciding to\nmove to Los Angeles in 2014. She moved with the hope that men on the West\nCoast weren’t as noncommittal as the ones she met in New York.She met her\nhusband, Jason Cosgrove, a digital media executive who was growing tired of\nthe online dating scene, on Tinder six weeks later.“I was probably chatting\nwith 10 guys at the time,” said Ms. Honowitz, who now runs a company that\nprepares gift bags for award shows and celebrities. “I was even talking to one\nof his best friends, which was a bit awkward later.”Mr. Cosgrove and Ms.\nHonowitz went out for sushi for their first date. They clicked. “You just know\nif it’s going to work after one date,” she said. “And it did.”Mr. Cosgrove,\n38, decided to propose using Tinder messages while sitting with Ms. Honowitz\non a bench in Central Park during a trip to New York. When he ran into\ntechnical difficulties on Tinder (they couldn’t get their profiles to “match”\nin a different city), he sent his “Tinder message” via text, excerpted here:\n“Here we are. Back in the place where it all began — a little app inside your\nphone. But things have changed a bit since we first met here … I suppose after\nsaying some sweet stuff to a girl on Tinder, it would be time to ask her out.\n… But I’ve got another question instead.”Ms. Honowitz put the phone down; Mr.\nCosgrove got down on one knee and proposed.“I was embarrassed by how we met at\nfirst and didn’t tell people, but now I see it as my civic duty to let people\nknow,” said Ms. Honowitz, who agreed to let Tinder post their love story on\nthe “success stories” part of their website. “There’s no shame in meeting on\nTinder. I’m a smart, educated girl from a great family. Jason is, too.”“And\nwe’re having a tinderbaby,” Mr. Cosgrove announced proudly.In 2015, Eric\nSchleicher posted a wedding photo of himself and his new wife, Caitlin, on\nInstagram with an attention-grabbing “Straight Outta Tinder” graphic stamped\non the front. “We #SwipedRight!,” Mr. Schleicher, the marketing manager for\nevents at the BOK Center arena in Tulsa, Okla., captioned the photo.He’s one\nof hundreds who have posted to the hashtag. “People are always surprised when\nI tell them how we met,” he said. “I thought this was a fun way of sharing\nit.”Mr. Schleicher joined Tinder in the fall of 2013, shortly after moving to\nDallas. He wasn’t looking for a hookup (he says that’s not his thing). He just\nwanted to get to know people.He met Ms. Schleicher at 11 p.m. at a bar called\nThree Sheets for their first date; it was her idea. “Looking back, the late\ntime could have given him the wrong impression,” said Ms. Schleicher, a labor\nand delivery nurse, “But he wasn’t in a rush that night, about anything. We\njust talked for hours.”“I think Tinder is what you make of it,” said Mr.\nSchleicher, 25. Sure, there are people looking for casual sex, he said, but\nthen there are people who really want to meet someone. “You just have to sift\nthrough,” he said.He’d go out of his way to seem normal when he approached\nwomen on the app, knowing that many of them were hurled insulting pickup lines\nlike, “Do you have any bikini shots?” His opening line was always plain\nvanilla: Hey, how are you?Mr. Cosgrove thinks of Tinder as an icebreaker,\nsince it can ease the stress of approaching a woman. “If I saw my wife in a\nbar, I would have been too intimidated to approach her,” he said. Knowing that\nshe had already swiped right reassured him that she found him attractive,\nwhich he said gave him more confidence on their first date.Aimee Denaro, a\nreal estate broker who lives in the East Village, never thought she’d meet a\nhusband on Tinder in 2013. “I had tried Match.com and eHarmony, but I never\nfound any normal guys there,” she said.Ms. Denaro signed up for a Tinder\naccount at the same time as her best friend, and they’d both scroll through\nthe guys, like it was a game. They were encouraged. “On Tinder, I felt like\nI’d found a larger pool of guys, guys I would have been friends with,” she\nsaid. (There were definitely creepers, too, like the guy who asked if she\nliked massages, or the one who asked her to describe her feet.)When she met\nRob Becker, she had an instant crush, but she didn’t take him seriously at\nfirst. “I had written him off, thinking ‘Come on, I’m not really going to meet\nmy husband on Tinder,’” she said. But he was exactly her type, and they were\nengaged a year later. He gave her a T-shirt that night: “Yeah, we met on\nTinder,” it read.And Ms. Denaro’s best friend? She was engaged a month later\nto one of her Tinder beaus as well. Says Ms. Denaro: “We were in each other’s\nbridal parties.”\n\n","title":"The Tinder Dating Pool Isn’t Completely Shallow - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"They swiped right on Tinder, and met the one https://t.co/uTyuiZGQds https://t.co/5oBXngEsj1","date":"Mon Mar 28 03:36:57 +0000 2016","favs":277,"id":{"$numberLong":"714295181990895616"},"retweets":78},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SfbLdR"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01522"},"content":"If Sally Field nursed a hope of dodging notice at the Whitney Museum of\nAmerican Art this month, that hope was crushed when she stretched her\n5-foot-3-inch frame on an outsize banquette, its cushioned surface an apparent\ninvitation to relax.It was no such thing, as Ms. Field soon discovered. The\noutline of her body had left a thermal impression captured in Day-Glo green on\na nearby video screen, part of an interactive installation exploring mass\nsurveillance by the artist and filmmaker Laura Poitras.“This is seriously\ndisturbing,” Ms. Field murmured and moved on. She was pretty well camouflaged\nfor her outing in a well-worn plaid J. Crew shirt and Bottega Veneta black\nleather jacket, her garb a kind of youthfully understated urban armor.Ms.\nField, who first captivated a mass TV audience in the 1960s in “The Flying\nNun,” has been long accustomed to a kind of informal surveillance. Blithely\nignoring the gapes of passers-by, she headed toward the museum terrace, a\nfavorite retreat of the actress, who routinely shuttles between her homes in\nLos Angeles and New York.And a refuge as well from prying eyes. What do all\nthose strangers make of her?“I can’t tell,” Ms. Field said evenly. “They don’t\ntreat me like a human being. They’re giving me different energy than if I had\njust been some older woman sitting next to them on a bus or riding in an\nelevator.”Her fame, she said, has left her a bit conflicted. “I’ve known some\nform of being celebrity my entire life,” said Ms. Field, who was the gamine\nsurfer Gidget on the TV show of that name at 18. “But I still want to go to\nthe market and have my little old lady cart behind me.”During such routine\nexcursions, “I put blinders on,” she said. “I don’t want people to see me, or\nto not see me.”All eyes were on her earlier that week when Ms. Field stepped\nelastically from her car to attend the premiere of “Hello, My Name Is Doris,”\nhosted by the Cinema Society at the Metrograph, a new downtown theater on\nLudlow Street.Among the guests were Michael Showalter, the film’s director,\nand cast members, including Natasha Lyonne and Tyne Daly, as well as Paul\nRudd, Emily Mortimer and the columnist Cindy Adams, who flaunted her trademark\nbeehive as she interviewed Ms. Field in a dim corner, scribbling old-school\nstyle in a reporter’s notebook.As the film’s title character, an endearing if\nslightly unhinged accountant in her 60s, Ms. Field finds herself lusting\nobsessively over a handsome co-worker decades her junior. Left mostly to her\nown devices after her mother dies, she is surprised to discover an engagingly\neccentric, adventurous side.Not only is Doris capable of entertaining humid\nfantasies about a much younger man, but of venturing into uncharted terrain,\nposing for rock album covers and dancing at subterranean clubs garbed in a\ngarish caution-yellow jumpsuit.Doris’s exotic escapade is “part of becoming\nnew, of coming-of-age,” Ms. Field said. “But it’s hard to be new and awkward\nand to open up to your vulnerabilities.”At 69, she can relate. “I’m moving on\nto the newest stage of my life, my 70s,” she said gamely. “There are things\nwaiting for me that I couldn’t have found without getting here.”Including the\nHarold-and-Maude scenario suggested by Doris? Not out of the question, it\nseems.Ms. Field, who has been married twice and had a much chronicled long-\nterm relationship with Burt Reynolds, said on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show”\nrecently that she wouldn’t object to acquiring a boy toy.“If he wants to step\nforward and say ‘How about me,’ I will judge the situation from that,” she\nsaid.She returned to the topic the other day at the Whitney. “Sex is in\neverybody’s relationships with everybody,” Ms. Field said, hopping good-\nnaturedly onto her soapbox. “It underlines human beings. It’s part of a\npackage, no matter where in life you are or who you’re with.”“Sure, society\nsees as part of that package being very, very young and very, very thin,” she\nadded. “But I don’t think there is an expiration date, like on a carton of\nmilk.”\n\n","title":"Sally Field on the ‘Newest Stage’ of Her Life - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTStyles: Sally Field talks about fame, younger men and her new film, “Hello, My Name is Doris.” https://t.co/JKUvrW629B https://t.co/…","date":"Mon Mar 28 02:31:27 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714278700171280385"},"retweets":115},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1URme3Q"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01523"},"content":"The world of make-believe can be a scary place, but never fear: Thanks to a\nseries of reimagined fairy tales published online by the National Rifle\nAssociation, classic characters like Hansel and Gretel are now packing\nheat.The group has published two of the updated tales on its N.R.A. Family\nwebsite in recent months, entitled “Little Red Riding Hood (Has a Gun)” and\n“Hansel and Gretel (Have Guns).” The stories have outraged advocates of gun\ncontrol, but their author, Amelia Hamilton, a conservative blogger, has called\nthem lessons in gun safety.“The stories are really also for adults, and it’s\nall about safety,” Ms. Hamilton said in an interview on “CBS This Morning” on\nFriday. “It’s for parents to start those conversations.”N.R.A. Family asked\nits readers in an editor’s note if the dark overtones of the original fairy\ntales — an old woman eaten by a wolf and children cooked by a witch — ever\nmade them “uneasy.” It said the new versions are meant to make the Grimm\nbrothers’ tales less grim.In Ms. Hamilton’s stories, each of the young\nprotagonists (and one grandmother) is transformed from a victim into a hero\nwith the help of a gun.Ladd Everitt, a spokesman for the Coalition to Stop Gun\nViolence, said that depiction was a source of concern.“There are no\nconsequences for the children here holding guns, walking out into the woods\nwith guns, thinking about killing the bad guys,” he said. “Children who might\nread these stories do not have the emotional maturity to understand that gun\nownership does come with risks.”In the N.R.A. version, Little Red Riding Hood\nset off through the forest to visit her grandmother, just like in the\noriginal. But the Big Bad Wolf did not scare her this time, because she “felt\nthe reassuring weight of the rifle on her shoulder.”When the wolf approached\nher, “she shifted her rifle so that it was in her hands and at the ready.” He\nfled in fear.Grandma, too, was saved by a gun. While distracting the wolf with\ncompliments about the size of his eyes and ears, she slowly reached for her\nweapon.“The wolf leaned in, jaws open wide, then stopped suddenly,” Ms.\nHamilton wrote. “Those big ears heard the unmistakable sound of a shotgun’s\nsafety being clicked off. Those big eyes looked down and saw that grandma had\na scattergun aimed right at him.”Hansel and Gretel got a similar treatment.\nThe story began with them hunting in the woods, eventually bagging “a\nmagnificent 10-point buck,” when they stumble upon a gingerbread cottage where\ntwo little boys were imprisoned by a witch.The siblings climbed through the\ncottage’s windows and rescued the boys while the witch slept in the next room.\nAs Hansel unlocked their cage, his sister “stood at the ready with her firearm\njust in case, for she was a better shot than her brother.”When they returned\nhome the next morning, the children told the parents about the witch and soon,\n“Villagers, prepared with rifles and pistols, headed into the forest, Hansel\nand Gretel leading the way.” The witch was locked up by local law enforcement,\nand then everyone ate her house.Efforts to reach Ms. Hamilton on Friday were\nunsuccessful. In an interview with N.R.A. News, she said her versions were\n“kinder” than the originals by the Grimm brothers because no grandmothers or\nchildren were eaten and, despite the guns, the villains were not shot. “The\nkids do just what they are supposed to do and get an adult,” she said.Mr.\nEveritt of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence compared the modified fairy\ntales to other N.R.A.-produced fare aimed at young people, such as “Noir,” a\nprogram on N.R.A. News starring Colion Noir, a young African-American gun\nenthusiast who shoots guns and delivers monologues on the importance of the\nSecond Amendment against a hip-hop soundtrack.“The intent here is to create\nfuture customers” for the gun industry, said Mr. Everitt. “I think it is\nwholly a marketing thing.”Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to\nPrevent Gun Violence, agreed, calling the stories “a disgusting, morally\ndepraved marketing campaign.” He said in a statement that the stories were in\npoor taste in part because nearly 50 children and teenagers are shot each day\nin the United States, and suicide by gun is a leading cause of death among\nchildren over the age of 9.Ms. Hamilton has pushed back against critics who\nsay her stories advocate arming children. She thought of Hansel, Gretel and\nLittle Red Riding Hood as “older teenagers” who “are old enough to be in the\nwoods by themselves and old enough to be hunting by themselves,” she told\nN.R.A. News.She has also announced plans for her next fairy tale: The Three\nLittle Pigs, with guns, will be published on the N.R.A. Family website in May.\n\n","title":"The N.R.A.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01524"},"content":"The nations of the world agreed years ago to try to limit global warming to a\nlevel they hoped would prove somewhat tolerable. But leading climate\nscientists warned on Tuesday that permitting a warming of that magnitude would\nactually be quite dangerous.The likely consequences would include killer\nstorms stronger than any in modern times, the disintegration of large parts of\nthe polar ice sheets and a rise of the sea sufficient to begin drowning the\nworld’s coastal cities before the end of this century, the scientists\ndeclared.“We’re in danger of handing young people a situation that’s out of\ntheir control,” said James E. Hansen, the retired NASA climate scientist who\nled the new research. The findings were released Tuesday morning by a European\nscience journal, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics.A draft version of the\npaper was released last year, and it provoked a roiling debate among climate\nscientists. The main conclusions have not changed, and that debate seems\nlikely to be replayed in the coming weeks.The basic claim of the paper is that\nby burning fossil fuels at a prodigious pace and pouring heat-trapping gases\ninto the atmosphere, humanity is about to provoke an abrupt climate\nshift.Specifically, the authors believe that fresh water pouring into the\noceans from melting land ice will set off a feedback loop that will cause\nparts of the great ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica to disintegrate\nrapidly.That claim has intrigued some experts who say the paper may help\nexplain puzzling episodes in Earth’s past when geological evidence suggests\nthe climate underwent drastic shifts. Yet many other scientists are\nunconvinced by some of the specific assertions the authors are making.“Some of\nthe claims in this paper are indeed extraordinary,” said Michael E. Mann, a\nclimate scientist at Pennsylvania State University. “They conflict with the\nmainstream understanding of climate change to the point where the standard of\nproof is quite high.”Despite any reservations they might have about the new\npaper, virtually all climate scientists agree with Dr. Hansen’s group that\nsociety is not moving fast enough to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases,\nposing grave risks. An agreement reached late last year in Paris seeks to cut\nemissions, but it is not remotely ambitious enough to limit global warming to\nthe degree Dr. Hansen regards as necessary.Among Dr. Hansen’s colleagues, some\nof the discomfiture about the new paper stems from his dual roles as a\npublishing climate scientist and, in recent years, as a political activist. He\nhas been arrested at rallies, and he has joined with a group of young people\nwho sued the federal government over what they said was its failure to limit\nglobal warming.Dr. Hansen argues that society is in such grave peril that he\nfeels morally compelled to go beyond the normal role played by a scientist and\nto sound a clear warning.That stance has made him a hero to college students\nfighting climate change, but some fellow scientists fear he has opened himself\nto the charge that he is skewing his scientific research for political\npurposes.In 2009, nations agreed to try to limit the planetary warming to 3.6\ndegrees Fahrenheit, or 2 degrees Celsius, above the preindustrial level. The\nEarth has already warmed by about half that amount. The climate appears to be\ndestabilizing, virtually all land ice on the planet has started to melt, and\nthe oceans are rising at an accelerating pace.The paper, written by Dr. Hansen\nand 18 other authors, dwells on the last time Earth warmed naturally, about\n120,000 years ago, when the temperature reached a level estimated to have been\nonly slightly higher than today. Large chunks of the polar ice disintegrated\nthen, and scientists have established that the sea level rose 20 to 30\nfeet.Climate scientists agree that humanity is about to cause an equal or\ngreater rise in sea level, but they have tended to assume that such a large\nincrease would take centuries, at least. The new paper argues that it could\nhappen far more rapidly, with the worst case being several feet of sea-level\nrise over the next 50 years, followed by increases so precipitous that they\nwould force humanity to beat a hasty retreat from the coasts.“That would mean\nloss of all coastal cities, most of the world’s large cities and all their\nhistory,” Dr. Hansen said in a video statement that accompanied the new\npaper.The paper identifies a specific mechanism that the scientists say they\nbelieve could help cause such an abrupt climate shift.Their idea is that the\ninitial melting of the great ice sheets will put a cap of relatively fresh\nwater on the ocean surfaces near Antarctica and Greenland. That, they think,\nwill slow or even shut down the system of ocean currents that redistributes\nheat around the planet and allows some of it to escape into space. Warmth will\nthen accumulate in the deeper parts of the ocean, the scientists think,\nspeeding the melting of parts of the ice sheets that sit below sea level.In\naddition, a wider temperature difference between the tropics and the poles\nwill encourage powerful storms, the researchers contend. The paper cites\nevidence, much of it contested, that immense storms happened during the warm\nperiod 120,000 years ago.For instance, the paper says such storms might have\nthrown giant boulders onto coastal ridges in the Bahamas, though other experts\nthink a tsunami might have been responsible.The idea of a shutdown in the\nocean circulation because of global warming was considered more than a decade\nago, and while scientists concluded that a weakening of the currents was\npossible, they said a complete shutdown was unlikely to happen in this\ncentury.That did not stop a distorted version of the idea from becoming the\npremise of the disaster movie “The Day After Tomorrow,” released in 2004.The\nnew paper may reopen that debate, requiring scientists to re-examine the idea\nwith the more sophisticated computer models of the climate that are available\ntoday. It could take several years for the experts to come to a consensus,\nthough.Dr. Hansen spent decades heading NASA’s climate research unit in\nManhattan, before retiring in 2013. He now heads a center created for him at\nColumbia University.He gained fame in 1988 when he warned Congress that global\nwarming had already begun.

With a kaleidoscope of talent — from elite\nrecruits to juniors, seniors and postgraduates — the A.C.C. has served notice\nthat it is built for the short and long run.“There’s so many kinds of systems\nand styles and the talent and the depth,” Bennett said of the conference. “It\nbattle-tests you. It can break you a little bit at times, but you see a lot,\nand it does toughen you up.”Virginia was one of four A.C.C. teams competing\nfor the last two Final Four spots. But this year, the conference also became\nthe first league to place six teams in the round of 16, and the first in\nN.C.A.A. tournament history to have at least five in the final 16 in\nconsecutive years.Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim, whose program was a pillar of\nthe Big East and is no stranger to the N.C.A.A. tournament, said that with a\nmore favorable approach to scheduling — for example, by not having lower-\nranked A.C.C. programs routinely play the conference’s top teams twice a\nseason — the A.C.C. might have put 10 teams in the tournament.At this rate,\nwould anyone really be surprised if one year soon the A.C.C. put together the\nfirst single-conference Final Four?Bennett was 16 in 1985, when the old Big\nEast nearly accomplished that feat by sending three teams — St. John’s,\nGeorgetown and Villanova — to the Final Four. The final was a classic, with\nVillanova improbably edging Georgetown.Villanova is back in the Final Four\nthis year, but the Big East is in rebuilding mode after being decimated by the\ndefections of several members during the recent wave of football-driven\nrealignment. Two former Big East members — Syracuse and Notre Dame — played\nunder the A.C.C. flag Sunday.That was more than symbolic. A large part of the\nA.C.C.’s success has been the result of an infusion of new blood from the old\nBig East: Boston College, Pittsburgh, Louisville, Notre Dame and Syracuse have\njoined in recent years. Another onetime Big East pillar, Connecticut, probably\nwishes it could join them.(Louisville could have been the A.C.C.’s eighth team\nin the tournament had it not imposed a postseason ban on itself.)I asked\nBoeheim, who was the Syracuse coach in 1985, whether this A.C.C. is as strong\nthe Big East was that year.“You know, they want me to say that, but you know I\ncan’t say that,” he said, smiling. “I was in that league 30 years. If I’m in\nthis league 30 years, then I might say that.”What’s encouraging about the\napproach to building programs at several A.C.C. universities — especially\nVirginia — is an emphasis on recruiting players who will remain in the program\nfor three to four seasons. I care less about the basketball than I do about\nending the obscene practice of having players on campus for a total of five\nmonths.Over the last seven years, Bennett has become a much-needed antidote to\nthe one-and-done model espoused by John Calipari and Kentucky. Bennett\npreaches building upon pillars, recruiting players just below the radar and\nthen keeping them, helping them improve and — ideally — reaping the reward. On\nSunday, it almost worked, until Syracuse ended the Cavaliers’ run with a 68-62\nwin in the Midwest Regional final.Virginia is an older team, starting two\nseniors, a junior and two sophomores.Syracuse was an even match, starting\nthree seniors, a junior and a freshman.“We haven’t ever been in a spot where\nwe could recruit one-and-done players,” Bennett said. “I so enjoy watching\nthese guys develop, and that’s made our team strong. I think if you’re going\nto get one-and-done players, you’d better be able to back that up and do it\nyear after year.”Bennett’s approach seems to be working: Virginia has won\nconsecutive A.C.C. regular-season titles. The ideal player for Bennett is a\nplayer like Malcolm Brogdon, a 6-foot-5 senior who persevered through a foot\ninjury to play a fifth year at Virginia.Asked what had led him to come back,\nBrogdon said that he had spoken with Bennett and that “it really struck me\nwhen he said I could have it all — I could finish my legacy here, I could do\nsomething special with my teammates the last year, and I could also get my\nmaster’s degree and just finish what I started.”Brogdon added: “I’m a guy\nthat’s all about not trying to take the easy way out or get out of things too\nearly. I want to finish out.”After five years of major programs trying to\nmatch Calipari’s one-and-done circus, it’s reassuring to see a university,\nperhaps even a conference, adopt and dominate with another approach: Stay the\ncourse, enjoy slow and steady growth and, with luck, reap the rewards in\nMarch.\n\n","title":"‘Big Boy League’ A.C.C.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01526"},"content":"USUALLY when companies come out with a new and improved formula, they want the\npublic to know. But when the item in question is an iconic food product, the\ncalculus gets tougher. Every marketer remembers with a shudder the cautionary\ntale of New Coke.So when Kraft Heinz reached inside the blue box to tweak the\nrecipe for its macaroni and cheese, it chose to whisper rather than shout the\nresults.A new formula that removed artificial preservatives and swapped out\nartificial dyes for a combination of paprika, annatto and turmeric had been\nunder development for three years, and last April Kraft announced that it\nplanned to make the switch. But when the reformulated version hit shelves in\nDecember, only customers paying careful attention to the ingredients listed on\nthe side of the box would have known. Even the orangeish color of the mac and\ncheese remained the same.“We’ve sold well over 50 million boxes with\nessentially no one noticing,” said Greg Guidotti, vice president for meal\nsolutions at Kraft Heinz.“This was absolutely brilliant of them to change it\nand not say anything,” said Lynn Dornblaser, director of innovation and\ninsight at the market research firm Mintel.Now Kraft is getting a little more\nvocal.A new ad campaign plays up the element of surprise involved with the\ncompany’s new mac and cheese formula, with 15- and 30-second broadcast and\nonline video spots featuring the former late-night television host Craig\nKilborn and the tag line, “It’s changed. But it hasn’t.”Kraft was concerned\nthat people would perceive a change in flavor that wasn’t really there if it\nmade too big a deal about the different formula as soon as it started using\nit. In fact, when the company made the announcement last spring that it would\nbe tweaking the ingredients, Mr. Guidotti said, people began posting on social\nmedia their concerns that the mac and cheese would taste different.“We knew we\nwanted to address that tension,” he said.Some on social media even said,\nshortly after the April announcement, that they thought the mac and cheese\ntasted different when, in reality, they were still eating the previous\nversion. This is a psychological quirk, well known to food manufacturers, that\ncan stymie well-meaning attempts to make processed foods healthier.“Anytime\nthere’s a suggestion of what something should taste like, some aspect of\ntaste, when we try that food, we’re looking for it,” said David Just, a\nprofessor of behavioral economics at Cornell University who is affiliated with\nthe Cornell Food and Brand Lab. “Whenever you have labels like ‘healthier’ or\n‘reformulated,’ people are looking for the absence of a taste they really\nlike.”Ms. Dornblaser added, “Normally, consumers are going to expect when\nthere’s going to be a reformulation of whatever kind, they’re going to expect\nit to taste different and to look different.”Overcoming such a hard-wired\npreconception required stealth.“Our first advice to them was not to tell\nanyone about it, which is unusual for an ad agency,” said Adam Chasnow, vice\npresident and executive creative director for Crispin Porter \u0026amp; Bogusky,\nKraft’s partner in developing the campaign. “We’re going to focus on the fact\nthat things are still the same.”In addition to the commercials with Mr.\nKilborn, the campaign includes a two-and-a-half-minute online video that takes\na more serious, documentary-style look at the change; digital display ads; and\npromotions through Pandora online radio, Snapchat and ESPN’s “SportsCenter.”\nPrint ads in 20 magazines, including Southern Living, US Weekly and Essence,\ncheekily tell readers things like, “We’d invite you to try it, but you already\nhave.”Kraft is also encouraging fans to post on social media with the hashtag\n#didntnotice by offering giveaways, including a pillow shaped like Kraft’s\ncurved macaroni noodle.Mr. Guidotti said that since the company revealed that\nit had been using the new formula for some time, customer feedback has been\ngenerally positive, although there was a spate of posts from customers\nclaiming that they actually had noticed the change. “When you say something,\npeople will say, ‘Oh yeah, I knew that,’ ” he said. “There’s psychology\ninvolved in there as well.”Before the campaign began, Kraft and Crispin Porter\n\u0026amp; Bogusky worried that a sharp-eyed fan or a food blogger would notice the\nchanges to the ingredients list and act as a spoiler.“We were always\nconcerned,” Mr. Guidotti said. “Should consumers find out sooner, we had\ncontingencies. We had a lot of different ways of launching our advertising\nsooner, launching our social sooner, having more specific responses.”None of\nthat proved to be necessary, not that Mr. Guidotti or his team are\ncomplaining.“I think we probably did five times as much work, but it was all\nworth it,” he said.\n\n","title":"Kraft Reveals Revamped Mac and Cheese, 50 Million Boxes Later - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Kraft Macaroni \u0026amp; Cheese reveals its new recipe — after 50 million boxes of it have already been sold https://t.co/S6Fh15nUPl","date":"Mon Mar 28 01:20:35 +0000 2016","favs":208,"id":{"$numberLong":"714260865487388672"},"retweets":121},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1q9OqUk"}

Less than 24 hours\nafter the bot, @TayandYou, went online Wednesday, Microsoft halted posting\nfrom the account and deleted several of its most obscene statements.The bot,\ndeveloped by Microsoft’s technology and research and Bing teams, got major\nassistance in being offensive from users who egged it on. It disputed the\nexistence of the Holocaust, referred to women and minorities with\nunpublishable words and advocated  genocide. Several of the tweets were sent\nafter users commanded the bot to repeat their own statements, and the bot\ndutifully obliged.But Tay, as the bot was named, also seemed to learn some bad\nbehavior on its own. According to The Guardian, it responded to a question\nabout whether the British actor Ricky Gervais is an atheist by saying: “ricky\ngervais learned totalitarianism from adolf hitler, the inventor of\natheism.”Microsoft, in an emailed statement, described the machine-learning\nproject as a social and cultural experiment.“Unfortunately, within the first\n24 hours of coming online, we became aware of a coordinated effort by some\nusers to abuse Tay’s commenting skills to have Tay respond in inappropriate\nways,” Microsoft said. “As a result, we have taken Tay offline and are making\nadjustments.”On a website it created for the bot, Microsoft said the\nartificial intelligence project had been designed to “engage and entertain\npeople” through “casual and playful conversation,” and that it was built\nthrough mining public data. It was targeted at 18- to 24-year-olds in the\nUnited States and was developed by a staff that included improvisational\ncomedians.Its Twitter bio described it as “Microsoft’s A.I. fam from the\ninternet that’s got zero chill!” (If you don’t understand any of that, don’t\nworry about it.)Most of the account’s tweets were innocuous, usually imitating\ncommon slang. When users tweeted at the account, it responded in seconds,\nsometimes as naturally as a human would but, in other cases, missing the\nmark.Tay follows a long history of attempts by humans to get machines to be\nour pals. In 1968, a professor at the M.I.T. taught a computer to respond\nconversationally in the role of a psychotherapist. Many 20- and 30-somethings\nhave fond memories of SmarterChild, a friendly bot on AOL Instant Messenger\nthat was always available for a chat when their friends were away.Now, Apple’s\nSiri, Amazon’s Alexa, Microsoft’s Cortana, Google Now and Hound mix search-by-\nvoice capabilities with attempted charm. The idea of a personable machine was\ntaken to its logical ending in the 2013 movie “Her,” in which a man played by\nJoaquin Phoenix falls in love with the voice in his phone.And this is not the\nfirst time automated technology has unexpectedly gotten a company in trouble.\nLast year, Google apologized for a flaw in Google Photos that let the\napplication label photos of black people as “gorillas.”\n\n","title":"Microsoft Created a Twitter Bot to Learn From Users.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0152a"},"content":"CHICAGO — Shortly before Coach Jim Boeheim cut down the net to celebrate a\nmost improbable victory, he grabbed a microphone and noted to the assembled\nfans that he had just witnessed the best comeback in Syracuse’s long, rich\nbasketball history.Boeheim could have been talking about his own comeback from\na nine-game suspension earlier in the season, during which the Orange stumbled\nto a 4-5 mark, and went 0-4 to open their Atlantic Coast Conference\nschedule.He also could have been discussing Syracuse’s late-season swoon, when\nit lost five of its last six games before accepting a controversial No. 10\nseed and a spot in the N.C.A.A. tournament, even with 13 losses.But in a\nseason in which Syracuse seemed to be left behind and labeled for elimination\nmore than once, it crafted its best comeback of all, the one Boeheim was\nreally talking about.Trailing by 15 points with 9 minutes 32 seconds left in\nthe game, Syracuse went on a blistering run to beat No. 1 Virginia, 68-62, in\nthe Midwest Regional final at United Center and reach the Final Four for the\nfifth time under Boeheim. The Orange will play North Carolina in a national\nsemifinal Saturday night in Houston.“It’s the best comeback I’ve seen at\nSyracuse,” Boeheim said after the game. “I haven’t been there forever, but 56\nyears. It’s the best comeback we’ve ever had.”Syracuse (23-13), which last\nmade the Final Four in 2013, became the fourth double-digit seed to reach the\nFinal Four and the first since 11th-seeded Virginia Commonwealth in 2011.But\nit would not have happened if Malachi Richardson had not shaken off a\nmiserable first half to lead Syracuse with 23 points, 21 of them in the second\nhalf on 6-for-11 shooting, including three 3-pointers.Richardson, the 6-foot-6\nfreshman from Trenton, N.J., had missed all five of his shots in the first\nhalf and appeared passive. In one sequence, he angered Boeheim by passing up a\nmakable shot and then soon after by absent-mindedly stepping on the end\nline.Boeheim chewed out Richardson when he removed him from the game, using\nterms Richardson said were not suitable for publication. Then, when Syracuse\ncame into the locker room at halftime, Boeheim lit into him again.Syracuse,\ntrailing by 16 after Virginia’s Anthony Gill dunked to open the second half,\nemployed a press to force some important turnovers and change the pace of the\ngame. It also shut down London Perrantes, who had scored 15 first-half points\nwith five 3-pointers. But he scored only 3 points in the second half on 1 for\n4 shooting.But the most important change for Syracuse was to get the offense\ngoing by taking the ball aggressively to the basket and then making some\ncritical 3-pointers.With Syracuse trailing, 56-43, with 8:32 to play,\nRichardson scored 14 of the Orange’s 21 points over the next five minutes. He\nhit a pair of free throws, then a couple of layups, scored on a putback of his\nown miss, added a steal and nailed three 3-pointers in a handful of\npossessions that gave Syracuse a 64-58 lead with 3:27 to play.Tyler Lydon, a\nfreshman who drained a 3-pointer in the first half after his shoe came off,\nalso hit a clutch 3-pointer during that sequence, to draw Syracuse to within\none possession, 58-55, with 6:50 to play.By that time, Syracuse had yanked\nmomentum into its favor, and it would never relinquish it as Virginia\ncollapsed.The Orange took the lead for good on a layup by Richardson that made\nit 59-58 with 5:50 to go, and then put the clamps on Virginia’s rattled\noffense.With 1:49 to play, Gill moved forcefully inside to finally score for\nVirginia, ending a scoring drought that had lasted 5:43.Syracuse led, 64-60,\nand time began to fritter away. With 26.9 seconds to play, Virginia’s Malcolm\nBrogdon hit a pair of free throws, and Syracuse’s lead was down to a basket,\n64-62.Syracuse came back up the floor and got the ball to Michael Gbinije, who\nwas fouled with 25.2 seconds left. He hit one of two free throws. The score\nwas 65-62, and Virginia still had a chance. But Devon Hall missed an open\n3-pointer with 14 seconds left, and Lydon grabbed the last of his six\nrebounds. He was fouled and hit both of his free throws, essentially icing the\ngame.All that was left was to cut down the nets on another victory that nobody\nthought Syracuse could achieve.And it was not even the first time that day\nthat Syracuse had reached a Final Four.The women’s team made it earlier Sunday\nby defeating Tennessee in the regional final in Sioux Falls, S.D.Before the\nmen’s tournament began, some critics said the Syracuse team had no business\nmaking it into the tournament at all, and then fortune was on its side when\nMichigan State, a top team on its side of the bracket, was upset.But after it\nbeat Virginia, a top-tier team trying to return to the Final Four for the\nfirst time since 1984, there was nothing left for critics to say.“I thought we\ndeserved to be in the tournament,” Boeheim said. “But certainly I wasn’t\nplanning on getting to the Final Four. We tell the players, if you can win one\ngame, you get another chance. They’ve done that.”\n\n","title":"Seeded 10th, Syracuse Is One of the Last Four Left - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTSports: Syracuse beats Virginia, 68-62, and its unlikely run continues with a trip to the Final Four https://t.co/L29bNSmy9j https:/…","date":"Mon Mar 28 00:24:27 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714246741328064512"},"retweets":133},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21O9Wtq"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0152c"},"content":"LOS ANGELES — California lawmakers have reached a tentative deal to raise the\nstate minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022, potentially signaling the biggest\nadvance yet in a campaign to increase pay for low-income workers that has\nreverberated in the Democratic presidential contest and in cities across the\ncountry.If approved, California would become the first state to adopt a $15 an\nhour minimum wage. A measure to impose a $15 statewide minimum wage in New\nYork is under negotiation in Albany.Under the tentative California deal —\nwhich could be announced as soon as Monday — the wage, which was raised to $10\nan hour on Jan. 1, would increase incrementally to $15 over the next six\nyears. Small businesses would have an extra year to comply.Advocates for the\nhigher wage hailed the California legislation, describing it as a major\nvictory that would propel similar efforts nationally.“This is a very big\ndeal,” said Paul K. Sonn, the general counsel to the National Employment Law\nProject, a national research and advocacy group on wages. “It would mean a\nraise for one of every three workers in the state.”The movement has gained\ntraction in a dozen cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle.\nLast week, the mayor of Washington proposed raising the minimum wage to $15 by\n2020.In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is pushing for a $15 minimum wage in\nNew York City by the beginning of 2019 and statewide by July 2021. Mr. Cuomo,\na Democrat who has previously raised wages to $15 for state workers and fast-\nfood employees, was attempting to broker a deal with the State Senate, which\nis led by Republicans who remain wary of the potential economic effect of the\nwage, particularly in long-suffering areas upstate.The deal comes as raising\nthe minimum wage has become a central point of contention in the Democratic\npresidential contest. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator running for the\nDemocratic nomination, has made a $15 federal minimum wage a central plank in\nhis campaign; it is now $7.25 an hour.His opponent, Hillary Clinton, has\ncalled for a $12 federal minimum wage, but has said she supports efforts in\nsome cities and states to pass a $15 minimum wage. She has resisted pressure\nto support a $15 federal minimum wage.Gov. Jerry Brown of California, a\nDemocrat, backed raising the minimum wage in 2013, when legislation passed\nincreasing it to $10. He has since resisted efforts to raise it again,\nexpressing concern that another increase could cost the state billions of\ndollars of wages and hurt the state’s business climate.Under the latest deal,\nthe wage would increase to $10.50 at the beginning of 2017 and escalate\nsteadily until reaching $15 by 2022.The deal was outlined on Sunday by\nofficials who had been briefed on the legislation and who requested anonymity\nto discuss a measure that had not yet been announced. Mr. Brown’s office did\nnot immediately respond to requests for comment. Aides to lawmakers involved\nin the effort said they could not comment until a final deal was announced.The\ntentative deal came after union leaders moved to take the issue to voters this\nNovember. An initiative to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2021,\nwhich would peg future increases to inflation, qualified for the ballot last\nweek. Union leaders have the authority to withdraw the initiative, presuming\nthey are satisfied with the new legislation.“If a California minimum wage bill\npasses and is signed into law by the governor, we will take a careful look at\nit, and our executive board will decide what to do with our ballot\ninitiative,” said Steve Trossman, a spokesman for the Service Employees\nInternational Union-United Healthcare Workers West.The ultimate sweep of any\nNew York legislation remains unclear. But Mr. Sonn said that if both these\nstates act, as appears likely, it would have a dramatic effect, given their\nsize.“The scale of having both New York and California would reverse years of\nfalling wages and result in very substantial wage growth for workers at the\nbottom,” he said.\n\n","title":"California Nears Deal to Adopt a $15 State Minimum Wage - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"California Nears Deal to Adopt a $15 State Minimum Wage https://t.co/6aUSoNNeBq","date":"Mon Mar 28 00:10:51 +0000 2016","favs":325,"id":{"$numberLong":"714243318192988161"},"retweets":177},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21O9DPi"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0152d"},"content":"“Hmm … I’ll have what she’s having,” I thought last week as I watched the\nSaint Laurent spring runway show online, the model’s ball-bearing hips\nsheathed in a black latex bodysuit.A true believer, I lost no time tracking\ndown its slick approximation, zipping myself into it and styling it with some\nvintage Chanel tweeds.When I worked up the nerve to wear it, reactions were\nswift and incisive. “Is it Wang?” a friend asked brightly. “Vuitton?” another\ninquired.As is happened, I had plucked that much-coveted swathe of rubber-and-\nraunch straight off the rack at Purple Passion, a cavelike emporium in Chelsea\ntrading in leather-wrapped paddles, harnesses, spiked chokers and demonic\nmasks that might have wandered off the set of “Eyes Wide Shut.”Nice way to add\na little kick to a sadly fatigued wardrobe, I assured myself as I made my\nselection.This has been a year, after all, in which sex-shop chic infiltrated\nthe runways, asserting its status as a kind of kinky perma trend, one that,\nlike nautical stripes or safari suits, has woven itself inextricably into the\nfabric of fashion.Lightly veiled, domesticated variations on fetish wear\nemerged last September on the spring 2016 runways of unlikely designers like\nCarolina Herrera, where a faintly recognizable harness embellished an\notherwise pristine white dress, and Marissa Webb, who showed an airy spring\ndress with a curious hybrid of leather porn-shop harness and fishing vest.Ms.\nWebb likes to wear that harness herself, usually over a black blazer. “But\nhere’s to anyone who wants to wear it over nothing at all,” she said.Kink\nreturned in force at the fall 2016 shows this year, with lace-up corsets, wet-\nlook bodysuits and leggings, corsets, fishnet hose and pole-dancing pumps\nshimmying their way into the collections of Alexander Wang, Hood by Air,\nPrada, Balmain, Marc Jacobs and Vetements, to name but an influential few.Ms.\nWebb incorporated a sex-shop reference in high-waist trousers that were nipped\nat the midsection for a corseted effect. Subtly or overtly, she said, “a\nfetish influence is always part of fashion.”Designers have repeatedly gone\nback to that once-forbidden well, with Mr. Jacobs in particular revisiting a\ntheme he explored most memorably in his fall 2011 collection for Louis\nVuitton.“I wanted severity and fetish,” Mr. Jacobs said at that time of his\nstrokeable fur purses, patent-leather bustiers and masks. His aim was to break\ndown and recombine hallowed dress codes and “make them a bit caricature.”In\nother, more repressive times, Mr. Jacobs’s steamy little numbers may have made\nsome people squirm. Today they are so deeply embedded in the popular culture\nthat they have been all but stripped of their dark associations.So inured have\nconsumers become, said Robbie Sinclair, the women’s wear editor of the New\nYork trend-forecasting service WGSN, “that when people see a rubber pencil\nskirt, nobody bats an eyelid.” Indeed, early adopters have incorporated the\nlook into their daily arsenal of chic.“Women are more aware than ever of the\nimplications of an O-ring, leather harness choker necklaces, vinyl skirts or\nplatform boots,” said Connie Wang, the fashion features director of\nRefinery29, a shopping site that recently offered a pair of velvet bondage\ncuffs. If customers are for the most part unfazed, Ms. Wang said that it is\nbecause “porn and its related aesthetic have become mainstream, full stop.”The\ntrend’s subversive allure was certainly not lost on the college-age women who\nthronged the Pink Pussycat in Greenwich Village on a recent Sunday, raiding\ntables and shelves piled with fishnet bodysuits, filigreed harnesses,\nrhinestone-covered shackles and strap-on accessories in 50 shades of\npink.Dressing like a dominatrix may seem pretty innocuous to worshipers at the\naltar of pop idols like Kim Kardashian, who has embraced peach-tone latex as\ncocktail attire; Rita Ora, who flaunted her curves in sickly pink latex; or\nTaylor Swift, who, for the filming last year of “Bad Blood,” her racy girl-\npower music video, laced herself into a clam-colored latex corset from a high-\nend Los Angeles sex shop.Not everyone, of course, is entirely on board. When\nMs. Swift was photographed last summer wearing a harness to a Hollywood lunch,\nTwitter virtually imploded, reactions varying from sputtering disdain to\nunconcealed hostility. Nonetheless, the look is a commonplace, so ubiquitous\nthat less-worldly consumers may well be challenged to pinpoint its ultimate\nsource.For many young women, the sex-shop look has become a fashion fallback,\n“a kind of classic,” said David Wolfe, a creative director of the Doneger\nGroup, the New York trend forecasting firm. Some retreat routinely to the\nreassuring familiarity of fishnet hose, tight T-shirts and pole-dancing shoes,\nhe pointed out, but are rarely aware of their lineage.“People only get as far\nback as tracing this to rock ’n’ roll,” Mr. Wolfe said. “They don’t realize\nthat the rock ’n’ roll look had had its roots in a period when rock people\nstarted raiding porn shops for their wardrobes.”He was referring to the\ntrend’s historical antecedents in the fetish emporiums of London’s seamier\nback streets, stores that were mined by the original punkers for their strappy\nbondage trousers, spiky leather chokers, strap-festooned trousers and\nschoolgirl plaid skirts.And that’s to say nothing of Madonna, who in earlier\ncareer incarnations embraced fetish-wear as a second skin, contributing\nimmeasurably to the steady erosion of boundaries between fashion and\nfetishism.Over the years sex-shop chic has made regular incursions into\nconventional wardrobes, in the form of catsuits, rump-clutching lace or\nleather trousers and stiletto-heel, thigh-high boots.“Whether they’re inspired\nby a runway show being live-streamed or someone’s Instagram feed, a much\nhigher number of people are feeling inspired to try something more daring,”\nsaid Alexandra Popa, the founder of Bordelle, a London lingerie shop and\nwebsite with a brisk business in dog-collar chokers.Fashion marketers have\ntraded on that fascination, construction sites plastered with images of models\nin tie-me-up tops (IRO) and chains (Alexander Wang). This year Diesel saw fit\nto introduce its underwear campaign online on Pornhub/YouPorn, as part of its\nforay into digital advertising.Television, too, has lately exploited the\nintrigue of latex and leather. Such trappings feature in “Billions,“ a\nShowtime drama in which Paul Giamatti as the United States attorney battling\nWall Street corruption engages with his wife (Maggie Siff) in BDSM role-\nplay.Others mine the style for laughs, as did Vogue, in its February issue,\nwith a leather-clad Ben Stiller, the hapless antihero of “Zoolander 2,”\nsaddled up and propped on all fours as a camera-toting Penélope Cruz (the\nfilm’s sharp-eyed investigator) looked on.Sure, it was all in good fun, yet\nanother indication that, among a large segment of the population, such\ninstances of erotic aggression have been rendered as tame as a terrier.\nWatered-down versions of raunch wear are standard issue at the mall. Seen at\nstores like Hot Topic or Forever 21, often in tones of mint or pink, “they\nlook wearable,” said Mr. Sinclair, the trend forecaster. “Pastel tints give\nthem a more commercial vibe.”Still, when style-world influencers insist on\nauthenticity (the kink-wear equivalent of a Perfecto biker jacket), many now\nturn to naughty lingerie boutiques, hard-core leather outlets and upscale\nfetish specialists like Fleet Ilya, Atsuko Kudo and Chromat for their vinyl\nskirts, cage petticoats, bondage bras and PVC leggings.“Harnesses are probably\nour biggest sellers,” said Max Gregory, the owner of the Leather Man, the\nvenerable sex shop on Christopher Street. “A lot of women, especially models\nand stylists, come in and put them with whatever they’re wearing.”“People will\nwear the restraint cuffs as a fashion piece,” he said. Any lingering sense of\nshame has dissipated along the way.“Women are incorporating fetish wear into\ntheir style in ways that are much more mix-and-match, and less obvious than\nbefore,” said Ms. Wang of Refinery29. “They’re pairing their patent thigh-\nhighs with oversize sweatshirts and frowzy dresses.”At Tic Tac Toe, the Pink\nPussycat’s sister store on West Fourth Street, jeweled handcuffs, pastel tutus\nand black patent pumps perched on four-inch platform soles attract a mostly\nfemale weekend clientele, a sales clerk said.Among the shop’s more eye-\ncatching attractions last week was a pair of thigh-high red vinyl boots,\nringers for those that stalked the Dior runway last spring, but at $99, a\nbargain for sure.Reader, I bought them.\n\n","title":"Raiding the Sex Shop for the Latest Fashion - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Sex-shop chic has infiltrated the runways https://t.co/q8vj0pOLOB https://t.co/hGk7ZHsT5X","date":"Sun Mar 27 23:53:01 +0000 2016","favs":275,"id":{"$numberLong":"714238827779457025"},"retweets":115},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21NSDsC"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0152f"},"content":"Asked during a January debate why he trailed Hillary Clinton so badly among\nminority voters, Senator Bernie Sanders said he would gain ground once those\nvoters became familiar with his track record and agenda on the economy and\ncriminal justice.Two months later and on the eve of another important primary\nvoting day, Mr. Sanders remains on the wrong side of a yawning gap among\nAfrican-Americans even as his performance among whites has been impressive.One\nimportant reason for this may be that African-Americans have experienced\nsomewhat more favorable economic trends in recent years. While still worse off\nthan whites, African-Americans have seen their jobless rate fall a little\nfurther than whites have, relative to a prerecession average. Furthermore, the\ndecline has been faster for African-Americans in the last year.The economist\nRobert J. Shapiro recently measured the income growth that people experience\nas they age. He found that, on average in 2013 and 2014 (the most recent data\navailable), incomes for blacks in their 30s, 40s and 50s grew more rapidly\nthan for whites in the same age group. Older people, who strongly support Mrs.\nClinton, have also seen income gains relative to other groups since the\nrecession.Still, the economic data is sufficiently tentative and murky that it\nis unlikely to tell the full story.That is all the more true given the stark\ndifference between Mr. Sanders’s performance among working-class whites and\nAfrican-Americans. Typically in Democratic primaries, insurgent liberal\ncandidates fail to make significant inroads in either of these groups. But Mr.\nSanders carried white working-class voters by large margins in states like\nIllinois, Massachusetts, Michigan and New Hampshire. He nearly tied Mrs.\nClinton among white working-class voters in states where he otherwise lost\nbadly, such as Florida and Ohio.Moreover, Mr. Sanders has done so while facing\nsome of the same disadvantages that weigh him down with African-Americans: low\nname recognition and the group’s longstanding affection for the Clinton\nfamily. Recent polling shows that Bill Clinton’s favorability rating among\nworking-class white Democrats is roughly equivalent to his rating among\nAfrican-Americans.Perhaps a better explanation for Mr. Sanders’s divergent\nperformance is that while African-Americans and white working-class Democrats\nare experiencing broadly similar economic trends, they interpret them\ndifferently.A New York Times/CBS News poll conducted last week found that\nAfrican-Americans rated the economy as good by a ratio of about four to one,\nversus about two to one for white Democrats and an even narrower margin for\nwhite Democrats without a college degree. A Times/CBS News poll in December\nfound that, relative to two years earlier, roughly three times as many\nAfrican-Americans said their family’s financial situation was better as said\nit was worse, while Democrats without a college degree were almost evenly\nsplit on this question.Geoff Garin, a strategist for Mrs. Clinton’s 2008\ncampaign who currently polls for Priorities USA Action, a pro-Clinton “super\nPAC,” posited that for a more economically marginal group like African-\nAmericans, the unemployment rate — which has declined significantly for all\nracial groups in recent years — carries more importance than growth in incomes\nand certain assets, which have been slower to recover. For whites, even\nworking-class whites, whose jobless rate is substantially lower than that for\nAfrican-Americans, the latter took on comparatively more importance.“The major\nsource of economic anxiety for working-class white men is not whether they\nhave a job tomorrow,” Mr. Garin said, “it’s that they still haven’t had their\npersonal recovery. Their recovery is about assets and income.” For African-\nAmericans, on the other hand, “you don’t take job growth for granted.”He cited\npolling data showing that working-class white Democrats were roughly as\nconcerned about inequality as they were about job growth and economic growth,\nwhile African-Americans were overwhelmingly concerned about the latter two. It\nis no surprise, Mr. Garin said, that Mrs. Clinton, who has had a similar\nemphasis in her campaign, did better among African-Americans, while Mr.\nSanders’s emphasis on inequality resonated more with whites.In a similar vein,\nthere is anecdotal evidence suggesting that African-Americans and Hispanic\nvoters are more likely to use the economy’s recent low point, in 2008 and\n2009, as the base line for their judgment than are whites, who may focus on\nmore recent performance, where improvement has been less pronounced.David\nSimas, the White House political director, recalled sitting in on focus groups\nwhen he worked for the 2012 Obama campaign for ads that began by reminding\nvoters how bleak the economy had been when Barack Obama first took office.\n“The folks who responded to it the most were African-Americans and Hispanic\nvoters,” he said.Willie Minor, an African-American actor in Dallas, who runs a\nsmall theater company, recalled that in 2009, “I called all my lenders and\ncreditors, asked for extensions, made partial payments, things like that.” He\nsaid that since then, thanks in part to increased revenue from the company’s\nproductions, he has “been more secure financially.”The Affordable Care Act may\nbe another aspect of President Obama’s economic record that minority voters\nand working-class whites view differently. “Blacks and Hispanics benefited\nmore from the A.C.A.,” said Simon Rosenberg, president of NDN, a policy and\nadvocacy group. “It was a really dramatic lowering of their uninsured rate,\nwhich was obviously material to their economic health and their overall\ncomfort in the world.”Mr. Minor said that while he received his health care\nthrough the Department of Veterans Affairs, many of his friends “had no\ninsurance and no possibility of getting insurance.”“Obamacare has been a boon\nto them,” he said.By contrast, many whites, who were insured at a higher rate\nthan the other groups before the Affordable Care Act took effect, saw the\nprogram as detrimental to their interests. “The promise of Obamacare was to\nmake it more affordable for everybody,” said J. J. Price, a firefighter and\nunion member in Roanoke, Va., who voted for Mr. Obama in 2008 but Mitt Romney\nin 2012. “It’s done nothing but make it more expensive on us, the working\nclass.”Mrs. Clinton, of course, has been a dogged defender of the Affordable\nCare Act, while Mr. Sanders has dwelled on the program’s not going far enough.\nHe prefers a single-payer system akin to expanding Medicare for the entire\npopulation.The dynamic on the Affordable Care Act suggests a broader\ndifference when it comes to African-Americans and working-class whites: When\nMr. Sanders implicitly criticizes Mr. Obama from the left, white working-class\nDemocrats may see it as advocating for their economic interests, but the\nclaims tend to fall flat with many blacks, among whom the president is still\nwildly popular.Larry Cohen, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders and past president\nof the Communications Workers of America, said that Mrs. Clinton’s perceived\nloyalty to the administration, as well as the nearly uniform support for Mrs.\nClinton within the black political establishment, especially in the South,\nwere key factors in limiting Mr. Sanders’s support among African-\nAmericans.Others largely agree. “I don’t think you can discount how important\nPresident Obama is,” said Stanley B. Greenberg, a former Clinton White House\npollster who recently conducted focus groups with African-American voters in\nPhiladelphia and Cleveland. “Obama and his election and re-election is seen as\non a scale of what the civil rights movement achieved.”He added that Mrs.\nClinton, by way of her service in the administration and her eagerness to\ndefend the president’s policies on the campaign trail, “is seen as having a\nmore instinctive identification with Obama.”\n\n","title":"Why Sanders Trails Clinton Among Minority Voters - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Why Bernie Sanders trails Hillary Clinton among minority voters https://t.co/ROhJbYeB1j https://t.co/okBxrCsOt1","date":"Sun Mar 27 23:25:34 +0000 2016","favs":330,"id":{"$numberLong":"714231921564327937"},"retweets":164},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SfbJmp"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01530"},"content":"MEDIA, Pa. — In 1997, Ted Cruz was a young lawyer on the climb when a pressing\nfamily matter pulled him to a seedy motel outside Philadelphia.His half sister\nMiriam Cruz was living there, spiraling deeper into drug addiction. She was\nneglecting her young son. And Mr. Cruz was determined to steer her back on\ntrack.With a “really studious schoolboy look,” Mr. Cruz walked up the steps of\nthe motel, his appearance notable at a place where rooms rented by the hour\nand unsavory characters lurked behind drawn curtains, said Michael Gunning,\nMs. Cruz’s boyfriend at the time.But after a long lunch with Mr. Cruz and\ntheir father, Rafael Cruz, Ms. Cruz was unmoved, Mr. Gunning said. Within\nmonths, she and Mr. Gunning were arrested at the motel for fighting with\nseveral men during a drug deal. In their room, a police report noted, officers\nfound two crack pipes.With his sharp intellect and steely resolve, Ted Cruz\nhas propelled himself through one accomplishment after another: Princeton,\nHarvard Law, a Supreme Court clerkship, the United States Senate, and now a\nstrong contender for the Republican presidential nomination.But as his life\nwas taking off, his half sister’s was going in the opposite direction, a\nsnowballing misery of bad choices, bad luck and, most of all, a losing battle\nwith drugs.Through her Mr. Cruz became acquainted with a world far from the\ntowers of the Ivy League and the corridors of power — so far that several of\nMs. Cruz’s friends interviewed recently did not even know Mr. Cruz was running\nfor president.He fielded phone calls from his half sister when she landed in\njail. He kept tabs on her as she bounced from boyfriend to boyfriend, job to\njob, and in and out of rehab. He took a particular interest in making sure\nthat her son was cared for, including taking out a large credit card advance\nto send him to a military-themed boarding school. Ms. Cruz, friends said, came\nto look up to her younger half brother and to rely on his help.But Mr. Cruz,\naccustomed to achieving everything he set his mind to, also learned the limits\nof what he could accomplish. Despite periods of sobriety, Ms. Cruz continued\nin her drug abuse and arrests until 2011, when she died of an accidental\noverdose in a bedroom strewn with prescription pill bottles.“This is a problem\nthat for me I understand firsthand,” Mr. Cruz said during a presidential\ndebate when asked about the country’s drug epidemic. He then pressed his case\nfor strengthening the border to, in part, stem the flow of illegal drugs.But\nat a less guarded moment, during a forum on addiction in New Hampshire last\nmonth, Mr. Cruz was uncharacteristically introspective.“You know as a family,\nyou wonder, ‘Could I have done more?’” he said. “Was there a way to pull her\nback? Was there a way to change the path she was on? Those are the questions\nyou never fully answer.”Mr. Cruz declined to be interviewed for this article\nabout his half sister. But in his memoir, “A Time for Truth,” and occasionally\nduring the campaign, Mr. Cruz has spoken of his relationship with Miriam, one\nof two daughters from his father’s first marriage.Miriam was a frequent\nvisitor to Rafael Cruz’s new family, letting his toddler son Ted, nine years\nyounger, pull on her hair and play with her for hours.As a teenager, Ted would\nsometimes spend the night with Miriam and her husband, Larry Maykopet, who\nlived a few blocks away from the Cruz home in Houston, Mr. Maykopet said.Mr.\nCruz said in his book that Mr. Maykopet physically abused Ms. Cruz. Friends of\nMs. Cruz’s said she told them the same thing.In an interview, Mr. Maykopet\nsaid he had never abused Ms. Cruz. He said their relationship ended in 1987, a\ncouple of years after their son, Joseph Maykopet, was born, when he returned\nto his native Illinois to serve a prison sentence. In 1993, they divorced.By\nthat time, Ms. Cruz and their young son were settled in Delaware County, Pa.,\noutside Philadelphia. At first, they enjoyed a stable life. Ms. Cruz had a\nwell-paying office job, and was in a relationship with a caring postal worker,\nsaid Dawn Dyer, a close friend of Ms. Cruz’s.Ms. Cruz also liked to have fun.\nShe and Ms. Dyer would go to karaoke bars, where Ms. Cruz, a petite woman with\nlong hair, would belt out “La Bamba” and sip on Seagram’s and 7Up.“She was so\nsweet and full of life,” Ms. Dyer recalled.But, Ms. Dyer said, after two car\naccidents that left Ms. Cruz in relentless pain, she became addicted to\nprescription medication.Ms. Cruz met Mr. Gunning when both were patients in a\nrehabilitation center in Media, Pa.“She was 10 pounds of dynamite packed in a\none-pound box,” Mr. Gunning said.Once out of rehab, they united in their abuse\nof a variety of drugs.“We were just looking to fill an empty spot and void in\nour lives,” said Mr. Gunning, a mechanic who said he had since recovered from\ndrug addiction.Ms. Cruz began a pattern of arrests, primarily for shoplifting,\nand stints behind bars, police and court records show.Lanne Kowal, who\nreceived a police citation in 1998 for stealing Tylenol from a Quality\nDiscount Store with Ms. Cruz, recalled driving her in her red Pontiac Firebird\ninto Philadelphia, where they would sell stolen items, and buy and do heroin\nin a part of the city known as the Badlands.“We would cop, drive out of the\nneighborhood a little bit, and pull over where we could in a desolate area,”\nsaid Ms. Kowal, who changed her name from Lynne Ann Margadonna and said she\nstopped using drugs 18 years ago.In 1997, Mr. Cruz, after a year clerking with\nChief Justice William H. Rehnquist, joined the Washington law firm Cooper,\nCarvin \u0026amp; Rosenthal.Sometime that year, he and his father drove to\nPhiladelphia, he later wrote, “leaving our watches, rings, money, and wallets\nin D.C., because we didn’t know if we’d be robbed or shot at the crack house\nwhere Miriam was living.”(The motel was certainly shady, Mr. Gunning said, but\nit was not a crack house.)But when Mr. Cruz and his father took her to a\nnearby Denny’s, Mr. Cruz wrote, they could not get through to her.Ms. Cruz was\nhopelessly angry, he wrote in “A Time for Truth.”“Angry that her parents\ndivorced when she was a little girl, angry that her father missed a high\nschool swim meet of hers.”“I wasn’t terribly understanding,” he added,\nrecounting his tough-love approach. “I pointed out to her that our aunt, Tia\nSonia, had experienced far worse — horrific things in a Cuban jail — and yet\nshe raised our Cousin Bibi as a single mom. I told Miriam she needed to stop\nwallowing in self-pity and do what was needed for her son.”Unable to steer Ms.\nCruz out of addiction, Mr. Cruz focused on helping her son. Taking out a\n$20,000 advance on his credit card, he enrolled Joseph in Valley Forge\nMilitary Academy in Wayne, Pa., hoping that the boarding school would instill\ndiscipline and order in the boy’s life.Ms. Kowal recalled meeting Mr. Cruz at\none of Joseph’s school events she attended with Ms. Cruz.“He didn’t say much\nto me or her,” Ms. Kowal said. “I remember her saying, ‘That’s my brother,\nthat’s the one putting Joey through school.’”“But their relationship was not\nthat touchy-feely type of relationship you’d expect from siblings,” she\nadded.Ms. Dyer, Ms. Cruz’s close friend, said she and her husband assumed\ntemporary guardianship of Joseph with Ms. Cruz’s permission.Ms. Cruz “knew at\nthat time she wasn’t in the right situation for her son,” she said. And\nJoseph, bullied at his new school, left Valley Forge after one year, she\nsaid.Mr. Cruz kept tabs on Joseph, Ms. Dyer said, and sent gifts and money for\nhis clothes.There were glimmers of hope. Ms. Cruz went through stretches of\ngetting off drugs, her friends said. Years later, she and Joseph resumed\nliving together.It was Joseph, then 25, who found her dead in their\nCollingdale, Pa., home in January 2011, according to a Collingdale police\nreport.In the bedroom where she died, the police found a “handbag spilled out\nonto the bed in front of the deceased along with numerous prescription\nbottles.”The Delaware County medical examiner determined Ms. Cruz died of\n“mixed prescription drug intoxication” and ruled the death an accident.At the\ndrug addiction forum last month in New Hampshire, Mr. Cruz recalled learning\nof Ms. Cruz’s death.“We just got the call one day that Miriam was gone,” he\nsaid. “These tragedies are happening in human lives all over this country.\nIt’s the human journey. It’s not an easy one.”At the same time, Mr. Cruz told\nthe forum that some stories of addiction have happy endings. A contrast to\nMiriam, he said, was their father.His heavy drinking was a reason for his\ndivorce from Miriam’s mother (who died in 2013), and it led him to abandon Ted\nand his mother for a time.But then his father found religion and turned his\nlife around, Mr. Cruz said. His father, he said, has not had a drink in 40\nyears.The elder Mr. Cruz, a preacher, now travels the country campaigning for\nhis son.Ted Cruz’s nephew, meanwhile, appeared with him in a campaign video\nposted on YouTube. Mr. Maykopet spoke of life with his troubled mother and of\nthe man who kept watch over him from afar.“With guidance from my Uncle Ted and\nthe rest of my family, I was able to get past that part of my life,” Mr.\nMaykopet said. “My Uncle Ted has been a huge inspiration for me ever since I\nwas younger — just to progress, and just to keep moving forward.”\n\n","title":"Despite Efforts, Ted Cruz Was Unable to Steer Half Sister Back on Track - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"As Ted Cruz's life was taking off, his half sister's was going in the opposite direction https://t.co/n9DHslBEyx https://t.co/05W6gfVfhO","date":"Sun Mar 27 23:13:48 +0000 2016","favs":183,"id":{"$numberLong":"714228959215489028"},"retweets":97},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25ribjV"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01531"},"content":"An urbane, soft-spoken former auto executive, Aldo Bozzi does not fit the mold\nof a driven Manhattan restaurateur — much less one who almost single-handedly,\nif inadvertently, set off a restaurant revolution in the United States and\nbeyond.And Mezzaluna, his colorful and cacophonous little trattoria on the\nUpper East Side, hardly seems the setting for any kind of upheaval. Yet in a\nfresh and unassuming way, it introduced a style of modern Italian dining that\nstill informs restaurants today, from Mario Batali’s new La Sirena in\nManhattan to the much lauded Poggio Trattoria in Sausalito, Calif.“I never\nimagined I would be doing this, and 30 years later,” Mr. Bozzi, 75, said\nrecently over lunch at Mezzaluna. “When I started, I simply wanted to have a\nplace that served the kind of food I was accustomed to growing up in\nItaly.”That kind of food was found in classic trattorias, which are ubiquitous\ntoday. But in 1984, when Mezzaluna opened, they were all but unknown in this\ncountry.“When I first visited Mezzaluna, I felt so excited that New York at\nlast had a genuine Milanese trattoria,” said Danny Meyer, the president of\nUnion Square Hospitality Group and a crusader for authentic Italian cooking at\nMaialino, Marta and other restaurants. This was a year before Mr. Meyer\nstarted his company with the debut of Union Square Cafe. “The success of\nMezzaluna reinforced my confidence in the direction we were heading.”Back\nthen, most Italian restaurants in Manhattan came in two flavors: old-style red\nsauce spots, and fancy Frenchified salons sporting tuxedoed captains, leather\nbanquettes, elegant flatware and menus the size of a small-town phone book. Il\nMonello, Il Nido, Tre Scalini, Barbetta — all are gone except Barbetta.The\ncooking at many of these high-end dining rooms focused largely on the\nclassics, embracing gastronomic barbells like béchamel-bound lasagna,\nfettuccine Alfredo and spaghetti alla carbonara in bounteous portions.A\ntraditional trattoria, on the other hand, is small, family-run, assiduously\nlocal, inexpensive and features exceptional ingredients served by authentic\nItalian people not wearing tuxedos. Attempting to define today’s urban\niteration is like trying to describe the average automobile: It can be sleek,\nstylish and fast; modest, dependable and leisurely; or even homey.Several\nreputable restaurateurs took a stab at the trattoria format in the early days:\nat Trattoria da Alfredo, Nanni and, most notably, the celebrity clubhouse Da\nSilvano, which opened in 1975 and still thrives. But none rallied a culinary\nuprising the way Mezzaluna did.“Aldo succeeded because he saw that there was a\nfundamental transformation going on in our society at the time,” said Piero\nSelvaggio, owner of the luxurious Valentino restaurant in Santa Monica, Calif.\nMr. Selvaggio pointed to the new wave of Italian immigrants in the early\n1980s.“They were better educated,” he said. “They had a different lifestyle,\ndifferent tastes, and Mezzaluna captured that.” (In 1985, Mr. Selvaggio opened\na trattoria called Primi, in Santa Monica, which he sold in 2001.)With a\ndegree from one of Milan’s elite business schools, Mr. Bozzi joined the Alfa\nRomeo company in 1965. Three years later, he was dispatched to New York, where\nhe rose to president of North American operations. During this time, he\ntraveled the country extensively. Being a worldly epicure, he spent much time\nseeking out authentic Italian restaurants, a challenge akin to finding Alpine\nskiing in Delaware.“They called everything northern Italian or southern\nItalian, which meant white or red,” he said.In 1980, Mr. Bozzi was summoned\nback to the home office in Milan, a move that, if nothing else, represented a\nlucrative gastronomic promotion. “But I never really wanted to be in the car\nbusiness,” he said. “So I didn’t go.”During a two-year stint running a\nManhattan-based Italian gold company, he nurtured a crazy notion that had been\nbuilding for almost a decade: Why not open a restaurant?Using part of his\n$250,000 severance from Alfa Romeo, he assumed a lease on a 1,100-square-foot\nstorefront on Third Avenue. With little experience but much grit, he went to\nwork channeling the spirit of his two favorite trattorias in Milan: the\nfashionable Ristorante la Briciola and Paper Moon. Thus arrived a four-seat\nantique wood bar; elbow-to-elbow marble tables (“It creates a party atmosphere\nevery night”); special terra-cotta floor tiles from Florence; and a muraled\nceiling of a cerulean sky and puffy white clouds.The cynosure of the room,\nhowever, was the artwork. Mr. Bozzi commissioned a renowned Florentine\narchitect, Roberto Magris, who enlisted dozens of artists to interpret the\nrestaurant’s logo: a crescent-shaped, two-handed chopping tool called a\nmezzaluna. The result is a captivating collage of framed images — some\nwhimsical, some alluringly enigmatic. In one corner, behind the bar, is a\nwood-fired pizza oven in the shape of a beehive, perhaps the first of its kind\nin the city.Mr. Bozzi laughed as he recalled the day the fire department\nconducted its preopening inspection. “They didn’t know what to make of it,” he\nsaid. “So they wrote on the report: fireplace.”Along with his chef (and now\npartner), Paolo Casagranda, Mr. Bozzi built a menu around innovative pizzas,\n17 in all. While they may not seem so groundbreaking today, in 1985 many were\neye-opening: speck smoked with juniper or pine wood, imported broccoli rabe\nmarinated in garlic vinegar, burrata, wild mushrooms. Many of the pastas were\nmade with imported gragnano, a handmade dried pasta from Naples.Portions were\nmodest, to encourage a variety of tastings. Among other firsts, Mezzaluna\nplaced cruets of excellent olive oil on dining tables, from his small family\nestate outside Florence. There were no main courses, only carpacci; bright,\ncomposed salads with seafood and meats cooked in the wood oven; pastas with\nroasted vegetables; shellfish; and one dessert, tiramisù. (The current menu is\nlarger.)“This was the forerunner of lighter and smaller plates,” said Nick\nValenti, the chief executive of the hospitality company Patina Restaurant\nGroup, who was so impressed by Mezzaluna that he enlisted Mr. Bozzi as a\nconsultant, an arrangement that continues.A savvy oenophile, Mr. Bozzi was\ndismayed by the poor quality of house wines in most American restaurants. With\nMr. Casagranda’s input, he mounted a blackboard and presented six whites and\nsix reds by the glass from quality producers like Gaja, Antinori and\nMastroberardino.Mezzaluna opened in June 1984. In characteristic New York\nfashion, the moment the news media ebulliently broadcast its arrival, a\nPamplona scene ensued. Its 45 neighborly tables turned more than 10 times a\nday, while the overtaxed pizza oven devoured more wood than a paper plant in\nMaine.In 1987, Mr. Bozzi and a partner opened a larger trattoria, Mezzogiorno,\nin SoHo. It quickly became a haunt of the downtown art world. The art dealer\nLeo Castelli dined there seven days a week. (Mezzogiorno closed last fall,\nowing to a lease issue, and reopened on the Upper West Side.)The outward trek\nof the American trattoria gained traction in 1988, when three Mezzaluna\nemployees fashioned a snazzy replica, just a calzone’s toss up Third Avenue,\ncalled Ciao Bella. Several years later, they opened Bella Blu, on Lexington\nAvenue, followed by others. By then, numerous trattorias of all stripes were\nsprouting in Manhattan with names like Le Madri, Cent’Anni, Coco Pazzo,\nSerafina and Mediterraneo.Riding on the prevailing culinary winds, trattoria\nspores drifted far and wide. Mr. Bozzi dabbled in licensing the Mezzaluna\nbrand in Aspen, Colo.; Beverly Hills, Calif.; and the Brentwood neighborhood\nof Los Angeles — the scene of Nicole Brown Simpson’s last meal. (The latter\ntwo have closed, and Mr. Bozzi is no longer involved in the Aspen restaurant.)\nHis biggest licensing success, and the most unlikely, has been in Turkey,\nwhere a dozen Mezzalunas are slicing up carpacci.Today, the Manhattan original\nthrives as a low-key favorite of chefs like Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Daniel\nBoulud, Thomas Keller and Bobby Flay.When Mr. Bozzi is not overseeing\nMezzaluna with Mr. Casagranda, or conceiving Italian projects for Patina\nRestaurant Group, he spends more than a third of the year in Italy with his\nwife, Chiara, a retired pediatrician.At the conclusion of a long interview\nover tiramisù and espresso, one critical question remained for this improbable\npioneer: “Do you drive an Alfa Romeo?”“I am not driving one at present,” Mr.\nBozzi said, pausing for the punch line. “But in two weeks I will have a new\nnephew. His name is Romeo.”\n\n","title":"Mezzaluna, the Little Restaurant That Started a Revolution - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"This little restaurant on NYC’s Upper East Side set off a restaurant revolution in the U.S. and beyond https://t.co/Jpt05B3i6G","date":"Sun Mar 27 22:59:57 +0000 2016","favs":160,"id":{"$numberLong":"714225474344513536"},"retweets":71},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25riJ9q"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01532"},"content":"While Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson filmed their 94th episode of\n“Elementary,” the CBS detective series, on the Upper East Side in Manhattan on\nFriday, a real-life homicide mystery took a new turn just one block away.The\ncase has stymied New York City police detectives for more than a week now,\nafter a 78-year-old man was found dead in his apartment on the top floor of a\nprewar apartment building on East 64th Street. The man, Christopher Cooley,\nwas discovered on March 17, seated on a couch, his necktie looped, but not\nknotted, around his neck, a throw pillow over his face and a broken lamp at\nhis feet, the police said. His hair was matted with blood.The police have not\nyet publicly declared the case a homicide, but in a brief interview on Friday,\nthe city’s chief medical examiner did just that, indicating that a cord of\nsome sort had been used to strangle Mr. Cooley and that the case was not a\nsuicide. “The cause of death is ligature strangulation, and the manner of\ndeath, homicide,” the medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Sampson, said. She\ndeclined to say what was used to kill him.The homicide has left many residents\nanxious at the thought of a killer on the loose and others annoyed at the\nsudden intrusion of detectives and reporters.Some have begun locking their\ndoors, after years of keeping them unlocked and relying on doormen to keep\nthem safe.So far, the case has yielded few clues. Mr. Cooley had long lived\nalone in his 11th-floor apartment. Younger neighbors knew Mr. Cooley, a Yale\ngraduate, as little more than a friendly face in the elevator. He apparently\ndid not regale neighbors with stories, although he clearly had some good\nones.While living in Venice as a younger man, Mr. Cooley had gotten to know\nEzra Pound, the poet who was indicted on a treason charge for his wartime\nsupport of Fascist Italy, and even attended the poet’s last birthday party,\ndays before Pound’s death, according to one book.Reached by telephone, a\nsister of Mr. Cooley’s, Clare Cooley Edwards, declined to speak about his\ndeath.Mr. Cooley’s frequent vacations were one reason his death went unnoticed\nfor some time, a doorman, who gave his name as Alex, said in an interview. By\nthe time he was found, newspapers dating to March 5 had piled up at his door.\nBut Alex, speaking while on a cigarette break, said he and the other doormen\nhad not suspected anything because “Mr. Cooley often vacationed in Europe and\ndidn’t tell the building that he was leaving.”The first person to worry about\nhis absence was an out-of-state sister, who called the building after being\nunable to reach her brother, the police said. At the sister’s request, the\nbuilding’s superintendent opened Mr. Cooley’s apartment through a back door.\nThe tenant was found dead, the police said.The superintendent quickly called\nthe police, and officers discovered no signs of a break-in or robbery. The\ndoor to Mr. Cooley’s apartment was locked, the police said, and $190 cash was\nfound in his pockets.\n\n","title":"A Mysterious Killing on the Upper East Side Unsettles Residents - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"A mysterious killing on NYC's Upper East Side has unsettled residents https://t.co/Mcy7PlgaoV","date":"Sun Mar 27 22:32:34 +0000 2016","favs":124,"id":{"$numberLong":"714218581655953408"},"retweets":84},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21NSDsA"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01533"},"content":"The National Football League was on the clock.With several of its marquee\nplayers retiring early after a cascade of frightening concussions, the league\nformed a committee in 1994 that would ultimately issue a succession of\nresearch papers playing down the danger of head injuries. Amid criticism of\nthe committee’s work, physicians brought in later to continue the research\nsaid the papers had relied on faulty analysis.Now, an investigation by The New\nYork Times has found that the N.F.L.’s concussion research was far more flawed\nthan previously known.For the last 13 years, the N.F.L. has stood by the\nresearch, which, the papers stated, was based on a full accounting of all\nconcussions diagnosed by team physicians from 1996 through 2001. But\nconfidential data obtained by The Times shows that more than 100 diagnosed\nconcussions were omitted from the studies — including some severe injuries to\nstars like quarterbacks Steve Young and Troy Aikman. The committee then\ncalculated the rates of concussions using the incomplete data, making them\nappear less frequent than they actually were.After The Times asked the league\nabout the missing diagnosed cases — more than 10 percent of the total —\nofficials acknowledged that “the clubs were not required to submit their data\nand not every club did.” That should have been made clearer, the league said\nin a statement, adding that the missing cases were not part of an attempt “to\nalter or suppress the rate of concussions.”One member of the concussion\ncommittee, Dr. Joseph Waeckerle, said he was unaware of the omissions. But he\nadded: “If somebody made a human error or somebody assumed the data was\nabsolutely correct and didn’t question it, well, we screwed up. If we found it\nwasn’t accurate and still used it, that’s not a screw-up; that’s a lie.”These\ndiscoveries raise new questions about the validity of the committee’s\nfindings, published in 13 peer-reviewed articles and held up by the league as\nscientific evidence that brain injuries did not cause long-term harm to its\nplayers. It is also unclear why the omissions went unchallenged by league\nofficials, by the epidemiologist whose job it was to ensure accurate data\ncollection and by the editor of the medical journal that published the\nstudies.In 2013, the N.F.L. agreed to a $765 million settlement of a lawsuit\nin which retired players accused league officials of covering up the risks of\nconcussions. Some players have appealed the settlement, asking for an\nexamination of the committee’s concussion research.Some retired players have\nlikened the N.F.L.’s handling of its health crisis to that of the tobacco\nindustry, which was notorious for using questionable science to play down the\ndangers of cigarettes.Concussions can hardly be equated with smoking, which\nkills 1,300 people a day in the United States, and The Times has found no\ndirect evidence that the league took its strategy from Big Tobacco. But\nrecords show a long relationship between two businesses with little in common\nbeyond the health risks associated with their products.In a letter to The\nTimes, a lawyer for the league said, “The N.F.L. is not the tobacco industry;\nit had no connection to the tobacco industry,” which he called “perhaps the\nmost odious industry in American history.”Still, the records show that the two\nbusinesses shared lobbyists, lawyers and consultants. Personal correspondence\nunderscored their friendships, including dinner invitations and a request for\nlobbying advice.In 1997, to provide legal oversight for the committee, the\nleague assigned Dorothy C. Mitchell, a young lawyer who had earlier defended\nthe Tobacco Institute, the industry trade group. She had earned the\ninstitute’s “highest praise” for her work.A co-owner of the Giants, Preston R.\nTisch, also partly owned a leading cigarette company, Lorillard, and was a\nboard member of both the Tobacco Institute and the Council for Tobacco\nResearch, two entities that played a central role in misusing science to hide\nthe risks of cigarettes.The N.F.L.’s concussion committee began publishing its\nfindings in 2003 in the medical journal Neurosurgery. Although the database\nused in the studies contained numerical codes for teams and players, The Times\ndecoded it by cross-referencing team schedules and public injury reports.The\nN.F.L.’s concussion studies have faced questions since they were published,\nbut even the league’s harshest critics have never suggested, and no evidence\nhas ever arisen, that the underlying data set could be so faulty.“One of the\nrules of science is that you need to have impeccable data collection\nprocedures,” said Bill Barr, a neuropsychologist who once worked for the Jets\nand who has in the past criticized the committee’s work.By excluding so many\nconcussions, Mr. Barr said, “You’re not doing science here; you are putting\nforth some idea that you already have.”In an introduction to the first of the\nconcussion committee’s papers, the league’s commissioner at the time, Paul\nTagliabue, acknowledged the need for “independent scientific research” to\nbetter understand the risks of concussions.“As we looked more deeply into the\nspecific area of concussions, we realized that there were many more questions\nthan answers,” Mr. Tagliabue wrote.The committee’s chairman, Dr. Elliot\nPellman, the team physician for the Jets, emphasized that his group aimed to\nproduce research that was “independent” and “meticulous.”In fact, most of the\ndozen committee members were associated with N.F.L. teams, as a physician,\nneurosurgeon or athletic trainer, which meant they made decisions about player\ncare and then studied whether those decisions were proper. Still, the\nresearchers stated unambiguously — in each of their first seven peer-reviewed\npapers — that their financial or business relationships had not compromised\ntheir work.The committee said it analyzed all concussions diagnosed by team\nmedical staffs from 1996 through 2001 — 887 in all. Concussions were recorded\nby position, type of play, time missed, even the brand of helmet.The\ncommittee’s statements emphasized the completeness of the data.“It was\nunderstood that any player with a recognized symptom of head injury, no matter\nhow minor, should be included in the study,” one paper said.And in\nconfidential peer-review documents, the committee wrote that “all N.F.L. teams\nparticipated” and that “all players were therefore part of this study.”Those\nstatements are contradicted by the database.The Times found that most teams\nfailed to report all of their players’ concussions. Over all, at least 10\npercent of head injuries diagnosed by team doctors were missing from the\nstudy, including two sustained by Jets receiver Wayne Chrebet, who retired\nseveral years later after more concussions. Dr. Pellman, the Jets’ physician,\nled the research and was the lead author on every paper.According to the\nresearch papers, team physicians were to fill out forms specially designed for\nthe studies to submit information about concussions — a system that went well\nbeyond the league’s standard injury-reporting protocols. In one paper, the\ncommittee wrote, “The Commissioner of the N.F.L. mandated all team physicians\nto complete and return forms whenever they examined a player with a head\ninjury.”But after The Times described how it had identified missing\nconcussions, the N.F.L. said this week that the studies, in fact, “never\npurported” to include all concussions.Teams were “not mandated” to\nparticipate, the league said, only “strongly encouraged.” And some teams, a\nspokesman said, “did not take the additional steps of supplying the initial\nand/or follow-up forms.” He did not explain why some teams had not included\nall concussions identified by medical personnel.The league explained, as did\nthe papers, that some concussions went undiagnosed in the first place because\nplayers are known to occasionally hide their symptoms of concussion from team\ndoctors; that symptoms of concussion can be so brief that no one notices; and\nthat doctors might have used different criteria to make concussion\ndiagnoses.But the vast majority of omitted concussions identified by The Times\nwere included in the N.F.L.’s public injury reports, meaning that medical\nstaffs had made the diagnoses and reported them to the league. Some of the\nomitted concussions were reported by the teams to the news media after a game\nbut do not appear on the injury reports, presumably because the player’s\nstatus for the next game was not in doubt.The database does not include any\nconcussions involving the Dallas Cowboys for all six seasons, including four\nto Mr. Aikman that were listed on the N.F.L.’s official midweek injury reports\nor were widely reported in the news media. He and many other players were\ntherefore not included when the committee analyzed the frequency and lasting\neffects of multiple concussions.Several other teams have no concussions listed\nfor years at a time. Yet the committee’s calculations did include hundreds of\nthose teams’ games played during that period, which produced a lower overall\nconcussion rate.A Cowboys spokesman, Rich Dalrymple, said the team had\nparticipated, but he declined to say how many cases were reported and which\nplayers were involved. He said he did not know why the Cowboys’ data did not\nappear in the studies. A San Francisco 49ers spokesman did not return messages\nseeking comment about Mr. Young.Dr. Robert Cantu, one of the peer reviewers\nwho at the time criticized the committee’s analyses, said, “It should be an\nunmistakable red flag that a team does not report any concussions over\nmultiple years.”Some injuries were more severe than what was reflected in the\nofficial tally. According to committee records, St. Louis Rams quarterback\nKurt Warner sustained a concussion on Dec. 24, 2000, that healed after two\ndays. But Mr. Warner’s symptoms continued, and four weeks later he was ruled\nout of the Pro Bowl with what a league official described as lingering\nsymptoms of that head injury.The N.F.L. declined to make Dr. Pellman available\nfor an interview. The study’s epidemiologist, John Powell, who no longer works\non behalf of the league, did not respond to interview requests. Michael L. J.\nApuzzo, editor of Neurosurgery when the papers were published, did not respond\nto interview requests.The committee and the N.F.L. have long claimed that the\npapers were vetted through a rigorous, confidential peer-review process before\npublication, which legitimized their methods and conclusions. But more than a\ndozen pages of anonymous back-and-forth between reviewers and the committee\nshow some reviewers almost desperate to stop the papers’ publication while the\nauthors brushed aside criticism.One reviewer wrote, “Many of the management of\nconcussion suggestions are inappropriate and not founded on facts.” Another\nsaid the committee’s assertion that the league was handling concussions too\ncautiously was not proved and was therefore “potentially dangerous.”An author\nof the N.F.L. studies responded, “If the truth is dangerous, then I suppose\nour results are dangerous.”In 1992, amid rising concerns about concussions,\nMr. Tisch — the Giants and Lorillard part owner — asked the cigarette\ncompany’s general counsel, Arthur J. Stevens, to contact the N.F.L.\ncommissioner at the time, Mr. Tagliabue, about certain legal issues.Mr.\nStevens was not just any tobacco lawyer; he was a member of the industry’s\nsecretive Committee of Counsel, which helped direct tobacco research projects.\nIn a letter obtained by The Times, Mr. Stevens referred Mr. Tagliabue to two\ncourt cases alleging that the tobacco and asbestos industries had covered up\nthe health risks of their products.In one case, the family of a dead smoker\nsought internal documents that the tobacco industry had withheld on the\ngrounds of lawyer-client privilege — which does not apply if invoked to cover\nup a crime. The judge in the case reacted angrily after reading those internal\nrecords.“The documents speak for themselves in a voice filled with disdain for\nthe consuming public and its health,” the judge, H. Lee Sarokin of Federal\nDistrict Court in New Jersey, wrote earlier in 1992. Tobacco lawyers succeeded\nin having Judge Sarokin removed from the case.Why an influential tobacco\nlawyer would recommend legal cases to the N.F.L. is not known, because neither\nMr. Stevens nor Mr. Tagliabue would agree to be interviewed. Mr. Tisch died in\n2005.Joe Lockhart, a league spokesman, said that the cases involved potential\nbias of judges and that there was no evidence that the letter “was taken\nseriously.”Even so, records show that, in the legal arena, the league and the\ntobacco industry sometimes intersected.Before joining the N.F.L., Ms.\nMitchell, a young Harvard Law School graduate, had been one of five lawyers at\nCovington \u0026amp; Burling who had provided either lobbying help or legal\nrepresentation to both the N.F.L. and the tobacco industry, sometimes in the\nsame year. Mr. Tagliabue had been a partner at the firm before becoming the\nN.F.L.’s commissioner.In 1992, Ms. Mitchell defended the Tobacco Institute\nagainst a smoker’s lawsuit. She also worked on behalf of the institute in a\nlandmark secondhand smoke case, as well as for other nontobacco clients. Ms.\nMitchell said she was not responsible for legal strategy in the tobacco\ncases.At the N.F.L., said Brian McCarthy, a league spokesman, Ms. Mitchell’s\nwork for the concussion committee was administrative. “She did not have any\nresponsibility or any role in directing the research,” he said.Dr. Waeckerle,\nthe concussion committee member, offered a different view.He said Ms. Mitchell\nasked committee members: “How can this affect us? How can this be studied? How\nshould we view it? Is this a legitimate concern, or is this part of somebody’s\nzeal, and do we need to be concerned?”Dr. Waeckerle praised her for bringing a\nnonmedical voice that made members consider the risks, benefits and “what are\nthe intended and nonintended consequences of whatever we were discussing.” He\nsaid, for example, that she wanted to ensure that the committee’s work applied\nonly to the N.F.L., not to college or youth football.Ms. Mitchell said in an\ninterview that she left the N.F.L. after six years for personal reasons,\nunrelated to her work, and that she did not recall much about the committee’s\nwork.“I don’t think I saw any reports,” she said. “It was in the early\nstages.”Ms. Mitchell added that, as the league’s assistant secretary, she had\nbroad responsibilities beyond health and safety issues.Her contributions to\nthe concussion committee won her thanks in five research papers — three by the\nN.F.L. and two by a Canadian company that did contract work for the N.F.L. The\ncommittee wrote that she worked “tirelessly to initiate” its research and that\n“her efforts paved the way for successful completion of the research.”On at\nleast two occasions in the 1970s and 1980s, the N.F.L. hired a company whose\nclient list included the Tobacco Institute to study player injuries. The\nleague also hired a company — for a matter unrelated to player safety — that\nhad performed a study for the tobacco industry that played down the danger of\nsecondhand smoke.The N.F.L.’s ties to tobacco are reflected in other ways.\nWhen Congress was considering legislation that dealt with when a team owner\ncould relocate a franchise, Joe Browne, a league official sought lobbying\nadvice from a representative of the Tobacco Institute.“I would like to take\nthe opportunity to sit down and discuss this bill with you further,” Mr.\nBrowne said in a 1982 letter to the institute’s president, Sam Chilcote.Neil\nAustrian, a former N.F.L. president, had previously run an advertising agency\nthat under his leadership reversed its ban on taking tobacco clients. He\ncalled Philip Morris “an honorable company that sets high standards.” It was\nduring his tenure at the N.F.L. that the concussion committee was\ncreated.Years later, when the committee’s work drew criticism during the peer\nreview process, its members pushed back.“We are aware the findings from the\nN.F.L. confront some popular opinions,” they wrote, “but believe this study\nstands on its merits based on the physician evaluation of injury and quality\nassurance of the data.”\n\n","title":"N.F.L.’s Flawed Concussion Research and Ties to Tobacco Industry - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"A look at the NFL's deeply flawed concussion research and ties to the tobacco industry https://t.co/uSvEnH3CAH https://t.co/w45fmooZYw","date":"Sun Mar 27 22:20:07 +0000 2016","favs":221,"id":{"$numberLong":"714215448649277441"},"retweets":163},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1q9UPyM"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01534"},"content":"LOS ANGELES — As a box office megadraw, “Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice”\nmore than did its job, taking in an estimated $170.1 million in North America\nand an additional $254 million in simultaneous release overseas.But as a\nmeasure of the creative capabilities of a studio betting its future on a\nstring of tonally similar superhero movies? Most critics eviscerated the\nWarner Bros. film, which was directed by Zack Snyder, and audiences gave it a\nsoft B grade in CinemaScore exit polls.Warner, which spent roughly $400\nmillion to make and market “Dawn of Justice,” described the box office results\nas “phenomenal,” “sensational” and “fantastic.” Domestic ticket sales, fueled\nby higher-priced Imax, premium large-format theaters and RealD 3-D screenings,\nset a record for a March release, among others.[ A look back at how Batman and\nSuperman have stacked up onscreen in live-action theatrical releases before\n“Batman v Superman.” ]It was one of the largest rollouts in Hollywood history:\nWarner booked “Dawn of Justice” onto roughly 50,000 screens in 67 countries.\n“We’re absolutely jubilant about the way the fans embraced the film,” Jeff\nGoldstein, Warner’s executive vice president for domestic distribution, said\nby phone on Sunday. “To be this successful as we launch the DC Comics universe\nis really a triumph.”The real test for Warner and “Dawn of Justice” may lie\nahead, however. Any movie with both Batman and Superman in its title had\nbetter turn out huge opening-weekend crowds. Financial success will depend on\nrepeat visits by fans in the weeks ahead and attendance by older moviegoers,\nwho tend to skip the initial hoopla.Analysts estimate that the movie will need\nto take in more than $800 million worldwide to break even, after accounting\nfor revenue splits with theaters. (Boding well for Warner: “Dawn of Justice”\nfaces light competition over the next two weekends.)Questions also remain\nabout Warner’s 10-movie “cinematic universe” of interconnected superhero\nmovies. Mr. Snyder’s bleak “Dawn of Justice” was designed as the creative\nfoundation for a multibillion-dollar string of films featuring the likes of\nWonder Woman and Aquaman. Mr. Snyder is set to begin filming a two-part\n“Justice League” in the coming weeks.As Mike Sampson, editor of the fan site\nScreenCrush.com, wrote last week before the numbers were in, “If the\noverwhelming sentiment is that the ‘Dawn of Justice’ doesn’t make you want to\nsee Justice arrive, Warner Bros. has a supersized problem.”Is Warner\nconcerned?“Not in the least,” Mr. Goldstein said. “While I respect the\nreviewers, the enormous turnout speaks for itself.” (Over the weekend, James\nWan, who is directing “Aquaman,” told attendees at a comic book convention\nthat his film would not forget to have fun in response to a question about Mr.\nSnyder’s dark aesthetic.)Chatter around the unusually negative reviews, which\nwere 29 percent positive, according to RottenTomatoes.com, may have actually\nhelped “Dawn of Justice,” as moviegoers set out to see what the ruckus was\nabout. A number of review-based Internet memes popped up last week, with one\nvideo of a sad-looking Ben Affleck, who played Batman, viewed about 14 million\ntimes since its posting on Thursday.ListenFirst Media, an analytics company,\nsaid that the number of social media mentions of “Dawn of Justice” on Thursday\nand Friday were 45 percent larger than for Marvel’s “Avengers: Age of Ultron”\nover a corresponding period.Rival studios on Sunday gave credit to Warner,\nwhich has struggled at the box office during the last two years, for selecting\nwhat turned out to be a perfect release date for “Dawn of Justice.” Movie\nindustry conventional wisdom holds that superhero movies do best in the\nsummer. But Warner — trying to get ahead of Marvel’s coming “Captain America:\nCivil War” — took a risk on the Easter holiday. According to comScore, 76\npercent of American schools were closed on Friday.For the weekend, Disney’s\n“Zootopia” was second at the domestic box office, taking in an estimated $23.1\nmillion, for a four-week total of $240.5 million, according to comScore. Third\nplace went to Universal’s “My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2,” which was made for\nabout $18 million and took in a better-than-expected $18.1 million.

As\nsomeone who was in Tower 2 in the 9/11 attacks, I know all too well what it\nfeels like to live in a city under siege, always fearing the next attack.I am\nsaddened that we are in a world that creates people who see no alternative for\ntheir lives than to die violently, taking as many innocent people with them as\ntheir crude homemade devices will allow.What we all are losing in this battle\nis our ability to live our lives devoid of fear. There is a lot to be said for\nbeing able to go to a park or a concert or the subway and not worry about the\npotential for violence and bloodshed.I miss the innocence of a pre-9/11 world\nwhere that was the norm. My heart of course goes out to the victims of this\nlatest attack. I hope we find our way through this violence someday, but I see\nno immediate answers or a clear path back to those innocent days._— lgt525 in\nAnn Arbor, Mich., reacting to __ the terrorist bombings in Brussels__ on\nTuesday.__This comment received more than 330 reader recommendations._2\\.

Having grown up in South Florida\nsince 1964, I have had a number of friends and acquaintances who: were “Peter\nPan” children; were missing family members unable to leave Cuba; were poor\nbecause the Cuban government confiscated all they had earned; were willing to\nraft to the Florida shore risking their life.I realize that times change, but\nthe government leaders of Cuba essentially have not.The brothers that brought\nyou the Elian Gonzalez debacle, Mariel boatlift, and Communism 90 miles from\nour border are still in power. Perhaps if they apologized or renounced some of\ntheir actions, having our president watch a baseball game with Cuba’s dictator\nwould be marginally acceptable, but that has not happened.As much as I am\ngrateful to be a citizen of the United States of America, I am troubled to see\nour president smiling and enjoying a game with the same government that caused\nso much hardship and strife that still exists today in the hearts and minds of\ngood friends and valued neighbors._— __physics is fun in Miami Springs, Fla.,\nreacting to an article about the baseball game between the Cuban national team\nand the Tampa Bay Rays attended by President Obama on Tuesday._4\\. My family\nand I came to the States from Cuba in 1962 with pretty much nothing. My\nparents sacrificed and worked hard and they, I, and my three brothers and my\nsister have done well.With all its “warts” I still think the U.S. is a place\nlike no other, and I love America. I’ve always thought the “embargo” was an\nabject failure, undermined by Cubans here who sent money and made illegal\nvisits. Mr. Obama’s reaching out is long overdue.That said, what most people\ndon’t understand is that it was most often the Castros who rebuffed efforts at\nbetter relations with the U.S. I’m sure they were well aware that more contact\nwith the States would dilute their stranglehold on Cuba and the Cuban\npeople.My theory is that now in their old age, they’ve “given up,” have little\nleft to steal from their own people, and know their days on Earth are\nnumbered, so they apparently aren’t as disinclined to improving relations with\nthe U.S. It’s my fervent hope the Cuban people, the true victims of the Castro\nrevolution, will benefit as a result._— J.

So, let me see if I have the\nRepublican strategy straight. “The people” should have a say in who the next\nSupreme Court justice is going to be (and therefore Obama’s pick should be\nblocked), but “the people” are not allowed to elect the presidential nominee.\nDo I have that right?_— Rebecca L. in Los Angeles, reacting to an article\nabout a 100-day campaign underway by Republican party leaders to block\n__Donald Trump from receiving their party’s nomination.__This was the most-\nrecommended comment of the week with more than 2,750__ reader recommendations.\nIt also received 42 reader responses._6\\.

Until cops suffer consequences for abusing their power\nin this way, this will continue to happen. And once again, if there wasn’t a\nvideo, I suspect this mail carrier would have had a couple more charges tacked\non to the incident and a lot of people who would assume that he was in the\nwrong because the cops said so.Moreover, he now has an arrest record.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01536"},"content":"TAKE a glance at who wrote this article and you’ll understand the problem.\nWho’s who?Two people with the same name can get mixed up — in both senses.\nThrow in the Internet, which can make geography irrelevant, and the\npossibility for confusion rivals that of a Shakespeare comedy, without the\nhappy ending.Just ask us.For more than two decades, Scott Shane the business-\nschool professor and Scott Shane the journalist have been mistaken for each\nother by co-authors, collection agencies, Google, a journalism school, public\nrelations firms, an ex-congressman, a book distributor — and, yes, this\nnewspaper. Being Internet doppelgängers has never been more than a persistent\nnuisance. But it reflects an era in which a person is not just flesh and blood\nbut also an electronic composite, patched together from words, numbers and\nimages, accessible at a click.The professor is clean-shaven. The journalist\nhas a beard. In a small town, in real life, that might keep us pretty well\nsorted out. Out on the web, it has meant only that our photos, too, have been\njumbled. Arriving to give a talk recently, the journalist was asked by his\nhost when he grew the beard. Sure enough, there on the poster advertising his\ntalk on drone strikes was the portrait of the expert on entrepreneurship.The\nprofessor, meanwhile, has distant relatives who ask him how he has time to\nwrite for The Times.In the early days of the Internet, when we were both\nliving in Maryland, one of us was sshane@erols.com, the other\nsshane@starpower.net, which was fine until both Internet providers were folded\ninto the RCN Corporation. Then we randomly started getting each other’s email.\nMost of the time it didn’t matter. Occasionally it did, like when the\njournalist received a book chapter written by the professor with an urgent\nnote from the editor to return it with any changes by the next day.When a\nhouse cleaner for the professor stole a check and used it for a big purchase\nat Best Buy, the bad account was sold to a persistent debt-collection company\n— which then discovered the journalist’s home phone number. The company phoned\noff and on for a couple of years, scoffing at the journalist’s insistence that\nthey had the wrong Scott Shane.A few years ago a former congressman phoned the\nprofessor, offering a tip on something that was happening in Libya: “It’s off\nthe record, because it’s classified,” he said. Rattled, and figuring it was\nanother mix-up, the professor cut him off and hurried to hang up, wanting\nnothing to do with state secrets.Because we both write books, various titles\nare regularly attributed to the wrong author, especially by the aggregating\nsoftware that pulls together so much of the web’s data. For a while, the\njournalist propped up one of the professor’s books (“Born Entrepreneurs, Born\nLeaders”) in front of his desk at work, simply to enjoy colleagues’ double\ntakes. The professor is routinely instructed to remove citations of the\njournalist’s work from his academic citation count, the basis of evaluations\nand raises.The comic plot thickened a few years ago when the professor was\nasked to write columns for a New York Times business blog called “You’re the\nBoss.” The journalist began to get regular pitches from wheedling P.R.\noperatives who wanted to get the name of a company or an executive into the\ncolumn. They were befuddled when told they had the wrong Scott Shane of The\nNew York Times.The column stint ended a few years ago. But by then the\nprofessor’s name and email were officially embedded in the newspaper’s\ncomputer system. That meant that an editor trying to send the journalist a\n“playback” of an edited version of his article sometimes chose the wrong Scott\nShane from a drop-down menu. The professor would get an urgent message asking\nwhether the editing changes were O.K. The journalist would wonder why he\ndidn’t get a playback.Uprooting the professor from the paper’s email\ndirectories, starting a few weeks ago, has proved to be a complicated task,\nrequiring a crew of technical experts scouring the system. After a round robin\nof a dozen emails, word arrived that the problem had been fixed.Actually, it\nturned out, the problem had not been fixed. The professor’s email address\nsurfaced again last week, evidently hiding somewhere in the recesses of The\nTimes’ computers. The tech team is back on the case.And meanwhile, a\npostscript: The professor seems to have passed this confusion of identities,\nlike some genetic disorder, to a new generation. His son, Ryan Shane, is an\nexcellent swimmer for an 11-year-old, but he is not (yet) ready for the\nOlympics. Some in the world of competitive swimming, however, have mixed him\nup with Shane Ryan, a 22-year-old who is a genuine Olympic prospect.Unlike his\ndad, who would prefer to avoid the confusing bits and bytes, Ryan Shane would\nbe happy to ride the wave of online confusion to a spot with Team U.S.A. He’d\nalso welcome sponsorship. A tech company might be fitting.\n\n","title":"Me and My Doppelgänger - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytopinion: When two people in public professions have the same name, things can get weird. https://t.co/huSJ81FW1q https://t.co/C5H68L…","date":"Sun Mar 27 21:25:05 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714201602022891520"},"retweets":69},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1SdCAiI"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01537"},"content":"Yes, he has seen “Hamilton.”But since his inauguration two years ago, Mayor\nBill de Blasio has not visited the Museum of Modern Art. He has not attended a\nNets or Knicks game. He has not been to the Guggenheim Museum, the Studio\nMuseum in Harlem, the P.S. 1 art center in Queens, the New York Botanical\nGarden in the Bronx or the Metropolitan Opera — although he did see a movie at\nLincoln Center once.He has never visited the High Line, the renowned elevated\npark on the Far West Side of Manhattan. In 2014, he skipped a ceremony for the\nopening of its final portion. Instead, that day he drove six hours to\nPittsburgh to attend a baseball game.Asked recently when he last visited\nCentral Park, the mayor replied, “I’ll have to get back to you.”Mayors of New\nYork have long considered themselves the city’s cheerleaders in chief, making\nfrequent appearances at its major institutions and promoting the world-class\ncultural offerings and only-in-New-York attractions that lure millions of\ntourists from around the world — and persuade New Yorkers that it’s worth\nputting up with tiny apartments and high rents just for a chance to live\nnearby.Mr. de Blasio, by contrast, is more of a homebody who is protective of\nhis privacy and prefers to spend downtime in his old Brooklyn neighborhood\nrather than out on the town. Uncomfortable in Gracie Mansion — he often refers\nto the mayoral residence as a “hotel,” and has complained to aides about\nfeeling out of place in its halls — he can frequently be found in Park Slope,\nexercising at his old gym and sipping cappuccinos at a beloved cafe.The\nmayor’s absence from cultural hot spots has caused consternation among arts\npatrons, who were accustomed to first-class treatment from Mr. de Blasio’s\npredecessor, Michael R. Bloomberg, a philanthropist and champion of public art\nprojects, including Christo’s colossal “Gates” installation that festooned\nCentral Park in fiery orange. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani alienated the cultural\nworld when he threatened to cut off funding for the Brooklyn Museum over a\nprovocative exhibition that incorporated elephant dung, but he was also an\navid operagoer, requesting that Lincoln Center keep a seat free for busy days\nwhen he arrived after the first act. Mayor David N. Dinkins was a familiar\nfigure at United States Open tennis matches in Flushing Meadows, Queens.“Every\nmayor has a style, but part of being mayor is showing that you are a citizen\nof the city,” said George Arzt, who served as a press secretary to Mayor\nEdward I. Koch, who made boosterism a trademark of his administration. “It’s a\ncity of restaurants, and museums, and other cultural opportunities — being\nseen there gives a boost. If the mayor went to a Jackson Pollock show, people\nwould say, ‘Oh, I got to go to that show!’”Big-city mayors rarely shirk this\nside of their duty: Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles often Instagrams his\ntravels, showcasing local restaurants and attractions.Still, with New York\nenjoying record-high tourism and record-low crime, some wonder: Does it matter\nhow a mayor spends his free time?City officials said this month that they\nwere expecting 59.7 million visitors this year, breaking last year’s record of\n58.3 million, and that those visitors would generate an estimated $60 billion\nin economic activity and support about 360,000 tourism-related jobs — numbers\nthat would be the pride of any metropolis.Fred Siegel, a historian who teaches\nat St. Francis College, said Mr. de Blasio did not have “an expansive view of\nthe social life of the city.” But he added that some New Yorkers simply might\nnot care where their mayor goes.“If the city’s streets are functioning well,\nif crime is maintained, I think the mayor can get by without being a bon\nvivant,” Mr. Siegel said.So what does the mayor like to do?Mr. de Blasio, who\ndeclined to be interviewed for this article, does have a cultural side, even\nif he does not always publicize it. He adored the Afropunk festival in Fort\nGreene, Brooklyn, telling his cultural affairs commissioner to ensure that the\npromoters retained their permit. He is a devotee of the 2008 musical “Fela!” —\nhe often urges its soundtrack upon aides — and he attended a concert by the\nAfrican singer Salif Keita at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. He and his wife,\nChirlane McCray, went to the New York African Film Festival at the Walter\nReade Theater, and they had aisle seats at “Eclipsed,” the new Lupita Nyong’o\nplay on Broadway about sex slaves in Liberia.“He’s more ‘Fela!’ than\n‘Phantom,’” Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance, said. “He’s\nmore ‘Hamilton’ than ‘Hamlet.’”“He fits the New York demographic of a\ntheatergoer, but not the deep-dive theater junkie who can sit through ‘Long\nDay’s Journey Into Night,’” Mr. Tompkins said. “He is paying attention to a\ndifferent category of cultural institution in a way that I think is totally\nfine.”He also eats.Bar Toto, a casual red-sauce spot in Park Slope, is half a\nblock from the de Blasio homestead, and it is the mayor’s go-to place for\nleisure and business meetings alike: His campaign fund has spent nearly\n$11,000 there since 2010.Mr. de Blasio has also dined at old-school\nDelmonico’s, the new-school Breslin, the Midtown Mediterranean spot Taboon,\nand Casa Lever, an expense-account stalwart where he and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\nate. He attended the reopening of the Carnegie Deli. Some mornings, he and his\nwife stop by the Mansion diner, two blocks from Gracie Mansion, for omelets or\noatmeal. John Philips, the owner, says that when there is a line, the mayor\ninsists on waiting in it. “He’s very courteous to our staff and to me\npersonally,” Mr. Philips said. “I can’t say a bad word about him.”The mayor as\nsports fan is a role Mr. de Blasio has adopted with relish, if selectively. He\nwatched the Rangers play in the Stanley Cup finals, and he dropped a\nceremonial puck at the first Islanders game in Barclays Center. The mayor\ncheered on the Mets in the World Series, and he has visited Yankee Stadium\nseveral times, but for soccer games; his son, Dante, is a soccer fanatic. He\nalso organized a parade for the national women’s soccer team after they won\nthe World Cup. A Red Sox fan, the mayor did attend a Yankees game — once —\nalthough his aides clarified that he stayed only for a few innings.Now, past\nthe midpoint of his first term, the mayor’s cultural itinerary is starting to\npick up.In the last two weeks, Mr. de Blasio cut the ribbon at the opening of\nthe Met Breuer building on the Upper East Side, declaring that “our identity\nas a city is caught up in the richness of our cultural life.” He attended the\npremiere of a documentary film on gun violence. He went to the opening game of\nNew York City F.C., the soccer team that plays at Yankee Stadium.That was in\naddition to his recent Friday evening at “Eclipsed,” where Mr. de Blasio kept\na low profile, staying seated at intermission. Ms. McCray posted a photograph\non Twitter of the first couple at the theater with the caption: “Two feminists\nout on date-night.”The mayor’s recent excursions coincide with a broader\nretooling by his political team before an expected re-election bid. Mr. de\nBlasio is spending more time in parts of the city like Staten Island and\nQueens, which are not his traditional bases of support. The mayor’s extensive\ntravels — he has been to Iowa, Israel and Italy, among other places — had\nprompted grumbling; at one point last year, he had made more public\nappearances outside New York City than on Staten Island.Tom Finkelpearl, the\ncity’s cultural affairs commissioner, recalled running into Mr. de Blasio at a\nChaka Khan concert in Prospect Park. “He does love culture, understands the\nneed, the financial and economic development need for culture,” said Mr.\nFinkelpearl, whose department’s budget has grown by more than 10 percent since\nMr. de Blasio took office.“But what I think is really wonderful is to hear him\ntalk about the moral and spiritual need of culture in the community,” Mr.\nFinkelpearl added. “I think people are confident he’s going to be good for\nculture in the city, and continues to be good for culture in the city.”Mr. de\nBlasio is a proud social reformer and likes art with a moral purpose. He\nrecently took time at news conferences to recommend the films “Spotlight” and\n“The Big Short,” praising them for highlighting injustice. (“It makes your\nblood boil,” he said of the latter.)He also prides himself on a knowledge of\npop culture, giving regular interviews to the hip-hop radio station Hot 97 and\nmaking a cameo on “The Good Wife,” one of his favorite television shows. He\nattended the taping of the 40th-anniversary special for “Saturday Night Live”\nand has appeared as a guest with Seth Meyers, Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert and\nTrevor Noah.He has taken his son to the Museum of Natural History in\nManhattan, his aides said, and enjoys the Louis Armstrong House in Queens and\nthe Snug Harbor Cultural Center on Staten Island. The mayor has attended\nofficial functions at the Brooklyn Museum, the Brooklyn Academy of Music and\nCarnegie Hall, and he watched Diana Ross perform at the renovated Kings\nTheater in Brooklyn.In a statement emailed by aides, Mr. de Blasio said: “I\nappreciate the hidden and lesser known treasures of our city as much as I do\nits iconic offerings. I want to open up cultural windows to all New Yorkers,\nand the first lady and I have tried to do that by traveling across all five\nboroughs and experiencing and enjoying that which makes them unique.”Still,\nthere are skeptics. Jordan Roth, a prominent Broadway producer, has griped\nabout the mayor, saying it was “disappointing” that Mr. de Blasio had not\nattended more shows. Peggy Siegal, a prominent publicist, earned some\nnotoriety when she told The Wall Street Journal — in an article last spring\nabout the mayor’s absence at boldface events like the Met Gala hosted by Anna\nWintour, the annual Costume Institute benefit at the Metropolitan Museum of\nArt — that Mr. de Blasio had “disdain for the striving, successful New\nYorkers.”“I seem to have hit on a sensitive nerve in the social scene of New\nYork, by the mere fact that I received so many emails agreeing with the\nissue,” Ms. Siegal recalled recently. She said that those in her world “would\nactually really like the mayor to come to these events.”“They like him,” Ms.\nSiegal said. “He’s a nice guy.” (The mayor’s office said he had not yet\ndecided whether he would attend this year’s Met Gala, which is on May 2.)Mr.\nde Blasio’s aides said that in addition to “Hamilton,” he had seen “A Raisin\nin the Sun,” “Rasheeda Speaking,” “MotherStruck!” and a revival of Tom\nStoppard’s “The Real Thing.” He attended Shakespeare in the Park on a night\nwhen Senator Chuck Schumer made a cameo. Recently, the mayor posted to Twitter\nthat he wanted to see “Shuffle Along,” a show, opening next month, about a\nlandmark African-American musical from the 1920s.Ken Sherrill, a professor\nemeritus at Hunter College, said the mayor — who once said, “I’m not hired by\nthe people to go to parades” — was recalibrating his approach.“I was watching\nthe news last night, and I saw the mayor filling potholes,” Professor Sherrill\nsaid. “For the first time, he seemed comfortable with the symbolic aspects of\nthe job. I had always felt that he was not at ease.”“He is only lately coming\nto understand that the symbolic head-of-state activities are part of the job,”\nhe added, “that going to a park is not just for his pleasure — it’s for saying\nthe parks are an important part of the city.”The mayor’s interest in parks may\nbe less relevant were it not for the outsize role Central Park has played in\nhis administration.Mr. de Blasio has spearheaded a widely opposed effort to\nban the park’s horse carriages, a pet cause of his political donors. Parks\nadvocates cried foul when he proposed spending upward of $20 million in public\nfunds for a private stable in the park, a plan that collapsed.After the mayor\nfailed to recall when he had last been to Central Park, his aides emailed a\nlist of 10 ostensible visits there during his term. Several of the events did\nnot actually take place inside the park, including visits to the Museum of\nNatural History and the inflation ceremony for floats in the Macy’s\nThanksgiving Day Parade, which are on Central Park West.In 2015, the mayor\nmade only one bona fide Central Park visit: for CityFest, a Gospel-themed\nmusic festival. (He is, however, a devotee of Prospect Park in Brooklyn, where\nhe and Ms. McCray were married under a pin oak tree.)Mr. de Blasio has been\nscarce at other landmarks as well.He did not ride the tram when visiting\nRoosevelt Island for a groundbreaking ceremony last year; Mr. Bloomberg, who\nalso attended the event, took the tram.In January, Mr. de Blasio hosted a news\nconference at the ferry terminal on Staten Island, to name a new ferryboat.\nRather than ride a ferry, he was driven there in a sport utility vehicle. (An\naide said the mayor needed privacy to make phone calls.) At the event, Mr. de\nBlasio could not recall his last ferry ride, although a reporter from The\nStaten Island Advance reminded him: October.Told that Mr. de Blasio was driven\nto Staten Island, Bill Cunningham, a former spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg,\nlaughed. “You would think if you were going to name a ferryboat, you might\nride on a ferryboat, but that’s just the old advance man in me I suppose,” Mr.\nCunningham said.Mr. Giuliani, in an interview, said that he could appreciate\nthe pressures facing Mr. de Blasio, and that the mayor should not be faulted\nfor taking time to relax in his old haunts, rather than hobnobbing around\ntown. “It makes a lot of sense to me,” Mr. Giuliani said. “Hey, Mayor Koch\nused to love to go down to the Village, because that was his old\nneighborhood.”Still, Mr. Giuliani, who was speaking from Warsaw, where he was\ntraveling on business, said a mayor’s presence at major attractions could be\nimportant. “People here in Poland may see a picture of the mayor in Central\nPark, and that makes them want to come to New York,” he said.“Even though he\nand I disagree philosophically, I have great empathy for the difficulty of his\njob,” Mr. Giuliani said. “But you got to balance it. You do belong to the\npublic, ultimately.”\n\n","title":"The Mayor Does the Town, His Way - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"How NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio hits the town https://t.co/xnG0jJusRZ https://t.co/Sx0FUHymGx","date":"Sun Mar 27 21:10:09 +0000 2016","favs":103,"id":{"$numberLong":"714197840801763329"},"retweets":55},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25rk3ZX"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01538"},"content":"BERKELEY, Calif. — For decades, the University of California, Berkeley, has\nbeen synonymous with liberal activism and social justice campaigns. But\nstudents, alumni and staff members say they have a hard time squaring that\nimage with a spate of high-profile sexual harassment cases roiling the\ncampus.The dean of the law school stepped down this month after an\ninvestigation concluded that he forcefully hugged and kissed his executive\nassistant almost daily. An assistant basketball coach was fired, also this\nmonth, after the university determined that he had propositioned a reporter\nafter shutting her in a parking garage. “With all candor, I was trying to\ntrick her into going upstairs,” he told investigators.In October, a renowned\nastronomer left the faculty after he was accused of buying students drinks,\ngrinding with one on the dance floor and grabbing the crotch of a student from\nanother university.“This is supposed to be the pride of our state university\nsystem,” said Jennifer Reisch, a Berkeley Law graduate who said she was\nsexually assaulted when she was a student by a previous law dean at Berkeley\nnearly 16 years ago. “How is this happening?”At a time of heightened awareness\nof the dangers of sexual violence on campuses across the country, Berkeley\nstudents and alumni are accusing the administration of failing to make the\nuniversity safe from sexual harassment and violence — and then doing too\nlittle when it occurs.In addition to these cases, the university is\ninvestigating 16 cases involving sexual harassment and nine involving sexual\nviolence. The university is also facing two complaints lodged with the federal\ngovernment and a civil suit brought by three women. All three actions accuse\nthe university of failing to prevent sexual abuse.“There’s a feeling that you\ncan do this stuff, and you’ll just get a slap on the wrist,” said Nicoletta\nCommins, a graduate student at the Berkeley School of Public Health and one of\nthe three women suing the university. “Berkeley doesn’t do anything about it\nunless there is external pressure.”On Thursday, Berkeley’s chancellor,\nNicholas B. Dirks, announced a number of initiatives to raise awareness of\nsexual harassment and sexual assaults, including a half-day of activities for\nthe entire campus, tentatively set for next fall.The chancellor also said the\nuniversity would increase resources for the Office for the Prevention of\nHarassment and Discrimination. Dan Mogulof, a spokesman for the university,\nsaid that the office’s budget would be increased to $1.2 million from the\ncurrent level of $900,000, and that the staff of three would be doubled.Still,\nhundreds of Berkeley students and alumni expressed outrage this month when\nthey learned that the administration had kept secret the existence of the\nsexual harassment case against Sujit Choudhry, the dean of the law school who\nlater stepped down. Under the terms of the confidential punishment, he had\nbeen allowed to remain in the job while his executive assistant, who had filed\na complaint against him, was told to look for work elsewhere in the\nuniversity.The case was made public only after the executive assistant, Tyann\nSorrell, filed a civil suit this month against Mr. Choudhry and the university\nsaying that the punishment the administration meted out — a one-year cut in\nsalary to $373,500, from $415,000; a requirement to undergo counseling; and a\nletter of apology to Ms. Sorrell — was inadequate.“I’ve worked for many high-\nlevel execs in Fortune 500 companies, and I’ve never seen anyone behave the\nway he has,” she said in an interview.Ms. Sorrell, a mother of five, graduated\nfrom Berkeley and had worked for the two previous law school deans.The\nuniversity has since released details of the inquiry, which concluded that Mr.\nChoudhry, who became dean in 2014, “engaged in intentional physical touching”\nof Ms. Sorrell, including “hugging, kissing her cheek, squeezing her arm,\nrubbing her arms and shoulders, and holding her hands to his waist at the\nworkplace.”The report concluded that the conduct was “unwelcome and\nobjectively sexual in nature.”A letter of protest by more than 400 alumni\ndescribed Mr. Choudhry’s punishment as “feeble.” They threatened to withhold\nfuture donations until he was fired.Mr. Choudhry announced he was stepping\ndown this month, but he remains on the faculty.Janet Napolitano, the president\nof the University of California system, who said she was upset that she had\nlearned of his case from the news media, barred Mr. Choudhry from campus for\nthe rest of the term and ordered disciplinary proceedings that could\nultimately result in stripping him of tenure.Mr. Choudhry declined to be\ninterviewed, but lawyers representing him provided a copy of a letter sent\nlast week to Ms. Napolitano by his counsel, William W. Taylor.Mr. Choudhry was\nbeing deprived of due process, the letter said, and his case “lumped in” with\nother cases on campus.“He is a scapegoat for any shortcomings, real or\nperceived, in the university’s handling of sexual harassment claims and\nrelated policies and procedures,” Mr. Taylor wrote.In an interview, Ms.\nNapolitano said she stood by her order to keep Mr. Choudhry off campus. The\nUniversity of California needed to set an example for the country, she said.“I\nthink our society at large has undervalued sexual harassment in the\nworkplace,” Ms. Napolitano said. “It’s gone on in many professions for\ndecades. We are a public university, and we ought to be leading by example,\nnot by mistake.”Critics point to several ways the university appears to have\nmishandled sexual harassment and assault claims.In the case of Mr. Choudhry,\nhe did not take a required course in sexual harassment awareness until after\nMs. Sorrell had filed her complaint. Activists say this was a significant\nfailing given the law school’s previous entanglement with a sexual assault\nscandal. A complaint filed in 2002 by Ms. Reisch, the alumna, accused John\nDwyer, the dean then, of undressing and fondling her at her apartment when she\nwas intoxicated. He resigned. According to the university, Mr. Dwyer said the\nencounter was consensual but inappropriate.In the case of Geoffrey Marcy, the\nastronomy professor who resigned last year, an investigation noted that\naccusations of sexual harassment went back to 2001. A former student, now a\nprofessor at Harvard, said in a blog that Dr. Marcy’s “inappropriate actions\ntoward and around women” was an “open secret” at meetings of astronomers.As\npart of her response to these cases, Ms. Napolitano set up a committee that\nwill review and approve punishments for those who are found to have violated\nsexual harassment and sexual violence policies. The committee, she wrote in a\nletter last week to the chancellors in the University of California system,\nwould ensure that responses were “consistent with the serious nature” of the\noffenses.Next month, Ms. Napolitano will receive an update on cases involving\nfaculty from the President’s Task Force on Preventing and Responding to Sexual\nViolence and Sexual Assault, which she set up in 2014.Some students and alumni\nremain skeptical.“Time and time again, universities when they are faced with\nproblems like this set up a task force. That looks good on paper,” said Sofie\nKarasek, a Berkeley graduate who is the co-founder of the group End Rape on\nCampus.Ms. Karasek, who says she was sexually assaulted in 2012 by a fellow\nstudent when she was a freshman at Berkeley, is a complainant in the civil\nsuit against the university.In an email on Thursday, she described the\nuniversity’s overall response as the bare minimum “they can get away\nwith.”“Berkeley is merely waiting for this issue to dissipate from the public\neye,” she said.\n\n","title":"Sexual Harassment Cases Tarnish Berkeley’s Image as a Center of Social Activism - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTNational: A dean resigned.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01539"},"content":"SAN FRANCISCO — Robert Reed, who is enjoying a surprising career turn as a\nbusy tour guide at the latest hot spot here, stood smiling one recent sunny\nmorning before 10 foreign dignitaries and journalists. They included the mayor\nof Genoa, Italy, and the general consuls from Italy, Canada and\nSwitzerland.Each visitor wore a sport coat and tie, and a yellow safety vest\nto ensure they wouldn’t be run down by garbage trucks.“It’s always nice to\nmeet new friends from around the world,” Mr. Reed said in his introduction,\nbeaming. “In fact, we’ve had visitors from 58 countries.” Behind him stood a\nwarehouse filled with a 630-ton mountain of refuse being pecked by sea gulls.\n“Come on,” Mr. Reed continued, “I’ll show you the bottles, cans and paper.”You\nwon’t find San Francisco’s Pier 96 in any travel guidebook but it has become a\nmust-see destination for visitors from Afghanistan to Vietnam. They’ve come to\nexplore Recology — Mr. Reed is a spokesman — one of the world’s most advanced\nrecycling plants, a deafening, Rube Goldberg system of conveyor belts and\nsorters that, with the help of human hands, untangles a 30-foot hill of debris\ncollected by trucks every day from across the city.“It’s like a modern art\ninstallation,” marveled Mauro Battocchi, the Italian consul general here. “So\nfabulous — the people and machines and objects of our lives all working\ntogether.”Foreign officials and others come here to pick up tips on how to\nhandle their own mushrooming piles of garbage back home. As the world’s\npopulation grows, people are consuming more, creating more trash, and\ncountries are looking for ways to deal with it that put less stress on the\nenvironment.Many are part of a growing movement sometimes called Zero Waste or\nthe Circular Economy. It entails trying to eliminate tough-to-recycle items\nlike flimsy plastic bags and also pioneering new ways to recycle or compost\neverything else. Often, cities around the world have led the way, including\nPortland, Ore.; Seattle; and Milan, as well as the Basque region in Spain.\nThat has given rise to a trash tourism circuit.Recycling sites “don’t have to\nmarket themselves,” said Jessica Morrison, an environmental policy analyst for\nthe Fraser Valley Regional District in British Columbia, who helped organize a\ntour in 2014 for a dozen officials to visit a recycling plant in Montgomery,\nAla. “People like us are knocking down the doors.”And the interest remains\ndespite strained recycling economics caused by falling oil prices. That has\ndriven down the cost of new commodities, like plastic, and, in turn, the price\nof recycled materials sorted and sold by companies like Recology.More broadly,\nskeptics contend that the energy and other resource costs required to recycle\nsome items are not worth the investment. But the visitors to Recology tend to\nbe among the converted, who believe that incineration and landfilling carry\ntheir own devastating, long-term ecological costs.Recology, a private company,\ngets most of its operating budget from the monthly fee of $35.18 it charges\neach household for residential trash, recycling and compost.Mr. Reed says the\nRecology operation is cost effective, at least by one measure: San Franciscans\npay the same amount or less than residents of other Bay Area big cities do for\ncurbside pickup, but they compost or recycle a greater percentage of their\ngarbage.This success is partly why San Francisco’s plant has achieved\nsomething approaching celebrity status, with numerous write-ups, including a\nbig spread in France’s Le Monde newspaper; visits from some 50 film crews,\nmostly for television; and roles in two major movies: the 2012 documentary\n“Trashed,” featuring the British actor Jeremy Irons, and the popular new\nFrench documentary “Demain,” about solutions to global problems.San Francisco\nhas become a recycling model for some cities, including Paris. The city’s\ndeputy mayor, Mao Peninou, visited in October 2014 and said Recology’s\ncomposting now serves as a proof-of-concept for new Parisian efforts along the\nsame lines.Recology continues to draw visitors even though it is “not state of\nthe art,” said Jack Macy, the Zero Waste coordinator for San Francisco. He\nacknowledged that other places have pulled ahead with newer technology, and\nnoted that San Francisco itself originally drew inspiration from Germany,\nwhich was recycling and beginning to compost in the 1980s.Today, San Francisco\ndiverts around 80 percent of waste away from landfills, putting it among the\nelite recycling cities. (And Recology plans to spend $11 million to upgrade\nits facility in the next year to deal with more packaging from online\nshopping.)San Francisco also has a world-class reputation for its composting\nprocesses, which turns food waste into fine, coffee-like grounds that is sent\nto farms as fertilizer.The Recology tour starts at Pier 96, an industrial hub\nat the city’s southern edge, inside the doors of a cavernous, 200,000-square-\nfoot warehouse.The first step is the separation of all recyclable garbage,\nwith tractors scooping up piles and pouring them onto five conveyor belts. It\ntravels up to the first culling level, where human “classifiers” wearing\nmasks, gloves and aprons pull out the biggest pieces of cardboard and drop\nthem down chutes where they are baled.A few feet later, everything else\nbustles up a fast-moving moving ladder that carries the lighter paper to the\ntop, while heavier cans and bottles fall back down. The bottles and cans are\nthen divided.Farther along, an optical sorter uses a beam of light to\ndetermine which plastic bottles are clear and which ones are colored. The\nclear ones are flipped off the belt by puffs of air.“It’s Willy Wonka’s\neverything-you-can-imagine recycling place,” Mr. Reed said during the recent\ntour. The former freelance reporter for The San Francisco Chronicle loves\ntalking about recycling and composting so much that it is as enjoyable “as a\nwoman asking if she can give me a back rub.” he says.Mr. Reed likes to explain\nthat Recology is a private, employee-owned company that has created around 210\njobs, most of them drawn from Bayview-Hunters Point, one of the city’s poorest\nneighborhoods, where the plant is.“It’s the Silicon Valley of recycling,” said\nChristian Forthomme, chief executive of RealChange, a Bay Area-based\nconsulting firm that brings foreign executives and officials to visit Silicon\nValley, including four delegations to Recology in the past six years.One group\nincluded Bruno Hug de Larauze, president of the Chamber of Commerce in\nBrittany, France, who likens Recology to an Uber or Airbnb for waste that\nshows how technology and capitalism can change the world. Plus, the place is\njust impressive, Mr. de Larauze said.“It was the wow effect. It was\nincredible,” he said of his first visit (he’s been twice), and added with a\nlaugh, “It smelled, let me be frank.”After the tour with Genoa’s mayor and the\nconsuls general, Mr. Reed organized a lunch of salad with French and Italian\ncheeses. As they sat down to eat, Mr. Reed raised the possibility of another\ndestination for the group.“I hope you’ll get a chance to visit our composting\nfacility,” he told the dignitaries. “But we probably don’t want to talk about\nthat while you’re eating.”\n\n","title":"San Francisco, ‘the Silicon Valley of Recycling’ - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NYTScience: San Francisco is so trendy that foreign dignitaries flock to see its heaping piles of waste https://t.co/qLQeuT76Id https:/…","date":"Sun Mar 27 19:50:03 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714177684553744385"},"retweets":64},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1UfMxSI"}

The Cosby sections will include\njust a few objects that recognize his work as a comedian, his work on the\ntelevision programs “I Spy” and “The Cosby Show,” and his support of black\nHollywood stuntmen.Curators at the museum said that they felt his achievements\nshould stand alone.How to handle Mr. Cosby’s legacy is just one of the\ndifficult decisions faced by the museum as it tries to tell the story of black\nhistory and culture in America. The museum’s 11 inaugural exhibitions will,\namong other things, focus on slavery, segregation, music and the military.The\nmuseum’s director, Lonnie G. Bunch, has said that the museum seeks to strike a\nbalance, showing personal suffering and acts of oppression as well as the\ngreat achievements and resilience that constitute the African-American\nexperience. He has said he understands that, given the subject matter, not\neveryone will be happy with all of the curatorial decision-making.Mr. Cosby,\n78, who has denied the accusations against him, is to be included alongside\nother popular entertainment figures in an exhibition titled “Taking the\nStage.”The Smithsonian Institution faced questions last year when its National\nMuseum of African Art featured works on loan from the substantial art\ncollection of Mr. Cosby and his wife, Camille.The Smithsonian eventually put\nup a sign telling visitors that the museum did not condone the behavior of\nwhich Mr. Cosby is accused.The situation at the new history and culture museum\nis different from that one, Smithsonian officials have said, noting that Mr.\nCosby’s presence in it will be minimal and that he has not donated money or\nobjects to it.Still, Kristina Ruehli, another woman who has accused Mr. Cosby\nof assault, said she did not think Mr. Cosby deserved to be celebrated by the\nmuseum, and that, if the curators did include him, they should mention the\naccusations.Beth Ferrier, who has also accused Mr. Cosby of assault, agreed.\n“A label is the only way I would agree to it,” she said. “We’ve been labeled.”\n\n","title":"Museum’s Plan to Include Cosby Material Draws Criticism From Accusers - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Bill Cosby's accusers are upset that a new museum plans to include the entertainer, but omit the assault allegations https://t.co/lkVei7Fd4P","date":"Sun Mar 27 19:20:07 +0000 2016","favs":193,"id":{"$numberLong":"714170150073851906"},"retweets":143},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1PyUqKY"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0153b"},"content":"CHICAGO — Mayor Rahm Emanuel has informed some city leaders that he has chosen\nan interim superintendent of police, rejecting three candidates that had been\nrecommended by the police board, as he seeks to repair Chicago’s fractured\nrelationship with its police force.Eddie Johnson, the Police Department’s\nchief of patrol, was asked to take the job as interim police superintendent,\nsaid Anthony Beale, the alderman for Chicago’s Ninth Ward. The selection was\nreported by The Chicago Sun-Times late Saturday.The choice of Chief Johnson,\nwho is African-American and a 27-year veteran of the force, suggested that the\nmayor believed an insider was needed to help restore the community’s trust in\nthe department.The job at the helm of Chicago’s roughly 12,000 officers, which\npays $260,000, is among the toughest in American law enforcement. Chief\nJohnson would face challenges of rising violence; bruised officer morale; and\ncommunity relations, particularly with African-Americans, that have been\nstrained by outrage over police misconduct. The move by Mr. Emanuel signaled\nhis disapproval of three candidates who had been presented this month by the\nChicago Police Board.Under city ordinance, Mr. Emanuel is required to choose\nthe police superintendent from the slate of recommendations offered by the\npolice board. If he intends to install Chief Johnson in the job permanently,\nhe will have to ask him to apply and request that the board conduct a new\nsearch.The board had whittled down a field of 39 applicants to three: Cedric\nL. Alexander, the chief of police of DeKalb County, Ga.; Anne Kirkpatrick, a\nformer police chief of Spokane, Wash.; and Eugene Williams, a deputy police\nsuperintendent in Chicago and the chief of the Bureau of Support Services.It\nwas unclear why the mayor went off script. Kelley Quinn, a spokeswoman, said\nSunday that Mr. Emanuel had spent more than three months researching the\nhiring decision, and that he would be making an announcement about his choice\n“in the coming days.”“The mayor’s choice for the next superintendent will be\none of the most important decisions he makes,” Ms. Quinn wrote in an email.In\na separate statement, Ms. Quinn explained Mr. Emanuel’s decision to reject the\nthree finalists. “While each of the finalists had strong qualifications, the\nmayor did not feel that any of them were the complete package that Chicago\nneeds at this time and thus none were offered the position,” Ms. Quinn wrote.\n“The mayor called each of them individually late Saturday to let them know of\nhis decision.”The police board said in a statement on Sunday that it had not\nbeen notified of any decision. “The board will be taking no action until it\nreceives such notification,” Lori Lightfoot, the panel’s president, said in\nthe statement.Chief Johnson would replace the interim superintendent, John J.\nEscalante, who was not among the finalists, though he did apply.Mr. Beale, the\nalderman, who is a member of the City Council’s black caucus, said he\nsupported the mayor’s decision. “Eddie Johnson knows Chicago,” he wrote in an\nemail. “He knows the Police Department and the challenges facing our\nneighborhoods. He is a true leader and will bring the fundamental changes\nC.P.D. needs right now.”Public anger over the use of force by the department\nhas put intense pressure on city leaders since November, when Jason Van Dyke,\na white officer, was charged with first-degree murder in the shooting death of\nLaquan McDonald, a black teenager. The public release of video footage of the\nshooting fanned outrage and led to weeks of protests.In the fallout, the\nJustice Department announced an investigation into the Police Department, and\nin December Mr. Emanuel abruptly fired Garry F. McCarthy, then the\nsuperintendent.Mr. Emanuel’s choice for superintendent also posed high\npolitical stakes for him. He has faced fierce criticism over the police, and\nsome have even called for his resignation.In statements announcing earlier\npromotions in Chief Johnson’s career, the Police Department portrayed him as\nan officer with “vast experience” in sometimes difficult settings. He was\npromoted in December to chief of patrol.Mr. Emanuel is not the first Chicago\nmayor to circumvent the police board in selecting a superintendent. In 2007,\nMayor Richard M. Daley rejected the board’s three recommendations and instead\nnamed Jody P. Weis, an outsider, to lead the department.\n\n","title":"Rahm Emanuel Picks Eddie Johnson as Chicago’s Interim Police Chief - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel picks Eddie Johnson as the city's interim police chief https://t.co/Iejmx27kJL","date":"Sun Mar 27 18:54:06 +0000 2016","favs":91,"id":{"$numberLong":"714163605898457090"},"retweets":67},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/22FsP7A"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0153c"},"content":"Facing a storm of criticism over its plan to show a documentary about the\nwidely debunked link between vaccines and autism, the Tribeca Film Festival on\nSaturday pulled the film from its schedule next month.In a statement, Robert\nDe Niro, a founder of the festival, wrote: “My intent in screening this film\nwas to provide an opportunity for conversation around an issue that is deeply\npersonal to me and my family. But after reviewing it over the past few days\nwith the Tribeca Film Festival team and others from the scientific community,\nwe do not believe it contributes to or furthers the discussion I had hoped\nfor.”The film, “Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,” was directed and co-\nwritten by Andrew Wakefield, the author of a study that was published in the\nBritish medical journal The Lancet and then retracted in 2010. Mr. Wakefield’s\nmedical license was also revoked over his failure to disclose financial\nconflicts of interest and ethics violations.Information about the film no\nlonger appears on the festival’s website, but on Friday, the site,\ntribecafilm.com, did not mention Mr. Wakefield’s revoked license or the 2010\nretraction, saying instead that the study “would catapult Wakefield into\nbecoming one of the most controversial figures in the history of medicine.”\nAnd on Twitter, Mr. Wakefield described the film as a “whistle-blower\ndocumentary.”A festival spokeswoman said on Saturday that she had no further\ncomment about what specifically in the film raised concerns for Mr. De Niro\nafter he initially added it to the festival. The film was to have been shown\njust once, on April 24, and was to be followed by a discussion with the\ndirector and subjects of the film.Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of\npreventive medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, said on\nSaturday that he believed “the entire board as well as Mr. De Niro have\nlearned a lot in the last several days.”“My hat is off to them for listening,\nthinking about it, discussing it and responding,” he said.Nevertheless, Dr.\nSchaffner said, it was troubling for scientists that a film promoting\n“discredited ideas” got so close to a forum as prestigious as the Tribeca Film\nFestival.“It gave these fraudulent ideas a face and a position and an energy\nthat many of us thought they didn’t deserve,” he said. “We’re all for ongoing\nreasonable debate and discussion, but these are ideas that have been proven to\nbe incorrect many, many, many times over the past 15 years.”When the\nfestival’s plan to show the film was made public on Tuesday, filmmakers and\nmedical experts were vocal in their condemnation of it. The documentarian\nPenny Lane (“Our Nixon”) posted an open letter on Thursday in Filmmaker\nMagazine telling the festival that the screening “threatens the credibility of\nnot just the other filmmakers in your doc slate, but the field in general.”On\nSaturday, Ms. Lane said she was “amazed” that the festival had decided to\ncancel the film screening. In an email, she described it as a “momentous and\nsignificant” moment for documentary filmmaking.“This is completely\nunprecedented,” she said. “Has a documentary film ever been pulled from a\nfestival lineup once revealed to be a fraud? I really don’t think\nso.”Nevertheless, Ms. Lane said she feared that on some level the damage had\nalready been done by drawing attention to Mr. Wakefield’s work and granting it\na seal of approval, however brief.”This wasn’t about exposure; it was about\ncredibility,” she said. “The kind of credibility an A-list film festival, or\nany important, respected gatekeeper, can give you, especially once you’ve been\ndiscredited by everyone else.”Now that the film had been pulled from the\nlineup, Mr. Wakefield and supporters of his work can champion it as a\ndocumentary that has been “banned” by the powers that be, “and that will add\nto his conspiracy theory aura,” she said.Doctors and infectious disease\nexperts also spoke out. “Unless the Tribeca Film Festival plans to\ndefinitively unmask Andrew Wakefield, it will be yet another disheartening\nchapter where a scientific fraud continues to occupy a spotlight,” Dr. Mary\nAnne Jackson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Missouri-Kansas\nCity, said in an interview on Friday.As the criticism mounted on Friday, Mr.\nDe Niro defended the film, saying that he and his wife, Grace Hightower, have\na child with autism and that “we believe it is critical that all of the issues\nsurrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined.”\n\n","title":"Robert De Niro Pulls Anti-Vaccine Documentary From Tribeca Film Festival - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"Robert De Niro pulls an anti-vaccine documentary from the Tribeca Film Festival https://t.co/drSwhcUIzz https://t.co/22oTIQrHLQ","date":"Sun Mar 27 18:45:06 +0000 2016","favs":498,"id":{"$numberLong":"714161339741167622"},"retweets":254},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1RI431B"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0153d"},"content":"HAVANA — Five decades after his music was banned in this Communist country,\nMick Jagger stood — and sang, jumped and performed his signature dance moves —\nbefore hundreds of thousands of adoring fans Friday night in Cuba and\ndeclared: “Times are changing.”“We know that years back it was hard to hear\nour music in Cuba,” Mr. Jagger said in Spanish, alluding to the years that\nAmerican and British rock music were forbidden here. “Here we are.” It was a\nbit of an understatement at the start of a free two-hour outdoor Rolling\nStones concert at the Ciudad Deportiva sports facility that capped a whirlwind\nweek of “firsts.” Days after a visit by President Obama and a Tampa Bay Rays\nexhibition game, the show took on outsize symbolism that was hard to\nexaggerate.In a nation where people long stifled by a repressive government\nfeel as if they are on the cusp of a broad transformation, Cuban music fans\nhoped Mr. Jagger would break down the gates to political and social change\nthat Cuban leaders had already cracked open. “Big things start with something\nsmall,” said Andres Martinez of San Francisco, who attended with his\ngirlfriend, who lives in Cuba. “Five years from now, they’re going to be\nsaying: ‘It started with the Rolling Stones.’ ”His girlfriend, Madelaine\nTamayo Ortíz, a singer from Havana, chimed in: “Something is going to happen.\nSomething better,” she said. “Beyond music, this concert was a ‘yes’ to\nunity.”But lest anyone forget the political context: Cellphone service was\ndown citywide during the concert, leading many people to suspect that the\ngovernment had blocked the signal to keep the audience from communicating.\n(Others guessed that the system had simply crashed.) Security was tight at the\norderly show.The Rolling Stones gave a stunning performance of 18 of their\nclassics to locals and foreigners, many of whom had never seen such a\nspectacle. Cubans marveled at the three-story-high jumbo screens, enormous\nthundering speakers and camera towers, wondering how much the production cost\nand grateful that the band had agreed to free admission.In other Latin\nAmerican cities the band has visited on its current Olé tour, tickets went for\nover $500, and fans here saw the decision to perform for free as a nod to the\npercolating sense that Cuba was on the verge of something big. Earlier this\nmonth, the D.J. and producer Diplo brought his group, Major Lazer, to Havana\nfor a large free show that mostly catered to a young audience; the Rolling\nStones’ crowd was filled with fans of all ages and foreigners who traveled\nfrom the United States, Britain and even as far as Australia.The band kicked\noff the show with “Jumpin’ Jack Flash,” and bedazzled the audience with an\nanimation featuring red moving drawings of a pentagon and crosses that aired\nduring “Sympathy for the Devil.” The concert ended, of course, with\n“Satisfaction.” Mr. Jagger spoke several times in Spanish, telling the\naudience how he ate fish and chips at the British Embassy but preferred rice\nand beans at a paladar — a private restaurant. He made the point to always\npronounce Cuba as it is said in Spanish: “koo-bah.”“You have to understand, we\nhave never seen such a thing,” said Tatiana Corrales, a construction company\nadministrator who attended the concert with her 25-year-old daughter and her\ndaughter’s friends. “For us, a concert is a little platform where you get to\ndance a little and have a nice time. This has been a really convulsive week\nfor Cuba. We’re leaving behind the capsule we’ve been in for over 50\nyears.”Ms. Corrales said the concert was especially meaningful for people of\nher generation, who were born at the start of the 1959 Communist revolution\nand were forced to listen to the Rolling Stones and the Beatles in secret on\nsmuggled records. For years, she had no idea what Mr. Jagger or Keith Richards\nlooked like.“If there’s something that opens political doors, it’s music,” Ms.\nCorrales said. “Music has no barriers, not gender, race, or economic.”\n\n","title":"Another First for Cuba: A Concert by the Rolling Stones - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytimesworld: Another first for Cuba: a concert by the Rolling Stones https://t.co/PmUDrCfcnk https://t.co/8rLRifclnV","date":"Sun Mar 27 18:24:30 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714156154658680833"},"retweets":158},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1WSkarz"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0153e"},"content":"_Over two telephone conversations on Friday, Donald J. Trump, the Republican\npresidential candidate, discussed his views on foreign policy with Maggie\nHaberman and David E. Sanger of The New York Times. Here are some excerpts we\nhighlighted (and an edited transcript)._**On whether he would be willing for\nthe United States to be the first to use nuclear weapons in a confrontation\nwith adversaries: **“An absolute last step. ... I personally think it’s\nbiggest problem the world has, nuclear capability ... And the first one to use\nthem, I think that would be a very bad thing. And I will tell you, I would\nvery much not want to be the first one to use them, that I can say.”_____**On\nwhether the United States should spy on its allies, and whether President\nObama was right to stop the listening in on Angela Merkel’s cellphone:**“You\nknow, I’d rather not say that. I would like to see what they’re doing. Because\nyou know, many countries, I can’t say Germany, but many countries are spying\non us. I think that was a great disservice done by Edward Snowden. That I can\ntell you.”_____**On whether to allow Japan and South Korea to build their own\nnuclear arsenal:**“It’s a position that at some point is something that _we_\nhave to talk about, and if the United States keeps on its path, its current\npath of weakness, they’re going to want to have that anyway with or without me\ndiscussing it, because I don’t think they feel very secure in what’s going on\nwith our country.”_____**On whether he would withdraw United States forces\nfrom Japan and South Korea if those countries do not increase their payments\nto cover the costs of those troops:**“Yes, I would. I would not do so happily,\nbut I would be willing to do it... We cannot afford to be losing vast amounts\nof billions of dollars on all of this... And I have a feeling that they’d up\nthe ante very much. I think they would, and if they wouldn’t I would really\nhave to say yes.”_____**On his standards for using American troops abroad,\nsuch as for homeland protection, for humanitarian intervention, or to aid\nallies:**“It sounds nice to say, ‘I have a blanket standard; here’s what it\nis.’ No. 1 is the protection of our country, O.K.? That’s always going to be\nNo. 1, by far. That’s by a factor of 100... After that it depends on the\ncountry, the region, how friendly they’ve been toward us. You have countries\nthat haven’t been friendly to us that we’re protecting. So it’s how good\nthey’ve been toward us, etc., etc.”_____**On recent American engagement in the\nMiddle East: **“If you would go back 15 years ago, and I’m not saying it was\nonly Obama, it was Obama’s getting out, it was other people’s getting in, but\nyou go back 15 years ago, and I say this: If our presidents would have just\ngone to the beach and enjoyed the ocean and the sun, we would’ve been much\nbetter off in the Middle East, than all of this tremendous death, destruction,\nand you know, monetary loss.”_____**On whether he would stop buying oil from\nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates if those countries refused to send\nground troops to fight ISIS:**“There’s two answers to that. The answer is,\nprobably yes, but I would also say this: We are not being reimbursed for our\nprotection... You know, Saudi Arabia... the amount of money they have is\nphenomenal. But we protect countries, and take tremendous monetary hits on\nprotecting countries. ... And yet, without us, Saudi Arabia wouldn’t exist for\nvery long. It would be, you know, a catastrophic failure without our\nprotection.”_____**On the United States’ fight against ISIS and our efforts to\nseek a political accord between President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and rebel\nforces: **“Well, I thought the approach of fighting Assad and ISIS\nsimultaneously was madness, and idiocy. They’re fighting each other and yet\nwe’re fighting both of them. You know, we were fighting both of them. I think\nthat our far bigger problem than Assad is ISIS, I’ve always felt that. Assad\nis, you know I’m not saying Assad is a good man, ’cause he’s not, but our far\ngreater problem is not Assad, it’s ISIS.”_____**On summing up his worldview as\n‘America First’:**“I’m not isolationist, but I am ‘America First.’ So I like\nthe expression... We have been disrespected, mocked, and ripped off for many,\nmany years by people that were smarter, shrewder, tougher. We were the big\nbully, but we were not smartly led... The big stupid bully, and we were\nsystematically ripped off by everybody. From China to Japan to South Korea to\nthe Middle East... protecting Saudi Arabia and not being properly\nreimbursed... I mean they were making a billion dollars a day before the oil\nwent down... The whole thing is preposterous... We will not be ripped off\nanymore, we’re going to be friendly with everybody, but we’re not going to be\ntaken advantage of by anybody.”_____**On his recent comments questioning the\neffectiveness of NATO and its ability to combat terrorism:**“I’ll tell you the\nproblems I have with NATO. No. 1, we pay far too much. ... NATO is unfair. ...\nBecause it really helps them more so than the United States, and we pay a\ndisproportionate share. Now, I’m a person that – you notice I talk about\neconomics quite a bit, in these military situations, because it is about\neconomics, because we don’t have money anymore because we’ve been taking care\nof so many people in so many different forms that we don’t have money. ... So\nNATO is something that at the time was excellent. Today, it has to be changed.\nIt has to be changed to include terror. It has to be changed from the\nstandpoint of cost because the United States bears far too much of the cost of\nNATO.”_____**On whether Russia will end up dominating Ukraine:**“Well, unless,\nunless there is, you know, somewhat of a resurgence frankly from people that\nare around it. Or they would ask us for help. But they don’t ask us for help.\nThey’re not even asking us for help. They’re literally not even talking about\nit, and these are the countries that border the Ukraine.”_____**On how he\nwould combat China’s assertiveness over islands in the South China Sea:**“We\nhave great economic — and people don’t understand this — but we have\ntremendous economic power over China. ... And that’s the power of trade.\nBecause they use us as their bank, as their piggy bank, they take — but they\ndon’t have to pay us back. It’s better than a bank because they take money out\nbut then they don’t have to pay us back.”_____**On why he wants to avoid being\ntoo specific about his foreign policy plans: **“A politician would say, ‘Oh I\nwould never go to war,’ or they’d say, ‘Oh I would go to war.’ I don’t want to\nsay what I’d do because, again, we need unpredictability. ... The problem we\nhave is that, maybe because it’s a democracy and maybe because we have to be\nso open — maybe because you have to say what you have to say in order to get\nelected — who knows? But I wouldn’t want to say. I wouldn’t want them to know\nwhat my real thinking is.”\n\n","title":"Highlights From Our Interview With Donald Trump on Foreign Policy - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @nytpolitics: Here are the highlights from @sangernyt and @maggienyt's interview with Donald Trump about foreign policy https://t.co/mNP…","date":"Sun Mar 27 16:53:48 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714133328039972865"},"retweets":52},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/25qYhFx"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f0153f"},"content":"WASHINGTON — Twice a day, for breakfast and lunch, Benjamin R. Civiletti,\nattorney general to President Jimmy Carter, invited his seven special\nassistants — mostly young graduates of the nation’s most prestigious law\nschools — to his private dining room at the Justice Department for casual\nconversation or friendly debate.Merrick B. Garland, fresh from a Supreme Court\nclerkship, 26 and looking years younger, showed little interest in chitchat.\nEven in staff meetings, he spoke so rarely that some colleagues figured him\nfor shy or insecure.But it became clear over time that Mr. Garland was\nsilently working out his arguments, processing facts and testing alternatives.\nSurrounded by overachievers in a city full of people clamoring to be heard, he\nwas waiting until he had something to say.“He has a tendency to save up his\npoints, and when he finally speaks up, his points come out almost like a\nGatling gun,” said Lovida H. Coleman Jr., who worked with him back then and\nremains a close friend. “Not in an unpleasant way, not in a way of showing\noff. He was smart and to the point.”Mr. Garland, now chief judge of the\nfederal appeals court in Washington and President Obama’s nominee to the\nSupreme Court, has deftly navigated the capital’s high-powered legal circles\nfor decades.In a city where ambition is often rewarded when accompanied by\npartisan loyalty, he has pulled off a rare feat, advancing as a centrist whose\nhallmark is finding the middle ground. His sharp mind — he was a standout in\nhigh school and at Harvard, and won clerkships with legal luminaries — has\nlong commanded attention. Mr. Civiletti liked to tease Mr. Garland’s fellow\nassistants that he had a “résumé that makes you want to cry.”Other judges, law\nschool classmates and old friends describe his ability to deliver solutions,\nidentifying areas of agreement, sometimes on narrow grounds, when people are\nsharply divided.“The essence of who you are is who you are at an early stage,”\nsaid Abbe D. Lowell, a Washington lawyer who worked alongside Mr. Garland as a\nfellow assistant to Mr. Civiletti. “Not only is he book smart, but he’s really\nable to use all of that intelligence to forge consensus.”In his rise to the\ntop, Judge Garland, 63, has made canny decisions: choosing the Justice\nDepartment aide job rather than starting his career at a prominent law firm;\nlater leaving a lucrative partnership to get trial experience as a federal\nprosecutor. He calls himself “an accidental judge,” because he was offered a\njudicial appointment while in line for a top Justice Department position.“Look\nat his record,” Ms. Coleman said. “Every choice is virtually perfect.”He was\nguided in the ways of Washington and the law by various mentors: a Supreme\nCourt justice, an Illinois congressman-turned-judge, a former corporate\nlawyer. But Judge Garland has thrived in part, many from both parties say,\nsimply because he is nice. Several people used similar, somewhat surprising,\nlanguage to describe the tough-minded legal advocate: “a sweet spirit,” Frank\nKeating, the former Oklahoma governor and a Republican, put it.From his days\nas a high school student leader in the Chicago suburbs in the tumultuous late\n1960s — where he spoke up for free speech yet shunned protests against the\nVietnam War — to his time at the hypercompetitive Harvard Law Review, and\nthrough his years in Washington, Judge Garland has accumulated friends and\nseemingly made few enemies.But when it comes to a Supreme Court confirmation\nprocess, his careful course could hurt as much as it helps. With Republican\nleaders refusing to hold hearings on his nomination and insisting that Mr.\nObama’s successor should pick the next justice, conservative advocacy groups\nsay there is proof, like his votes on gun rights or the fact that he\nvolunteered for Democrats like Bill Clinton and Michael Dukakis, that he is\nhardly as moderate as he may seem. Those on the left have their own complaints\n— that he is not a bold thinker or reliably liberal — but have mostly held\nback.“He’s not an intellectual leader of the left or the right,” observed Tom\nGoldstein, an appellate lawyer and the founder of SCOTUSblog, a website\ndevoted to Supreme Court news. “The people out there cheering for the Garland\nnomination are the professional legal class in Washington, D.C.,” Mr.\nGoldstein said. “What you don’t see are the progressive, committed liberals\nsaying, ‘Here’s our guy, let’s march into battle for him.’ ”Judge Garland,\naware that he is in for a tough slog, is “focused but calm,” said Senator\nChuck Schumer, the New York Democrat, who overlapped with him at Harvard and\nmet with him in the Capitol last week. In a 2013 panel discussion, titled Life\nLessons Learned, the judge revealed his approach to dealing with the harshness\nof the city that has been the backdrop to his life’s work.“They tell you in\nWashington that if you want a friend, get a dog,” he said then. “That is not\ntrue. Get a family. This is a hard place to be.”Slightly built, with a full\nhead of gray hair and a still-boyish face, Judge Garland is meticulous — to\ndeal with partial colorblindness, he used to keep a list of which ties go with\nwhich suits — and easygoing by nature.His success in Washington seems rooted\nin skills he learned growing up, said Barry Rosen, who first knew him as a Cub\nScout and went on to Harvard Law with him. “He didn’t draw attention to\nhimself” and “he was always a listener,” his old friend recalled.Today, he has\na talent for letting others talk about themselves. Whether in a meeting or at\na party, he leans slightly toward whoever is speaking, head nodding. “He’s\nabsorbing what he hears and integrating it,” said Martha Minow, the dean at\nHarvard Law School.The future judge intended to be a doctor, not a lawyer,\nwhen he arrived at Harvard in 1970 from the Chicago suburbs, where he was\nraised in a family of modest means with a deep connection to their Jewish\nroots. (He saw medicine, and later law, as “a helping profession,” his sister,\nJill Roter, said.) His mother served on the school board; his father ran a\nsmall advertising business out of the family’s basement; they helped found a\nsynagogue in what was once a fish store. One grandfather, a Russian immigrant,\nwas a lawyer, handling wills and traffic court matters in a one-man shop.In\nhigh school, Judge Garland was a star debater, the class valedictorian, an\nactor who sang show tunes (including the title song from “Hair”), a teenager\nwho took an exchange student to the prom because he worried she would not have\na date. He was so well regarded that when Fred Eisenhammer, a classmate and a\nfreelance sportswriter, claimed in The Chicago Tribune last week that Judge\nGarland blocked him in a relay race at summer day camp during junior high\nschool, his old friends rebuked him, Mr. Eisenhammer says, insisting that\n“Merrick was the best.”His parents were Democrats, though not activists; as a\nyoung man, Mr. Garland spent two summers volunteering for his hometown\ncongressman, Abner Mikva, an outspoken liberal Democrat. (To this day, Ms.\nRoter said, she does not know her brother’s party affiliation.)He navigated\nthrough a political controversy at Harvard in 1973, as the Vietnam War was\nwinding down — and seemed to come out on both sides. At issue was whether to\nhold a student referendum on whether Harvard should reinstate a Reserve\nOfficers’ Training Corps (R.O.T.C.) program. As a member of a student\ncommittee, Mr. Garland joined a unanimous vote, under pressure from a leftist\ngroup, to hold the referendum. Then, after resistance by the Harvard\nadministration, he joined a unanimous vote against holding it. In the process,\nhe never divulged his own view of bringing back R.O.T.C.At Harvard Law School,\nas articles editor of the Law Review, Mr. Garland took on a delicate task,\nhandling a submission by Justice William J. Brennan Jr. of the Supreme Court,\nfor whom he would eventually clerk. He was friendly with both liberals and\nconservatives, said Michael Chertoff, who was also on staff and went on to\nbecome secretary of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush.“I don’t\nthink he was ever viewed in a particular camp,” Mr. Chertoff said. “He was a\nlegal craftsman. He was not an agenda-driven person.”Offers from law firms\nawaited Mr. Garland after he finished two prestigious clerkships, first with a\nfederal appeals court judge, Henry Friendly, and then Justice Brennan, in\n1979. But as someone interested in policy and problem solving, said Robert C.\nPost, a fellow clerk and now dean of Yale Law School, he was “really\ninterested in connecting himself to people who were politically involved.”For\nadvice on making his way in Washington, Mr. Post said, Mr. Garland turned to\nRepresentative Mikva (who later became a federal judge on the same appeals\ncourt where Judge Garland now sits, as well as a mentor to Mr. Obama). They\nwere so close that Judge Mikva later relied on Mr. Garland to vet his\nclerks.In Mr. Civiletti’s office, the future judge kept the attorney general\nbriefed on antitrust matters at a time when the Justice Department was trying\nto break up A.T.\u0026amp;T. and I.B.M., and he also helped address the legal\nfallout from the Iran hostage crisis in 1979. Some aides tried to use their\naccess to push ideological agendas with the attorney general.“That wasn’t\nMerrick,” Mr. Civiletti recalled in an interview. “He was interested in\ngetting the right answer.”As a young Washington lawyer, he developed a group\nof friends he would remain close to for years. They would go to parties at the\nColeman family home, play volleyball or barbecue and dance late into the night\nto the Beach Boys and Otis Redding. Even though he was not skilled, Ms.\nColeman, a Republican, loved dancing with him because he “smiled so much.”In\nthe office, he and the other young assistants were mentored by a colorful\nfigure, Victor H. Kramer, counsel to the attorney general. Mr. Kramer had\nspent more than a decade at the corporate law firm Arnold \u0026amp; Porter before\nquitting to help provide legal services for the poor. He urged lawyers to work\nin public service.“In private practice, I spent my time learning more and more\nabout less and less,” he told the assistants, one of them, Eric L. Richard,\nrecalled.Mr. Garland, who joined Arnold \u0026amp; Porter in 1981, ultimately chose\nmuch the same path. He was so eager to work on trials at the firm, he later\nsaid, that he spent “one winter in Helena, Mont., in minus 50 degrees.” But in\n1989, shortly after becoming a partner, he abruptly quit, trading his\ncorporate office, big paycheck and a portfolio that included antitrust cases,\nto become a workaday prosecutor in the office of the United States attorney\nhere. (His financial disclosure forms show he is nonetheless a wealthy man,\nwith $6 million to $23 million in assets, including trust funds established by\nthe parents of his wife, Lynn.)In 1995, Jamie Gorelick, a top Clinton\nadministration Justice Department official, hired Mr. Garland to be her right-\nhand man. He was known as an exacting, demanding supervisor who often worked\nlate and had high expectations for his staff. But he also found a way to get\nthe best out of people and was quick to give others credit.Years later, he\ntold interviewers: “I like legal problems. I like learning about legal\nproblems. I like cooperating with others in figuring out legal problems.”At\nJustice, Mr. Garland also proved adept in the spotlight. He ran several high-\nprofile national security prosecutions, including the case of Theodore J.\nKaczynski, known as the Unabomber, and the attack at the 1996 Olympics in\nAtlanta.But it was his work on the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah\nFederal Building in Oklahoma City that helped burnish his credentials with\nRepublicans there and his reputation as a problem solver. He also knew how to\nnavigate what Patrick Ryan, the former United States attorney in Oklahoma\nCity, called the “daggone snake pit” of Washington.When Stephen Jones, the\nlawyer for the accused bomber, Timothy J. McVeigh, complained to Mr. Garland\nabout the conduct of a prosecutor, he said, the issue was quickly resolved. (A\nmonth before the president nominated Judge Garland for the Supreme Court, Mr.\nJones, a Republican, wrote a four-page letter to the White House praising him\nas the “ideal nominee.”) When Mr. Ryan, a Democrat, refused Mr. Garland’s\nrequest that he ask Oklahoma City federal judges to recuse themselves, Mr.\nGarland did not insist. He just found someone in Washington to do so.“I’m not\nused to Eastern politics,” Mr. Ryan said. “I found that most everybody with\nthe exception of Merrick that worked in Washington, you have to be careful\nabout trusting them.”During his 19 years on the bench, Judge Garland has tried\nto resist what can be an isolating job. He turns up at investitures, portrait\nunveilings and charity dinners and socializes with members of the city’s legal\nelite. He holds annual summer reunions for his fiercely loyal clerks at his\nhome in Bethesda, Md., serving bagels and lox and cooing over their children,\nwhom he calls his “grand-clerks.”He tutors disadvantaged children and performs\nthe occasional wedding. At the 2000 Nantucket ceremony of Beth Wilkinson, a\ntop aide to him at Justice, and David Gregory, the former host of the NBC\nprogram “Meet the Press,” the nervous judge started the ceremony without the\nbride. “David turned to him,” Ms. Wilkinson recalled, “and said, ‘Merrick,\ndon’t you think we should wait for Beth?’ ”In his chambers at the imposing\nfederal courthouse here, Judge Garland keeps a coffee pot “strategically\nplaced,” he has said, so that he has to walk by the clerks to get to it, and\ncan stop and ask what they are doing.Rather than have them write long memos\nfor him, as is the custom of many other judges, he insists on doing his own\nresearch, for fear that he might miss some nuance or the finer points of an\nargument. Then, he said: “We just argue it out. I pick clerks who can say no\nto me, in a nice way — who can say, ‘That’s wrong, judge, and this is the\nreason why.’ ”His colleagues say that as chief judge, a position he assumed in\n2013, he can find a sliver of common ground and build a decision around that.\nOne pointed to a politically charged case that challenged the\nconstitutionality of a ban on federal contractors making political\ndonations.Judge Garland pulled liberal and conservative judges toward the\nmiddle, issuing an opinion that upheld the law, but on the narrowest grounds.\nThe final vote was 11 to 0; the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal.On the\nbench, he is a tough questioner. “He would often come back from oral arguments\nand his first question to us would be, ‘Do you think I went too far out there?\nDo you think I was too rough?’ ” said one former clerk, Danielle Gray. “We all\nthought, ‘You could not have been nicer in asking these very tough questions.’\n”Having been passed over by Mr. Obama twice — first for Justice Sonia\nSotomayor, and then Justice Elena Kagan, both more palatable to the political\nleft — Judge Garland is, the White House hopes, a man for this moment. Still,\neven with his mostly-in-the-middle record, it may not be enough.“If you wanted\nto game a Supreme Court nomination, you would go to one side or the other,”\nsaid Neal Katyal, former acting solicitor general. “He surely had people\nwhispering in his ear for years to do that.”\n\n","title":"Merrick Garland Is a Deft Navigator of Washington’s Legal Circles - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"How Merrick Garland, President Obama's Supreme Court pick, has navigated D.C.'s legal circles for decades https://t.co/yAlWg1wRCw","date":"Sun Mar 27 16:25:04 +0000 2016","favs":180,"id":{"$numberLong":"714126100541149184"},"retweets":93},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/21Nxsa3"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700d190dea3b36ae7f01540"},"content":"THOSE of us in the news media have sometimes blamed Donald Trump’s rise on the\nRepublican Party’s toxic manipulation of racial resentments over the years.\nBut we should also acknowledge another force that empowered Trump: Us.I polled\na number of journalists and scholars, and there was a broad (though not\nuniversal) view that we in the media screwed up. Our first big failing was\nthat television in particular handed Trump the microphone without adequately\nfact-checking him or rigorously examining his background, in a craven\nsymbiosis that boosted audiences for both.“Trump is not just an instant\nratings/circulation/clicks gold mine; he’s the motherlode,” Ann Curry, the\nformer “Today” anchor, told me. “He stepped on to the presidential campaign\nstage precisely at a moment when the media is struggling against deep\ninsecurities about its financial future. The truth is, the media has needed\nTrump like a crack addict needs a hit.”Curry says she’s embarrassed by the\nunfairness to other Republican candidates, who didn’t get nearly the same\nairtime.An analysis by The Times found that we in the news media gave Trump\n$1.9 billion in free publicity in this presidential cycle. That’s 190 times as\nmuch as he paid for in advertising, and it’s far more than any other candidate\nreceived. As my colleague Jim Rutenberg put it, some complain that “CNN has\nhanded its schedule over to Mr. Trump,” and CNN had lots of company.Larry\nSabato, a politics professor at the University of Virginia, says television\nnetworks “have a lot to answer for.”“We all know it’s about ratings, and Trump\ndelivers,” Sabato says. “You can’t take your eyes off him. When Trump is on, I\nstop what I’m doing and wait for the car crash.”Sabato is particularly\ncritical of Sunday morning news program hosts who have allowed Trump to\n“appear” by telephone, instead of in person.Although many of us journalists\nhave derided Trump, the truth is that he generally outsmarted us (with many\nexceptions, for there truly have been serious efforts to pin him down and to\ninvestigate Trump University and his various business failings). He\nmanipulated television by offering outrageous statements that drew ever more\ncameras — without facing enough skeptical follow-up questions.It’s not that we\nshouldn’t have covered Trump’s craziness, but that we should have aggressively\nprovided context in the form of fact checks and robust examination of policy\nproposals. A candidate claiming that his business acumen will enable him to\nmanage America deserved much more scrutiny of his bankruptcies and mediocre\ninvesting.All politicians spin, of course. But all in all, I’ve never met a\nnational politician in the U.S. who is so ill informed, evasive, puerile and\ndeceptive as Trump.When the fact-check website PolitiFact was ready to choose\nits “lie of the year” for 2015, it found that the only real contenders were\nfalsehoods by Trump. So it lumped them together and awarded the title to “the\nmany campaign misstatements of Donald Trump.”That pattern of prevarication is\nwhat we in the media, especially television, didn’t adequately highlight,\nleaving many voters with the perception that Trump is actually a straight\nshooter.The reason for this passivity goes, I think, to a second failure: We\nwrongly treated Trump as a farce. “The media made a mistake by covering\nTrump’s candidacy at the start as some sort of joke or media prank,” notes\nDanielle S. Allen, a political scientist at Harvard. “The repeated use of\nreferences to ‘the Donald’ across all platforms structured the conversation\naround ironical affection for a celebrity rather than around serious\nconversation of character and policy.”“Trump was quite literally a laugh\nline,” says Ralph Begleiter, a former CNN correspondent and communications\nprofessor at the University of Delaware. Begleiter notes that Sarah Palin\nreceived more serious vetting as a running mate in 2008 than Trump has as a\npresidential candidate.I personally made the mistake of regarding Trump’s\ncandidacy as a stunt, scoffing at the idea that he could be the nominee. Mea\nculpa.We failed to take Trump seriously because of a third media failing: We\nwere largely oblivious to the pain among working-class Americans and thus\ndidn’t appreciate how much his message resonated. “The media has been out of\ntouch with these Americans,” Curry notes.Media elites rightly talk about our\ninsufficient racial, ethnic and gender diversity, but we also lack economic\ndiversity. We inhabit a middle-class world and don’t adequately cover the part\nof America that is struggling and seething. We spend too much time talking to\nsenators, not enough to the jobless.All this said, I have to add that I don’t\nknow if more fact-checking would have mattered. Tom Brokaw of NBC did\noutstanding work challenging Trump, but he says that when journalists have\nindeed questioned Trump’s untrue statements, nothing much happens: “His\nfollowers find fault with the questions, not with his often incomplete,\nerroneous or feeble answers.”Likewise, Bob Schieffer of CBS tells me: “I’m not\nsure more fact-checking would have changed that much. We’re in a new world\nwhere attitude seems to count more than facts.”That may be true. But I still\nthink that we blew it and that this should be a moment for self-reflection in\njournalism.Despite some outstanding coverage of Trump, on the whole we in the\nmedia empowered a demagogue and failed the country. We were lap dogs, not\nwatchdogs.\n\n","title":"My Shared Shame: The Media Helped Make Trump - The New York Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @NickKristof: My column on how we in the news media screwed up, were out of touch \u0026amp;  empowered Trump: https://t.co/bDXc4Sj2ox https://t.…","date":"Sun Mar 27 16:15:04 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714123583765757954"},"retweets":638},"topic":"all","source":"nytimes","link":"http://nyti.ms/1RsyKCm"}
