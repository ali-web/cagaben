We'll see how we're treated. I want to see how\nwe're treated. I want to see how we're treated. Look, I signed a pledge. They\nwanted me to sign the pledge. And I'm the one that's being discriminated\nagainst,\" Trump told host John Dickerson.The billionaire businessman was\nreferring to the pledge he signed last year that committed him to supporting\nthe eventual GOP presidential nominee and that ruled out a third-party bid.\nLast week, Trump reneged on that pledge.Asked where he stands on that pledge\nnow, Trump told Dickerson, \"I want to support the party\" but added he didn't\nwant to \"comment too much on it right now.\"As an example of his feeling\ndiscriminated against, Trump complained about receiving the same number of\ndelegates in Louisiana as Ted Cruz even though he won the state's primary by 3\npercentage points.\"When I go in and win the state of Louisiana and I get less\ndelegates, that's not the way the system's supposed to work,\" Trump said,\nadding that he thinks \"it could be illegal, if you want to know the\ntruth.\"After the delegates were allocated, Trump suggested last week that he\nwould file a complaint over the delegates issue.According to CBS News' latest\ncount, Trump has 737 delegates, Cruz has 460 and John Kasich has 143. A\ncandidate needs 1,237 delegates in order to win the nomination.During the\ninterview, the GOP presidential front-runner rejected the idea that last week\nwas the worst of his campaign.\"I don't see this as the worst week in my\ncampaign. But certainly, I've had some weeks, and you've been reporting on\nthem, where that was the end,\" said Trump, who then suggested that he always\nbounces back from bad weeks with higher poll numbers.Trump addressed the\ncontroversy surrounding his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former\nBreitbart reporter Michelle Fields. Lewandowski was charged last week with\nbattery for grabbing Fields at a press conference last month. Trump has\ndefended him, but said on \"Face the Nation\" that he would have \"fired him\ninstantaneously\" if he had thrown Fields to the ground.He also addressed the\ncomments he made on abortion earlier this week. In the interview, Trump said\nthat current abortion laws shouldn't be changed. In a follow-up statement\nafter the interview, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said he only meant that\n\"until he is president.\"\"Then he will change the law through his judicial\nappointments and allow the states to protect the unborn. There is nothing new\nor different here,\" she said.Trump also called nuclear proliferation the\nworld's \"single biggest problem.\"\"Look, nuclear's a horror show. I would be\nprobably the last to even think about using it. People say, 'You've promised\nnever, ever to use it.' You can't do a thing like that. You have to have cards\non the table,\" he said.Last week, Trump said he would be open to allowing\nSouth Korea and Japan to obtain nuclear weapons and he also declined ruling\nout using nuclear weapons in a military conflict in Europe.\n\n","title":"Trump: \"I'm the one being discriminated against\" - CBS News","twitter":{"body":".@realDonaldTrump: \"I'm the one being discriminated against\" https://t.co/Efps4psX99 https://t.co/FZovSOkREM","date":"Sun Apr 03 14:53:28 +0000 2016","favs":32,"id":{"$numberLong":"716639763059572736"},"retweets":49},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1V2qkaN"}

While still working at Jones Day,\nshe wrangled a part-time job as a local reporter in Washington, D.C.Before\nlong she found herself having to make a choice: \"My local station had made me\na full-time offer. And I thought, 'Wow, if I'm good enough to be full-time\nhere, maybe I'm good enough to be full-time someplace better than here!\" she\nlaughed.\"Better than here\" was Fox News Channel. She joined in 2004.Her legal\nskills -- along with a willingness to take on some of America's big-name\nconservatives -- quickly made Kelly a rising star.Kelly doesn't hold back, and\nshe's equally aggressive in her defense of Fox News.\"I did, and do, believe\nthat there is a left-leaning bias in news, in most of news,\" she said.\"You\nbelieve there's a right wing bias at Fox?

Each side blamed the other for Saturday's escalation, the worst since the end of a full-scale war in 1994.The defense ministry said, in response to pleas from international organizations, it will be unilaterally \"suspending a counter-offensive and response on the territories occupied by Armenia.\" The ministry added it will not focus on fortifying the territory that Azerbaijan has \"liberated.\" It did not elaborate.Nagorno-Karabakh, a region in Azerbaijan, has been under the control of local ethnic Armenian forces and the Armenian military since a war ended in 1994 with no resolution of the region's status. The conflict is fueled by long-simmering tensions between Christian Armenians and mostly Muslim Azeris.Armenian forces also occupy several areas outside Nagorno-Karabakh proper. The sides are separated by a demilitarized buffer zone, but small clashes have broken out frequently.Officials in the self-proclaimed republic of Nagorno-Karabakh promptly disputed the reports of Azerbaijan's unilateral cease-fire. David Babayan, spokesman for the Karabakh president, told The Associated Press on Sunday that they had not seen any signs that fighting was suspended.The defense ministry of Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday also claimed to have restored control over a strategic area near the front line. It said Nagorno-Karabakh forces went on a counter-offensive around the village of Talish after Azerbaijani forces shelled their positions just before dawn. Two Karabakh troops were reported injured.It also said Azerbaijan was using rockets, artillery and armor against the region.Earlier Sunday, a spokesman for Azerbaijan's Defense Ministry, Vagif Dargyakhly, said Azerbaijani positions came under fire overnight and that civilian areas also were hit.On Saturday, Armenia said 18 soldiers were killed and Azerbaijan reported 12 dead.Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed Sunday to back its ally Azerbaijan in the conflict, saying that the flare-up could have been avoided if \"fair and decisive steps\" had been taken.\"We pray our Azerbaijani brothers will prevail in these clashes with the least casualties,\" he said.The unresolved conflict has been an economic blow to Armenia because Turkey has closed its border with Armenia.\n\n","title":"Azerbaijan declares unilateral cease-fire with Armenia - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Azerbaijan declares unilateral cease-fire with Armenia https://t.co/gmQW2CPkq1 https://t.co/WbvWm3W23c","date":"Sun Apr 03 12:44:01 +0000 2016","favs":26,"id":{"$numberLong":"716607186638651394"},"retweets":36},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1SL9km6"}

The attacks were claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS.)Feist said Belgium's biggest airport should be back at around 20 percent of capacity on Monday and able to process 800 passengers an hour. Speaking at a news conference Saturday, he hoped that full service at the airport could be restored by the end of June or the beginning of July in time for the summer vacation season.Prior to the attacks, the key European aviation hub usually handled about 600 flights a day. It served 1.5 million passengers in February.New security measures have been ordered at the airport to minimize the chances of any repeat attacks.Police on Sunday were conducting spot checks of vehicles before they arrive, and a large white tent was set up outside the terminal to screen IDs and travel documents before allowing anyone to enter the building. A drop-off parking area outside the terminal has been closed. There will be no access by rail or public transport to the airport for the foreseeable future.The bombers entered the check-in area with suitcases packed with explosives and nails, and the resulting blasts collapsed the ceiling and shattered windows in addition to killing 16 people.The attacks have prompted a wider discussion among aviation authorities in many countries over whether to impose routine security checks at the entry to airport terminalsUntil the terminal can be fully repaired, Feist said departing passengers will first enter a temporary structure erected on the tarmac, then go to a specially built check-in area.There will be no access by rail or public transport to the airport for the foreseeable future, he said.Delta, meanwhile, said it was suspending service between Atlanta and Brussels until March 2017 due to the continued uncertainty surrounding the airport's re-opening and weakening demand.

The retailer started using the \"Navajo\" descriptor in 2001, according to court documents.But the tribe did not unreasonably delay a trademark infringement challenge against the clothing retailer, U.S. District Judge Bruce Black in New Mexico ruled Thursday.There was no evidence anyone legally associated with the Navajo Nation knew the retailer used the tribe's trademarks until June 2011, Black said. The tribe sent a cease-and-desist letter to Urban Outfitters and followed up with the lawsuit.\"We're happy with the ruling and hope to resolve the matter expeditiously for the benefit of the Navajo people,\" Paul Spruhan, an attorney for the tribe, said Friday.Court documents do not quantify the amount the Navajo Nation could recover if it's successful in its lawsuit, but it could amount to millions of dollars dating to 2008.On some claims, the tribe wants all the profits generated from the Navajo-themed sales. On others, it wants $1,000 per day per item, or three times the profit generated by marketing and retail of products using the name.Lindsay DeMoss, one of a handful of attorneys listed for Urban Outfitters, declined to comment. The company had said in court documents that granting the tribe a monetary windfall for a situation it created with unexplained silence \"would be inequitable and unjust.\"Black's ruling applies to Urban Outfitters and one of its subsidiaries, Anthropologie. The judge held off on determining whether it also applies to subsidiary Free People until a company representative could be interviewed.The tribe's lawsuit alleges violations of federal and state trademark laws, including the Indian Arts and Crafts Act, which makes it illegal to sell arts or crafts in a way to falsely suggest they are made by American Indians.Urban Outfitters says \"Navajo\" is a generic term for a style or design.\n\n","title":"​Navajos sue Urban Outfitters over the use of their name - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Navajos sue Urban Outfitters over use of their name https://t.co/fvNftTwzzU https://t.co/XDNu0hB2IZ","date":"Sun Apr 03 05:00:01 +0000 2016","favs":71,"id":{"$numberLong":"716490417081032704"},"retweets":56},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1REY8Ff"}

Villanova missed just five shots\nin the second half.The margin topped the 34-point Final Four wins by\nCincinnati over Oregon State in 1962 and Michigan State over Penn in 1979.The\nWildcats now have four wins in the tournament of at least 19 points, the only\nclose game a 5-point win over overall No. 1 seed Kansas in the Elite\nEight.Villanova dominated the Sooners (29-8) after an opening 7 minutes that\nhad the teams trading the lead almost every possession.The Wildcats broke it\nopen with a 21-4 run. The stats about NRG Stadium being a horrible place to\nshoot went out the window along with the Sooners' chances at playing for their\nfirst title.\"I definitely think it helped,\" Wright said of practicing shooting\nin the dome. \"'We're going to be good,' we keep telling them, and I think they\nbelieved that.\"The Wildcats, with Hart going 7 for 8, shot 66.7 percent in the\nfirst half, including 6 of 11 from 3-point range in taking a 42-28 halftime\nlead.\"I wouldn't say it's easy, but when you have guys like (teammates) you\ncan go off any night,\" Hart said. \"When they're aggressive, it helps me.

Hield came into the game shooting 46.5\npercent from 3-point range.\"Just playing defensively as a team ... we\ncontained him,\" Hart said.Hield kept putting on and off his familiar white\nsleeve on his right arm. It didn't matter as the Sooners absorbed their worst\nloss of the season.The Sooners finished 31.7 percent (19 of 60) for the\ngame.\"Just credit them for what they were doing. Made it tough on me throwing\nmultiple bodies at me,\" said Hield, who had six points against West Virginia.\n\"They just played terrific tonight.\"Hield said Villanova was: \"one of the best\nteams I've ever played in college.\"Several Wildcats get credit for the great\ndefense against Hield.\"We were just loading into him,\" Mikal Bridges said. \"We\njust tried our best to limit his touches and load to him when he had the\nball.\"Kris Jenkins added 18 points for Villanova and Ryan Arcidiacono had\n15.Jordan Woodard led the Sooners with 12 points.Villanova turned the tables\nfrom the teams' December meeting with a 21-4 run in the first half.The\nWildcats made one less 3-pointer in the run than they did in 32 attempts in\nthe 78-55 loss at Pearl Harbor. Bridges, Jenkins and Arcidiacono hit the long\njumpers for Villanova and Oklahoma, meanwhile, couldn't get anything going.\nThe Sooners went 4 1/2 minutes without scoring. They committed four turnovers\non their first five possessions of the droughtHart capped the half for\nVillanova with a 3-pointer with 8 seconds left that made it 42-28.The Wildcats\nhad as many assists (9) as Oklahoma did turnovers. Villanova shot 66.7 percent\n(18 of 27) while the Sooners were just 12 for 25 (48 percent).\"I'm happy we\nhad one of those games, we made every shot,\" Wright said. \"Kind of similar to\nour game in Hawaii against Oklahoma, they made everything, we couldn't make\nanything.\"We were dialed in. Played great defensively.\"The teams were as close\nas you can possibly get in the final AP poll. Villanova was sixth and Oklahoma\nseventh. Both teams spent time at No. 1 this season.**HOUSTON --** North\nCarolina's latest step on the way to a title was shaping up as strictly an\ninside job.Out of nowhere, Marcus Paige figured out how to hit from 3-point\nland and the Tar Heels put an end to any hopes of another Syracuse\ncomeback.Using layups, floaters and putbacks -- then, finally, three very\ntimely 3s from Paige -- the Tar Heels outmuscled Syracuse 83-66 on Saturday to\nmove a win away from the program's sixth national title.Paige finished with 13\npoints and Brice Johnson and Justin Jackson led North Carolina (33-6) with 16\napiece, as the Tar Heels, the lone No. 1 seed in the Final Four, beat Jim\nBoeheim's 10th-seeded Orange for the third time this season and advanced to\nMonday's title game against Villanova.North Carolina Tar Heels forward Brice\nJohnson dunks the ball against Syracuse Orange forward Tyler Lydon during the\nsecond half in the 2016 NCAA Men's Division I Championship semifinal game at\nNRG Stadium in Houston, Texas on April 2, 2016.Earlier, the Wildcats made 11\nof 18 shots from behind the 3-point line, debunking the theory, first advanced\nat the cold-shooting Final Four in 2011, that nobody could shoot in Houston's\ncavernous stadium.Then, the Tar Heels, ranked 284th in the country this season\nfrom long range, reversed that one-game trend. They bricked up 3 after 3,\ngoing 0-for-10 in the first half and barely drawing iron on some of them.\nPaige opened the second half with North Carolina's 11th straight miss, and for\nthe next 10 minutes, the Tar Heels (33-6) basically ignored the 3-point\nline.Only when Trevor Cooney and Malachi Richardson triggered a 10-0 Syracuse\nrun to trim a 17-point deficit to seven did the Tar Heels start thinking long\nrange again. Paige made three 3s and Theo Pinson hit another to stifle the\nrally and make Carolina almost respectable from the 3-point line: 4 for 17 for\nthe game.Meeks finished with 15 points and eight rebounds, including a paddy\ncake putback after batting a second offensive rebound to himself off glass.\nThat gave the Heels a 67-53 lead.Before Paige found his range, that was how\nNorth Carolina built its lead.It was a reminder of the days before the 3-point\nshot was invented, when the way to really beat a zone -- and Boeheim's 2-3 is\nthe best in the game -- was to make blink-of-an-eye passes in and around the\npaint and crash the offensive glass to take advantage of a defense that\ndoesn't put bodies on bodies when the ball goes up.That plan still works these\ndays.Early in the second half, Jackson made a jump pass from the corner to the\nlane, where Paige was waiting and batted the ball with an open hand over to\nMeeks, who dunked.A bit later, Joel Berry got an easy offensive rebound and a\nlayup to put the Tar Heels ahead by 17.North Carolina finished with 16 second-\nchance points on 16 offensive boards.Syracuse trailed by 16 in its crazy\ncomeback victory over Virginia last week to make it here. But there was no\nfull-court press that could beat the Heels, and no meltdown awaiting from them\neither.Cooney led the Orange (23-14), the first No. 10 seed to make it to the\nFinal Four, with 22 points. Richardson had 17, but after his 3 trimmed the\ndeficit to seven with 9:48 left, Syracuse couldn't pull closer.\n\n","title":"Villanova, North Carolina head to NCAA championship game - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Stage is set for NCAA national championship game https://t.co/p1PxrRlToI #FinalFour https://t.co/jgDpdJ79xy","date":"Sun Apr 03 03:05:40 +0000 2016","favs":78,"id":{"$numberLong":"716461640070348800"},"retweets":43},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1SK51ax"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1ab7e"},"content":"**BRUSSELS --**When Ibrahim El Bakraoui blew himself up in the Brussels Airport check-in area, killing and maiming scores of travelers, it was at least the third time he had passed unimpeded through an airport terminal in recent months.Suspected by Turkey of being a \"foreign terrorist fighter\" and known at home in Belgium as an ex-con wanted for parole violations, Bakraoui was still allowed to board a commercial airliner unaccompanied last summer, flying freely from Istanbul to the Netherlands and disappearing without a trace.The ease with which he did so raises questions about how much governments know about the movements of returnees among the 5,000 home-grown jihadis who have trained and fought in places like Syria or Iraq. Many now pose a \"serious threat,\" according to the police agency Europol. Some, like Bakraoui, have already used their deadly skills in cities like Brussels or Paris.Testimony from government ministers, extracts of documents and conversations with police, border and aviation officials reveal a series of security gaps, misunderstandings and procedural red-tape that surrounded the deportation last July of this future suicide bomber.Even those who take some responsibility for missing the threat Bakraoui posed find it hard to understand why his capture raised no alarms. This was a man picked up by Turkish authorities in Gaziantep near Syria, who had done jail time in Belgium for armed robbery, including shooting at police with a Kalashnikov.\"We are talking about someone with a 10-year conviction, who spent a few years in prison, then traveled via Turkey to the Syrian border,\" Belgian Interior Minister Jan Jambon said on March 25, as lawmakers probed for security shortfalls three days after the Brussels attacks left 32 people dead.\"You don't have to have worked long on terrorism to conclude from all this that there is a very high probability -- 90 percent, 99 percent, take your pick -- that we are dealing with a foreign fighter,\" he said.Bakraoui may be just one case among many. Turkey has deported around 3,250 suspected \"foreign terrorist fighters\" since 2011 -- a number that does not include those turned back before making it to Syria, according to its foreign ministry.Turkey's government says Belgium made no extradition request for Bakraoui when it learned on June 26 that he was in Turkey, leaving him free to travel anywhere in Europe.\"It was obvious that he was affiliated and involved in the conflict zones, and he was wounded. That is the reason why he was deported. And this is the information that was communicated to Belgium,\" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan told CNN in an interview aired Thursday.Bakraoui is not the only case to fall through the communications gap. In September 2014, just over a year before Bakraoui's trip to Amsterdam, three French jihadis who said they were defecting from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) were able to buy tickets to Marseille, fly together unescorted and walk out of customs as free men, one of their lawyers, Pierre Dunac, said.According to France's interior ministry, they were detained in Turkey for visa violations -- although they were wanted men back home. Before setting out for Syria, two of them were associated with Mohamed Merah, the Islamic extremist who killed seven people in the south of France in 2012.Amid a government uproar, the three turned themselves in to French police and have been behind bars ever since, facing terrorism charges.Paris authorities filed preliminary terrorism charges Wednesday against a 34-year-old Frenchman for allegedly plotting an imminent attack and operating an explosives arsenal of what prosecutors called \"unprecedented scale.\"Paris Prosecutor Francois Molins said Wednesday that the suspect, Reda Kriket, is accused of participating in a terrorist group with plans for at least one attack, possessing and transporting arms and explosives, and holding fake documents, among other charges. Kriket will stay in custody while magistrates continue investigating the case and determine whether to send him to trial.A masked Belgian police officer takes part in police operations in the Schaerbeek area of Brussels, Belgium, March 25, 2016, three days after bomb attacks in the Belgian capital.Kriket is believed to have traveled to Syria in 2014 and 2015 and made several trips between France and Belgium and the Netherlands, Molins said.At least three other people are in custody in the case in Belgium and the Netherlands.Molins did not say whether Kriket's purported plot was linked to the ISIS network behind last week's attacks in Brussels and last November's attacks in Paris.During the March 24 raid that ended in his arrest two days after the Brussels attacks, police found a small quantity of explosives at Kriket's apartment in Argenteuil, on the northern outskirts of Paris.Kriket was convicted in absentia in July in Belgium for recruiting ISIS members along with Abdelhamid Abaaoud, one of the key leaders of the Paris attacks, CBS News correspondent Debora Patta reported.Kriket, a French national, was convicted alongside Abaaoud of being part of a jihadist network planning to travel to Syria.Before being killed in a police raid, the ringleader of the Nov. 13 Paris attacks claimed to have entered Europe in a multinational group of 90 fighters, who scattered \"more or less everywhere.\"The Associated Press reported that ISIS has trained at least 400 fighters to target Europe in deadly waves of attacks, deploying interlocking terror cells like the ones that struck Brussels and Paris with orders to choose the time, place and method for maximum carnage.Belgium has provided more foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria, per capita, than any other European nation, and authorities estimate that at least 130 of these battle-trained extremists have returned home.Belgian authorities have admitted to serious mistakes after the attacks, but they claim they are making progress and have inflicted damage against the terrorist network suspected of carrying out both the Brussels and Paris attacks.However, CBS News correspondent Allen Pizzey reported that exactly how much damage European law enforcement agencies have inflicted on that European network of apparent ISIS operatives remains an open -- and vexing -- question.One official conceded Brussels will never return to the so-called \"normal\" again.As for Bakraoui, what he did while in Turkey and what he would go on to do in Brussels would remain a mystery to Belgian authorities for quite some time.He disappeared off their radar last May and only popped back up on June 26, when Turkey notified Belgium that he had been picked up two weeks earlier near the Syrian border. More than two weeks would go by without a Belgian response.Then, on the morning of July 14, Turkey's foreign ministry sent an advisory to Belgian and Dutch authorities that Bakraoui was booked on a 10:40 a.m. Pegasus Airlines flight in Istanbul, bound for Amsterdam.The Dutch justice ministry said the deportation warning was sent to a Turkish-language electronic drop box that is normally checked twice a day. The message was prioritized as urgent, but the subject line read simply \"Itinerary.\" It gave no reason for Bakraoui's expulsion.A separate communique was sent to a Belgian police liaison officer in Turkey. When he requested details of the allegations against Bakraoui, he was told to make a written request, which he did the following day. A reply arrived on July 20, according to Jambon's testimony, almost a week after Bakraoui walked out of Amsterdam's Schiphol airport.Turkish officials, including Erdogan, maintain they did their job by warning Belgium that Bakraoui could be a \"foreign terrorist fighter.\" The Belgian government says the warning failed to include that crucial detail.\"Turkey only explained to us in January 2016 exactly why this man was stopped,\" Belgian Justice Minister Koen Geens told lawmakers, though he conceded \"we should have guessed, based on the place he had been to.\"Brothers Khalid and Brahim Bakraoui, suspects linked to the Brussels terrorist attacks, are pictured on a newspaper front page in Brussels, March 18, 2016.For their part, the Dutch said the Bakraoui case was not handled according to the usual protocol. There was no direct exchange between police in the two countries, or any indication of terror links in the notification.In five other cases with Dutch nationals -- all but one involving suspected travel to Syria -- Turkish authorities followed up the electronic notification by contacting Dutch police. The foreign ministry said Bakraoui's case seemed to be the only slip-up of its kind.Still, a history of violent crime and a probation violation, as was the case for Bakraoui, would not necessarily raise alarms, the ministry said. Certainly he was not flagged in either the Interpol or European databases.\"It is clear the procedure is vulnerable,\" the Dutch justice ministry said.Security officials say sometimes their hands are tied. It's hard to prove whether suspects have even set foot in Syria, where swathes of the country are virtually lawless, let alone establish if they have committed any crimes there.Without proof, \"we can go to the airport and say, 'We have reason to believe you have been to Syria. Would you like to talk about that?' And if he says, 'No, I've been visiting friends in Turkey,' we have to let him go,\" a European security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue.Deportation is not just a one-way street. More than 82,000 people were expelled from EU countries in 2012, mostly migrants, and the procedures involved were similar to those followed in Turkey, according to aviation officials.Indeed what's most surprising is that little of this is out of the ordinary.There are no enforceable international laws governing deportations, only guidelines and standards. Intelligence sharing is virtually non-existent. European Union agencies are reluctant to share information among themselves let alone with an outsider like Turkey, even if it is a candidate to join the 28-nation bloc.And when no crime has been committed on Turkish soil, let alone a trial held, all must respect the right to the presumption of innocence and confidentiality.Airlines are not informed of the reasons for any deportation, whether from Turkey or continental Europe. A risk assessment of the danger a passenger might pose is supposed to be made available to carriers 24 hours in advance, but it's unclear whether this happens routinely or in time.A replica of the Manneken-Pis statue, a major Brussels tourist attraction, is seen among flowers at a memorial for the victims of bomb attacks in Brussels metro and Brussels international airport of Zaventem, in Brussels, Belgium, March 28, 2016.\"Authorities can book tickets on an airline and as far as I know most airlines accept expulsions,\" said Association of European Airlines spokesman Geert Sciot. \"Commercial airlines do not get information about the reason or justification of expulsion because that is part of privacy and security.\"In Europe, police are tasked with getting a deportee to the aircraft door but they are routinely following orders from immigration officials.\"We just do what we're told,\" one European police official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak publicly about the procedure.Under the Convention on International Civil Aviation -- the non-binding charter for the industry -- signatory countries should first aim to take people back to their point of departure. Option B is the person's country of residence or nationality.This could explain why Bakraoui was returned to Amsterdam rather than Brussels, where his arrival might have been flagged.At European Union headquarters in Brussels, meanwhile, new measures to tackle the issue of returning foreign fighters are near completion. These include the IDs of returning EU citizens to be cross checked with police databases and a Passenger Name Record system giving authorities access to travelers' personal information.It's an open question, though, as to how effective they will be when solid information already in the hands of officials now is not put to good use.\"When Turkey gives us the identity of a jihadi, there's no need for any system. We have the information, but we are not doing anything with it,\" Belgian leftist opposition lawmaker Marco Van Hees told government ministers.\n\n","title":"​Brussels attacks: Foreign fighters are evading Europe's security net - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Gaps in security, cooperation add to Europe's ISIS threat.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1ab80"},"content":"******BRUSSELS**\\- A partial, symbolic airline service will begin Sunday at Brussels Airport after a 12-day shutdown of passenger service caused by adeadly bombing attack, the airport's chief executive said Saturday.Arnaud Feist, CEO of Brussels Airport Co., said the Brussels Airlines flights to Athens, Turin in Italy and Faro in Portugal, the first of which he said should take off around 2 p.m. local time were chiefly symbolic.Effective Monday, Belgium's biggest airport should be back at around 20 percent of capacity and able to process 800 passengers an hour.It has been closed since devastating suicide bombings in the airport's main terminal and a Brussels subway train killed 32 people and wounded 270 on March 22.Speaking at a joint news conference, Feist called it \"a sign of hope\" and a demonstration of \"shared will\" that even partial passenger service could resume so soon following what he called \"the darkest days in the history of aviation in Belgium.\"He said he was expecting the formal go-ahead from the Belgian government later Saturday.The March 22 attacks, in which three suicide bombers also died, were claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. To minimize the chances of a repeat, Belgian Federal Police spokesman Michael Jonniaux said new security measures have been ordered at the airport, including spot checks of vehicles before they arrive, the closing of a drop-off parking area outside the terminal, and the screening of all people, their ID and travel documents and baggage before they are allowed to enter the facility.The bombers had been able to enter the airport's check-in area with suitcases packed with high explosives and nails, and the resulting blasts collapsed the ceiling, shattered windows and caused great damage.Until the terminal can be fully repaired, Feist said departing passengers will first enter a temporary structure erected on the tarmac, then go to a specially built area for check-in.There will be no access by rail or public transport to the airport for the foreseeable future, he said.Brussels Airport, which usually handled about 600 flights a day, served about 1.5 million people in February, the month preceding the attack. Feist said he hopes full service can be restored by the end of June or beginning of July in time for the summer vacation season. (See below for information about current travel options.)Also Saturday, Belgian police, some on horseback, moved in to detain some two dozen protesters at Brussels' Bourse Square, breaking up a demonstration to protest Islamophobia. Authorities in the Belgian capital, fearing violent disorders, banned all demonstrations after a group of right-wing hooligans congregated at the same square last Sunday.Belgian plainclothes police apprehend a youth in the Brussels district of Molenbeek, Belgium, April 2, 2016In the Molenbeek neighborhood, where a far-right France-based group had planned to demonstrate, at least one person was detained, and witnesses saw several minor clashes between police and young people.Molenbeek, home to one of the largest Muslim communities in Brussels, has been a hotbed of radical Islamic sentiment and was home to some of the men who staged the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris that killed 130, and were also claimed by Islamic State.The Belgian Federal Prosecutor's Office announced that a Belgian national has been charged with participating in the activities of a terrorist group for his alleged role in another plot to attack France, which was uncovered after the arrest of a Frenchman and the discovery of a huge cache of weapons and explosives.A statement from the prosecutor's office on Saturday identified the 33-year-old Belgian suspect only as Y.A. It said he's in custody, and has been charged in the case that stemmed from the arrest of Reda Kriket in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt last week.Paris prosecutor Francois Molins said an \"imminent\" attack had been thwarted with Kriket's arrest and the discovery of the explosives stash in suburban Argenteuil outside Paris.A third man was arrested in Rotterdam in the case, which officials say is separate from the attacks in Paris and Brussels.Here are the latest Brussels policies for several major airlines:- **Delta** confirms that it will terminate service between Brussels and its hub in Atlanta, Georgia until March 2017, though it will continue to operate between Brussels and New York (JFK) as soon as flights are cleared to resume.In the meantime, the airline suggests that customers reroute to or through Paris, Amsterdam, Dusseldorf or Luxembourg. Passengers with Brussels tickets through April 18 can rebook with no penalty - although the fare could be higher - if they begin their rescheduled travel by April 30. Or they can cancel their reservation and apply the ticket's value toward a new ticket for one year, according to Delta's website, although they could incur change fees and higher fares.- **United** says it will waive change fees and any difference in fare for passengers who reschedule a Brussels flight through April 30 if the new trip follows the same route or goes to or from London, Paris, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf or Luxembourg. For trips after April 30 and within a year of the ticket's purchase, United says it will waive change fees but the fare could increase.- **American** has canceled its Brussels flights through April 15. It is waiving change fees for Brussels trips that were bought before March 29 and scheduled to fly through April 22 on American, British Airways or Iberia. Passengers can rebook to or through several other European cities - London's two main airports, Paris' two main airports, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, and Liege Bierset, Belgium - with no change fee. In some cases, American says it will waive any change in fare as long as the passenger flies in the same class of seat covered by the original ticket.- **Air France** says that passengers who bought tickets to Brussels before March 23 for travel through April 18 can get a refund or rebook their trip through April 18. Rebooked travel must be completed no later than April 30.- **British Airways** passengers booked for Brussels flights through April 9 can claim a refund, rebook a later date at no extra charge, or pick another destination. The airline says it will operate flights to and from Liege, Belgium, through Monday.- **Lufthansa** has canceled flights to and from Brussels until at least Wednesday and is offering passengers flights from Munich and Frankfurt to Liege instead. It has a shuttle service between Frankfurt and Brussels. Passengers whose Brussels flights on Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Germanwings or Eurowings have not been canceled can rebook in the same class for travel before Oct. 31.\n\n","title":"Flights to resume at Brussels airport, CEO says - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Flights to resume at Brussels airport, CEO says https://t.co/0Pot2aStSO https://t.co/9W6Iwz4UG5","date":"Sat Apr 02 20:10:01 +0000 2016","favs":33,"id":{"$numberLong":"716357035789574145"},"retweets":22},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1REPYg1"}

Panicked, you\nfeel a presence in the room and see the image of a ghost or a demon gliding\ntoward you. The figure approaches you, sits on your chest and puts its hands\naround your neck. You actually feel it strangling you and you try to scream,\nbut you can't even open your mouth.This may sound like something out of a\nhorror movie, but it is an actual phenomenon many people describe\nexperiencing. Though the ghostlike figures aren't real, the physical sensation\nand fear are genuine. Experts say it's a typical episode of sleep\nparalysis.The condition is defined by the inability to move or speak while\nfalling asleep or upon waking, and usually lasts for a minute or two. It is\nsometimes accompanied by hallucinations that are essentially projections of\ndream imagery. Many who suffer from it describe feeling heaviness on the chest\nand the overwhelming sensation of another presence in the room. The\ncombination produces the terrifying feeling of a real-life nightmare.So what\ncauses sleep paralysis? Christopher French, Ph.D., studies it as head of the\nAnomalistic Psychology Research Unit at Goldsmiths, University of London.\n(\"Anomalistic Psychology attempts to explain paranormal and related beliefs,\"\nhis department's website explains.) French says sleep paralysis happens during\nrapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the stage of sleep in which dreams\noccur.\"During REM sleep, the muscles are actually, literally paralyzed.\nUsually you're not aware of it because you're aware of whatever you're\ndreaming about. Putting it simply, it's that your brain has woken up but your\nbody hasn't,\" he told CBS News.Those who experience sleep paralysis can see\nthat they are still in their bedrooms, he said, but they can't move.In the\ndocumentary \"Devil in the Room,\" people describe frightening episodes of sleep\nparalysis. \"My bed was shaking and I felt like I was being strangled,\" one\nrecalled. \"The only thing I could move was my eyes, but I felt like there was\na presence in my room,\" said another. \"Pressure holding me down. Screaming and\nscreaming and asking for help, but your mouth isn't moving.\" \"There was a\nwoman levitated in bed next to me.\"\"It's absolutely terrifying,\" French said.\nHowever, he emphasized that experiencing sleep paralysis is completely normal\nand has a scientific explanation.\"After a very vivid episode, you're going to\nthink 'well, either I'm crazy or that was real,' and neither of those two\nalternatives are that great,\" he said. \"But it's not real and you're not going\ncrazy. We do generally know in scientific terms what causes it and I think\nthat can be very reassuring.\"**How common is sleep paralysis?**Sleep paralysis\ntends to occur more often in people who have other sleep disorders, such as\nnarcolepsy or sleep apnea, but it can happen to anyone.According to French's\nresearch, about 30 to 40 percent of the general population has experienced\nsleep paralysis at some point in their life.Brian Sharpless, Ph.D., an\nassistant professor of psychology at Washington State University, and author\nof the book \"Sleep Paralysis,\" has studied the phenomenon in the U.S.After\nanalyzing a sample size of over 36,000 people from a variety of cultures and\ngroups, he found that about 8 percent of the general population experiences\nsleep paralysis, with some groups at a higher risk. About 28 percent of\nstudents, for example, reported incidents of sleep paralysis, while 32 percent\nof people with psychiatric disorders such as depression or anxiety said they\nexperienced it, as well.This makes sense, as sleep paralysis is greatly\naffected by quality of sleep. \"Any kind of disrupted sleep, whether it's\nbecause you don't have a regular schedule, you have jetlag, or you do shift\nwork seems to make sleep paralysis more likely,\" Sharpless told CBS News.\n\"Overall, I think it's much more common than people may think.\"**Sleep\nparalysis through history**Sleep experts have known about sleep paralysis for\nyears. It's been a recognized diagnosis in the American Academy of Sleep\nMedicine's Diagnostic Classification of Sleep and Arousal Disorder since its\nvery first issue published in 1979.But it's just starting to become more well-\nknown in popular culture, as projects like \"Devil in the Room\" make their way\naround the Internet. Just last year, a hybrid film of documentary and horror\nabout sleep paralysis called \"The Nightmare\" debuted at the Sundance Film\nFestival.Descriptions of sleep paralysis can be found throughout history in\ncultures from all over the world.French points to a 1781 painting by Henry\nFuseli called \"The Nightmare,\" which depicts a demon sitting on the chest of a\nsleeping woman, as perhaps the most famous historic example of a sleep\nparalysis depiction.John Henry Fuseli's painting, \"The Nightmare.\"According to\na 2008 research paper, a 17th century Dutch physician recorded a case report\nof a patient's symptoms that describes episodes of sleep paralysis, suggesting\nphysicians have known about the condition for hundreds of years.One theory\nsuggests sleep paralysis may also have played a role in the Salem Witch\ntrials. A 2003 paper quotes a possible description of sleep paralysis found in\nevidence used in the 1692 trials. Bernard Peach testified that one night, \"he\nheard a scrabbling at the window, whereat he then saw Susanna Martin come in,\nand jump down upon the floor. She took hold of this deponent's feet, and\ndrawing his body up into an heap, she lay upon him near two hours; in all\nwhich time he could neither speak nor stir.\"Different cultures around the\nworld have also come up with fables and tales to explain what happens during\nan episode of sleep paralysis.\"In all cultures, even in modern times, there\nare dozens and dozens of different words for sleep paralysis and different\ninterpretations from different cultures,\" French said. \"But again you look at\nthe actual descriptions and clearly it's the same core phenomenon.\"Folklore in\nNewfoundland describes the \"Old Hag\" who comes in the night and sits on the\nsleeper's chest and suffocates them. Japan has \"Kanashibari,\" which is a\nnocturnal spirit attack.In St. Lucia, the condition is referred to as \"Kokma.\"\n\"Their interpretation is that it's the spirit of unbaptized children that\nwould come and try to strangle you while you slept,\" he said.In more modern\ntimes, French said some people who experience sleep paralysis explain it by\nbecoming convinced they were abducted by aliens.\"Of course, it may sound a bit\nsilly to most people, but to these people it's very real,\" he said. \"But what\nthey're really describing is a typical sleep paralysis episode.\"**Treatments\nand coping strategies**While research on the best methods to treat sleep\nparalysis is lacking, experts say the best way to prevent it is to practice\ngood sleep hygiene.\"Getting the recommended 7 to 9 hours per night of sleep a\nnight, making sure your sleep times are very consistent. People have a\ntendency to sleep deprive themselves on the weekdays then on the weekends try\nto sleep in,\" said Dr. Daniel Barone, a sleep expert at Weill Cornell Medicine\nand New York-Presbyterian.Of course, for sufferers of sleep paralysis, this\ncan often be difficult to accomplish. \"One of the things that happen to people\nwho get sleep paralysis is that they become frightened to go to sleep,\" French\nsaid. \"And that disrupts the sleep cycle and that makes it more likely that it\nwill happen. So it's really a horrible vicious circle.\"Barone notes that\ntreating the sleep disorders that can bring on episodes of sleep paralysis is\nimportant, and avoiding excessive alcohol, nicotine, and food intake before\nbed can also help.While it's happening, it can be difficult to \"break the\nspell\" of sleep paralysis, but French said a lot of the patients he's spoken\nto have actually learned to recognize their episodes and a few have actually\ncome to enjoy them. \"Basically the way you enjoy a good horror movie,\" he\nsaid.If that's not possible, there are some alternative strategies.\"Some\npeople have reported that focusing on a small body part, like a finger or toe,\nand trying to wiggle it, is helpful,\" Sharpless said. \"Trying to relax and\ntell yourself that it's sleep paralysis and those aren't really aliens in your\nbedroom can be a good way to talk yourself down. It may be helpful just to\nreassure yourself that it's a natural experience and that it's really nothing\nto physically worry about.\"\n\n","title":"The real life nightmare of sleep paralysis - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Yes, sleep paralysis is real and it's an absolute nightmare for all who suffer from it https://t.co/A3q7QkWSM8 https://t.co/3qY3Okmqfm","date":"Sat Apr 02 19:19:28 +0000 2016","favs":97,"id":{"$numberLong":"716344317422530565"},"retweets":71},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1W1oExY"}

One man said\nhe didn't hear the plane's engine as it flew overhead.The single-engine\nLancair IV landed on its belly and skidded about 250 feet before striking the\nrear of a black Nissan Altima sedan that was stopped on the shoulder of the\nroad. The driver of the car had pulled over to synchronize the Bluetooth\ndevice on his phone, Parent said.The impact crumpled the back of the car,\nkilling 38-year-old passenger Antoinette Frances Isbelle, CBS affiliate KFMB\nreported. She was believed to be a San Diego resident. Three others in the car\nwere also hurt.\"The plane went completely into the trunk and pushed the rear\nbumper almost into the rear passenger seat,\" said John Buchanan, spokesman for\nthe North County Fire Protection District. Buchanan told KFMB one of the car\npassengers who survived, identified as 36-year-old Emily Boesmiller-Hoch, was\nrushed to the hospital after being cut from the wreckage.\"We had to extricate\nher from the car which took about 15-20 minutes to get her out of the car,\"\nBuchanan said.Boesmiller-Hoch, driver Aaron Meccann, 42, and front-seat\npassenger Jason Soule were expected to survive their injuries.Pilot Dennis\nHogge, 62, and his passenger, who wasn't immediately named, suffered major\ninjuries, Parent said.Firefighters were able to contain a fuel leak before it\ncaught fire since they arrived on scene from their station located less than a\nmile from the crash, Buchanan said.''It's amazing that there weren't more\ninjuries,'' he said.Emergency personnel investigate the scene of plane crash\non Interstate 15 on Saturday, April 2, 2016 in Fallbrook, Calif.The plane was\nonce owned by major league catcher Matt Nokes, who made a noteworthy landing\non busy I-15 when the engine quit on its second flight on Feb. 18, 2000.Nokes\nguided the high-performance $500,000 plane to a smooth landing and safely\ntaxied off the road without injuries.Nokes went on to fly the plane every day\nfor five years without incident before selling it. He said it had been rebuilt\nseveral times since he sold it.\"It was crazy,\" Nokes told The Associated Press\non Saturday. \"Everything worked out so beautifully. It was almost a humorous\nthing. Unfortunately, it doesn't always turn out that way.\"When Nokes heard\nabout the crash, he unsuccessfully tried to reach Hogge. He didn't realize\nHogge had been injured.He described Hogge as a good man, an outstanding pilot\nand a master plane builder.\"It's just horrible to hear about,\" said Nokes who\nspent 11 years in the majors, mostly with the Detroit Tigers and New York\nYankees.The stretch of freeway is no stranger to unusual landings. Parent said\nhe's aware of three other planes that have come down on that stretch of\nfreeway about 50 miles north of San Diego in the past decade.Nokes said the\nfreeway is a popular route for flying because there are fewer flight\nrestrictions than along the Interstate 5 corridor.The Federal Aviation\nAdministration and National Transportation Safety Board will investigate the\ncrash, FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said.A large number of people witnessed the\ncrash, Buchanan said. Many of them reported not hearing anything that would\nindicate an engine problem, but said the way the plane was banking to the\neast, then to the west before hitting the ground indicated it was in some kind\nof trouble.****The crash blocked two lanes and caused major backups on the\nfreeway that runs to Las Vegas.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1ab88"},"content":"**LOS ANGELES --**The death of Lana Meisner, the wife of founding Eagles bassist Randy Meisner, has renewed an unusual court battle over a proposed temporary conservatorship for the musician and highlighted his troubled history and what some call the couple's tumultuous marriage. A judge's ruling granting the temporary conservatorship in Los Angeles Superior Court Friday is only the latest development in an ongoing dispute over who is best able to care for the bassist, who new court documents allege suffers from bipolar disorder, traumatic brain injury and substance abuse and has threatened to harm himself and others on several occasions.The Eagles pictured in 1977: Don Henley, drums; Joe Walsh, guitar; Randy Meisner, bass; Glenn Frey, guitar; and Don Felder, guitar.On Friday, a Los Angeles judge granted Meisner's request to appoint his friend Arthur Ford and his accountant Tom DeLong as the temporary conservators for his medical care and estate. In a rare move, days after his wife's death in a gun accident last month, Randy Meisner asked a judge for the temporary conservatorship for himself, saying in a March 11 petition that he is \"barely able to accept the sudden and tragic loss of his loving wife.\"Lana Meisner was killed March 6, when police say a shotgun she was moving accidentally fired. Randy Meisner, best known for co-writing and singing the Eagles hit \"Take it to the Limit,\" asked for his \"trusted friends and advisers assist him with his own care, maintenance and support in his current state.\"Meisner's friend Jim Newton agrees that Meisner, 70, is in need of a conservator. But in a Monday court filing, he objected to Ford and Delong as the appointees. Newton argues a combination of mental illness and serious substance abuse puts Meisner, and possibly others, at \"substantial risk\" -- a risk, he says, which has been exacerbated by his wife's death.It's the second time Newton has asked a judge to appoint an independent conservator for Meisner -- his first request came last year, before Lana Meisner's death.In new documents filed Monday, Newton argues Ford is a friend from the music industry who doesn't have the expertise required to care for Meisner. He says Ford would be a \"sham conservator\" who will submit to Meisner's requests. The elections, he said, were filed \"within a matter of days\" of Meisner's release from a psychiatric hold at a hospital in the wake of his wife's death.He also called into question Meisner's ability to choose his own conservators.Friday, a judge disagreed. He granted Meisner's request to appoint Ford and Delong until May 25, when he'll hear Newton's cross-petition for a permanent conservatorship. Newton nominated a private professional fiduciary, a former social worker who specializes in mental health issues, to oversee Meisner's health care and finances.\"We are very happy Randy now agrees he needs help,\" Troy Martin, an attorney for Newton, told Crimesider. \"Our only intention is ensuring he gets the kind of help he needs. Randy is a very sick man.\"It's extremely rare for a person to request their own conservator, according to Howard Serbin, an Orange County, Calif. probate and elder law attorney. In California, conservatorships - called guardianships in other states - can be enacted to oversee the \"person\" or \"estate\" of someone who isn't able to make decisions regarding their own health care or finances.Though odd, a conservatee's own request may hold sway with a judge, Serbin said. \"A nomination by himself counts for a lot - if he's competent,\" Serbin said.Also unusual, Serbin said, was one of Meisner's reasons for asking for his own conservator. Meisner said in the petition he was \"increasingly anxious\" that Newton or his children would attempt to contact him or file again for a conservatorship.\"The proposed conservatee is worried this contact would impair his health, and hopes that requesting this conservatorship voluntarily will demonstrate to his children that he is being cared for in the hope they all stay at a distance while he grieves,\" the petition reads.The petition is \"more about his state of mind\" than his physical health, Delong told Crimesider before the hearing.\"He's obviously very upset and grieving over the loss of his wife, and he needs some help,\" Delong said.Police say Lana Meisner, 63, was fatally shot in the March 6 accident at around 7 p.m., inside the couple's Studio City home, as she was moving a rifle that was stored inside a case in the closet. As she lifted it, another item within the case shifted and hit the trigger, causing it to fire, according to police. Earlier that evening, around 5:30 p.m., police responded to the same home on the report of a possibly intoxicated man. Officers filed a domestic violence report involving the couple, police say. Lana Meisner told dispatchers her husband was waving a BB gun around the home, but an LAPD official close to the investigation told 48 Hours' Crimesider the claim turned out to be false - the woman later admitted there was no BB gun. The couple had argued, the source said, but no crime was committed.The death was ruled an accident after an investigation by Valley Bureau detective personnel and the Los Angeles Coroner's Office. Randy Meisner was cooperative, police say. The LAPD source told Crimesider that detectives were at the home from 8 p.m. until 6 the next morning, and there was nothing to indicate foul play. However, the source said the investigation isn't complete.There was no surveillance video inside or outside the home, according to the source. The case would have been investigated as a murder \"if there was anything that even hinted at criminal activity,\" the source said.But what led up to the fatal shooting remains unclear, and Newton says he believes a combination of alcohol, guns and the couple's volatile relationship may have all contributed. Newton, an old friend from Randy Meisner's home state of Nebraska, told Crimesider the relationship was so troubling he filed the first conservatorship petition last year.The petition alleged that Lana Meisner bought large amounts of alcohol for the musician and said he is \"easier to control when drunk,\" though the bassist has been repeatedly hospitalized for health issues related to alcoholism. The documents also allege Lana Meisner isolated him from his three adult children, failed to give him medical care and spent his money extravagantly.\"I think Lana was trying to hasten his demise,\" Newton told Crimesider.Randy Meisner's lawyer, Bruce Fuller, said the claims don't portray an accurate picture of the marriage--he dismissed them as \"allegations of one side of this case.\"\"They were each other's whole world,\" Fuller said. \"They really loved each other very, very deeply.\"Randy Meisner's accountant Tom Delong said Lana Meisner \"bent over backwards\" to care for her husband. He said he believed Meisner's children became estranged from their father as a result of an ongoing dispute between their mother, Meisner's ex-wife, and Lana Meisner. He said both Lana and Randy Meisner had told him they didn't know Jim Newton and that he wasn't a long-term friend.Randy Meisner, left, and Lana Meisner, rightNewton told Crimesider he first became involved in December 2013, when he called Randy Meisner, who was at a treatment facility while his wife was on a cruise. He said his old friend begged him for help.\"He told me he wanted to divorce her, she's spending his money, she's being mean to him, she 'gets me drunk and makes me sign things I know are not good,'\" Newton said.He flew to Los Angeles to visit the bassist, and that's when he said he first learned of the severity of the situation, and also discovered that Randy Meisner suffered from significant memory loss. Court documents would later describe his treatment for cognitive problems related to alcohol-induced dementia. Newton said he promised to help his friend, but later, he said, Randy Meisner couldn't remember the conversation.Newton admits that he was friends with Meisner years ago and wasn't in contact with him again until 2013, when the musician's son put them in touch. But he says he's aiming to fulfill his promise to Meisner, help him get care and re-unite him with his children.\"I am trying to make sure Randy's wishes when he was in a state of clarity are honored,\" he said.Newton's new filing extensively details Randy Meisner's struggle with his physical and mental health, including repeated hospitalizations, reported suicide threats, and one incident in which he allegedly threatened to gun down staff at a Studio City rehabilitation facility with his AK-47.Randy Meisner was admitted to the Verdugo Hills hospital on a temporary psychiatric hold after the incident in March of 2012, the new filing states, because he was \"gravely disabled and a danger to others.\" According to medical records cited in the documents, Meisner \"became extremely agitated, was verbally and physically abusive with caregivers - his mood was extremely unstable and unpredictable and he was not able to function independently. He was a danger to others threatening harm to others with bodily harm [sic] and hence the need for admission to the hospital.\"When he was admitted, the hospital records state, he was \"expressing paranoid delusional ideations\" and was \"in poor contact with reality.\"Around the same time, according to a 2015 geriatric psychiatric evaluation of Randy Meisner included with Monday's court filing, Lana Meisner said she had put her husband's gun collection into a storage unit. Police confiscated the AK-47, but allowed her to keep the remaining guns, the report said.Other incidents documented in the court filings describe Randy Meisner's alleged suicidal threats. Medical records from a 2013 hospitalization say Meisner \"had both a suicidal ideation and plan: he stated that he was going to kill himself by overdosing and taking all of his pills,\" the documents say.Monday's filing also details a Jan. 15, 2015 admission to a hospital for \"alcohol intoxication, pending withdrawal, and altered level of mental status\" after which he was placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold because he appeared agitated and confused. Lana Meisner told hospital staff her husband \"wants to put a gun in his mouth and was going to shoot and she had to rustle the gun away from him and all the guns have been removed from the house,\" state medical records cited in the documents. Meisner told his wife he was depressed and wanted to die, according to the records.According to the 2015 psychiatric evaluation, however, Lana Meisner said the incident she described in the hospital records happened \"10-15 years\" before the 2015 hospital admission.\"She acknowledged talking to the physician about Randy's history with a gun and shared her opinion that he should be on an anti-depressant because of his mood swings,\" the psychiatric evaluation states. Randy Meisner was discharged with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder mixed with psychotic features, according to the evaluation.In the evaluation, psychiatrist David Trader said he believed Randy Meisner suffered from a \"major neurocognitive disorder.\" Meisner showed deficits in key areas of mental functioning including orientation, memory and reasoning, he found.Trader said he believed Randy Meisner wasn't able to care for his personal needs like physical health, food, clothing and shelter, and lacked the mental capacity to manage his own finances and resist \"fraud or undue influence.\" His cognitive impairment and mood shifts left him particularly vulnerable to having his will overpowered, Trader wrote.Newton's first petition for conservatorship, filed in 2015, describe an oftentimes contentious relationship between Lana and Randy Meisner, and outline moments when the musician became \"irate\" with his wife.\"She made the comment that she locked her doors when she went to bed at night because she was afraid of what he might do,\" Newton told Crimesider.The Eagles perform at the band's 1998 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in New York. Band members are (L-R) Randy Meisner, Timothy B. Schmidt, Glen Frey, Don Felder, Joe Walsh and Don Henley (rear).Lana Meisner told friends and family that during her husband's extended hospitalization in 2013, she \"was the happiest she had been in a long time\" and that when he passed away, she planned to go \"antiquing in Paris,\" the documents allege. Lana Meisner allegedly spent hundreds of thousands of Randy Meisner's money on luxury purchases, including cruises, kitchen remodeling, and cosmetic surgery while he was hospitalized and in declining health. She made changes to his estate plan against his wishes and sometimes without his knowledge, the petition alleges, and sold a farm in Nebraska he had long said would be his son's inheritance.Delong, Randy Meisner's accountant, said the claims were \"overblown,\" including those that Lana Meisner extravagantly spent her husband's money. He said Randy Meisner was \"fully involved\" in their home renovations and that Lana Meisner used her own money for her cosmetic surgery.All three of Randy Meisner's children filed petitions in support of the 2015 temporary conservatorship, alleging that their stepmother was enabling their father's alcoholism and failing to provide him the care he needed.Randy Meisner's son, Eric Meisner, said in a declaration that his relationship with his father changed after his parents divorced in 1981 and his father moved in with Lana Meisner. He said the two began living together shortly after the divorce and married in 1996 or 1997.\"Lana has been isolating my father from his family for over 30 years,\" Eric Meisner wrote. \"My father has repeatedly stated his love for his family and his desire to be with us, but Lana continually interferes with his relationship with us.\"Lana Meisner \"controls who can speak to my father, and who cannot,\" Randy Meisner's daughter Heather Leigh wrote in another declaration. When her father was at a residential treatment facility, Leigh said her stepmother told staff there to only allow people who knew a special password she instituted to speak with Randy Meisner.Whenever her father would sober up, Leigh wrote, he would tell his children that he wanted to divorce his wife. In May of 2010, according to Newton, he visited his attorney to initiate divorce proceedings while his wife was on a cruise. When she returned several weeks later, according to Leigh and Newton, Lana Meisner fired his attorney, Patrick DeCarolis, as well as his long-time accountant.According to court records, in February of 2010, Randy Meisner filed a temporary restraining order against his wife for alleged domestic violence. DeCarolis told Crimesider the case was dismissed because he had been fired by Lana Meisner and the issue was never heard before a judge.Around the same time, Leigh wrote, her stepmother was telling other family members she planned to \"spend every dime\" of her father's money and that she wasn't \"going to leave a penny for those kids.\"\"It is abundantly clear to me that Lana is extremely concerned that if my father was able to stop his drinking and get out from under Lana's control he would seek out advice and support of his family and long-time advisers and divorce Lana, in which case she would not receive her inheritance under his estate pursuant to a prenuptial agreement,\" Leigh wrote. \"To avoid that possibility, Lana enables my father's alcoholism, which has nearly cost him his life.\"Several family members wrote in declarations that when Randy Meisner was hospitalized in 2013, requiring a tracheotomy and a feeding tube, Lana Meisner didn't tell them until weeks later. Newton's filing Monday said Meisner's lung had collapsed and he suffered from respiratory failure as a result of benzodiazepine use, a drug used to treat anxiety and other conditions. He spent 10 months in various rehabilitation facilities following the incident, according to court documents.Marla Dodd, a friend who also filed a declaration supporting the 2015 petition, wrote that when she visited Lana and Randy Meisner in 2014, the musician was drinking heavily and looked thin and pale. When she voiced concern over his condition to Lana Meisner, the woman told her \"she didn't want to spend 'her' money on a nurse for Randy.\"Randy Meisner was hospitalized again in 2015 after a routine visit to his dentist, Stacey Meisner, Eric Meisner's wife, wrote in a declaration. She said Lana Meisner told her in February of that year that her father-in-law's dentist was so concerned for his condition that he called 911. Randy Meisner spent several weeks in the hospital, she wrote.The petition alleges that Lana Meisner often said her husband was awful and difficult to care for, and that Randy Meisner became angry with her during arguments, often over his children or alcohol.In a March 2015 phone call, Stacey Meisner said Lana Meisner called her crying, telling her that she was \"trying to control his drinking but he wouldn't stop. She said that Randy was out of control.\"The Eagles (from left:) Bernie Leadon, Joe Walsh, Don Henley, Timothy B. Schmidt, Don Felder, Glenn Frey, and Randy Meisner in a 1998 file photo.Just before Randy Meisner's mother died in 2010, Leigh wrote that her father and stepmother returned to Nebraska but fought throughout the entire hospital visit, to the point where hospital staff told her their behavior was loud and disruptive. She said the night her grandmother passed away, Lana Meisner cried to her over the phone, but not because of the death -- Leigh said \"she was ranting about how awful my father was.\"\"I asked her, if it was so bad, why didn't she simply leave?\" Leigh wrote. \"She told me she couldn't, because if she left him, she 'would get nothing,' apparently referring to a prenuptial agreement.\"Dana Meisner, Randy Meisner's son and Eric Meisner's brother, accused Lana Meisner of attempting to create conflict within the family. He said in one instance, he believed the woman \"got my father into an alcohol-induced rage\" when the musician called his daughter-in-law angry over a request to borrow cash for a car repair.Dodd, the friend, described an instance during their 2014 visit where he \"became irate\" after Lana Meisner said he never took her side against his children. Dodd said the couple argued and at one point the musician \"threw a shrimp in frustration and it hit me.\"Later, in October 2014, Dodd wrote that she and her husband stayed with the musician while Lana Meisner was on a cruise. She said his condition had worsened and that he was having trouble walking. He drank during the day and became \"agitated\" as the day wore on, she wrote.\"At night, he would pace through the house hollering and screaming,\" Dodd wrote. \"The longer Lana was away, the worse his rants would get.\"Friends say Lana Meisner was exhibiting bizarre behavior as well. Dodd said that she kept in touch with Lana Meisner and at one point received a series of \"angry and paranoid\" texts from her. In an April 2015 voicemail, Dodd wrote, Lana Meisner said her neighbors had been coming into her backyard and spying on her. She said two kids were in her yard, Dodd wrote, one wearing a clown suit. She said she thought Dodd and her husband were \"in on it,\" and she allegedly said she took cocaine.\"Now I'm scared, because they have seen me doing blow through the bedroom window and they sit there and watch me,\" Lana Meisner said in the voicemail, according to Dodd.She said Lana Meisner appeared overwhelmed caring for her husband, but said she seemed more concerned about preserving her portion of the estate than providing medical care for him. In one text, Lana Meisner wrote, \"I'm tired of being a nurse. I get so mad. I feel that he's done this to himself and that now I have to be the one making all the decisions all the work all appts all everything!\"In Randy Meisner's 2015 psychiatric evaluation, Lana Meisner denied allegations made in the declarations, telling a physician, \"I'm not the person they're trying to say I am.\" She said she believed her husband's ex-wife and daughter Heather were \"behind\" the conservatorship petition.Lana Meisner's brother, Jeff Beucler, told Crimesider that many of the claims in the 2015 petition were \"lies and innuendo\" and that his sister was being unfairly portrayed, but declined to comment further.Randy Meisner also appeared to contest many of the allegations in declarations in the 2015 interview with the psychiatrist, Trader. The musician said he got along \"great\" with his wife and denied allegations that she isolated him. If he said he wanted to divorce his wife, he told Trader, he didn't mean it.Randy Meisner told the psychiatrist he believed his ex-wife was trying to get his wife out of his life, and that she and his daughter Heather were trying to control his money. He didn't recognize the name Jim Newton, he said. Fuller, Randy Meisner's lawyer, dismissed claims that the marriage was tumultuous. He said he never saw the couple try to control each other's finances or communications with others. Randy Meisner \"was and is\" out of contact with all of his children and his ex-wife, Fuller said, but not because of Lana Meisner.He said Meisner has been been \"very fragile\" since her death. Despite the loss, he said, Randy Meisner has his faculties about him and is trying hard to move forward. Fuller said Randy Meisner is \"upset that this James Newton continues to insinuate himself into Randy's life.\"\"Fortunately, he has a strong group of very committed friends who have been taking care of him and basically watching over him,\" Fuller said. \"With today's ruling, now Art Ford and Tom Delong can begin the process of getting in place some caregivers and people who can help him on a long-term basis.\"Randy Meisner didn't respond to a request for comment through a publicist.Troy Martin, Newton's attorney, said he's disappointed in Friday's ruling. He plans on determining the level of care Randy Meisner is receiving in the weeks before the next hearing on May 25, and he said he's asked Ford and Delong to provide him with a care plan.Newton characterized Randy Meisner and his children as the victims in the situation. He said he'll continue to push for the famed bassist to be reunited with his children.\"It's sad that this happened to Lana, and my heart goes out to her family and loved ones -- this shouldn't happen to anyone,\" Newton said. \"But I'm focused on getting Randy the help and care and support from his family that he obviously needs.\"\n\n","title":"Court battle after death of Lana Meisner, wife of Eagles bassist Randy Meisner - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Court battle after death of Eagles bassist's wife, Lana Meisner https://t.co/28eWF6Alqv https://t.co/BUGnbZA1sF","date":"Sat Apr 02 16:00:30 +0000 2016","favs":18,"id":{"$numberLong":"716294242604285953"},"retweets":19},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1REpxal"}

It's not really\nhard.\"\"That's why you do it,\" he added. \"It's not like I drew it out of a hat\nor something, Jimmy. It was my judgment that I thought he was better than the\nother two.\"You can watch the exchange here:Earlier in the interview, Christie\nwas forced to confront one particularly awkward moment on the campaign trail\nwith the GOP front-runner last month.\"You look like you were having a blast,\"\nFallon said, pointing to a photo of Christie gazing off into the distance\nwhile standing behind Trump during his Super Tuesday victory speech. The\nmoment, which launched a thousand Twitter memes, prompted many to jokingly\nwonder whether Christie was being held against his will by the billionaire's\ncampaign.Fallon repeated the question Friday: \"Were you being held hostage at\nthis time?\"Christie replied: \"This is what you would look like if you were\nstanding behind Jay Leno when he was doing his monologue.\"\"If you're used to\ntalking, it's awkward not to talk,\" he continued. \"So if you're standing\nthere, I'm listening.\"Then Fallon brought out some apropos props: cardboard\ncutouts of Christie and himself -- complete with despondent faces -- which he\nplaced over their respective shoulders.Christie joked of his own face, \"I'm\ntelling you -- I like that! He looks serious.\"\"You don't find that distracting\n- that person?\" Fallon asked.\"No,\" Christie said. \"He looks serious, he's\nlistening.\"Of Fallon's own cardboard doppleganger, however, Christie snarked:\n\"That's what you look like every night, though.\"The interview later turned to\nserious matters, with the late-night host questioning Christie on a possible\nvice presidential nomination if Trump won the Republican primary race.\"If\nTrump is the nominee, would you consider being vice president?\" Fallon\nasked.\"I have a hard time believing that anyone would ask me to be vice\npresident ... because of that,\" Christie said, pointing over his shoulder.\n\"When you're vice president that's basically what you do, right?\"\n\n","title":"Chris Christie defends Trump in uncomfortable Jimmy Fallon interview - CBS News","twitter":{"body":".@ChrisChristie defends @realDonaldTrump endorsement in uncomfortable @JimmyFallon interview https://t.co/ix0QHy2bZV https://t.co/XBzQ1mwmQT","date":"Sat Apr 02 15:23:57 +0000 2016","favs":56,"id":{"$numberLong":"716285045523218433"},"retweets":36},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1VjBhne"}

As he talks into the camera, shots ring out and he falls.With the phone still recording, an apparent gunman appears, standing overhead. He extends his arms as he fires more than a dozen times.\"We are confident (it) isn't a hoax,\" Chicago police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a brief statement emailed Friday afternoon.Police found the video during a now-standard online search following reports of a shooting.Guglielmi said the 31-year-old victim was hospitalized in critical condition. He added the man was known to police and that detectives were waiting to speak with him.Investigators were exploring whether the man videoing himself was targeted in retaliation for previous violence, he said. The gunman fled and no suspect is in custody.There is no indication the man was hit inadvertently or that it was a case of mistaken identity, said Guglielmi, the police department's communications director.\"He was certainly targeted,\" he said. \"We are trying to find out why.\"Among the theories investigators are considering is that the shooting might have been in retaliation for taunting rival street-gang members live online. Another possibility is that the man taking the selfie was taunting rivals after straying purposely into another gang's territory, Guglielmi said.In gang-related shootings, investigators typically search social media sites for clues when a call comes in. In this case, they found the video on Facebook, Guglielmi said.\"More and more of these incidents either originate or escalate from some type of activity that is on a social media platform,\" Guglielmi said. The term police use for the phenomenon, he said, is 'cyber-banging.'In the video, the man smiles as he looks into the camera, turns around with the camera focused on him and talks about a small store behind him. Some people can be seen standing on a sidewalk nearby. A few seconds before shooting starts, he says, \"I can't be out here without the store being open.\" He adds, \"I need somewhere to duck and hide for cover.\"He glances to his right a split second before the first sounds of gunfire.After about 30 seconds of silence, people can be heard talking about rushing to the hospital. And then a woman is heard crying and screaming, \"Oh my God, no! ... I don't believe this!\"\"I really do hate that it happened to him because he is a pretty nice kid,\" Roger Frowner, a resident of the neighborhood who knows the victim, told WBBM.\"It's crazy,\" Frowner added. \"I mean, a person can't stand on the street corner enjoy the sunny day is simply outrageous. It's a shame that people have to watch over their backs. The neighbors in the neighborhood have to duck and lay down on the floors in their own homes.\"\n\n","title":"​Chicago police \"confident\" selfie shooting video isn't hoax - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Chicago police \"confident\" man's shooting on selfie video wasn't a hoax https://t.co/M0cDezTYAu https://t.co/iX2cBMn6dP","date":"Sat Apr 02 03:03:28 +0000 2016","favs":34,"id":{"$numberLong":"716098698271399936"},"retweets":36},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1RSpbCr"}

But for Hispanics it was 10.8 percent, and African-Americans, nearly 20 percent.It may look like a game of musical chairs, but what instructor Donnell Hill is teaching in a Harlem classroom is serious business.\"We are learning time management,\" a student says.\"There it is, right? That's even more of a thing. How many of you are making moves to get here on time in the morning?\" Hill asks.This is STRIVE, a unique nonprofit focused on providing job training skills. Its participants are mostly young men of color. For some, it's the first time they've worn a shirt and tie.It's been STRIVE's mission to help them find work for the past 30 years. \"60 Minutes\" first highlighted the organization's efforts in 1997.Since then, it's shown remarkable results. STRIVE has a 70 percent success rate and has helped more than 66,000 find a job.The model is pretty straightforward. For six weeks straight, instructors hammer home the basics, drilling students on interviewing skills and even proper handshakes.A STRIVE participant practices a strong handshake with instructor Donnell Hill.But it's also part group therapy: They all must tell the others where their lives went wrong.Joseph Moreira, 23, says he learned important lessons from the program.\"That staying comfortable doesn't get you anywhere,\" Moreira tell CBS News. \"Pretty much, to grow as a person, you have to put yourself in uncomfortable situations to know what you really can do.\"\"Our job is to figure out what's going to prevent a young person in a low income community to access an opportunity,\" STRIVE CEO Phil Weinberg says. \"It might be clothing, it might be transportation, it might be issues they're having in their household. And we've got teams that wrap around those individuals and make sure that we're helping them troubleshoot and address road blocks that might be standing in their way to work.\"After they graduate from the classroom, next is on-site job training. During a session at Solar One, they're learning energy efficiency installation and will earn professional certifications.\"If you want to get something, if you want to be something, you have to live like that now,\" says 19-year-old Khadim Sarr.STRIVE has grown tremendously since it first started.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1ab91"},"content":"A move by two of the nation's most populous states to gradually raise their\nminimum wage to record levels is rekindling debate over the impact that could\nhave on jobs.In California, Gov. Jerry Brown on Monday is expected to approve\na statewide minimum wage of $15 an hour to take effect in 2022, while New York\nGov. Andrew Cuomo and state legislators have reached a similar deal. Although\nunions and labor activists are cheering the wage hike, some small business\ngroups are expressing concern.\"It's not like small business owners have this\nvault in their garage that they can go to,\" Tom Scott, executive director of\nthe National Federation of Independent Business/California, said.\"Nobody wants\nto hear the reality here,\" he added. \"Legislators can go back to their\ndistricts, which are heavily populated with small businesses, and have them\nexplain why this did this.\"The NFIB/California says that more than 90 percent\nof the 22,000 small businesses it represents in the state oppose the wage\nhike. The group predicts the pay increase will lead to layoffs and price\nhikes, as well as force some employers to close their doors altogether. The\nright-leaning American Action Forum estimates California's move could cost the\nstate nearly 700,000 jobs.Among many business owners, the link between wage\nhikes and layoffs is self-evident. That view was once shared in liberal\nquarters -- in 1987, for example, the New York Times opposed raising the\nfederal minimum wage to $4.35 an hour because the newspaper believed it would\ncause unemployment to rise.But research since then suggests a more ambiguous\nrelationship between pay and employment. An influential 1995 study by\neconomists David Card and Alan Krueger -- who looked at 410 fast-food\nrestaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania before and after New\nJersey's minimum wage rose from $4.25 to $5.05 an hour -- found \"no indication\nthat the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment.\"As public opinion has\nturned more in favor of raising worker pay, so has the makeup of the low-wage\nlabor force in the U.S. Minimum wage is no longer chiefly for teenagers in\nneed of a little spending money and job experience.Today, between 70 and 80\npercent of minimum wage workers are above the age of 25. The Center for Labor\nResearch and Education at the University of California, Berkeley also projects\nthat more than a third of the 2.2 million Californians now earning the minimum\nwage are parents.There are two key questions in assessing the impact of\nraising the minimum wage, \"what we know from past history, and what do we\nexpect from these new sets of increases that we're seeing,\" Ben Zipperer,\nresearch economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, said. The\ngrowing consensus is \"that the average employment effects of a rising minimum\nwage are hard to detect.\"When the minimum wage is raised, the effect on\nindividual businesses is lessened because their competitors also have to raise\nwages, economists say. And, while fewer workers are hired, fewer leave,\nlessening the need to recruit and train workers.But there are limits to what\ncan be gleaned from the past, and economists including Zipperer are less\ncertain of the ramifications of taking the federal hourly minimum wage from\n$7.25, where it's held for seven years, to $15 as labor activists\nadvocate.\"The research doesn't speak to what the effects of a $15 national\nminimum wage are,\" said Zipperer, who favors raising the baseline wage to $12\nby 2020.In pre-tax dollars, $15 an hour for a full-time job equates to monthly\npay of $2,600, or annual salary of $31,200; $12 an hour adds up to just under\n$25,000.How far that money goes depends in part on where workers live. One way\nof gauging the impact of the minimum wage is to compare it to the middle, or\nmedian, in a given area. California's plan to hike to $15 by 2020 represents a\nmodest increase in San Francisco, for instance, where many workers already\nearn good pay. In a rural area, with relatively low pay, the impact will be\nbroader.Krueger, speaking at an event last month hosted by the Washington\nCenter for Equitable Growth and the Economic Policy Institute, also said the\neconomic effects of a $15 minimum wage are unclear. \"Twelve dollars is\nprobably the outer end of that range in today's dollars. If you go beyond\nthat, we are in unchartered waters.\"\"From a self interest point of view, I can\nsee why some employers take the position that they do. Many others are more\nenlightened and look at the impact on the economy as a whole,\" Krueger\nadded.Confidence among small to midsize businesses has soured in recent weeks\namid volatility in the stock market and presidential campaign rhetoric, a\nsurvey released this week by PNC Financial Services (PNC) found.Still, one in\nfour companies expects to hire additional workers in the next six months, and\n45 percent expect profits to increase in the months ahead.\"As of now, some of\nthe minimum wage hikes as well as everything else in the economy has not\nimpaired the profitability of small businesses,\" Stuart Hoffman, PNC's chief\neconomist, said.\"The federal minimum wage not having been raised since 2009 is\nfalling behind even the slow inflation we have seen for the past seven years,\"\nhe added, noting that he favors periodic increases in the federal minimum\nindexed to inflation.\n\n","title":"Will raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour kill jobs? - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Will raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour kill jobs? https://t.co/3lfQfu2z1o https://t.co/B4bp0o1wq4","date":"Sat Apr 02 01:31:01 +0000 2016","favs":41,"id":{"$numberLong":"716075430856507392"},"retweets":40},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1pSdMFW"}

He said during an\nMSNBC town hall on Tuesday that he'd like to see the practice banned, and that\nwomen who undergo it should face \"some form of punishment.\" But he quickly\nbacktracked, explaining in a statement that while he believes it should be\nbanned, the punishment should be levied on abortion providers, not the women\nseeking abortions.Trump sought to clarify his position during an interview on\nFriday with \"Face the Nation\" moderator John Dickerson. The interview will\nair, in part, on Sunday's broadcast.\"A question was asked to me. And it was\nasked in a very hypothetical. And it was said, 'Illegal, illegal,'\" Trump\nexplained. \"I've been told by some people that was an older line answer and\nthat was an answer that was given on a, you know, basis of an older line from\nyears ago on a very conservative basis.\"Asked how he'd like to change the law\nto further restrict access to abortions, Trump replied, \"The laws are set now\non abortion and that's the way they're going to remain until they're\nchanged.\"\"I would've preferred states' rights,\" he added. \"I think it would've\nbeen better if it were up to the states.

He also stood by his campaign manager, Corey\nLewandowski, who's been charged with battery after allegedly grabbing a\nreporter's arm during a public event last month. And he suggested on Tuesday\nthat he no longer feels bound by his pledge to support the eventual GOP\nnominee, complaining that the party has treated him \"very unfairly.\"Despite a\nchorus of critics assailing both moves, Trump told \"Face the Nation\" it hasn't\nbeen the worst week of his campaign.\"I think I've had many bad weeks and I've\nhad many good weeks. I don't see this as the worst week in my campaign,\" he\nsaid. \"But certainly, I've had some weeks, and you've been reporting on them,\nwhere that was the end.

Dermyer pulled a woman over last year on Interstate 64 for expired license plates, his gut told him something wasn't right.Dermyer called a former partner and said the driver was acting normal but he couldn't shake a strange feeling. Dermyer eventually searched the trunk and found the remains of the driver's long-missing son, authorities said. The driver has since been charged with murder.It was the kind of career-making stop that friends and colleagues said highlighted his natural gift for police work. Dermyer was fatally shot Thursday at the Richmond Greyhound bus station when a gunman opened fire.\"That was him: he dug, he didn't give up,\" said Cyndi Grace, who partnered with Dermyer for four years at the Newport News Police Department. \"He was exceptional in every sense of the word.\"Dermyer had been participating with about a dozen other troopers in a training exercise at the bus station. Police said James Brown III, of Aurora, Illinois, shot Dermyer before being killed by two other troopers. Two women were also shot but were expected to recover. Police have not said what Brown's motive may have been.An undated mugshot shows James Brown III.Brown, 34, was from Aurora, Illinois. He had a lengthy criminal record in his home state, including charges of attempted murder, unlawful possession of a firearm and body armor as a felon and threatening to kill someone by phone. He often pleaded guilty to lesser charges or a single charge after being charged with several crimes.Brown's most recent conviction there was from 2012, when he pleaded guilty to domestic battery and aggravated battery of a pregnant woman and was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison.His aunt, Edith Brown, told CBS affiliate WTVR in Richmond she was upset about what happened, but not surprised.\"He had a lot of anger about the police in the past,\" Edith Brown said. \"He pretty much thought he wanted to be infamous . . . in terms of having a showdown. He always praised those people who got into shootouts with police.\"\"He always liked the criminal side,\" she added.She said her nephew vowed that his prison days were over.\"He said he would never go back to prison again,\" she said. \"He would fight it out with them.\"The injured women's names haven't been released, but a spokesman for Binghamton University in New York said that one of them was a member of the school's track team. The team was headed Thursday to a meet at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, about 50 miles from Richmond.The Binghamton student was released from the hospital Friday, spokesman Ryan Yarosh said.On Friday, friends and family fondly recalled Dermyer as a devoted family man and consummate professional.\"He was a gentle outgoing person who would do anything for anyone,\" his brother John Dermyer Jr. said in an email.Earlier this year, Dermyer and another trooper became mini celebrities when they helped rescue a lost dog running through interstate traffic in Hampton. Jeffrey Corbin, the dog's owner, said Dermyer's easy-going personality helped reshape Corbin's view of police.\"I don't have a lot of contact with state troopers, but in my mind's eye they seem to be all business,\" Corbin said. \"But he seemed to be a really warm person.... He had a warm persona about him.\"Dermyer is survived by his wife and two children. He was a former Marine who previously served on police forces in Jackson and Newport News, Virginia.The Richmond Greyhound station where the shooting occurred was scheduled to re-open Friday afternoon. Police continue to investigate the sequence that led to Brown shooting Dermyer.Virginia State Police Superintendent Col.

More than 11 million have lost their homes. But the greatest cultural loss was in the ancient city of Palmyra, a world heritage site.This week, the Assad dictatorship retook Palmyra from ISIS \\-- the bad guys taking it back from the worse guys, if you will.CBS News' Elizabeth Palmer reached Palmyra today, the first journalist for a U.S. network to enter the city.After 10 months under ISIS' control, who would have believed Palmyra could look so good. But up close, there are monumental gaps.For 2,000 years, the Roman Triumphal Arch spanned the entrance.

But no one's going to be moving back in anytime soon.For ISIS, Palmyra was a strategic prize and an opportunity to taunt the world -- with videos that showed fighters destroying priceless treasures and a mass execution in Palmyra's Roman amphitheater.But one atrocity has left especially deep scars, the execution of Mohamed al Asad's father, Khaled, who was Palmyra's director of antiquities.He was decapitated by ISIS and his body put on display.\"He was so brave,\" Mohamed tells CBS News. \"And I loved him so much.\"And his father loved the Palmyra Museum -- his life's work -- now wrecked.It's a wonder this building is still standing considering the amount of artillery and Russian airstrikes that were necessary to take back the town from ISIS.Everywhere, there's more ISIS desecration. A whole room full of delicate stone busts, their faces hacked away. And among Palmyra's greatest losses is the temple of Bel. All but the arch was blown to bits.And yet -- there's hope.Mohamed el Asad is already thinking of reconstruction.But where would he start?The experts, he assures CBS News, can do it.

The girl's parents brought her to Holtz Children's Hospital, part of the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Medical Center, where U-Health surgeons performed a seven-organ transplant to save her life. In 2014, during an ultrasound while just six weeks pregnant Valdez's mother, Julissa Cerda, received devastating news about the embryo she was carrying. It was all too familiar and hard to deal with. Her doctors in Texas noticed that her second child's bladder was enlarged, and suspected he was developing the same rare congenital disease that also affected Delilah Valdez.Doctors say both of Cerda's children developed Megacystis Microcolon Intestinal Hypoperistalsis Syndrome (MMIHS) or Berdon Syndrome. It's a rare prenatal condition involving a dilated urinary bladder, which causes massive abdominal distension, microcolon, and decreased or absent intestinal function. The condition is usually fatal within the first year of a child's life. It affects roughly one in 1 million children. When Cerda gave birth in 2015, her son Liam Emmanuel Garza was immediately placed on an intravenous feeding. Liam's only chance at survival was a multi-organ transplant - and just a few hospitals in the United States specialize in these types of complex transplant surgeries for children. Julissa was determined to have Liam treated at Holtz Children's Hospital where UHealth surgeons had saved her daughter's life. In 2011, Delilah received a new stomach, pancreas, liver, large and small bowel, spleen and kidney- a seven-organ transplant that made headlines around the world. Delilah, who is now 6-years-old and healthy, is thriving in kindergarten.\"I immediately knew that Liam's only change at survival would be at Jackson,\" said Cerda. \"When my daughter Delilah was diagnosed, I did my research and I knew that Jackson was one of the few hospitals in the country that also performed stomach transplants.\"In January 2016, Liam was placed on the transplant list and brought to Holtz Children's. On February 2rd3, Liam successfully underwent a 9-hour transplant surgery, receiving eight new organs: a liver, stomach, large and small bowel, pancreas, two kidneys, and bladder.Liam, who recently started eating solid food, is currently awaiting discharge.\n\n","title":"University of Miami surgeons save siblings with multi-organ transplants - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"5 years after surgeons save life of infant, they're called again to save younger brother https://t.co/EcfIv1u8Rf https://t.co/Vp93YXJ5qx","date":"Fri Apr 01 20:03:57 +0000 2016","favs":72,"id":{"$numberLong":"715993123181240328"},"retweets":34},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1ToMhzF"}

The show's African-American, Asian and Latino actors have been cheered by President Barack Obama, British actress Helen Mirren and many others.The latest snag occurred when the show posted on its website a call for \"nonwhite men and women, ages 20s to 30s, for Broadway and upcoming tours.\" Equity, which usually reviews casting notices, said it had not in this case.\"Our audition rules are created to provide the broadest access possible for our members to be seen for roles,\" the union said.The show is by Lin-Manuel Miranda, who wrote the show's book, music and lyrics, and stars in the title role.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1aba4"},"content":"An experienced California diver who was helping with the exploration of the\nnarrow underwater passageways that radiate from a well-known swimming hole in\neastern New Mexico has died, authorities confirmed Thursday.The initial\ninvestigation suggests 43-year-old Shane Thompson's death below the Blue Hole,\na tourist destination in the community of Santa Rosa, was an accidental\ndrowning.Police Chief Jude Gallegos said Thompson was among 10 or so people\nfrom the ADM Exploration Foundation who were at Blue Hole for a multiple-day\nexploration. The group has been working on surveying the underwater cave\nsystem since 2013.Thompson dove into Blue Pool on March 26 with another\nexperienced diver, Mike Young, Gallegos said. They planned to have Young enter\npart of the cave system while Thompson stayed outside in a safety role.Instead\nof staying outside, Thompson entered, Gallegos said. \"Apparently something\nwent horribly wrong, and he started to panic,\" the chief said.The divers were\nabout 160 feet below the surface when the incident happened.It still was\nunclear Thursday what went wrong. It could be weeks before preliminary autopsy\nresults are available, the state Office of the Medical Investigator\nsaid.Family members said Thursday they were struggling with Thompson's death,\nbut they acknowledged that diving was what he loved to do and that he had\nearned numerous certifications over his lifetime.A Navy veteran, Thompson\nbegan diving at a young age while growing up in the Florida Keys. After\nearning his first certification, he went to work for an underwater\nconstruction company and later started numerous diving businesses that focused\non everything from boat maintenance to salvage work and training.Last year,\nThompson rediscovered the wreckage of the B-36 \"Peacemaker\" bomber that had\ncrashed in 1952 near Mission Beach. A video posted by Thompson's San Diego-\nbased Advanced Underwater Training business shows his flashlight scanning the\nengines and other corroded pieces of the plane as he makes his way through the\ndarkness more than 250 feet below the surface.In New Mexico, the Blue Hole has\nbeen an attraction for centuries. Legend has it that outlaw Billy the Kid\nwould take a dip at the swimming hole before heading into Santa Rosa.The\nartesian spring, tucked into a rock outcropping, pumps out about 3,000 gallons\nper minute. The steady flow results in crystal clear conditions that have\nattracted divers from around the world.At the bottom of the bell-shaped\nspring, there's a metal grate that keeps divers from going any farther.\"From\nthat point on it goes into a maze - kind of looks like intestines,\" said\nGallegos, a longtime Santa Rosa resident who has seen a three-dimensional\nmodel of the cave system.The caves have been sealed off since 1976, when two\ndivers in training died after getting separated from their classmates. New\nMexico State Police divers quickly found one of the bodies, but it took\nseveral weeks to find the other. In the process, police divers made a crude\nmap of some of the unexplored passageways.At that time, one of the divers\ndescended close to 200 feet and found himself at the edge of an underwater\ncliff.

The study, published\nin the Orthopedic Journal of Sports Medicine, also found that ankle injuries\nare more common on colder game days.Greater emphasis has been placed on player\nsafety in recent years, particularly when it comes to concussions, as a\ngrowing body evidence shows the head injuries are associated with a number of\nlong-term health problems, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy\n(CTE).\"We were motivated by the high rates of injury in the NFL, and when we\ndid our own review, we found limited evidence as to identifying risk factors\nfor injury,\" David Lawrence, lead author of the study and a clinical fellow at\nSt. Michael's Hospital, told CBS News. \"This would be a potential target to\nhelp improve player safety so we thought we'd take the first step in trying to\nidentify some.\"The researchers analyzed weekly injury report data from the\n2012-2013 and 2013-2014 regular seasons for all 32 NFL teams. They identified\nthe five most common injuries -- knee, ankle, hamstring, shoulder, and\nconcussions -- and checked to see which, if any, external risk factors may\nhave played a role.The results showed NFL players had a two-fold greater risk\nof concussions and 1.5 higher risk for ankle injuries when games were played\nin 50 degrees Fahrenheit or lower when compared to games played in\ntemperatures of about 70 degrees or warmer.The study also found that an\nincreased rate of shoulder injuries when games were played on natural grass\ncompared to synthetic turf. Other factors, including altitude, time zone\nchange prior to game, period in the season, or distance traveled to a game,\nwere not associated with higher risk of any of the five injuries.The study did\nnot look at the reasons for the associations, but the researchers offer some\ntheories.\"At colder temperatures, materials and equipment in the playing\nenvironment have a lower elastic potential and that may increase the impact\nforces that are transmitted during the game and increase forces to the head,\"\nLawrence said.He also noted that at warmer temperatures, players may be under-\nreporting concussions, instead falsely attributing symptoms to heat exhaustion\nor dehydration. During colder games, players often interact more closely with\nathletic staff on the sidelines to access coats, hand warmers, and other\nwarming equipment, making it more likely that symptoms of concussions will be\nrecognized earlier.For ankle injuries, Lawrence explained that some of the\nbody's reflexes may not work as well in colder temperatures, which might\nincrease the risk of injury.However, the authors said that at this time, there\nis not enough evidence to know whether the results can be applicable to injury\nprevention efforts by the NFL.\"Before any injury prevention initiatives or\nstrategies are taken based on these or similar results, the results need to be\nreplicated in multiple other studies with more robust data and larger data\nsets,\" Lawrence said. \"This study is the first step and and highlights the\ndiscussion around this topic.\n\n","title":"NFL concussions more common on colder game days - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"NFL players at greater risk of concussions and other injuries on colder game days https://t.co/ad4OkgvNCp https://t.co/Gs6B0s2YkK","date":"Thu Mar 31 22:47:27 +0000 2016","favs":28,"id":{"$numberLong":"715671881425227777"},"retweets":56},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1ZOCUtX"}

It probably doesn't cross most peoples' minds to wonder how often a\ndeli cleans its meat slicer, but a new report shows it could be cause for\nconcern.Researchers from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nvisited 298 randomly selected delis -- including chain, grocery store and\nindependent locations in New York -- and found that about half don't clean and\nsanitize their meat slicers as often as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\nrecommends.The FDA sets the recommendations to prevent the spread of Listeria,\nsalmonella, and other germs that can make people seriously ill, and in some\ncases lead to death.Listeria contamination from sliced deli meats is a major\ncause of illness and outbreaks. Listeria leads to the third highest number of\ndeaths from foodborne illness in the United States annually.Making a meat\nslicer germ-free isn't as simple as running it through a dishwasher once a\nday. Fully cleaning one involves taking it apart, cleaning and sanitizing it\nevery four hours, according to the FDA.CDC Food Safety Program scientist Laura\nBrown, lead author of the research, which is published in the CDC's Morbidity\nand Mortality Weekly Report, told CBS News that she and colleagues interviewed\ndeli managers about their cleaning policies and practices, interviewed\nworkers, and made observations.Chain-owned delis and delis with more customers\nand more slicers cleaned their slicing equipment more often, said Brown. Also,\ndelis were more likely to fully clean their slicers more frequently if they\nhad required managers to undergo food safety training, if their workers had\nreceived food safety educations, and if there were written slicer-cleaning\npolicies.\"We do find that in general, chain restaurants and larger delis do\ntend to have better practices,\" said Brown.Infectious disease expert Dr. Bruce\nFarber said the study results don't surprise him.\"But I am surprised they got\nas good a result as they did,\" Farber, chief of infectious diseases at North\nShore University Hospital in Manhasset, NY, and Long Island Jewish Medical\nCenter, in New Hyde Park, told CBS News.Farber said he is more concerned about\nfresh produce when it comes to the spread of foodborne illnesses.\"Fresh fruits\nand vegetables are probably more risky to the average person than processed\nmeats when it comes to food poisoning and that probably also applies to\nListeria.\"There isn't good quality control when it comes to how those fruits\nand vegetables have been irrigated, he explained. \"They are irrigated and\nfertilized with water often contaminated by animals or sewage and they are not\nwashed as vigorously as they often should be before eating,\" Farber said,\nnoting that some produce, such as strawberries, are harder to clean than\nothers.The authors recommended in the report that states and localities should\nrequire deli manager training and certification, following the FDA's Food\nCode, and consider encouraging or requiring delis to post written policies on\nmeat slicer cleaning.But the upshot is not for people to avoid their beloved\ncorned beef on rye or Italian sub at their local \"Mom and Pop\" deli -- just\nconsider asking about their cleaning policies.\"They might want to ask when was\nlast time the food slicer was cleaned, and do they have a food safety\nmanager?\" said Brown.\n\n","title":"Germs may be lurking in your deli's meat slicer - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Step away from the sandwich...New CDC report uncovers troubling findings: https://t.co/9pUM2Hzl2P https://t.co/aaw68uCHwq","date":"Thu Mar 31 19:15:35 +0000 2016","favs":31,"id":{"$numberLong":"715618562283606016"},"retweets":53},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1ZOfAfF"}

He became angry when his wife and flight attendants told him to return to his seat. \"Pae pushed his wife because she was trying to make him stop,\" the complaint said. \"He felt that she was siding with the flight crew.\"He tried to head-butt and bite Marines who were passengers on the flight and tried to force him back to his seat, Assistant U.S. Attorney Darren Ching said at Pae's detention hearing Wednesday.According to the complaint, he threatened to kill passengers and was yelling that there is no god.Pae went into a rage because he felt the flight crew was ordering him around, Ching said.Ching said Pae shouldn't be released because he's a danger to his wife, himself and others. Pae urinated on himself and was on suicide watch at the Honolulu Federal Detention Center, Ching said.U.S. Magistrate Judge Kevin Chang ordered that Pae be released on $25,000 bond, but with certain conditions including not leaving the island of Oahu and undergoing a mental health evaluation.Since the arrest, Pae's wife has been staying at the Waikiki Gateway Hotel, defense attorney Jin Tae \"J.T.\" Kim told the judge, who asked whether Pae had financial resources to continue staying there after his release. Kim said he's working with the consulate to transfer more money to Pae's wife and find alternate, temporary housing.Chang denied Kim's request to allow Pae to return home to Korea, because that would involve getting on a plane again.Outside of court, Kim said his client is a 72-year-old retired farmer who traveled from South Korea to celebrate his 40th wedding anniversary with a Hawaii vacation. It was the couple's first trip to Hawaii.Pae only recently took up yoga to help with anxiety, Kim said, adding that he was sleep-deprived during the vacation. Pae told the FBI he hadn't been able to sleep in 11 days.\n\n","title":"Flight returns to Hawaii after unlikely disturbance - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Flight returns to Hawaii because violent passenger wanted to do yoga instead of sit in seat, FBI says https://t.co/ZM6NUXSTDO","date":"Thu Mar 31 18:47:30 +0000 2016","favs":71,"id":{"$numberLong":"715611496538091520"},"retweets":93},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1M3KAWY"}

Nairobi National Park, on the outskirts of the Kenyan\ncapital, is under growing pressure as the city expands. After that incident, a\nleading Kenyan wildlife expert, Paula Kahumbu, said the noise from nearby road\nconstruction was scaring lions out of the park and could lead to the deaths of\npeople or lions.In South Africa, officials said Thursday they captured a male\nlion that had escaped from Karoo National Park earlier this week. It was the\nlion's second escape from the park, located in an arid, sparsely populated\narea.Wildlife officials originally said they would have to kill the lion, but\nthen said they would consider other options, including relocating it to\nanother park, after an outcry from conservationists.\n\n","title":"Grim fate for lions that stray from Kenya park - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Grim fate for lions who wandered out of Kenya park https://t.co/NnYmbIgk0T https://t.co/Ss8ezoLLpk","date":"Thu Mar 31 18:25:37 +0000 2016","favs":19,"id":{"$numberLong":"715605987382661120"},"retweets":35},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1ZO8Z52"}

They also tracked how many\npeople engaged with that message by seeking resources to help quit smoking on\nGoogle or Wikipedia or by calling quitlines.\"This strategy allowed us to\nobserve how awareness days typically unfold in both the media and in the minds\nand actions of individuals,\" study co-author Benjamin Althouse, a research\nscientist at the Institute for Disease Modeling and the Santa Fe Institute,\nand lead analyst for the study, said in a statement. \"We can track how a\ncessation message moves across news and social media, and ultimately how the\npublic reacts by seeking out additional information on how to quit.\"The\nresults, published by JMIR Public Health and Surveillance, showed that\ncompared to an average day, the Great American Smokeout typically coincided\nwith a 61 percent increase in news reports on smoking cessation. It also\ncorresponded to a 13-percent spike in the number of tweets encouraging people\nto quit smoking.The study authors point out that this was the second-highest\ndaily news coverage of smoking cessation, only falling short of New Year's\nDay, when health resolutions are a big topic.The analysis also found that\nGoogle inquiries like \"help quit smoking\" typically increased by 25 percent on\nthe Great American Smokeout. Visits to the Wikipedia page on smoking cessation\nrose 22 percent and calls to quitlines jumped 42 percent.In terms of numbers,\nthis translated to about 61,000 additional Google searches, Wikipedia visits,\nand calls to quitlines.\"This shows that the Great American Smokeout is having\na significant impact on smoking cessation,\" Ayers said. Although it doesn't\nprove how many of those people actually quit, it does show the message got\nthrough and prompted them to take steps in the right direction.What's more,\nthe data can now be used to help make future awareness campaigns more\neffective. \"For example, there was on year where the spike was bigger than\nother years. We can look at messages that originated from the American Cancer\nSociety to potentially understand why,\" Ayers said.This study also provides a\nmodel to measure the impact of other awareness days and make them better.\"Now,\nhundreds of awareness days can be evaluated for the first time and we can\nstart the process of making them evidence-based,\" Ayers said. \"We can make\ndata-driven decisions about which media messages are most effectual and how to\nmake them more effectual.\"\n\n","title":"How effective are health \"awareness days\"? - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Do health \"awareness days\" actually make a difference? https://t.co/Edf8C06tSL https://t.co/PvH085cfYJ","date":"Thu Mar 31 14:00:43 +0000 2016","favs":13,"id":{"$numberLong":"715539323387527168"},"retweets":14},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1ZNiX6D"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1abb1"},"content":"******NEW YORK -- **An expedited screening program called PreCheck was supposed to be the answer to maddeningly long security lines at the airport. But four years after its launch, the Transportation Security Administration is far short of enrolling enough travelers to make a difference, spelling trouble for summer travel season.Fliers can expect massive security lines across the country, with airlines already warning passengers to arrive at least two hours early or risk missing their flight.The TSA cut its airport screener staff by 10 percent in the past three years, anticipating PreCheck would speed up the process. When not enough fliers enrolled, the agency tried to make up for that shortfall by randomly placing passengers into the express lanes. But it recently scaled back that effort for fear dangerous passengers were being let through. That's when the lines started growing, up to 90 minutes in some cases.The TSA is shifting some resources to tackle lines at the nation's biggest airports, but says there is no easy solution to the problem with a record number of fliers expected this summer.\"We had unacceptable line waits at the majority of our hubs,\" says Robert Isom, chief operating officer of American Airlines. \"Based on what the TSA is telling us, there is no relief in sight.\"Launched nationwide in 2012, PreCheck gives previously vetted passengers special screening. Shoes, belts and light jackets stay on. Laptops and liquids stay in bags. And these fliers go through standard metal detectors rather than the explosive-detecting full-body scanners most pass through.PreCheck lanes can screen 300 passengers an hour, twice that of standard lanes.The TSA offered Congress a lofty goal of having 25 million fliers enrolled in the program. Based on that and other increased efficiencies, the TSA's front-line screeners were cut from 47,147 three years ago to 42,525 currently. At the same time, the number of annual fliers passing through checkpoints has grown from 643 million to more than 700 million.As of March 1, only 9.3 million people were PreCheck members. Applicants must pay $85 to $100 every five years. They must also trek to the airport for an interview before being accepted. Getting once-a-year fliers to spend the time or the money to join has been a challenge. While 250,000 to 300,000 people are joining every month, it will take more than four years at that pace to reach the target.\"It hasn't been a failure; it just isn't moving as quickly as it needs to move,\" says Sharon Pinkerton, senior vice president for legislative and regulatory policy at airline trade group Airlines for America.Without enough members, the TSA faced a problem: PreCheck lanes were nearly deserted while other lines snaked throughout terminals. Keeping empty PreCheck lanes open was a waste of staff. But without them, passengers who paid to join would be aggravated.So the agency created workarounds to allow passengers who hadn't been fully vetted to still get expedited screening.Those who flew 50,000 miles a year or more with an airline sometimes got the PreCheck designation on their boarding pass at check-in. Others would randomly get it based on demographic information.As a further step, the TSA in 2013 created a program called Managed Inclusion where it randomly pulls people out of the normal line when it grows too long. Fliers' behavior is monitored, they are screened for explosives and then allowed to use the faster PreCheck lane.The Associated Press has made repeated requests under the Freedom of Information Act for details on how many fliers are allowed into PreCheck through each method, but has been denied the information for unspecified security reasons.Lines did get shorter. By Thanksgiving 2014 nearly 50 percent of fliers were getting expedited screening.Then last year, two back-to-back embarrassing inspector general reports came out, highlighting TSA security lapses. One disclosed that the agency let a convicted domestic terrorist use PreCheck. The second revealed that in 67 out of 70 tests across the nation, screeners failed to find mock weapons and explosives.In response, TSA agents stopped pulling passengers out of line unless there was an explosive-detecting canine team present. That change went into effect in September, right after the Labor Day rush.The move forced about 10 percent of all passengers -- some 70 million fliers a year -- to go back to normal screening.Longer lines soon followed. By February, just 26 percent of passengers were screened through PreCheck, according to Associated Press calculations on TSA data obtained through a public records request.During the week of spring break in mid-March, 6,800 American Airlines passengers missed their flights because of long checkpoint lines, foreshadowing the headaches airlines fear during the peak summer travel months.\"The TSA is more or less suggesting that we need to live with it,\" says Isom, American's chief operating officer.At Seattle-Tacoma International Airport waits have topped out at 90 minutes, with the typical morning rush averaging 45 minutes to an hour, says Wendy Reiter, the airport's director of security and emergency preparedness. In the first week of March, 50 Delta Air Lines passengers missed international flights -- the type of flight that only departs once a day.Last week, officials in Charlotte, North Carolina were warning passengers of waits exceeding 75 minutes, saying the lines were \"extremely heavy.\"At the world's busiest airport, in Atlanta, general manager Miguel Southwell told the TSA last month that \"things appear to be only getting worse.\"And in Minneapolis, executive director Jeffrey Hamiel told the TSA that \"we are experiencing unacceptably long security wait times during peak periods.\"The TSA knows there is no quick fix.\"The real answer to the volume growth is to ideally get a fully-vetted trusted traveler population,\" TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger told The Associated Press.For now though, the agency is relocating 28 of its 142 canine teams to the 20 busiest airports so it can randomly put more fliers into PreCheck. The TSA won't say which airports are losing the teams and could therefore have longer lines.An additional 200 screeners are being trained each week, but that is offset by the average 103 screeners the TSA loses weekly through attrition. The agency is asking airlines to enforce carry-on bags restrictions before checkpoints so it has fewer bags to screen. Airport and airline staff will also take over some non-security related tasks, such as returning empty bins to the start of the checkpoint.There has been one bright side: the TSA says there is a direct correlation between longer lines and a spike in PreCheck enrollments.\n\n","title":"​A long wait: Fliers brace for big security lines at airports - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Fliers can expect massive security lines across the country; here's why https://t.co/8d4c5hiAqL https://t.co/hcSUPlt4TQ","date":"Thu Mar 31 07:21:03 +0000 2016","favs":28,"id":{"$numberLong":"715438743029583872"},"retweets":43},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1pLfqsW"}

Given consumer reluctance to eat tough chicken\nbreasts, that could lead some producers to sell the meat at a lower price or\neven to breed smaller chickens in an effort to eliminate the problem.\"The\nchicken companies will have employees in processing plants looking at every\npiece of breast meat for any quality issues,\" Super said. \"If found, affected\nmeat is pulled from the line, typically sold at a discount and then further\nprocessed or ground for products like chicken sausage.\"\n\n","title":"\"Woody breast\" could bite the chicken business - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Emerging phenomenon called \"woody breast\" hits the chicken business https://t.co/Rys7XLqGoi https://t.co/S4W1N78gj7","date":"Wed Mar 30 20:41:57 +0000 2016","favs":31,"id":{"$numberLong":"715277909603262466"},"retweets":42},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1pLmC8e"}

The assassination attempt left him\nwounded in the chest, and his press secretary James Brady badly injured with a\ngunshot to the head.The entire ordeal was caught on video and in now-iconic\nphotographs.This photo taken by presidential photographer Mike Evens on March\n30, 1981 shows police and Secret Service agents reacting during the\nassassination attempt on then US president Ronald Reagan, after a conference\noutside the Hilton Hotel in Washington, D.C.. Reagan was hit by one of six\nshots fired by John Hinckley, who also seriously injured press secretary James\nBrady (just behind the car). Reagan was hit in the chest and was hospitalized\nfor 12 days. Hinckley was acquitted 21 June 1982 after a jury found him\nmentally unstable.\"The president first waves with his right arm, then you see\nhis left arm go up, and there comes the shot,\" Dan Rather, CBS Evening News\nanchor at the time, said as he described the footage during a live special\nreport.\"That's Secret Service agent Jerry Parr, pushing the president into the\nlimousine -- and James Brady the White House Press Secretary is hit,\" he\ncontinued.The shooter was John Hinckley Jr., a 25-year-old man who claimed he\nwas trying to impress actress Jodie Foster.

He'd be the 10th convicted killer executed in the U.S. this year, the sixth in Texas.Authorities said the slayings were revenge for his former wife's complaints to his probation officer that led to an arrest warrant issued for him.An attorney seeking to represent Battaglia has asked federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, for a reprieve so Battaglia's mental competency for execution could be further reviewed. The Supreme Court has ruled a prisoner can be executed if he's aware of his pending execution and understands why he's being put to death.\"This situation is morally bankrupt and violates basic notions of fairness in our capital punishment system,\" attorney Gregory Gardner told the high court, which in January refused to review his case.But Erich Dryden, an assistant Texas attorney general, told the justices the last-day appeals were improper, without merit and \"a fishing expedition.\"Evidence showed that at the time of the shootings, Battaglia was on probation for a Christmas 1999 attack on his estranged wife Mary Jean Pearle, the girls' mother. Their divorce was finalized the following August.Around Easter 2001, he called Pearle, swearing at her and calling her names, a violation of his probation. She reported the incident to his probation officer and Battaglia learned on May 2, 2001, that an arrest warrant had been issued. That evening, Pearle left their daughters with him for a planned dinner.She soon received a message that one of the girls had called for her. Pearle returned the call and Battaglia put her on speakerphone, telling Faith to ask her mother: \"Why do you want Daddy to go to jail?\"Pearle heard the child cry out: \"No, Daddy, please don't, don't do it.\"Pearle yelled into the phone for the girls to run and heard gunshots, followed by Battaglia telling her: \"Merry ... Christmas,\" the words divided by an obscenity. After hearing more gunfire, Pearle hung up and called 911.Evidence showed Faith was shot three times, and Liberty five. A semiautomatic pistol found near the kitchen door was among more than a dozen firearms recovered from Battaglia's apartment. Hours later, Battaglia was arrested leaving a tattoo shop where he had two large red roses inked on his left arm to commemorate his daughters.\"I don't feel like I killed them,\" Battaglia told The Dallas Morning News in 2014. \"I am a little bit in the blank about what happened.\" He referred to them as his \"best little friends.\" He declined to speak with The Associated Press as his execution date neared.Battaglia's trial attorneys called no witnesses during the guilt-innocence portion of his capital murder trial in 2002, and a Dallas County jury deliberated only 19 minutes before convicting him. During the punishment phase, jurors heard defense testimony that Battaglia's mental illness should convince them a life prison sentence would be appropriate. They did not agree.The lead prosecutor at the trial, Howard Blackmon, recalled Battaglia as \"uniquely sinister.\"\"This guy was so controlling, so vindictive to have murdered his own flesh and blood, his little girls, just out of spite,\" he said last week. Testimony at Battaglia's trial also showed he'd been violent with his first wife, who obtained a protective order that he ignored.\n\n","title":"​Dallas man set to die for killing daughters, 9 and 6 - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Texas man set to die for killing daughters, 9 and 6, while his ex-wife listened https://t.co/tCvaymwdnX https://t.co/HdHJXkID0b","date":"Wed Mar 30 14:37:57 +0000 2016","favs":91,"id":{"$numberLong":"715186304875675648"},"retweets":57},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1Sx1Kvf"}

It no longer exists, for reasons that are way too\ncomplex to flesh out here, but when conservatives have blasted the\nestablishment that's essentially the one they're harkening back to.In recent\nyears the term \"establishment\" has come to mean something different, to the\nextent it means something at all -- the loose assortment of interest groups,\ndonors and officeholders and what have you, that don't want the GOP to lean\ntoo far right. The enemy of the establishment, in this scenario, is \"the base\"\n-- the conservative Republican voters who propelled Ronald Reagan to the\npresidency, Newt Gingrich to the Speaker's chair, and the Tea Party to\nCongress.Now, about that base. The assumption was, among both professional\nconservative rabblerousers and establishment muckety-mucks alike, that base\nvoters are socially conservative, economically libertarian, and hawkish on\nforeign policy. Yet, weirdly enough, these voters seem awfully attracted to\nTrump's trade protectionism, support for entitlements, and (albeit strangely\nbellicose) non-interventionism. They also don't seem to mind that his personal\nlife has a lot more in common with Errol Flynn's than Billy Sunday's.Simply\nput, much of the base has ditched traditional conservatism for Trump's\npopulist nationalism. According to the latest CBS/New York Times poll, he\nstill leads with virtually every Republican demographic group -- a fact that\nhas remained unchanged for months. And he's not doing it by pushing the party\nto the right; in some ways, particularly when it comes to economic policy,\nhe's promising to drag it to the left.If Trump is the candidate of the base,\ndoes that make the forces arrayed against him the de facto establishment?\nPlenty of Trump's conservative detractors would disown the label, even though\nthey've been the ones propounding the \"base vs. establishment\" theory of\nRepublican feuding for decades. And if so, the new division will take some\ngetting used to. Case in point: Despite the looming possibility of across-the-\nnation losses with Trump on top of the ticket, only two senators have endorsed\nhis closest rival, Ted Cruz, who of course also happens to be their\ncolleague.But if Trump wins, he will surely try to rebuild the party in his\nimage -- whatever that ultimately turns out to be during the general election.\nThat means that, if you're a Republican interested in maintaining some form of\nthe status quo, that traditional mission of an otherwise amorphous\nestablishment, well, then, it should follow that, regardless of whether your\nname is Mitch McConnell or Mark Levin, you're an establishmentarian now.\n\n","title":"How Donald Trump re-defines the term \"GOP establishment\" - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"How Donald Trump re-defines the term \"GOP establishment\" https://t.co/wT7gYfPtAb https://t.co/dN3Uj72RuE","date":"Wed Mar 30 12:30:09 +0000 2016","favs":22,"id":{"$numberLong":"715154144592588800"},"retweets":23},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1SwBBg8"}

According to the designers' plan, the soil removed\nfrom the park would be relocated to neighborhoods throughout the city to add\nto other parks and structures.The design calls for a glass facade to cover the\nbuilding. \"With its highly reflective glass cover on all sides, the landscape\ninside the new park can reach beyond physical boundaries, creating an illusion\nof infinity. In the heart of New York City, a New Horizon is born,\" their plan\nstates.Sun and Wu said that their design would make Central Park accessible to\nmore people on a regular basis.Perspective rendering of New York HorizoneVolo\nMagazine's annual award recognizes novel skyscraper ideas that challenge our\nconcept of architecture and the way it is integrated into the natural and\nbuilt environments.The second place winner of this year's contest is called\nThe Hive, by Hadeel Ayed Mohammad, Yifeng Zhao and Chengda Zhu, also from the\nUnited States. The Hive is a high-rise terminal that acts as docking and\ncharging stations for personal or commercial drones. Their project page\nstates: \"This centrally controlled model will be more appealing to the\nlegislative sector as it adheres to the concerns about regulating drone\ntraffic.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1abcb"},"content":"******RIDGE, N.Y. --**Investigators are trying to figure out how a New York foster parent accused of sexually abusing at least seven boys in his care was able to keep getting children placed in his home, despite years of concern about his conduct.Before his arrest in January, Cesar Gonzalez-Mugaburu was the subject of nine previous investigations involving alleged abuse dating back to 1998, according to a spokeswoman for Suffolk County.Each of those inquiries led to a finding that the allegations weren't credible, and none of them led to the removal of children from Gonzalez-Mugaburu's split-level ranch home on eastern Long Island.New York City has also cut placement ties with SCO Family of Services, according to the New York Daily News. The city's Administration for Children's Services plans to inspect 500 homes of the 760 children who were placed in them by the SCO Family of Services.The Suffolk County district attorney has said he is investigating how the system designed to catch and prevent abuse broke down.SCO Family of Services, an agency that placed 72 children in Gonzalez-Mugaburu's care over 20 years, never found reason to stop placing children with him until his arrest in January, said the organization's chief strategy officer, Rose Anello.\"SCO has been working closely with the local authorities and law enforcement to better understand the scope of this matter,\" Anello said.Since the arrest, other victims have continued to come forward, police said. So far, police have interviewed a dozen potential victims. Officials said Gonzalez-Mugaburu has cared for as many as 140 children over the years.The nature of the past complaints about Gonzalez-Mugaburu wasn't immediately clear. Neither police officials, nor SCO would discuss details of past inquiries.Suffolk County Police detective Lt. Robert Donohue, commander of the special victims section, said the last probe before the one that led to Gonzalez-Mugaburu's arrest came in April 2015 and failed to turn up credible evidence of a crime.Gonzalez-Mugaburu made a practice of taking in all boys - many developmentally disabled with behavioral problems, the detective said.\"He was a predator and he knew exactly the segment of the population to prey on,\" Donohue said. \"We're dealing with vulnerable teens from broken families. Most of them are on medications and have diagnoses of behavioral or psychological problems that create a limit in their credibility.\" The detective said the credibility issue was a key factor in failing to develop evidence in some of the prior investigations.Gonzalez-Mugaburu also kept his victims quiet by threatening them and telling them he had installed hidden cameras in his house to watch their every move.\"He told them he could hear and see everything they would do,\" Donohue said.A break came in January, when detectives said two brothers who lived in the house came forward with credible stories of abuse. Once Gonzalez-Mugaburu was in custody, others felt more comfortable about coming forward, Donohue said.Gonzalez-Mugaburu, 59, has pleaded not guilty to a 17-count indictment charging him with child endangerment and sexual misconduct. He is accused of victimizing children as young as 8. One charge alleges he sexually abused a female dog in front of a child.His attorney has not returned telephone messages or responded to an email seeking comment, but in a brief jailhouse interview with the New York Daily News, Gonzalez-Mugaburu said the charges are \"not true.\"Anello said SCO's policy is to certify foster parent homes annually. Caseworkers are expected to make home visits at least once a month. She said socio-therapists visit twice a month. Anello did not respond to questions about whether all those requirements were met in the Gonzalez-Mugaburu case, citing the ongoing investigation. She said SCO is working with an independent, abuse-risk management organization to review the case.Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota said Gonzalez-Mugaburu earned as much as $18,000 a month as a foster parent, caring for six to eight children at a time since at least 1996.Spota said statute of limitations laws prevent filing charges involving some suspected victims.In Gonzalez-Mugaburu's quiet neighborhood in Ridge, neighbors said they never suspected any trouble happening in his home, where two vintage sports cars are parked in the driveway.\"Really nothing out of the ordinary,\" said Christine Stean, 30. \"You would see the kids raking leaves and doing yard work, but it didn't seem like anything out of the ordinary.\"Matthew Roamer, 28, added: \"It's just shocking. It blows your mind about what can go on two houses down that you have no idea about.\"\n\n","title":"Police: New York foster parent was under suspicion for many years - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Police: How did foster parent accused of sexual abuse keep getting children placed in home? https://t.co/lqYxAPWVAB https://t.co/2UMbExnauL","date":"Wed Mar 30 01:31:01 +0000 2016","favs":54,"id":{"$numberLong":"714988266718670848"},"retweets":73},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1pJ2S5i"}

Engberg was 74 and passed away in his\nsleep at his home in Palmetto, Fla., where he retired after his CBS News\ncareer.Engberg appeared on the \"CBS Evening News\" for 26 years and is best\nremembered for his original series \"Reality Check,\" a new style of fact\nchecking and watchdog reporting on the federal government that used modern\ngraphics and stylish production. The series ran on the broadcast in the 1990s\nand helped popularize the phrase so common today among commentators and\ncomedians.\"Reality Check\" began as a regular segment on the accuracy of\ncharges and counter charges flung about in the 1992 presidential campaign.\nBesides setting the facts straight or exposing inconsistencies, Engberg would\nalso uncover abuse and waste. He reported on expensive body guard units\ncreated to protect cabinet secretaries, an $18 million-dollar luxury subway\nbuilt to carry U.S. senators a few hundred yards to their offices and an un-\nnoticed law revision allowing U.S. representatives to buy radio ads with\ntaxpayer money. Engberg could raise an eyebrow or turn a humorous phrase when\nthe story called for it. His signature phrase in the series was \"TIME OUT!\"He\nand his team won a Columbia University DuPont Silver Baton for a \"Reality\nCheck\" investigation that made big news in January 1998. Engberg's reports\nbuilt a case identifying the Vietnam unknown in Arlington National Cemetery as\nU.S.A.F. 1st Lt. Michael Blassie, a pilot shot down in the war. The\ninvestigation resulted in the exhumation of the body, a DNA positive\nidentification and a reburial for family.Engberg distinguished himself as the\nprincipal reporter in other major investigations for CBS News. He was the\nfirst to report the existence of a security fence at the home of White House\naide Oliver North paid for with Iran-Contra money. He was among the first to\nlink faulty O-rings to the explosion that brought down the Space Shuttle\nChallenger in 1986.He covered the presidential election campaigns of Bob Dole\nin 1976, John Anderson and John Connally in 1980, Gary Hart and Geraldine\nFerraro in 1984, George H.W. Bush in 1988 and Patrick Buchanan in 1992.\nEngberg was sent overseas to report on the IRA hunger strikes in Northern\nIreland, the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square uprising in Beijing and the\nfall of the Berlin Wall. He reported from Saudi Arabia in the run-up to the\nPersian Gulf War in 1991 and then covered the first units in the Army\nartillery on their mission to liberate Kuwait. Enberg joined CBS News in the\nNew York Bureau in 1975 as a correspondent and was sent to the Dallas Bureau\nthe next year. He joined the Washington bureau in 1981, where he remained\nuntil his retirement in 2002. He appeared on several other CBS News programs,\nincluding 48 HOURS.Engberg was a seasoned Washington beat reporter before\njoining CBS News. In 1968 he began reporting for WTOP Radio in D.C. and\nquickly became the public affairs director and then news director of WMAL-TV.\nThere he won a Silver Gavel award from the American Bar Association for a\nseries he produced and narrated. He was hired by Westinghouse Radio in 1972\nand covered Watergate and the elections. One of the biggest scoops of his\ncareer came when he reported the resignation of Vice President Spiro Agnew in\na Baltimore courtroom in 1973. His eyewitness report for Group W won a Sigma\nDelta Chi medal for the year's Best Spot Radio News Reporting. Eric Jon\nEngberg was born September 18, 1941 in Highland Park, Ill., and graduated in\n1963 from the University of Missouri School of Journalism. Still a student, he\nbecame heavily involved with local radio station KFRU, where he worked for\nnearly five years after graduation and became the station's news director. He\nalso taught broadcast news writing at the University of Missouri during this\ntime. Engberg made news last year. When questions arose about Bill O'Reilly's\nclaim of reporting from a dangerous war zone during the Falklands War in 1982,\nEngberg thought he saw another \"reality check\" opportunity. He had been with\nO'Reilly, then a CBS News correspondent, and other reporters who were\nprevented from reaching the front and were contained in Buenos Aires, where\nthere was street violence. \"It wasn't a combat situation by any sense of the\nword that I know,\" he told CNN. The Fox News commentator then attacked him and\na war of words ensued, in which the feisty Engberg took delight in getting\nback in the media once more.He is survived by his wife, the former Judith Ann\nKlein; three sons, Robin, Jason and Mark; and five grandchildren.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1abd7"},"content":"The petition on Change.org seems like the work of an ambitious libertarian\nactivist with a stuck caps lock key. \"RECOGNIZE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO\nOPEN CARRY FIREARMS AT THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION,\" it says.The\nQuicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, site of the convention this July, is a gun-\nfree zone in a state, Ohio, where open carrying of firearms is permitted.\"Gun\nfree zones ... tell every insane killer in America ... (the) safest place to\ninflict maximum mayhem with minimum risk,\" the petition says, borrowing a line\nfrom the National Rifle Association. An image of an assault rifle is\nprominently featured atop the petition webpage.It calls on Republican\npresidential candidates to lobby their party to \"rectify this affront to our\nSecond Amendment freedoms and insist upon a suspension of the ... gun-free\nloophole.\"In the six days since it was posted, 50,000 people have signed the\npetition. Donald Trump said he would look into the petition's fine print.\nReporters asked Ohio Governor John Kasich and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz Monday about\nthe prospect of not just a contested convention, but an armed one.Over the\ncourse of the campaign, all three Republicans have expressed misgivings about\ngun-free zones.Kasich eliminated them at Ohio National Guard facilities late\nlast year. In the wake of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Cruz said, \"If\nyou're a lunatic, ain't nothing better than having a bunch of targets you know\nthat are going to be unarmed.\" And Trump, who regularly boasts of his Second\nAmendment bona fides, said in January he'd eliminate gun-free zones at\nschools.On Monday, the often tight-lipped United States Secret Service,\nresponsible for securing the convention, weighed in on the proposal. \"Only\nauthorized law enforcement personnel working in conjunction with the Secret\nService may carry a firearm inside the protected site,\" spokesman Rob Hoback\nwrote in a terse missive.Privately, a federal law enforcement official\nconceded it was a \"no brainer\" to veto allowing guns in the arena and\nsuggested it was laughable to even consider such a notion at all.That seemed\nlike the end of the story - a non-binding Internet petition gets its 15\nminutes and then fades away. But there was one question we wanted to know: Who\nwas behind the petition?Its content led us to believe it was likely a\nconservative gun rights advocate who wrote the 800-word memo in hopes of\nstirring a grassroots movement. But the Internet is a funny - and often\nanonymous - place.There's no name attached to the petition, only the handle\nThe Hyperationalist.A quick Google search led to a Twitter page\n(@Hyperationalist) and a blog with a Gmail address. I fired off an email,\nasking a bunch of boilerplate questions and included a plea for the\nHyperationalist's identity.Then I waited.Around 7:15p Monday, the phone\nrang.\"Hi, this is the Hyperationalist. You can call me Jim,\" the voice on the\nline said.A few things you should know about Jim: He declined to disclose his\nlast name or any potentially identifying information, but I was able to\ncorroborate his identity as the author of the petition with an employee of\nChange.org.Jim wouldn't say where he lives, only that he has roots in\nPhiladelphia and works in the public health sector. Jim is a self-described\nliberal Democrat who intends to vote for Hillary Clinton should she become the\nDemocratic nominee. He isn't affiliated with a campaign or any advocacy group,\nbut did some volunteer work on Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign. Jim\nis no fan of guns and he's \"pretty passionate\" about his activism, he says.Jim\nsays he wrote the petition knowing it was somewhat preposterous -- that law\nenforcement would never allow the Republican presidential candidates inside an\narena with potentially thousands of armed individuals. \"There were never going\nto be guns at the convention. Not a million signatures were going to make that\nhappen,\" Jim said.But he also knew that if the Republican candidates sincerely\nmeant what they have been saying about expanding Second Amendment rights, it\nwould logically follow that they should support a move to allow firearms at\nthe convention. \"If they can't live in accordance with the policies they\nimpose upon us, they owe us that rational conversation,\" Jim said.He\ncontinued, \"I thought, 'How do we square how unsafe they're going to be with\nwhat they say makes them safe?\"' The petition was born.\"I take them at their\nword,\" Jim said. \"[Open carry is] a state law in Ohio. I don't want them to\nhave a terrible event happen [at the convention] and then say if it hadn't\nbeen a gun-free zone, fewer people would have died.\"Max Burns, a spokesman for\nChange.org, said support for the petition shot up dramatically over the\nweekend and it's still going strong.So is the petition satirical? Jim says not\nexactly. \"I'm 100 percent sincere in my conviction that guns should be allowed\nat the GOP convention. [It would be a reflection of] the policies they sought\nto impose around the nation.\"He balked at the suggestion he was an Internet\ntroll, arguing the petition is a genuine political statement.Jim also mused on\nthe logic of why he - the gun control advocate - had to start the petition.\n\"If they believe this so strongly - that gun-free zones are dangerous - why am\nI the one raising the stink,\" he remarked. \"I think they should take up the\ncause. It would bring them up on intellectual consistency.\"Cruz and Kasich\npunted when asked about the petition Monday. Both candidates said they would\ndefer to the Secret Service's judgment on the matter. Trump told ABC News he\ncouldn't say whether he'd support the petition because he hadn't read it as of\nSunday._Steven Portnoy contributed reporting._\n\n","title":"Campaign 2016: Surprising source of GOP convention guns petition - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Meet \"Jim,\" the man who began petition to allow guns at this summer's GOP convention: https://t.co/JBIDlDAHEG https://t.co/KFE3NTndRK","date":"Tue Mar 29 13:18:05 +0000 2016","favs":41,"id":{"$numberLong":"714803818291183616"},"retweets":34},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1RoYuTE"}

Wright said the billionaire businessman seems to have always been\nhis own primary foreign policy consultant. \"His main sort of world view is\nthat America is getting ripped off by the world.\"During a 1998 interview on\nthe Oprah Winfrey Show, Trump said he was \"tired of seeing the country ripped\noff.\"\"We let Japan come in and dump everything into our markets. They come\nover here, they sell their cars, their VCRs, they knock the hell out of our\ncompanies. And, hey, I have tremendous respect for the Japanese people,\" Trump\nsaid.When Trump finally identified some advisers last week, the list of low-\nprofile names was panned by the GOP foreign policy community. Many in the\ngroup are former military officers, including Maj. Gen. Gary L. Harrell, a\nformer commander from the infamous Black Hawk Down Mission in Somalia.One of\nthe advisers, Joseph E. Schmitz, resigned from the Pentagon in 2005 amid\nallegations of misconduct, and later worked for the parent company of\ncontroversial security firm, Blackwater.Some have been turned off by Trump's\nrepeated calls to use torture as an interrogation tactic and vows to go even\n\"tougher than waterboarding.\"\"We're going to go by the laws, but I want to see\nif I can expand those laws and make them more severe. We have to,\" Trump said\nduring a rally in North Carolina.\"Torture works... Believe me, it works, okay?\nAnd waterboarding is your minor form,\" he said in South Carolina.Trump adviser\nWalid Phares, an analyst for Fox News and an adviser to Mitt Romney's 2012\ncampaign, chalked that up to campaign rhetoric.\"There's a very big difference\nbetween being a candidate and then getting to the White House,\" he said on Fox\nNews.But ultimately, Trump will have the final say.\"It doesn't mean that I'm\ngoing to use what they're saying, but I do like different opinions,\" Trump\nsaid in Washington DC this month.In an interview with the New York Times,\nTrump said he's developed his policy views largely from reading\nnewspapers.Trump didn't answer when he was asked if he's met with his foreign\npolicy team. A campaign spokesperson said he met with some advisers last week.\n\n","title":"Is \"Trump's world view\" immune to foreign policy advice? - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Is \"Trump's world view\" immune to foreign policy advice? https://t.co/565fAdPyxt https://t.co/d6XYKAnKUG","date":"Tue Mar 29 12:20:26 +0000 2016","favs":27,"id":{"$numberLong":"714789312513105920"},"retweets":25},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1SjhZti"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1abda"},"content":"Last Updated Mar 29, 2016 12:42 PM EDT******LARNACA, Cyprus **\\- An Egyptian\nwearing a fake explosives belt who hijacked a domestic EgyptAir flight and\nforced it to land in Cyprus on Tuesday surrendered and was taken into custody\nafter releasing all passengers and crew unharmed following an hours-long\nstandoff.Officials said early on that the hijacking was not an act of\nterrorism, and later that the man appeared to be psychologically unstable.\nHowever, the incident was likely to renew concerns about Egyptian airport\nsecurity months after a Russian passenger plane was downed over the Sinai\nPeninsula in a bombing claimed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria\n(ISIS.)\"From the start, it was clear that this wasn't an act of terrorism, and\ndespite the fact that the individual appeared to be dangerous in terms of his\nbehavior, we understood that this was a psychologically unstable person,\"\nCyprus' Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides told reporters.He said the man\ninitially asked to speak with his Cypriot ex-wife, who police brought to the\nairport.\"After that, he started asking for European Union representatives to\nassure him about matters that had no logical basis,\" Kasoulides said.A man\nclimbs out of the cockpit window of the hijacked Egyptair Airbus A320 at\nLarnaca Airport in Larnaca, Cyprus, March 29, 2016.At one point the hijacker\ndemanded the release of women held in Egyptian prisons, but he then dropped\nthe demand and made others. \"His demands made no sense or were too incoherent\nto be taken seriously,\" the minister said, adding that the contents of a\nletter the hijacker wanted to give to his ex-wife \"were also\nincoherent.\"Egypt's official Middle East News Agency identified the hijacker\nas Seifedeen Mustafa, without providing further details. A senior Cypriot\nofficial confirmed the name of the hijacker, but also provided no further\ndetails. Police in Cairo were questioning the hijacker's relatives, Sharif\nFaisal, the police chief for the industrial suburb of Helwan, told The\nAssociated Press.Video obtained by the private Egyptian TV network Youm7\nshowed a man identifed as the suspect going through a routine security\nscreening at the airport in Alexandria. He is seen walking through a metal\ndetector and then being patted down before he's allowed to reclaim his scanned\nbags and proceed.Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades, in an earlier appearance\nalongside European Parliament President Martin Schulz in Nicosia, was asked\nwhether the incident involved a woman. \"Always, there is a woman,\" he replied,\ndrawing laughter.Just minutes before the arrest, local TV footage from the\nairport showed several people disembarking from the aircraft and a man who\nappeared to be a crew member climbing out of the cockpit window and sliding\ndown the side of the plane. The hijacker had earlier freed most of the\npassengers but kept on board seven people - four crew members and three\npassengers.A Cypriot police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity\nbecause he was not authorized to brief reporters, said the hijacker walked off\nthe plane and was taken into custody by anti-terrorism police. He said the man\nwore a belt, but it contained no explosives. Egypt's Civil Aviation Ministry\nsaid man was wearing a fake explosives belt.Flight MS181 took off Tuesday\nmorning from Bourg el-Arab airport just outside the Mediterranean coastal city\nof Alexandria en route to Cairo with at least 55 passengers, including 26\nforeigners, and a seven-member crew.An official with flight-tracking website\nFlightRadar24 said the plane showed no immediate signs of distress. The flight\nbetween Alexandria and Cairo normally takes about 30 minutes.Egyptian\nofficials gave conflicting accounts as the drama unfolded. The Aviation\nMinistry said in a statement that the hijacker was wearing an explosives belt,\nwhich turned out to be untrue.Egyptian government spokesman Hossam al-Queish\nidentified the hijacker as Ibrahim Samaha, but an Egyptian woman who\nidentified herself as Samaha's wife told a local TV station that her husband\nis not the hijacker and was on his way to Cairo so he could fly to the U.S. to\nattend a conference. She said a photo circulated by Egyptian and regional TV\nchannels purportedly showing the hijacker was not her husband.The Egyptian\nCivil Aviation Ministry said the foreigners on board included eight Americans,\nfour Britons, four Dutch, two Belgians, a French national, an Italian, two\nGreeks and one Syrian. Three other foreigners could not be identified.The\ninitial group of passengers released by the hijacker was seen calmly walking\noff the plane down a set of stairs, carrying their hand luggage and boarding a\nbus. Security was tight at the airport, with police repeatedly pushing back\nreporters and TV crews working just outside the fence, near where the aircraft\nstopped. Police also evacuated a nearby beach popular with tourists.Egyptian\npassenger Farah el-Dabani told the Dubai-based Al-Arabiyah TV network that the\nhijacker was seated in the back of the aircraft and that it was the crew who\ntold passengers that the plane was being hijacked.\"There was panic at the\nbeginning, but the crew told us to be quiet. They did a good job to keep us\nall quiet so the hijacker does not do anything rash,\" she said in a telephone\ninterview.The hijacking will most likely bring to the fore again the question\nof security at Egyptian airports, five months after a Russian aircraft crashed\nover Egypt's Sinai Peninsula minutes after it took off from Egypt's Red Sea\nresort of Sharm el-Sheikh. All 224 people on board were killed in the\ncrash.Russia later said an explosive device brought down the aircraft and the\nIslamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) said it had downed the plane with a\nbomb contained in a drink can.\n\n","title":"EgyptAir Flight 181 plane hijacked by Egyptian Seif El Din Mustafa, lands in Cyprus but motive unclear - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"RT @CBSThisMorning: JUST IN: Cyprus standoff over, #EgyptAir hijacker arrested.

Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, says adopting the more Facebook-\nlike algorithm will help declutter people's feeds. But many users like their\nInstagram feeds the way they are.The Internet is abuzz with rumors that the\nnew system goes into effect tomorrow, but Instagram tells CBS News those\nrumors are not true.\"There are still weeks, or even months, of testing to come\nbefore we roll this out more broadly. Currently the test groups are very\nsmall. We will let the community know before any changes are made,\" a\nspokesman said via email.The company later posted similar reassurance for\nusers on the competing social network Twitter:We're listening and we assure\nyou nothing is changing with your feed right now. We promise to let you know\nwhen changes roll out broadly.Nevertheless, many users, including singer-\nsongwriter John Mayer, have taken to Instagram to express their ire about the\nproposed changes. Mayer stated that the chronological feed is necessary to\nhelp artists stay relevant on the platform and questioned how an algorithm\ncould better predict his ever-changing tastes and interests. This one's for\nthe artists and designers I've found on Instagram and come to \"know\" via my\nfeed. @craig.gleason @tittybats @wizardskull @corpsetits @tina_lugo13\n@pizza.wulf @soeymilk @stayhomeclubofficial @jaugurdesign #keepinstagramweird\n#instagram @instagramA photo posted by johnmayer (@johnmayer) on Mar 17, 2016\nat 11:03am PDTKendall Jenner echoed that sentiment in a tweet, urging\nInstagram: \"Don't fix something that isn't broken.\"preach @AlfredoFlores ....\nno @Instagram ! don't fix something that isn't broken\npic.twitter.com/mp3BQ1mW91Meanwhile, many Instagram users are promoting a\nworkaround for the algorithm: turn on push notifications.Instagram users are\nposting pictures featuring the hastag #turnmeon, asking followers to turn on\npush notifications so that they will receive an alert every time the person\nposts an update to the site. By now you've seen countless posts of bloggers,\nbrands, and businesses asking you to turn on notifications for their post.\nNotifications are annoying and I probably won't turn on my notifications, so\nit would be pretty hypocritical of me to ask you to do the same. So if you\nlike my posts and want to see them when I post, then turn on the\nnotifications. But if you don't want want the constant reminders, don't turn\non the notifications. You won't hurt my feelings. #turnmeon\n#instagramischangingA photo posted by Lindsey (@followtheruels) on Mar 28,\n2016 at 10:24am PDT I know I know you don't need to say anything ..

By 2050, they are expected to\nrepresent nearly 17 percent (1.6 billion), according to the U.S. Census Bureau\nreport commissioned by the U.S. National Institute on Aging (NIA).Over that\ntime, the number of Americans 65 and older is projected to grow from 48\nmillion to 88 million.Worldwide, life expectancy is expected to rise from 68.6\nyears in 2015 to 76.2 years in 2050. The number of people 80 and older is\nforecast to more than triple, from 126.5 million to 446.6 million worldwide,\nwhile their ranks in some Asian and Latin American countries could\nquadruple.\"Older people are a rapidly growing proportion of the world's\npopulation,\" NIA Director Dr. Richard Hodes said in an agency news\nrelease.\"People are living longer, but that does not necessarily mean that\nthey are living healthier. The increase in our aging population presents many\nopportunities and also several public health challenges that we need to\nprepare for. NIA has partnered with Census to provide the best possible data\nso that we can better understand the course and implications of population\naging,\" Hodes said.Non-infectious diseases are the main health concern for\nseniors worldwide, but infectious diseases are also a major threat to seniors\nin low-income countries, including many in Africa, according to the new\nreport.\"We are seeing population aging in every country in every part of the\nworld,\" John Haaga, acting director of NIA's division of behavioral and social\nresearch, said in the news release.\"Many countries in Europe and Asia are\nfurther along in the process, or moving more rapidly, than we are in the\nUnited States.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1abdd"},"content":"GOP front-runner Donald Trump said he was moving forward with legal action\nthat would, in essence, nullify the delegate selection process in Louisiana --\na state that Trump won but that might still give more delegates to his rival,\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz.However, whether there currently is any legal action is\nunclear and the Louisiana State Republican Party is pushing back on what it is\ncharacterizing as a miscommunication between Trump's national staff and his\nstate team. Trump's legal threat also raises questions about whether his team\nfully grasps the complex rules that govern the delegate allocating process.\nThere are two issues at stake: the delegates selected to attend the convention\nto sit on the various rules committees and the exact number of delegates\nallocated to each candidate. The first issue, the rules committees, is\nparticularly important because the rules governing each convention differ\nevery election cycle.Here, of Louisiana's six slots, pro-Cruz delegates have\nfive of them. A candidate that has stacked the committees with delegates that\nare friendly to the candidate can push rules friendly to the candidates'\nfavor.An outlandish example: If the rules committees are stacked with\ndelegates that are Cruz supporters, it can make rules that say that the\nRepublican nominee must only be a senator from Texas.After the Louisiana\nprimary, the state GOP had its meeting to select delegates, under \"Rule 6,\"\nwhich says that this meeting will occur right after the state convention. The\nTrump campaign claimed that this meeting was held in secret, which is what\ngives it the legal justification for a challenge.\"Well the problem we're\nhaving here is that there was a secret meeting in Louisiana of the convention\ndelegation, and apparently all of the invitations for our delegates must have\ngotten lost in the mail,\" Trump campaign official Barry Bennett said to MSNBC\non Monday.\"There's a process to deal with this. It's in the certification\nprocess, and it's been with our legal team for most of the morning now, and we\nare moving forward with the complaint to decertify these delegates,\" Bennett\nwent on.However, Jason Dore, the chairman of the Louisiana Republican party,\nsaid that their meeting wasn't secret and that, in fact, both of Trump's state\nchairmen were in the room and present for the meeting.Bennett later conceded\nto CBS News' Major Garrett that there was a campaign official in attendance at\nthe meeting - but only because Bennett got wind of it and that the party did\nnot go through the proper channels to notify prospective delegates, therefore\ngiving the challenge merit. Bennett said the campaign would contest the\ndelegate allocation process with the Republican National Committee.The second\nissue is the number of delegates that each candidate is awarded, which is\nbased on their vote totals and distributed proportionally. Even though Trump\nwon more votes in the state, both Cruz and Trump were awarded 18 delegates in\nthe wake of the primary because the race was close. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio\nwon five delegates, but because his campaign was suspended, those five\ndelegates become, in essence, free agents, who support whomever they choose.\nAs of right now, there is no indication as to which way these delegates will\ngo.The key point: Those delegates have not been allocated yet. But that hasn't\nstopped Trump from claiming that Cruz is trying to \"steal\" delegates.On\nSunday, Trump said to ABC, \"He's trying to steal things because that's the way\nTed works, OK...the system is a broken system. The Republican tabulation\nsystem is a broken system. It's not fair.\"Later in the day, Trump tweeted that\nthere is a lawsuit coming as a result of the delegate allocation. It was yet\nanother lawsuit threat from Trump regarding Cruz -- he previously threatened\nto sue Cruz over his citizenship and over commercials his campaign was running\nhighlighting Trump's past support for abortion.Trump then seemed to forget\nthat he used the word \"steal\" during a Monday radio interview with WTAQ radio\nin Wisconsin. When radio host Jerry Bader, a Cruz supporter, confronted him on\nthe claim, Trump said multiple times that he wasn't using the word\n\"stealing.\"\"I'm not saying stealing, Jerry,\" Trump said. \"I'm saying this: I\nwon the state of Louisiana. I won it. Okay?\"\"Okay, if I won it, how come I end\nup with less delegates? I'm just saying the system is bad. I'm not saying\nstealing because I know they have a - you know - the have a very strange\nsystem.\"When Bader read the direct quote from Trump using the word \"steal,\"\nTrump said, \"I don't know. I mean, maybe I did because I see what's going on,\"\nbefore launching into a riff about how unfair the process was.\n\n","title":"Inside Donald Trump's bizarre Louisiana delegate fight - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Inside Donald Trump's bizarre Louisiana delegate fight https://t.co/Q3lexulxM6 https://t.co/SFuQyhqjmR","date":"Tue Mar 29 04:43:08 +0000 2016","favs":28,"id":{"$numberLong":"714674226976915459"},"retweets":42},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1VQKmog"}

John Kasich.To stop an attack in the U.S. like the ones in Paris and Brussels, Cruz wants law enforcement to patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized.\"We need to be using proactive policing, we need to be using proactive law enforcement, and intelligence, and national security resources to prevent radicalization,\" Cruz has said.In the aftermath of 9/11, the New York City Police Department used a similar tactic to monitor mosques for terror connections.But NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton ended that program in 2014 and denounced Cruz's idea in a New York Daily News op-ed, writing the city does \"not single out any populace ... for selective enforcement.\"Kasich also took a dim view of Cruz's plan\"We're going to start creating more divisions, policing neighborhoods of Muslims? How are we going to do that?\" he said.Trump supports Cruz's proposal and remains focused on immigration.\"Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what the hell is going on,\" Trump said.Kasich and Cruz oppose that idea. But both favor tight restrictions on immigration from war-torn parts of the Middle East.Trump has also called for a return to waterboarding terror suspects -- as well as this: \"I would bomb the hell out of ISIS. Yes.\"Cruz concurs even if the air war inflicted civilian casualties.\"We need a comprehensive strategy to utterly destroy them. That involves carpet bombing them to oblivion,\" said Cruz.In an effort to deny Trump the delegates to secure the nomination, some parts of the GOP establishment are rallying to Cruz's side. Jeb Bush will hold fund-raisers for Cruz this week. And Cruz expects to pick up the endorsement of Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker on Tuesday.\n\n","title":"Examining GOP candidates' plans to combat terrorism - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Examining GOP candidates' plans to combat terrorism: https://t.co/qcXDzYsTPL https://t.co/XWuBuiZ50o","date":"Tue Mar 29 00:50:02 +0000 2016","favs":15,"id":{"$numberLong":"714615565302665216"},"retweets":18},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/25tgEtw"}

The superintendent was too scared to go on camera, but talked to us in the doorway.He said that there were five men who came and went regularly from the apartment. They were in a hurry to rent it, paid cash up front, and used a fake identity -- Michael Dos Santos.He became suspicious that something strange was going on when chemicals leaked through the ceiling into the apartment below. He also said he smelled a noxious odor coming from their rooms.But the superintendent did not report anything to police, as he said he could not be sure there was something criminal going on. It was only when investigators raided the place after the bombings that a deadly haul of explosives and chemicals were found.Meanwhile, Belgian police released new airport surveillance tape just before the bombing. They also admitted they are no closer to putting a name to the face of the man known only as \"the man in the hat.\"The \"man in the hat,\" who is suspected of taking part in the attacks at Belgium's Zaventem Airport, is still being sought by police. Freelance journalist Faycal Cheffou had been picked up by police last Thursday and charged with terrorism and murder. But he had been mistakenly identified as the suspected third airport bomber by the taxi driver who drove the attackers there. Police released Cheffou Monday due to a lack of evidence against him. Well-known talk show host Vince Kante used to work with Cheffou at a local radio station. Before Cheffou's release, he told CBS News it was obvious that the man in the video was taller and larger than Cheffou.\"I knew there was a long time I didn't see him, but it was like what the? What the? It's not possible,\" he said, laughing.Freelance journalist Faycal Cheffou is seen in a YouTube video from 2014 But the constant police bungling is no laughing matter. Despite frequent raids, investigators appear no closer to finding the mysterious man in the hat.\n\n","title":"New details about Brussels attackers' suspicious behavior before attack - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"New details emerge about Brussels attackers' suspicious behavior before attack https://t.co/RmEo9pNYTT https://t.co/1A29wlVQAZ","date":"Tue Mar 29 00:14:01 +0000 2016","favs":28,"id":{"$numberLong":"714606500048715777"},"retweets":57},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/25te6LW"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1abeb"},"content":"**HAVANA** \\-- Fidel Castro responded Monday to President Barack Obama's historic trip to Cuba with a long, bristling letter recounting the history of U.S. aggression against Cuba, writing that \"we don't need the empire to give us any presents.\"The 1,500-word letter in state media titled \"Brother Obama\" was Castro's first response to the president's three-day visit last week, in which the American president said he had come to bury the two countries' history of Cold War hostility. Obama did not meet with the 89-year-old Fidel Castro on the trip but met several times with his 84-year-old brother Raul Castro, the current Cuban president.Obama's visit was intended to build irreversible momentum behind his opening with Cuba and to convince the Cuban people and the Cuban government that a half-century of U.S. attempts to overthrow the Communist government had ended, allowing Cuban to reform its economy and political system without the threat of U.S. interference.Fidel Castro writes of Obama: \"My modest suggestion is that he reflects and doesn't try to develop theories about Cuban politics.\"Castro, who led Cuba for decades before handing power to his brother in 2008, was legendary for his hours-long, all-encompassing speeches. His letter reflects that style, presenting a sharp contrast with Obama's tightly focused speech in Havana. Castro's letter opens with descriptions of environmental abuse under the Spaniards and reviews the historical roles of Cuban independence heroes Jose Marti, Antonio Maceo and Maximo Gomez.Castro then goes over crucial sections of Obama's speech line by line, engaging in an ex-post-facto dialogue with the American president with pointed critiques of perceived slights and insults, including Obama's failure to give credit to indigenous Cubans and Castro's prohibition of racial segregation after coming to power in 1959.Quoting Obama's declaration that \"it is time, now, for us to leave the past behind,\" the man who shaped Cuba during the second half of the 20th century writes that \"I imagine that any one of us ran the risk of having a heart attack on hearing these words from the President of the United States.\"Castro then returns to a review of a half-century of U.S. aggression against Cuba. Those events include the decades-long U.S. trade embargo against the island; the 1961 Bay of Pigs attack and the 1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner backed by exiles who took refuge in the U.S.He ends with a dig at the Obama administration's drive to increase business ties with Cuba. The Obama administration says re-establishing economic ties with the U.S. will be a boon for Cuba, whose centrally planned economy has struggled to escape from over-dependence on imports and a chronic shortage of hard currency.The focus on U.S-Cuba business ties appears to have particularly rankled Castro, who nationalized U.S. companies after coming to power in 1959 and establishing the communist system into which his brother is now introducing gradual market-based reforms.\"No one should pretend that the people of this noble and selfless country will renounce its glory and its rights,\" Fidel Castro wrote. \"We are capable of producing the food and material wealth that we need with with work and intelligence of our people.\"\n\n","title":"Fidel Castro: Cuba doesn't want presents from U.S. \"empire\" - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Fidel Castro on @POTUS' trip to Cuba: \"We don't need the empire to give us any presents\" https://t.co/30EVsPunzf https://t.co/QRryTJxXuJ","date":"Mon Mar 28 15:41:28 +0000 2016","favs":142,"id":{"$numberLong":"714477514253582337"},"retweets":147},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1pFtPa7"}

Nathan Deal\nannounced his intention to veto the so-called \"religious freedom\" bill that\nattracted nationwide attention for what critics called its anti-gay\nprovisions.The Republican rejected the bill on Monday, saying \"I have examined\nthe protections that this bill proposes to provide to the faith based\ncommunity and I can find no examples of any of those circumstances occurring\nin our state.\" Deal added, \"I do not think that we have to discriminate\nagainst anyone to protect the faith-based community in Georgia.\" Republican\nmajorities passed the bill to broadly protect people acting on their religion.\nIt also would have protected clergy who won't perform gay marriages and people\nwho won't attend a wedding for religious reasons. Churches and affiliated\nreligious groups also could have declined to serve or hire someone based on\ntheir faith.But major companies from Walt Disney to the NFL threatened to pull\ntheir business. The bill's opponents said it excused discrimination and could\ntrample local ordinances protecting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender\npeople.In response to the veto announcement, a coalition of businesses that\nhad fought the bill applauded the governor.Deal said he would have signed the\nbill had it passed in its original form, but he said other versions caused him\nconcern. He said his decision to reject the bill was \"about the character of\nour state and the character of our people.

At that point, a half dozen officers jumped on her and pulled her to the ground.\"She just made one incredibly brazen move,\" Shaw said.KCAL9's Jennifer Kastner says police helped track the suspect because the victim's personal property -- including a \"Find My Phone\" app\" -- were left in the vehicle.Kastner spoke to the carjack victim -- she didn't want her face shown.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1abf4"},"content":"_The following script is from \"The Giving Pledge\" which aired on Nov. 17,\n2013, and was rebroadcast on March 27, 2016. Charlie Rose is the\ncorrespondent. Denise Schrier Cetta, producer._Today, the wealthiest 400\nAmericans are worth over $2 trillion. Together, it's been reported they own as\nmuch wealth as the bottom half of American households combined.While\nresentment towards the super rich grows, there may be a silver lining taking\nshape. It turns out a lot of those rich people are giving staggering sums of\nmoney away, in what is being called a golden age of philanthropy.And this\nsurge in generosity is not by accident. Much of it is the result of an\nambitious and targeted campaign called \"The Giving Pledge.\" It was started by\nan influential trio: Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett. Two years ago,\nCharlie Rose had the opportunity to get them together to learn more about\ntheir new club for billionaires. Membership comes with just two requirements:\nbe worth at least a billion dollars and be willing to give half of that\naway.Charlie Rose: Is it necessary to join the Giving Pledge that you promise\n50 percent of your net worth?Melinda Gates: Yes. In your lifetime or in your\nwill.Charlie Rose: Or in your will?Warren Buffett: Right.Charlie Rose: Are\npeople shocked by that?Warren Buffett: I don't think so.Melinda Gates: We're\nasking them to be bold. We're asking them to step out and to do something big.\nBut a lot of them were already on their way there and just hadn't put a\nnumeric number behind it. And I think now also the Giving Pledge has gotten\ngoing, people know that's the expectation.Warren Buffett: And we don't, we\ndon't, we don't find a lot of people that say, \"I want to join if it was 40\npercent.\"Charlie Rose: Some may say I'm happy to give much more than 50.Warren\nBuffett: Oh, most of them. Most. My guess is that a very significant\npercentage of our members, I mean, way over half are going to give a lot more\nthan half.That's certainly true of the founders. The Gates have already\ncommitted to giving 95 percent of their wealth away. Warren Buffett - 99\npercent.They say that kind of extreme giving is needed because the rich have\nbeen getting so much richer. Tech innovations and rising global markets have\nproduced vast fortunes not seen since the Industrial Revolution.So what does\nWarren Buffett say to convince today's billionaires to give their fortunes\naway?Warren Buffett: Incremental wealth, adding to the wealth they have now\nhas no real utility to them. But that wealth has incredible utility to other\npeople. It can educate children, it can vaccinate children. It can do all\nkinds of things.Charlie Rose: There are others, and people that I know, say,\n\"I want to give it to my children. That's what I want to do.\" What's wrong\nwith that?Warren Buffett: I don't really think that, as a society, we want to\nconfer blessings on generation after generation who contribute nothing to\nsociety, simply because somebody in the far distant past happened to amass a\ngreat sum of wealth.So far 115 billionaires have bought Buffett's argument and\nsigned the Giving Pledge. Ages range from 27 to 98. Some inherited wealth, but\nmost are self-made. Their businesses range from technology and social media...\nto pizza, hair care and home improvement. Combined pledges so far - over a\nhalf a trillion dollars.Charlie Rose: What conditions are there? I mean, can\nthey say, \"Yes, I'm with you. I'm here. But I want to give it to this\ninstitution or that institution.\"Warren Buffett: We don't care what\ninstitution they give it to.Bill Gates: Yeah, in fact, we're not endorsing any\nflavor of philanthropy. We do think we're all gonna be smarter and do it\nbetter learning from each other. But there is no pooling of money. We\ncelebrate the diversity of philanthropy.Billionaires can be shy when it comes\nto talking about their money. But Warren Buffett helped convince seven who\nhave signed the pledge to sit down with 60 Minutes.They are investors Pete\nPeterson and Nicolas Berggruen, South African mining tycoon Patrice Motsepe\nand his wife Dr. Precious Moloi-Motsepe, entrepreneur Sara Blakely and AOL\nfounder Steve Case, and his wife Jean.Charlie Rose: When did you first hear of\nthe Giving Pledge?Jean Case: Melinda called and talked to us. But we had the\nbenefit of knowing Bill and Melinda for a long time, going back to our\ntechnology roots.Steve Case: We competed against them for many years.Jean\nCase: We did.Steve Case: And we're happy to finally join forces.Charlie Rose:\nYou wanted to be on their side.Steve Case: Yeah, yeah, we wanted to be on the,\naligned.They've all signed the same pledge, and they bring the same brashness\nto their philanthropic ambition that helped them build financial empires.Pete\nPeterson: Charlie this is a group made up largely of entrepreneurs. And they\ndidn't make a billion dollars or five billion dollars by doing the ordinary.\nThey did it by being bold.That's certainly true for Sara Blakely.Sara Blakely:\nWell, I made all the money by making other people's butts look a lot\nbetter.Charlie Rose: I think you've missed me.In 2000, she took $5,000 in\nsavings and started the undergarment company Spanx. Now she wants her\nphilanthropy to be as cutting edge as her billion dollar business.Sara\nBlakely: I started my business with an invented product that didn't exist and\nshook up an industry. And I want to collaborate with people and increase my\nchances of coming up with an idea or something that will do that for my cause,\nwhich is helping women.At 42, Blakely admits she's just beginning to figure\nout how she'll help women. At 83, Warren Buffett says he wants to stick with\nwhat he's good at - running his company Berkshire Hathaway -- so he's given\nthe bulk of his fortune to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation so it can be\nused to reduce global poverty and disease.As for the other pledgers, they're\ntackling an impressive array of causes: unemployment in South Africa, early\ndetection and treatment of brain cancer, and some interests that take on a\nmore political tone: tax reform in California and the national debt.But as\nBill Gates discovered when he left Microsoft, going from making money to\ngiving it away, isn't always easy. An example of just one of the lessons he's\nlearned: it doesn't matter how effective a vaccine is, if you don't package\nand deliver it the right way, it will not do any good.Charlie Rose: I guess\nthere's a learning process, too.Melinda Gates: Absolutely.Charlie Rose:\nBecause you feel like, \"how do you do this even if you're inclined to do\nit?\"Bill Gates: It's almost disconcerting to switch to an area where you're\nback at square zero a little bit. And the measurements aren't quite the same\nas in the business game. What you're trying to do, the need to take risk, try\ndifferent things. And so you need encouragement.That's why Buffett and the\nGates invite pledgers once a year to exclusive resorts like Kiawah Island in\nSouth Carolina. Here billionaires attend sessions on how to give money away\nmore effectively. Our cameras were not allowed in, but we were shown this\nday's agenda: it included lessons on how tools like technology can be used to\ntransform failing schools and, with the government cutting funding on medical\nresearch, how can philanthropists step in and help spur new medical\nbreakthroughs.But we wondered, what else goes on behind closed doors?Charlie\nRose: Will there be a conversation here about failure?Warren Buffett:\nSure.Jean Case: Yes, there most definitely will be.Charlie Rose: What does\nthat, how do you phrase that?Warren Buffett: Well, if you bat a thousand,\nyou're playing in the little leagues.I mean the-- and the problems are major\nleague.Steve Case: The difference in the entrepreneurial world, when you\nlaunch a company, you have a particular idea, a particular product, a\nparticular service, almost always you pivot, you shift. You-- the market\nreacts to your initial idea. You make some adjustments. It's only after making\na few adjustments that you see the success. We need that same mentality in\nphilanthropy, trying things, taking risks, recognizing the first try, maybe\nthe second try, maybe the third try won't work. But if you stay at it and\nyou're learning, you're talking to others, and you're learning together,\neventually you'll break through and see the kind of impact you were hoping\nfor.Jeffrey Skoll, one of the first to sign the giving pledge, is using the\nbillions he made as eBay's first president to fight what he calls global\nthreats - not just one, but five problems he's convinced pose immediate danger\nto humanity: climate change, water security, pandemics, nuclear proliferation\nand the Middle East conflict.Charlie Rose: I mean, is there some argument to\nmake sometimes that-- that because people made a lotta money they may come to\nthese problems with a certain arrogance, like, \"I know everything there is to\nknow. I'm so-- smart guy. Let me tell you what to do.\"Jeffrey Skoll: I think\nwe all have a danger...Charlie Rose: Arrogance...Jeffrey Skoll: ...of feeling\nlike we know the answers. And the reality is we don't.But that doesn't keep\nSkoll from trying. In addition to his more traditional charitable giving, in\n2004 he started the for profit media company Participant, to make movies that\npromote his philanthropic goals.Charlie Rose: And the purpose of the movies is\nwhat? Awareness is one.Jeffrey Skoll: To create entertainment that inspires\nand compels social change. And so whether that is climate change or dolphin\nhunting in Japan or dealing with drug sentencing laws, every film we do has a\npurpose and it has a social action campaign associated with the movie. And we\ntry to get people involved in the issues of the movie, to try to make a\ndifference in those issues.But the problem with all of this may be that it\nshows how quickly charity can cross over into advocacy.Take the 2011 movie\n\"Contagion.\" Skoll took what he'd learned through his charitable work in\npandemics and funded a movie to warn people that a virus could kill\nbillions._[Jude Law in \"Contagion\": On day one there were two people, and then\nfour, and then 16. In three months, it's a billion. That's where we're\nheaded.]_Charlie Rose: And what did the movie accomplish for you?Jeffrey\nSkoll: In many ways, it put pandemics back on the map, that the public\nrealized how important our public health organizations are, for example. A\nnumber of politicians that had seen the movie who were ready to vote on cuts\nto funding to the CDC recognized that that would be a bad idea.Randall Lane:\nThe public has a right to know who owns the world.Randall Lane, the editor of\nthe business magazine Forbes, says billionaires like Skoll have become so\ninfluential he devoted an entire issue to philanthropy.Randall Lane:\nGovernment is showing, you know, over the past couple decades that it can no\nlonger solve the great problems of the day. Now these philanthropists who have\nincredible wealth, the problem-solving brainpower, and also the name and the\ninfluence to be able to open doors are uniquely qualified right now to solve\nthe huge problems.But that does raise the question: do these billionaires have\ntoo much power?Charlie Rose: There's some people who say big philanthropy is\nnot such a good idea, meaning that somehow you have enormous power and you're\nnot elected and, and that that may not be such a good idea to have people with\nenormous wealth to have so much influence.Warren Buffett: Well, would they\nprefer dynastic wealth? Pass it on. Or would they prefer, you know, obscenely\nhigh living? There's a couple other ways to get rid of money, but I-- I-- I--\nthink it's better if you're helping other people, using a good bit of it for\nhelping other people.Charlie Rose: OK, so there's no instance in which\nsomebody could say, \"Look, I mean, we got too many people of huge wealth who\nare having too much influence.\"Jean Case: Well, Charlie. Think about Bill and\npolio, for instance. Bill and Melinda's work in polio. I mean, they're coming\nclose to eradicating polio on the face of the Earth. I think when we have a\ncouple of examples like that, people will see, that's not power being used for\npersonal purposes. That's really leveraging everything you have to change the\nworld to make it better.But as Warren Buffett is finding out, not every\nbillionaire feels that way.Warren Buffett: I've got I've gotten a lot of yeses\nwhen I've called people.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1abf5"},"content":"Last Updated Mar 27, 2016 11:18 PM EDT******HANCEVILLE, Alabama** \\-- Mother\nMary Angelica, a folksy Roman Catholic nun who used a monastery garage to\nbegin a television ministry that grew into a global religious media empire,\nhas died. She was 92.Known to millions of viewers simply as \"Mother Angelica,\"\nthe founder of the Eternal Word Television Network died Easter Sunday at the\nrural monastery where she lived about 45 miles north of Birmingham, according\nto EWTN Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael P. Warsaw.\"Mother has\nalways, and will always, personify EWTN, the Network which she founded. In the\nface of sickness and long-suffering trials, Mother's example of joy and\nprayerful perseverance exemplified the Franciscan spirit she held so dear. We\nthank God for Mother Angelica and for the gift of her extraordinary life,\"\nWarsaw said in a news release late Sunday.Mother Angelica had been in\ndeclining health since suffering a severe cerebral hemorrhage on Christmas Eve\n2001. She never regained her full speaking ability and had other, less-severe\nstrokes through the years.Bedridden for months, Mother Angelica was placed on\na feeding tube this fall as her health slowly declined, fellow nuns at Our\nLady of the Angels Monastery said in an announcement released in November.Gov.\nRobert Bentley said in a statement Sunday that Mother Angelica will live on\nforever in the hearts of those touched by her sermons.\"On this Easter Sunday,\nit is only fitting that the Lord chose today to call home one of his humble\nservant, Mother Angelica. She devoted her life to ministry, converting untold\nnumbers of people to the church. She left an indelible mark on Alabama, the\nCatholic Church and the world as a whole,\" Bentley said.Although she had been\nout of the public eye for years and was no longer appearing on her trademark\n\"Mother Angelica Live\" show, old episodes of her show have remained a\nprogramming staple on Eternal Word.\"We want you to know how much God loves\nyou, and that's a lot,\" she told viewers at the end of an episode taped in\nNovember 2000.Mother Angelica displayed both deep devotion to Jesus and a\ncomic's timing on the episode, drawing laughs when she couldn't reach her\nBible during the opening sequence. An unseen aide hands her the book from off\ncamera.\"That's when you appreciate long arms,\" Mother Angelica\ndeadpanned.Mother Angelica was born Rita Rizzo in Canton, Ohio, in 1923. She\nentered the Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration monastery in Cleveland at age\n21 and joined other nuns in moving South to open a new monastery in Alabama in\n1962.With only $200, the nun began broadcasting a religious talk show from a\nTV studio put together in the monastery garage in suburban Birmingham in 1981.\nThat show grew into Eternal Word Television Network, which has long had the\nblessing of the Vatican.While critics sometimes accuse Eternal Word Television\nNetwork of being too conservative or too liberal, it says it tries to stick to\nthe leadership of the Vatican. The network reports extensively on statements\nand trips by the pope.Despite its humble beginnings, EWTN Global Catholic\nNetwork calls itself the world's largest religious media network. It has 11 TV\nnetworks that broadcast Catholic programming to more than 258 million\nhouseholds in more than 145 counties and territories.Eternal Word's radio\noperation includes a global shortwave broadcast; satellite and Internet radio\nchannels; and more than 300 Catholic radio affiliates in the United States.\nIts print services include The National Catholic Register newspaper, the\nCatholic News Agency and EWTN Publishing Inc.The nonprofit broadcaster\nreported total revenues of $46 million in 2013, the last year for which tax\nrecords are available. Of that, $45.4 million came from donations.An\nassociated catalog division reported revenues of $2.7 million in 2013, mostly\nfrom sales, records show.A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated at\n11:00 a.m. Friday at the Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament in Hanceville.\nInterment will immediately follow in the Shrine's Crypt Church.\n\n","title":"Global Catholic Network founder Mother Mary Angelica dies at 92 - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Global Catholic Network founder Mother Mary Angelica dies at 92 https://t.co/eqeNIUj8jq https://t.co/0GuLnYpN4i","date":"Mon Mar 28 03:51:07 +0000 2016","favs":149,"id":{"$numberLong":"714298748906643456"},"retweets":136},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1UVSzql"}

They graduated together from Vanderbilt\nUniversity's Owen Graduate School of Management.The White House said the\npresident also assured their parents that the thoughts, prayers and resolve of\nthe nation are with them at this difficult time.Stephanie, 29, and Justin, who\njust turned 30, were dropping off her mother, Carolyn Moore, at the time of\nthe explosions.\"I was waiting in line to check in, and she was sitting in the\nseats with her husband waiting for me to finish...

At one point, police used a water cannon to disperse what some\ndescribed as a riot. Several news outlets reported the protesters giving Nazi\nsalutes and aggressively confronting Muslim women at the shrine.Ten were\narrested and two police officers were injured.\"We had 340 hooligans from\ndifferent football clubs who came to Brussels and we knew for sure that they\nwould create some trouble,\" Police Commissioner Christian De Coninck said. \"It\nwas a very difficult police operation because lots of families with kids were\nhere.\"Brussels mayor Yvan Mayeur expressed his disgust, with Belgium still in\nmourning over the suicide bombings at Brussels airport and subway.\"The police\nwere not deployed to protect people from these hooligans but a whole other\nthreat,\" said Mayeur told RTL television.People trying to pay their respects\nwere also dismayed.\"It was important for us to be here symbolically,\" said\nSamia Orosemane, a 35-year-old comedian. But, she added, \"there were lots of\nmen who were here and doing the Nazi salute, shouting 'death to Arabs' and so\nwe weren't able to get through.\"\"We are all here today for peace, and for the\nbrotherhood among peoples.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1abf9"},"content":"******DUBLIN **\\-- Thousands of soldiers marched solemnly through the crowded streets of Dublin on Sunday to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Easter Rising against Britain, a fateful rebellion that reduced parts of the capital to ruins and fired the country's flame of independence.The Easter parade through Dublin featured military ceremonies at key buildings seized in 1916, when about 1,200 rebels sought to ignite a popular revolt against Ireland's place in the United Kingdom.The five-hour procession paused at noon outside the colonnaded General Post Office on O'Connell Street, the rebel headquarters a century ago, where commander Padraig Pearse formally launched the revolt by proclaiming to bemused Dubliners the creation of a \"provisional\" Republic of Ireland.A soldier in today's Irish Defence Forces, Capt. Peter Kelleher, stood in front of the restored post office Sunday to read the full, florid text of Pearse's 1916 proclamation.\"In the name of God and of the dead generations from which she receives her old tradition of nationhood, Ireland, through us, summons her children to her flag and strikes for her freedom,\" Kelleher said to an audience that included Ireland's leaders and scores of grandchildren of the rebels.Many donned their ancestors' Easter Rising bronze service medals, which Ireland issued in 1941 on the rebellion's 25th anniversary.British forces, among them many Irishmen focused on fighting Germany in World War I, were caught off guard by the seizure of largely unguarded buildings in 1916. Most officers were attending horse races in the Irish countryside. But Britain quickly deployed army reinforcements who were cheered by some locals as they marched into Dublin. Artillery based at Trinity College and a gunboat on the River Liffey which bisects the city shelled the post office and other rebel strongholds, forcing their surrender within six days.The fighting left nearly 500 dead, most of them civilians caught in the crossfire or shot -- by both sides -- as suspected looters. Some 126 British soldiers, 82 rebels and 17 police were slain.Many Dubliners opposed the insurrection as an act of treason in a time of war, but public sentiment swiftly swung in the rebels' favor once a newly arrived British Army commander decided to execute Pearse and 14 other rebel leaders by firing squad in Dublin's Kilmainham Jail.A 16th figure, Roger Casement, who days before the Easter Rising was caught trying to smuggle German weapons by sea to Ireland, was hanged inside a London prison.Irish President Michael D Higgins, centre right, arrives to lay a wreath at the General Post Office on O'Connell street, Dublin, Ireland, Sunday, March, 27, 2016.In the rebellion's immediate wake, the poet W.B. Yeats reflected Ireland's conflicted feelings about how violent nationalism appeared to be hastening Ireland's journey to political freedom but at a debatable cost. His \"Easter, 1916\" poem, among the most quoted works in all of Irish literature, listed the names of executed Rising commanders and concluded that Ireland had \"changed, changed utterly: A terrible beauty is born.\"Easter Rising veterans led Ireland's 1919-21 war of independence, their ranks swelled by combat veterans returning to Ireland from World War I trenches. As the newly founded Irish Republican Army fought police and soldiers in the predominantly Catholic south, Protestants in northeast Ireland carved out a new U.K.-linked state of Northern Ireland.A treaty accepted by most southern rebels established an Irish Free State in 1922 that grudgingly accepted the reality of the island's partition. The new Irish state survived a fratricidal 1922-23 civil war between IRA factions. Michael Collins' pro-treaty forces crushed IRA die-hards who, backed by Eamon de Valera, rejected the treaty because the new state was not fully independent of Britain. Both men had fought in the 1916 Rising.Ireland remained neutral in World War II and declared itself a republic on Easter Monday 1949.Ireland long has struggled to embrace Easter as its effective independence day, in part because the enemy camps from the Irish civil war forged the country's two dominant political parties: Fine Gael by allies of the slain IRA leader Collins; and de Valera's Fianna Fail party. Both parties claim to be the true defenders of the 1916 rebels' ideals.Official unease with 1916's disputed legacy grew from the early 1970s as a new Belfast-based IRA launched a ruthless campaign to force Northern Ireland out of the U.K. and into the republic. This outlawed faction called itself the Provisional IRA and killed nearly 1,800 people before calling a 1997 cease-fire to support leaders of its revived Sinn Fein party, who today help govern Northern Ireland alongside British Protestant politicians.In a sign of changing times, leaders of Fine Gael, Fianna Fail and Sinn Fein stood side by side at Sunday's events, including a ceremony inside Kilmainham Jail, where Pearse and other commanders were executed.Sunday's commemorations are the centerpiece of an estimated 2,500 events nationwide this spring and summer reflecting on the uprising's legacy.The anniversary date is imprecise, given that Easter falls on different dates each year and the 1916 rebellion actually started on Easter Monday -- an official holiday in Ireland -- not on the Sunday. The rebellion began April 24 and ended on April 29, 1916. The executions began four days later.\n\n","title":"Ireland commemorates 100th anniversary of 1916 Easter Rising - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Ireland commemorates 100th anniversary of 1916 Easter Rising https://t.co/2gVjLWO7br https://t.co/k4rDVi2RUV","date":"Mon Mar 28 01:53:02 +0000 2016","favs":130,"id":{"$numberLong":"714269034049638401"},"retweets":91},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/21OcKqx"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1abfb"},"content":"As the Republican presidential primary continues its descent into tabloid-\nlevel smears, GOP front-runner Donald Trump is laying all the blame at the\nfeet of his chief opponent for the nomination: Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. \"I had\nnothing to do whatsoever with the National Enquirer, and neither did the\ncampaign,\" Trump told ABC News in a phone interview Sunday. \"And I will tell\nyou -- for him to try and say that I had to do with it try and put the shoe on\nthe other foot is disgraceful.\" Trump was referring to a story that ran in the\nNational Enquirer on Friday that claimed to reveal unsavory details about\nCruz's personal life. The Texas senator immediately denied the report's\nallegations and slammed Trump as the \"sleazy\" originator of the story, along\nwith the campaign's \"henchmen.\"But on Sunday, Trump said he \"didn't even know\nabout the story\" in the Enquirer.\"I have no control over the National\nEnquirer,\" he told ABC. \"I just got it last night. Somebody sent it to me over\nto read so I could at least see what it said.\"The billionaire businessman then\npointed the finger at Cruz, saying his rival was the one who \"started\" the\nvicious mudslinging that this week grew to encompass the two candidates'\nwives.\"By the way, he's the one that started it,\" Trump said. \"And from what I\nhear, he and his campaign went out and bought the cover shoot. She did --\nMelania did a cover shoot for GQ, a very strong modeling picture. No big deal.\nBut it was a cover shoot for GQ, a big magazine. And it was, you know, fine.\"\nThe GQ cover image featured Trump's wife, Melania, posing nude on a fur rug\nand handcuffed to a briefcase. An anti-Trump super PAC unaffiliated with the\nCruz campaign used that photo in an ad \\-- captioned \"Meet Melania Trump. Your\nnext first lady,\" -- that encouraged Utah voters to vote for Cruz over Trump\nin the state's primary last week. Trump, in retaliation, threatened to \"spill\nthe beans\" on Heidi Cruz, his rival's wife. Cruz has refuted that he has any\nconnection to the super PAC, called \"Make America Awesome,\" or to its Utah ad\ncampaign. Despite the denials, Trump insists Cruz was responsible. \"From what\nI hear somebody bought the rights to it and he was the one or his campaign\nbought the rights and they gave it to the super PAC,\" Trump said. \"And just so\nyou understand, that super PAC is very friendly to Ted Cruz. He knew all about\nit 100 percent. So he started it. I didn't start it.\"Cruz, on Sunday, again\ndenied the National Enquirer allegations, calling them \"complete made up\nlies.\"\"They're garbage,\" Cruz told Fox News. \"But, you know, it's indicative\nof just how low Donald Trump will go.\"Responding to Trump's own denial of his\ninvolvement in the Enquirer story, Cruz pointed to one source that had once\nbeen affiliated with his rival's campaign.\"You know the only person quoted on\nthe record there is Roger Stone, the chief political adviser to Donald Trump,\"\nCruz said. Though Stone departed Trump's last year, when the campaign said\nthey had fired the adviser, Cruz insisted that \"Roger Stone remains the\nhenchmen, the hatchet man, the enforcer for Donald Trump. He's pushing these\nattacks. And, by the way, he's been pushing them for many, many months\nonline.\"He also pointed out that David Pecker, the CEO of the tabloid\nmagazine, was a \"close\" friend of Trump.\"The National Enquirer has endorsed\nDonald Trump for president,\" Cruz said. \"And this entire campaign they've done\ntwo things. One, they've praised Donald Trump at every turn. And two, they\nspread lies and smears and attacks on every -- every one of his opponents.\" Of\nthe ad that featured Trump's wife, Cruz decried it as well. \"As soon as I saw\nit, I denounced it and said it was wrong,\" Cruz said. \"Melania is a lovely\nwoman.\"He added that it was the work of an independent organization. \"It was a\ngroup -- I don't know the person who was involved,\" Cruz said. \"As far as i\nknow, I never met them. I've never spoken to them. They're completely\ndisconnected from the campaign.\"\n\n","title":"Trump on Cruz spat: \"He started it.

Ted Cruz has called for increased surveillance in Muslim\ncommunities in the United States in the wake of last week's terrorist attacks\nin Brussels\\--and two national security experts, including a Republican member\nof Congress, were critical of the GOP hopeful's plan.\"To send inflammatory\nmessages could actually have an unintended consequence,\" said House Homeland\nSecurity Committee Chairman Michael McCaul (R-Texas). He added that Muslim\ncommunities are situated very differently in Europe, noting that they tend to\nbe more segregated and thus easier for members of those communities to become\nradicalized. \"In Europe it's very segregated, and you have the diasporas in\nBelgium that I saw,\" he said. \"And they're being radicalized because they're\nnot assimilated with the culture. I don't think we have that same situation in\nthe United States.\"John Miller, the deputy commissioner of intelligence and\ncounterterrorism for the New York Police Department, also criticized Cruz's\nplan. \"When you have people campaigning through fear and using that as\nleverage, and then giving advice to police to be the cudgel of that fear,\nthat's not the direction American policing should be taking in a democracy,\"\nhe said. \"Listen, we're the proudest country on the planet and that's because\nwe have been a leader on freedom and human rights and everything else,\" Miller\ncontinued. \"I think in our history if there are moments of shame it would be\nJapanese internment, the Red Scare and McCarthyism, torture after 9/11--these\nare things that on reflection, through history, the American people have\nrejected.\"The two men also addressed the susceptibility of the United States\nto the kind of terrorist attack that killed dozens in Brussels last week, as\nwell as what officials can do to prevent similar attacks here.McCaul reassured\nthat the American people are being protected, including additional security at\nairports and other transit hubs which were the target of the ISIS attacks in\nBrussels. \"We are ramping up security at train stations, at airports, at\nsubway systems using canines and other things both visible and invisible,\" he\nsaid. \"I want to give the American people assurances that we are protecting\nthem.\"Still, he noted that there are two main concerns for preventing similar\nattacks in the U.S.: first, Americans already in the country who have been\ninspired by the attacks; and second, the foreign fighters that left the U.S.\nto join ISIS and have since come home. \"The idea that there are ISIS followers\nin the United States talking to ISIS in Raqqa and being influenced by them,\nand the thing that is the biggest challenge to federal law enforcement is the\nfact that they're communicating in darkness,\" he said, referring to encrypted\ncommunications. \"If you can't see what they're saying in advance, it's hard to\nstop it.\"Still, McCaul said, the U.S. has advantages in dealing with these\nkinds of threats that Europe doesn't. \"In many ways Europe is in a pre-9/11\nposture, they have many intelligence and security gaps,\" he said. \"The\nphenomena here is a foreign fighter threat, the revolving door from Europe to\nthe region in Iraq and Syria and back through Turkey, back into Europe ...\nit's one of the greatest threats that Europe has because they're not prepared\nfor it from a security standpoint.\"Miller, explaining how the NYPD responds to\nan international incident of terrorism, said the agency's response is\nthreefold: first, they work to secure potential major targets in New York\nCity, bringing in additional security as soon as the attack happens.Second,\nthey look for any possible New York connection to \"make sure that we don't\nhave a threat that needs to be chased here.\" At first glance, he added, it's\nalways difficult to tell whether a terrorist attack is an isolated incident or\nindicative of more to come around the globe.And third, the NYPD sends officers\nand detectives to the scene of the attacks to see what American law\nenforcement can learn from the attacks or the way they were handled locally.\n\"We study, with the local authorities, the attack and the response to see what\nwe can bring back home to sharpen or hone our response,\" he said.He noted that\nmany previous attacks have either been inspired or enabled by ISIS, but that\nBrussels is an example of something even more dangerous: attacks that were\nactually directed by ISIS.\"That's teams under the command and control of ISIL\nsent from Syria to western Europe,\" he said, referring to an alternative\nacronym for the group.\n\n","title":"National security experts slam Ted Cruz on Muslim plan - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"RT @CBSPolitics: On @FaceTheNation, national security experts slam Ted Cruz on Muslim plan https://t.co/qN3DU7Dpm8 via @emilyrs","date":"Sun Mar 27 21:43:02 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714206118201917446"},"retweets":38},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/25qZYTm"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1abfe"},"content":"_With inspirational messages Pastor Joel Osteen has built a loyal following\n... both in person and on television ... you'd hardly know that he ever\ndoubted that the ministry would be his calling. Tracy Smith has our Easter\nSunday Profile:_Every Sunday morning, as the light comes up over Houston, a\ncapacity crowd fills the biggest church in town ... and their pastor,\ntelevangelist Joel Osteen, prays it all goes well.And it seems, to some at\nleast, that God has been listening.Osteen, with wife and co-pastor Victoria,\nleads Houston's Lakewood Church, now the largest congregation in the United\nStates. More than 40,000 members show up every week to hear Osteen's message\nof hope, usually delivered with his trademark smile.His sermons are\nrelentlessly positive, and that's made him a target of critics, who say Osteen\nsometimes sounds less like a preacher and more like a motivational\nspeaker.\"You've been criticized for 'Church lite,' for 'a cotton candy\nmessage,'\" said Smith. \"Do you feel like you're cheating people by not telling\nthem about the Hell part? Or repentance part?\"Pastor Joel Osteen.\"No, I really\ndon't, because it's a different approach,\" Osteen replied. \"You know, it's not\nhellfire and brimstone. But I say most people are beaten down enough by life.\nThey already feel guilty enough. They're not doing what they should, raising\ntheir kids -- you know, we can all find reasons. So I want them to come to\nLakewood or our meetings and be lifted up, to say, 'You know what? I may not\nbe perfect, but I'm moving forward. I'm doing better.' And I think that\nmotivates you to do better.\"And if anything, his flock seems to be growing:\nOsteen personally leads three services a week, for the thousands at the\nchurch, and for millions more on TV, the Internet and radio, making him one of\nthe most-watched religious leaders in America.After every service, the Osteens\nmake their way to the church lobby to meet what is typically a few hundred who\nwait on line for a little face time, a blessing, or just a word of hope for\nsomeone going through a hard time.Whatever you think of Osteen's theology, you\ncan't deny his ability to connect to his followers.\"One time I thought he was\nlooking at me, and I'm like, _he's talking about me!_\" one man said.And the\nchurch is only part of his ministry. His eight books, including his latest,\n\"The Power of I Am,\" are all bestsellers, and have made Osteen so much money\nthat doesn't need to touch the Lakewood collection plate.He says his personal\nwealth comes from the books and other projects, like with Sirius Radio. \"But I\ndo think there is a certain thought, especially in the church world, that\nyou're supposed to be poor and broke and defeated to show that you're humble.\nAnd see, I don't buy into that,\" he said.\"You purposely don't ask for money on\nTV,\" said Smith. \"But people send it anyway?\"\"People send money. They buy the\nproduct or they support the ministry. Yeah, you know, just an unbelievable\namount that keeps it all going.\"\"Do you think if you stood up there and said,\n'Please don't send money,' people would still send money?\"\"I don't know. I\ndon't want to try that, though!\"When asked what happens to the money taken in\nby the ministry (from which he does not take a salary), Osteen said, \"In just\nbig broad terms, $30 million goes to the TV effort. What's left, it's paying\nstaff, it's supporting missionaries and missions' work, it's just the\norganization of making it go. So if we bring in, you know, $90 million this\nyear, we will spend $90 million.\"\"You said $90 million? Is that a good\nestimate of what you'll bring in?\"\"That is. It's amazing, I know.\"What might\nbe even more amazing is that Osteen never dreamed he could be a preacher --\nand he never even wanted to try.Born a minister's son in 1963, Joel Scott\nOsteen grew up in Houston watching his dad, Pastor John Osteen, founder of\nLakewood Church, and a preacher with a more traditional style.Young Joel\nOsteen behind the camera.Dad, of course, wanted Joel to succeed him as pastor,\nbut Joel never saw himself at the podium. Instead, he studied TV production,\nand helped get his dad on the air every week.\"I had no desire to do it,\" he\nsaid. \" And even my dad, he never pressured me. He just said, 'Joel, you'd\nmake a good minister.' But I had no desire, and I didn't think this was in\nme.\"In the meantime he met his future wife, Victoria Iloff, as she was working\nthe counter at a jewelry store her parents owned. Their very first date: a\nbasketball game at Houston's Compaq Center.But Dad kept on asking Joel to give\npreaching a shot, and in 1999, at age 36, he finally agreed to do it.Six days\nlater, Joel Osteen got a wake-up call.\"My mother called at 2:09 in the\nmorning, and she said, 'Joel, Daddy's had a heart attack over at our house,'\"\nhe recalled. \"And, I went there and, you know, the fire trucks are there and,\nyou know, my dad was there on the ground and they were shocking him and all\nthat stuff. But I knew he was gone. You know how you just know it?\"After the\nfuneral, Osteen says he felt called to stand in his daddy's shoes.\"I'm not\nsaying I was that great at it. But immediately, there was just momentum. And\nit's almost like it never stopped.\"In fact, under Joel Osteen, the church grew\nso quickly that in 2003 they leased the then-vacant Compaq Center, and turned\nit into the church's current home.\n\n","title":"The positivity of Joel Osteen - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"The positivity of Joel Osteen, a @CBSSunday profile https://t.co/LSDNjprE6k https://t.co/hI7qxyos71","date":"Sun Mar 27 21:31:02 +0000 2016","favs":134,"id":{"$numberLong":"714203098810617856"},"retweets":48},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1Pz6D2h"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1abff"},"content":"Last Updated Mar 28, 2016 5:41 AM EDT******THE HAGUE, Netherlands **\\-- Dutch\npolice arrested a 32-year-old Frenchman in the port city of Rotterdam on\nSunday at the request of French authorities who suspect him of \"involvement in\nplanning a terror attack,\" prosecutors said.Residents were evacuated from\nhomes near addresses on two streets that were raided Sunday by anti-terror\npolice, who also took three other men into custody.French officials requested\nthe arrest Friday after the suspect emerged during an investigation, according\nto a statement from the Dutch national prosecutor's office.The suspect was\nallegedly involved in a plot disrupted by police in the Paris region last\nweek, the Paris prosecutor's office said. Another Frenchman, Reda Kriket, was\ndetained Thursday in that plot and remains in custody.An official with the\nParis prosecutor's office said there is no sign of a link at this stage\nbetween Kriket's purported plot and a network behind attacks in Brussels and\nParis in recent months.The Paris official and Dutch prosecutors' Spokesman Wim\nde Bruin declined to give more details about the alleged plot.The suspect,\nwhose identity was not released, is expected to be extradited to France\nsoon.Three other men were detained in Sunday's raids; two with Algerian\nbackgrounds and a third man whose identity could not immediately be\nestablished.De Bruin said the three were held in relation to a Dutch\ninvestigation, but he gave no further details.The raids came with Europe on\nhigh alert following last week's deadly suicide bombings in Brussels.Belgian\nriot police clashed Sunday with hundreds of right-wing hooligans at a\ntemporary shrine honoring victims of the Brussels suicide bombings, as\ninvestigators launched fresh anti-terror raids, taking four more people into\ncustody.Police used water cannon when scuffles broke out in front of the\nBourse, which has become a symbolic rallying point for people to pay their\nrespects to those who died in Tuesday's attacks. Black clad men carrying an\nanti-ISIS banner with an expletive on it trampled parts of the shrine,\nshouting Nazi slogans. Ten were arrested and two police officers injured.\"We\nhad 340 hooligans from different football clubs who came to Brussels and we\nknew for sure that they would create some trouble,\" Police Commissioner\nChristian De Coninck said. \"It was a very difficult police operation because\nlots of families with kids were here.\"Much like in France after the Paris\nattacks, public interest in fiery far-right nationalistic populism has\nexploded in popularity. Vocativ reports Facebook likes for Vlaams Belang, the\nright-wing populist party from Flanders, has surged more than 3,000\npercent.Brussels mayor Yvan Mayeur expressed his disgust, with Belgium still\nin mourning over the suicide bombings at Brussels airport and subway, which\nkilled at least 38 people,including the bombers, and injured at least\n300.Federal prosecutors, meanwhile, said Sunday morning's raids were linked a\n\"federal case regarding terrorism\" but did not specify whether it had any\nlinks to the March 22 attacks.Right-wing demonstrators protest against\nterrorism in front of the old stock exchange in Brussels, Belgium. March 27.\n2016.Thirteen raids were launched in the capital and the northern cities of\nMechelen and Duffel. An investigating judge was to decide later whether to\nkeep the four in custody. Five were released after questioning.Tuesday's bomb\nattacks are also tearing at the fabric of the government, justice system and\npolice, and Belgium's interior minister sought Sunday to contain the growing\ncriticism of the government's handling of the tragedy.Interior Minister Jan\nJambon conceded Sunday that decades of neglect had hampered the government's\nresponse to violent extremism. He said the government has invested 600 million\neuros ($670 million) into police and security services over the past two years\nbut that Belgium's justice system and security services are still lagging\nbehind.Jambon, whose offer to resign Thursday was declined by the prime\nminister, also acknowledged some shortcomings prior to the attacks.\"There have\nbeen errors,\" he said on VRT television.Jambon said it takes time to hire\nanti-terror specialists and specialized equipment and insisted that the\ngovernment's new investments need time before they become visible to the\npublic.A woman consoles her children at a street memorial following Tuesday's\nbomb attacks in Brussels, Belgium, March 23, 2016.As international pressure on\nBelgium has mounted for serving as an unwitting rear-base for extremist\nfighters who launched the Nov. 13 massacres that left 130 dead in Paris, the\ngovernment has felt forced to defend its choices and the actions of\ninvestigators. Lawmakers, meanwhile, are demanding an inquiry.Belgian police\nand the army have been deployed, sometimes around the clock, at major\nbuildings and sites in the capital in increasing numbers since November, when\nBrussels went into lockdown over fears that top Paris suspect Salah Abdeslam\nhad returned and was hiding there.As it turned out, Abdeslam did return, but\npolice did not find and arrest him until March 18, four days before suspects\nfrom his network exploded suicide bombs in Brussels.Belgian investigators have\nbeen slammed for not questioning Abdeslam long enough or hard enough after he\nwas shot in the leg during his arrest. Police have also been criticized for\ntaking too long to get to Zaventem airport on Tuesday morning after two\nsuicide bombers blew themselves up there -- and left an even bigger third\nsuitcase full of explosives that did not go off.Jambon and Justice Minister\nKeen Goens were grilled by lawmakers Friday over how authorities failed to\narrest suicide bomber Ibrahim El Bakraoui before he blew himself in the packed\ndeparture hall at Brussels Airport.Turkey has said that Bakraoui -- whose\nbrother Khalid was the suicide bomber at the Maelbeek subway station on\nTuesday -- was caught near Turkey's border with Syria in 2015 and Ankara had\nwarned Brussels and the Netherlands that he was \"a foreign terrorist fighter.\"\nBelgian authorities said they did not know he was suspected of terror-related\nactivities until after he was deported to the Netherlands.Jambon also said the\nBrussels subway network had been told to shut off services around 20 minutes\nbefore the attack at the subway station, which is close to both the European\nUnion headquarters and the U.S. embassy. He did not fully explain why it was\nnot closed in time, raising more questions about the efficiency of Belgium's\nsecurity services.Italian police in the southern city of Salerno said Sunday\nthat they had arrested an Algerian wanted in Belgium for an alleged false ID\ncrime ring. Djamal Eddine Ouali was arrested Saturday in the town of Bellizzi,\nsaid Luigi Amato, the head of Salerno police's anti-terrorism squad. Ouali,\n40, was being held in jail while authorities expect extradition procedures to\nsoon begin.Belgian prosecutors said Sunday that the man is thought to have\nmade false documents for some of the attackers in the Nov. 13 massacre in\nParis, including top suspect Salah Abdeslam. Investigators are trying to\nestablish whether the same false ID ring provided papers for the March 22\nattackers.Also over the weekend, an American couple has been confirmed to be\namong the 31 people killed in Tuesday's terror attacks in Brussels.Justin and\nStephanie Shults were listed as missing after the suicide bombings at the\nBrussels airport, and their families spent the last several days frantically\ntrying to locate them.On Saturday, the couple's families and employers\nconfirmed they had been killed. CBS affiliate WKYT in Lexington, Kentucky,\nobtained a statement from Mars Inc., where Stephanie Shults worked, on\nSaturday night.\"Today we learned from Stephanie's family that she and her\nhusband, Justin, were among those killed in the attack on the Brussels\nairport,\" the company said. \"We are mourning the loss of our colleague and\nfriend. Our hearts and thoughts are with their families and with all those who\nare suffering during this terrible time.\"Justin Shults' brother confirmed his\ndeath through social media Saturday, CBS affiliate WTVF in Nashville\nreported.An undated photo shows Stephanie and Justin Shults.His employer,\nClarcor, also released a statement confirming his death.\"We have learned today\nthat Justin Shults died in the bombing at Brussels Airport,\" the statement\nsaid.\"We grieve with his family and continue to offer our support as they\nmourn this unimaginable loss. Justin has been an integral member of our global\nfinance team since May of 2012, and he has lived with his wife, Stephanie, in\nBrussels since 2014. He will be remembered by his Clarcor community as an\nintelligent, kind and loyal friend and employee. Justin will be greatly missed\nby those who knew him,\" the company said.\n\n","title":"Frenchman suspected in planning terror attack arrested - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Frenchman suspected in planning terror attack arrested in Holland amid raids on multiple homes at request of France https://t.co/SdNytohQn0","date":"Sun Mar 27 21:07:42 +0000 2016","favs":45,"id":{"$numberLong":"714197226948583425"},"retweets":55},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1UVryTT"}

That, he says, is how the company has survived this long.\"It\nwas a milling company on the banks of the Mississippi,\" Powell said. \"We\ninvented the packaged food revolution in America. The consumer wanted\nconvenience, and General Mills became Betty Crocker and Bisquick and Cheerios\nand cereal.\"General Mills began as the Washburn-Crosby Company in 1866,\nselling a single product, its gold medal-winning flour. \"Still the number one-\nselling flour in America,\" said Forsythe.He and archivist Jessica Faucher\npulled out an early cookbook: \"Things you can make with Gold Medal flour‎.\nThey'll expect that you know how to do certain things if you're going to make\ncalves brain, breaded. How to separate the two lobes of the brain with a\nknife, and then soak them in cold water with a little salt for an hour.\"And\nthey expected you to use everything.\" Such as? \"Ox eyes.\"In 1921, the company\nbegan marketing its second product, Washburn's Whole Wheat Flakes, which would\nbecome Wheaties. But they didn't catch on at first.\"So on Christmas Eve 1926,\nwe hired the Wheaties Quartet to come in and sing the Wheaties jingle, which\nis the first-ever singing radio commercial,\" said Forsythe.  \n\"It was catchy, and Wheaties' sales improved,\" Forsythe said.The company\nlearned the power of radio and television.

Johnson, who is African-American, was not among the board's recommendations.CBS Chicago reports that in a prior news release, officials said Johnson had more than 20 years on the force, with time spent in the bureau of detectives and patrol.\"While I supported the nomination of Gene Williams, I believe Eddie Johnson is equally suited to lead the Chicago Police Department and I support Mayor Emanuel's decision,\" Beale said. \"Eddie Johnson knows Chicago, he knows the police department and the challenges facing our neighborhoods. He is a true leader and will bring the fundamental changes CPD needs right now. I look forward to getting to work with Eddie right away.\"Anabel Abarca, a spokeswoman for Alderman George Cardenas, a prominent member of the Chicago City Council's Latino caucus, also told AP Sunday that Emanuel reached out to the alderman with news of Johnson's selection.Emanuel's spokeswoman Kelley Quinn declined to comment on whether Johnson is the mayor's pick, but said he has made a decision and has informed the three nominees. She said Emanuel would announce his decision within days.\"While each of the finalists had strong qualifications, the mayor did not feel that any of them were the complete package that Chicago needs at this time and thus none were offered the position,\" Quinn said. \"The mayor called each of them individually late Saturday to let them know of his decision.\"A city ordinance allows Emanuel to appoint an interim chief and ask the police board for a new list of finalists.One of the board's initial nominees, Cedric Alexander, told AP on Sunday that Emanuel offered him the job on Thursday during a meeting in Washington, D.C., and that the mayor told him he intended to make Johnson his first deputy. But he said Emanuel phoned him Saturday night to say he had changed his mind.\"He did offer me the position in D.C. on Thursday, and last night he called and said he's going in a different direction,\" said Alexander, the public safety director in Georgia's DeKalb County. NBC5 in Chicago first reported that Alexander said he'd been offered the position.Alexander told AP the plan had been for him to fly to Chicago on Monday and that the announcement was to have come Wednesday.\"I would like to thank the Chicago Police Board for giving me the opportunity to apply,\" Alexander said. \"Clearly the mayor is going in another direction, and I would just like to wish the very best for the people of Chicago.\"Chicago City Council's black caucus said last week that they would prefer a local African-American for the job. But they stopped short of endorsing Eugene Williams, a black deputy chief in Chicago who was among the police board recommendations. Anne Kirkpatrick, former police chief in Spokane, Washington, also was a finalist.On Sunday, Police Board President Lori E. Lightfoot said the board \"has not received formal communication\" from the mayor regarding the nominees it submitted for the position. \"The board will be taking no action until it receives such notification.\" Lightfoot said the board would have \"no further comment.\"Officer Jason Van Dyke has been charged with first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald and the video has prompted investigations, including a federal civil rights probe of the Chicago Police Department.\n\n","title":"Chicago mayor dismisses recs, makes own pick for top cop - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Chicago mayor dismisses recommendations, makes own pick for top cop after Laquan McDonald https://t.co/dn04XEB76f https://t.co/Jd6PSo2le4","date":"Sun Mar 27 20:07:03 +0000 2016","favs":43,"id":{"$numberLong":"714181961158365185"},"retweets":46},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1UnqOsa"}

That agreement aims to restore bison to areas of the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains where millions once roamed.\"For thousands of years the Blackfeet lived among the buffalo here. The buffalo sustained our way of life, provided our food, clothing, shelter,\" Blackfeet Chairman Harry Barnes said. \"It became part of our spiritual being. We want to return the buffalo.\"The 89 plains bison, also known as buffalo, will form the nucleus of a herd that tribal leaders envision will soon roam freely across a vast landscape: the Blackfeet reservation, nearby Glacier National Park and the Badger-Two Medicine wilderness - more than 4,000 square miles combined.Bison were hunted to near-extinction in the late 1800s as European settlers advanced across the once-open American West.Most of the animals that survive today are in commercial herds, raised for their meat and typically interbred with cattle. The Blackfeet have a commercial bison herd established in 1972 that numbers more than 400 animals.The lineage of Elk Island's bison, which experts say are free of cattle genes, traces back to a small group of animals captured by several American Indians on Blackfeet land just south of Canada.Those bison were later sold to two men, Charles Allard and Michel Pablo, who formed what became known as the Pablo-Allard herd. By the early 1900s, the Pablo-Allard herd was said to be the largest collection of the animals remaining in the U.S.After U.S. officials rejected a sale offer from Pablo, the Canadian government purchased most of the bison. The animals were then shipped train from Ravalli, Montana, to Elk Island, according to park officials and Western historians.\"They've made a big circle, but now they're coming home,\" said Ervin Carlson, a Blackfeet member and president of the Intertribal Buffalo Council.The relocation comes as the restoration of genetically-pure bison to the West's grasslands and forests have gained traction. The efforts include the relocation of some genetically-pure bison from Yellowstone National Park to two Indian reservations in eastern and central Montana.The tribes - the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation and the Assiniboine and Gros Ventre Tribes of the Fort Belknap Reservations - are signatories to the 2014 treaty. But ranchers and landowners near the reservations have strongly opposed the tribes' plans, driven by concerns over disease and the prospect of bison competing with cattle for grass.Brucellosis, the disease found in Yellowstone's bison herds, is absent from Canada's Elk Island, according to the park's superintendent, Stephen Flemming.\"The difficulty (with Yellowstone bison) is the stigma attached to them. In this case, the animals (coming from Canada) have never been exposed to brucellosis,\" said Keith Aune with the Wildlife Conservation Society, which has been working with the Blackfeet on their bison program.Over the past five years, Flemming said, about 180 Elk Island bison were relocated to form a private herd maintained by the American Prairie Reserve, which controls a large area between the Fort Peck and Fort Belknap reservations. Those animals, too, have met some resistance from ranchers, but the absence of brucellosis has largely neutralized that issue as a point of contention.The Blackfeet will loan 20 of the Elk Island bison to the Oakland Zoo in California for a special exhibit slated to open this fall, according to tribal officials and the zoo's president, Joel Parrott.Offspring from the animals would be returned to Montana, and there are plans to promote eco-tours to the Blackfeet Reservation among zoo patrons.\"Bison historically are native California animals, too,\" Parrott said. \"We're going to highlight the efforts of the Blackfeet. A big part of this which is so unique is the return of buffalo to tribal lands after all these years.\"\n\n","title":"Bison coming \"home\" to Montana Indian reservation after 140 years - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Bison coming \"home\" to Montana Indian reservation after 140 years https://t.co/tMipz3Jk9L https://t.co/XDpAJzbSmI","date":"Sun Mar 27 19:47:53 +0000 2016","favs":274,"id":{"$numberLong":"714177139483009024"},"retweets":159},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1SfcBHB"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1ac05"},"content":"******SACRAMENTO, Calif.**\\- California legislators and labor unions have reached a tentative agreement that will take the state's minimum wage from $10 to $15 an hour, a state senator said, a move that would make for the largest statewide minimum in the nation by far.\"This is not a done deal,\" Sen. Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, told The Associated Press on Saturday. \"Everyone's been operating in good faith and we hope to get it through the Legislature.\"Leno said if an agreement is finalized, it would go before the Legislature as part of his minimum-wage bill that stalled last year.If the Legislature approves a minimum-wage package, it would avoid taking the issue to the ballot. One union-backed initiative has already qualified for the ballot, and a second, competing measure is also trying to qualify.\"This is an issue I've been working on for many years,\" Leno said. \"The governor and stakeholders have all been negotiating earnestly and in good faith for some time.\"Leno did not confirm specifics of the agreement, but most proposals have the wage increasing about a dollar per year until it reaches $15 per hour.The Los Angeles Times, which first reported the deal, said the wage would rise to $10.50 in 2017, to $11 an hour in 2018, and one dollar per year to take it to $15 by 2022. Businesses with fewer than 25 employees would have an extra year to comply.At $10 an hour, California already has one of the highest minimum wages in the nation along with Massachusetts. Only Washington, D.C., at $10.50 per hour is higher. The hike to $15 would make it the highest statewide wage in the nation by far, though raises are in the works in other states that might change by the time the plateau is reached in 2022.Last summer, the Los Angeles City Council and Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted to incrementally raise the minimum wage, reaching $15 an hour by 2020, reports CBS Los Angeles.Some in the service industry have voiced concerns that raising the minimum wage would increase expenses for employers, forcing them to raise menu prices. That, in turn, could lead to fewer customers or lower tips, some workers have said.\"I think it would be detrimental to the serving business if it was adopted statewide,\" said Michelle Mellon, a server at Du-Par's Restaurant in Studio City. \"People rely on their tips a lot, probably moreso than their checks.\"Some states have passed higher minimums for government employees and state-contracted workers, and some cities including Seattle have already passed $15 an hour increases.And Oregon officials approved a law earlier this month that will increase that state's minimum wage to nearly $15 in urban areas over the next six years.California union leaders, however, said they would not immediately dispense with planned ballot measures.Sean Wherley, a spokesman for SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, confirmed that the SEIU parent union was involved in the negotiations. He said SEIU-UHWW's leadership will decide whether to push ahead with its initiative that has already qualified for the ballot.\"Ours is on the ballot. We want to be certain of what all this is,\" Wherley said. \"If some agreement is signed into law, then our executive board would decide what to do. They would only make that decision after any agreement is signed into law.\"The union proposal that has already qualified for the ballot calls for reaching the $15 mark by 2021. The second proposed measure would reach $15 by 2020. Businesses and Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown have said such a steep wage increase would be incredibly costly.A spokesman for Brown, Evan Westrup, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Kevin Liao, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, D-Paramount, declined to comment.\n\n","title":"Deal reached to raise Calif. minimum wage to $15 an hour - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Deal reached to raise Calif. minimum wage to $15 an hour https://t.co/IwLOlg43Wa https://t.co/geoiNwgibb","date":"Sun Mar 27 18:15:03 +0000 2016","favs":98,"id":{"$numberLong":"714153778967130112"},"retweets":103},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1Sf1Yod"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1ac06"},"content":"******NEW YORK**\\- Jim Harrison, the fiction writer, poet, outdoorsman and reveler who wrote with gruff affection for the country's landscape and rural life and enjoyed mainstream success in middle age with his historical saga \"Legends of the Fall,\" has died at age 78.Spokeswoman Deb Seager of Grove Atlantic, Harrison's publisher, told The Associated Press that Harrison died Saturday at his home in Patagonia, Arizona. Seager did not know the cause of death. Harrison's wife of more than 50 years, Linda King Harrison, died last fall.The versatile and prolific author completed more than 30 books, most recently the novella collection \"The Ancient Minstrel,\" and was admired worldwide. Sometimes likened to Ernest Hemingway for the range and kinds of his interests, he was a hunter and fisherman who savored his time in a cabin near his Michigan hometown, a drinker and Hollywood script writer who was close friends with Jack Nicholson and came to know Sean Connery, Orson Welles and Warren Beatty among others. He was a sports writer and a man of extraordinary appetite who once polished off a 37-course lunch, a traveler and teller of tales, most famously \"Legends of the Fall.\"Published in 1979, \"Legends of the Fall\" was a collection of three novellas that featured the title story about Montana rancher Col. William Ludlow and his three sons of sharply contrasting personalities and values, the narrative extending from before World War I to the mid-20th century, from San Francisco to Singapore.\"Late in October 1914 three brothers rode from Choteau, Montana to Calgary, Alberta to enlist in the Great War,\" reads Harrison's celebrated opening sentence, which author Vance Bourjaily would praise for establishing \"both the voice and manner of the epic storyteller, who deals in great vistas and vast distances.\"The book was a best-seller, and Harrison worked on the script for an Oscar-nominated 1994 film of the same name starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Aidan Quinn. Harrison's screenplay credits also included \"Revenge,\" starring Kevin Costner, and the Nicholson film \"Wolf.\" But he would liken the unpredictable and nerve wracking process to being trapped in a \"shuddering elevator\" and reminded himself of his marginal status by inscribing a putdown by a Hollywood executive, \"You're just a writer,\" on a piece of paper and taping it above his desk.Harrison could have been a superb character actor, a bearded, burly man with a disfigured left eye and a smoker's rasp who confided that when out in public with Nicholson he was sometimes mistaken for the actor's bodyguard. Erudite enough to write reviews for The New York Times and to quote Wallace Stevens from memory, he also had a strong affinity for physical labor and a history of writing stories for and about men.\"My characters aren't from the urban dream-coasts,\" he told The Paris Review in 1986. \"A man is not a foreman on a dam project because he wants to be macho. That's his job, a job he's evolved into.\"How is it macho that I like to hunt and fish? I've been doing it since I was four.\"Harrison had displayed numerous talents before the general public caught on to him. He was an accomplished poet and sports journalist and a fiction writer with a strong feel for open spaces and the pull and consequences of history. He set many works in the rural north of his native Michigan, including the detective novels \"The Great Leader\" and \"The Big Seven,\" and used Nebraska as the backdrop for one of his most acclaimed works, \"Dalva.\"His other books included a volume of novellas, \"The River Swimmer\"; the poetry collections \"Songs of Unreason\" and \"Returning to Earth\"; and a memoir about food, \"The Raw and the Cooked: Adventures of a Roving Gourmand.\" He was voted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2007.Harrison married Linda King in 1959 and had two daughters.The grandson of farmers, and son of an agricultural extension agent, Harrison grew up in small Michigan towns - Grayling, Reed City, Haslett - where he developed a love of books and a primal bond with the outdoors, \"bone- and marrow-deep.\" He would associate his childhood with simple pleasures and ongoing loss, a general longing for simpler times and the physical handicap of his blind left eye, injured at age 7 when a neighborhood girl jammed a bottle in his face.In the 1950s and '60s, he drifted between studies at Michigan State University and the \"Beat\" scene in Boston, where he met Jack Kerouac, and New York City, where he taught briefly before returning to rural Michigan. In 1965, he debuted as a poet with \"Plain Song.\"Life as an outdoorsman inadvertently made him into a novelist. In the late 1960s, he slipped off a bank along the Manistee River in Michigan, injured his back, lapsed into a semi-coma and for some two years was forced to wear a corset. His close friend Tom McGuane suggested he try a full-length work of fiction since Harrison \"could no longer do anything to avoid it.\" (Through McGuane, he would also meet Nicholson, when Harrison visited the set of \"The Missouri Breaks,\" a 1976 movie written by McGuane).Harrison's first novel, \"Wolf: A Fake Memoir,\" came out in 1971 and he followed two years later with a work of fiction about the ecology, \"A Good Day to Die.\" But he was devastated by the commercial failure of his novel \"Farmer\" and was so broke he recalled, he couldn't pay his taxes and couldn't fill out a scholarship form for his daughter because he was required to include records from the IRS.His turnaround involved a true Hollywood twist. Harrison was visiting his in-laws' home when he came upon the journals of his wife's great-grandfather, a mining engineer named William Ludlow, and was inspired to write a story. The completion of what became \"Legends of the Fall\" was made possible by a $15,000 loan from Nicholson.\"And now the one-eyed goofy, the black-sheep poet ... has inadvertently struck it rich,\" Harrison later wrote of his mid-life success. \"After the first full year of this experience I was sitting on the porch of our recently remodeled farmhouse, triple the estimated time and expense and a thoroughly enervating process, reading the Detroit Free Press and noting that I had made more money in the last year than the President of General Motors, Harlow Curtis.\"I idly hoped he was happy in his work.\"\n\n","title":"Jim Harrison, \"Legends of the Fall\" author, dead at 78 - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Jim Harrison, the legendary-in-his-own-right \"Legends of the Fall\" author, dead at 78 https://t.co/AMCnTLDBko https://t.co/lxxeh9NFZ6","date":"Sun Mar 27 18:07:03 +0000 2016","favs":115,"id":{"$numberLong":"714151764015071232"},"retweets":174},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1RIethy"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1ac08"},"content":"_This year's bout of over-the-top staged wrestling that is Wrestlemania is\njust one week off. And, as Rita Braver now explains, there's a most unusual\nTAG TEAM in command:_Over more than three decades, Wrestlemania has become the\nSuper Bowl of American wrestling -- a day-long event featuring brawny brawlers\nof both sexes. And next Sunday, for the first time, the success of wrestling's\nbiggest event will rest largely on the very strong shoulders of two women.They\nare scions of two of America's most prominent sports families: Stephanie\nMcMahon, daughter of World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Vince McMahon, is the\ncompany's Chief Brand Officer; and Charlotte Jones Anderson, daughter of\nDallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who holds the same job for the Cowboys. It\nwas Charlotte who managed to land Wrestlemania for her family's AT\u0026amp;T\nField.Correspondent Rita Braver with Stephanie McMahon and Charlotte Jones\nAnderson.\"I made the pitch of why we needed to be together, and why\nWrestlemania had to occur here,\" Charlotte said. \"And when it was over, Vince\nlooked down the table and he said, 'We're gonna come to AT\u0026amp;T\nStadium.'\"\"How could we say no to Charlotte,\" Stephanie laughed.Of course,\nit's a bit different from the games usually played here. Charlotte's Dallas\nCowboys are in a sport where nothing is pre-ordained. But Stephanie makes no\nbones about the fact that World Wrestling matches are essentially fixed (or as\nWWE prefers to say, \"scripted\"). This season's stories of villains versus\nheroes will culminate in Wrestlemania, really a mega-finale, where champions\nwill be revealed.And does Stephanie know what the outcome is? \"Absolutely,\"\nshe said. \"And if we're doing our jobs right, we're going to take you on a\nride to make you so anxious and so caught up that you can't wait to see what's\ngoing to happen.\"But if their sports are different, their lives have many\nsimilarities.Stephanie faced skepticism as she came into the business: \"Oh,\nthere still is, absolutely there still is,\" she told Braver. \"I do think that\nwhen you are the boss' daughter or the boss' son, that you have more to\nprove.\"And her father obliges: \"He challenges me more, he drives me harder,\"\nshe said. \"You don't expect respect; you have to earn it from everyone.\"Vince\nMcMahon, chairman and CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment, with his daughter,\nStephanie McMahon, chief brand officer of WWE.Charlotte said her biggest\nchallenge was \"overcoming a perception that is, 'You are there only because\nyou are your father's daughter.' So every step of the way, you're always\ntrying not only to prove to yourself, but you're trying to prove in your work\nthat you belong where you are.\"And both women are working in fields dominated\nby male executives. Charlotte was not long out of Stanford University when her\nfather sold his oil and gas business to buy the then-struggling\nCowboys.\"People forget that at that time, the Dallas Cowboys were losing\n$75,000 a day,\" she said.One of her jobs was to save money. \"You pick the\nbiggest red-letter item on the list, which happened to be laundry, and went to\nthe local dry cleaning and said, 'I'll tell you what, if you will take care of\nour laundry bill, I'll put your sign out at practices.' And slowly, the idea\nof sponsorship and marketing evolved.\"In recent years, Charlotte oversaw the\nbuilding of the $1.15 billion stadium, the nation's largest domed structure.\nShe is now supervising a new, state-of-the art practice field and team\nheadquarters on 91 acres about an hour out of Dallas, in Frisco,\nTexas.Stephanie McMahon started working at World Wrestling, headquartered in\nStamford, Connecticut, when she was still in high school.Stephanie McMahon as\nthe \"Billion Dollar Princess.\"\"I'd come after school and I'd answer phones,\"\nshe said. \"I still have extensions memorized from that time.\"After Boston\nUniversity, she worked her way up through the executive ranks, but she also\nplays another role. She is not only a top executive, but also a wrestler -- a\nvillain, nicknamed the Billion Dollar Princess.She once even had to slap her\nmother, Linda McMahon, a former WWE executive in her own right (and one-time\ncandidate for the U.S. Senate).\"And I almost threw up,\" Stephanie said. \"I'm\nnot kidding! That was the single hardest thing I have ever had to do in our\nshow.\"Of course, it was all part of the show. Outside the ring, Stephanie's\nlife is remarkably parallel to Charlotte's. Both are moms to three children;\nboth are married to men who work for the family business (Charlotte to\nmarketing executive Shy Anderson, whom she met on a blind date, and Stephanie\nto WWE World Heavyweight Champ, Triple H).

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1ac0a"},"content":"******VATICAN CITY**\\- Pope Francis tempered his Easter Sunday message of Christian hope with a denunciation of \"blind\" terrorism, recalling victims ofattacks in Europe, Africa and elsewhere, as well as expressing dismay that people fleeing war or poverty are being denied welcome as European countries squabble over the refugee crisis.Tens of thousands of people patiently endured long lines, backpack inspections and metal-detecting checks Sunday to enter St. Peter's Square. Under a brilliant sun, they listened to Francis deliver the traditional noon Easter speech from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica.To their delight, Francis completed a whirl through the square, made colorful with sprays of tulips and other spring flowers, in his open-topped pope-mobile after celebrating Mass on the steps of the basilica. He leaned over barriers to shake hands, as the vehicle ventured past the Vatican's confines, with his bodyguards jogging alongside on the boulevard.For years, Islamist extremists in social media have listed the Vatican and Rome as potential targets due to hosting the headquarters of the Roman Catholic church and several basilicas. Despite the threats, Francis has kept to his habit of trying to be in close physical contact with ordinary people.Francis said, for the faithful, Jesus who rose after death by crucifixion \"triumphed over evil and sin.\" He expressed hope that \"will draw us closer to the victims of terrorism, that blind and brutal form of violence.\"At the end of Mass, he chatted briefly with the former king and queen of Belgium, Albert II and Paola, who attended the ceremony.In his speech, Francis cited recent attacks in Belgium, Turkey, Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Ivory Coast and Iraq.He called the message of Easter \"a message of life for all humanity.\"Easter \"invites us not to forget those men and women seeking a better future, an ever more numerous throng of migrants and refugees - including many children - fleeing from war, hunger, poverty and social injustice,\" he said.As he has done repeatedly, Francis lamented that \"all too often, these brothers and sisters of ours meet along the way with death or, in any event, rejection by those who could offer them welcome and assistance.\"Some European countries have erected barbed-wire fences and other barriers to keep out those who continue to arrive on Greek and Italian shores after risky sea voyages on smugglers' boats. Another strategy has been for some European countries to express a preference for accepting Christian refugees over Muslim ones - which would effectively rule out the vast majority of Syrian refugees.Most recently, a host of countries along Europe's main migrant route north of Greece to central Europe have simply closed their borders to refugees, stranding thousands of refugee families at different border points.Francis also decried the destruction and \"contempt for humanitarian law\" in Syria, millions of whose people have fled to Europe or to refugee camps closer to their homeland.\n\n","title":"On Easter Sunday, specter of terrorism dominates the Vatican - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"On Easter Sunday, specter of terrorism dominates the Vatican https://t.co/bBxGnP1d3A https://t.co/5FQ4NOLnFn","date":"Sun Mar 27 12:01:42 +0000 2016","favs":84,"id":{"$numberLong":"714059819213262848"},"retweets":81},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/21NgvfX"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1ac0b"},"content":"******DAMASCUS, Syria**\\- Syrian government forces backed by Russian airstrikes drove Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) fighters from Palmyra on Sunday, ending the group's reign of terror over a town whose famed 2,000-year-old ruins once drew tens of thousands of visitors each year.The victory sets the stage for the next major operation against a key ISIS stronghold in Iraq, where government and U.S. coalition forces have been preparing for months to retake Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city.Government forces had been on the offensive for nearly three weeks to try to retake the central town, known among Syrians as the \"Bride of the Desert,\" which fell to the extremists last May amid the ongoing war in Syria. Their advance marks the latest in a series of setbacks for ISIS, which has come under mounting pressure on several fronts in Iraq and Syria in recent months.A view shows the Monumental Arch in the historical city of Palmyra, Syria, August 5, 2010.Gen. Ali Mayhoub announced on state TV that that the fall of Palmyra \"directs a fatal blow to the ISIL, undermines the morale of its mercenaries, and ushers in the start of its defeat and retreat.\" He said it lays the ground for further advances toward Raqqa, the ISIS group's de facto capital, and Deir el-Zour, an eastern city it largely controls.Troops in Palmyra are now dismantling explosive booby traps planted by ISIS, the station reported. State TV and a Britain-based monitoring group later reported that troops captured a military base to the east.The advance marks a strategic and symbolic victory for the government, which has sought to portray itself as a bulwark against terrorism. The town was an important juncture on an ISIS supply line connecting its territory in central and northern Syria to the Anbar province in Iraq, where the group also holds territory.ISIS drove government forces from Palmyra in a matter of days last May and later demolished some of the best-known monuments in its UNESCO world heritage site, including two large temples dating back more than 1,800 years and a Roman triumphal archway.The extremists have destroyed a number of historical sites across their self-declared caliphate, viewing such ruins as monuments to idolatry.ISIS also demolished Palmyra's infamous Tadmur prison, where thousands of government opponents were reportedly tortured.Syrian state TV hailed the government's advance, and a local reporter spoke live from inside Palmyra, showing troops in the center of the town. Some of the nearby buildings had been reduced to rubble.Syrian Culture Minister Issam Khalil hailed the recapture of Palmyra as a \"victory for humanity and right over all projects of darkness.\" Maamoun Abdulkarim, director of the museums and antiquities department in Damascus, said Palmyra's Great Colonnade had suffered only minor damage. \"We will rebuild what you have destroyed,\" he said, addressing ISIS.The Syrian opposition, which blames the government for the country's devastating civil war and the rise of ISIS, rejected that narrative.\"The government wants through this operation to win the favor of Western nations by fighting against terrorism, while obscuring its responsibility as providing the reasons for the spread of terror,\" said Khaled Nasser, a member of the opposition coalition that has been negotiating with the government in Geneva.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict through local activists, confirmed ISIS had lost the town. Observatory chief Rami Abdurrahman said three weeks of fighting killed more than 400 ISIS fighters, as well as 180 troops and pro-government militiamen.The retaking of Palmyra plays into the larger Western narrative of ISIS losing ground despite the spectacle of terror attacks in Europe. Government and peshmerga troops in Iraq, with significant U.S. backing, are readying an operation to retake Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. Many are calling it the largest ground operation to date against the militants, as thousands of troops are expected to take part in the assault on the key city.Residents told The Associated Press that ISIS evacuated all of Palmyra's civilians to other territories under its control before government forces entered the city.Government forces have advanced on a number of fronts in recent months, aided by a Russian air campaign. Moscow announced earlier this month that it would begin drawing down its forces, but said it will continue to target ISIS and other extremist groups.Russian jets carried out 40 air sorties near Palmyra in a 24-hour period, hitting 158 targets and killing more than 100 militants, Russia's defense minister said Saturday.The government has also benefited from a U.S. and Russian-brokered cease-fire that has sharply reduced violence across the country since it took effect last month. ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front are excluded from the agreement. The truce is intended to support peace talks underway in Geneva that were adjourned last week.Syria's conflict began a little more than five years ago with mostly peaceful protests against the Assad family's four-decade rule. A fierce government crackdown and the rise of an insurgency plunged the country into a full-blown civil war that has killed more than 250,000 people.\n\n","title":"Syrian troops retake Palmyra, proclaim ISIS is dying - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Syrian troops retake ancient city of Palmyra, proclaim ISIS is dying https://t.co/vkcXmfve8R https://t.co/QDEZOgCw4x","date":"Sun Mar 27 11:31:08 +0000 2016","favs":207,"id":{"$numberLong":"714052128797552642"},"retweets":150},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/21NeHn9"}

The Chicago Tribune\nreports the illness has sickened at least 150 dogs so far.Chicago's Anti-\nCruelty Society has halted dog adoptions and temporarily shut two downtown\nadoption centers. The organization tells CBS Chicago it first detected the\nillness last week and soon had 100 sick dogs at its main facility. Officials\nwith the rescue group PAWS say they're caring for 40 to 50 dogs sick with\ncanine flu. Founder Paula Fasseas says the group treated 350 dogs during last\nyear's outbreak.The animal welfare groups think this sickness is the same\nstrain from last year. That outbreak sickened 1,700 dogs in Cook County, where\nChicago is located.Earlier this year, hundreds more pets got sick when a dog\nflu outbreak spread through western states.The virus is especially likely to\nspread at animal shelters, kennels, and doggie day care facilities where large\nnumbers of dogs gather. Experts attribute the recent increase to warmer\nweather bringing more dogs out to play.\"It has now come back around in the\nspring time when people start walking their dogs in the parks more and just\ninteracting more in general with the nice weather, the disease spreads really\neasily,\" said Collette Bradley of the Anti-Cruelty Society.Vaccines are\navailable at veterinary offices.Vets say the disease is rarely fatal, but\nowners should see a vet right away if their dog shows symptoms.\"If your dog\ndoesn't eat well, misses a meal, if you see coughing, if you see lethargy,\njust being tired, moping around, it could be a sign of a fever,\" veterinarian\nRob McMonigle told CBS News during the last outbreak. \"If you see that, give\nyour local vet a call and schedule an appointment because they'll need to get\non some special medications for it.\"\n\n","title":"Highly contagious dog flu flares up again - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Highly contagious dog flu flares up again https://t.co/euSaHFC1Ou https://t.co/sqjoOPHjg3","date":"Sun Mar 27 05:00:01 +0000 2016","favs":63,"id":{"$numberLong":"713953700335771648"},"retweets":104},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1RsOl4T"}

After a bit of a struggle getting the supply ship precisely\naligned, motorized bolts drove home to lock the Cygnus in place.Kopra and his\ncrewmates plan to open the capsule Sunday to begin the process of moving\nequipment and supplies into the station. At the same time, they will replace\nthe off-loaded cargo with trash and no-longer-needed gear. The cargo ship is\nexpected to remain attached to the station for 55 days, departing May 20.The\nCygnus is the first of three cargo ships expected to reach the station over\nthe next 15 days, a record for space station operations. A Russian Progress\nfreighter, scheduled for launch next Thursday, will reach the station on April\n2, and a SpaceX Dragon supply ship is set for launch April 8, arriving two\ndays later.British astronaut Timothy Peake, left, assists station commander\nTimothy Kopra, right, operating the lab's robot arm from the multi-window\ncupola to capture the Cygnus cargo ship.The Dragon's berthing at the Harmony\nmodule's Earth-facing port will mark the first time two U.S. cargo ships have\nbeen attached to the station at the same time, joining the Cygnus, two\nProgress freighters and a pair of Soyuz crew ferry craft. All told, the three\ncargo ships will deliver some 12 tons of supplies and equipment.The Cygnus,\nmaking Orbital ATK's fifth operational station resupply flight -- its second\nsince a catastrophic October 2014 launch failure -- is loaded with 1,713\npounds of science gear, 2,511 pounds of crew supplies, 2,442 pounds of station\nhardware and another 550 pounds of computer and spacewalk equipment.The gear\nincludes 29 small \"nano\" satellites, a 3-D printer and experiments in a\nvariety of fields, including one to study mechanical \"grippers\" that work on\nthe same principal as a gecko's sticky feet, another to spectroscopically\nstudy meteor trails from above to determine their chemical constituents and\none to learn more about how the soil of airless moons, comets and asteroids\nbehaves.One experiment will remain aboard the Cygnus and not be activated\nuntil after the spacecraft departs in May. The Spacecraft Fire Experiment, or\nSaffire, will ignite a relatively large piece of composite material to study\nhow flames propagate in the absence of gravity. The goal is to learn more\nabout fire prevention and safety in spacecraft.The actual burning will be\ncontained inside the Saffire experiment housing aboard Cygnus, but Kopra\ncalled down for additional details after the cargo ship was captured.\"We're\nsomewhat familiar with the experiment that's in Cygnus called Saffire, but we\nwanted to see if it would be possible to send up some additional technical and\nsafety information about the experiment,\" he called.\"Yes, we can put that\ntogether and get it up to you,\" Jay Marschke replied from mission control.\n\n","title":"Cargo ship brings 3.6 tons of supplies to space station - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Cargo ship brings 3.6 tons of supplies to space station https://t.co/DmW2LiyqaQ https://t.co/z8DAkbd5Im","date":"Sun Mar 27 02:30:02 +0000 2016","favs":78,"id":{"$numberLong":"713915956968357889"},"retweets":71},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1pPLxYW"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1ac0f"},"content":"Men who know they've probably been infected with the mosquito-borne Zika virus\nshould not have sex without a condom for six months, according to new federal\nhealth guidelines released Friday.Numerous cases of sexually transmitted Zika\ninfection -- which is thought to cause severe birth defects in some cases --\nhave been confirmed in the United States, said officials at the U.S. Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention.\"Mounting evidence supports a link between\nZika and microcephaly, and possibly other problems such as miscarriage,\" Dr.\nDenise Jamieson, co-lead of the Pregnancy and Birth Defects Team of the CDC's\nZika Virus Response Team, said during an afternoon news conference.\"The rate\nof these conditions is not known yet,\" she said. \"We know there is a risk, but\nit is important to remember that even in places with active Zika transmission\nwomen are delivering apparently healthy infants.\"The goal of the latest CDC\nguidelines is to give doctors the best advice possible to share with their\npatients about pregnancy planning and sex, Jamieson added. However, they are\nare based on the best evidence to date, and not on a definitive understanding\nof Zika, she noted.Zika is a mosquito-borne virus that's been tied to\nthousands of cases -- mainly in Brazil -- of a severe birth defect called\nmicrocephaly. In microcephaly, a newborn's head is smaller than normal, with\nthe potential for long-term neurological damage.While the bulk of Zika cases\nleading to microcephaly may occur via maternal infection during pregnancy,\ncases of sexual transmission from a man to his female partner have come to\nlight, the CDC said.A team led by CDC investigator Alexandra Oster notes that,\nas of March 18, there are now \"six confirmed cases of sexual transmission in\nthe United States associated with this outbreak.\"Just how long might the Zika\nvirus linger in semen? According to the report, semen collected from one man\nstill showed signs of the virus 62 days after he began to exhibit fever linked\nto Zika infection.Zika infection is usually a transient, mild illness in\nadults, and many cases may occur without symptoms, experts say. However,\nbecause of the risk to babies, the CDC is advising that men with known or\nsuspected infection with Zika refrain from sex -- or only have sex with a\ncondom -- for six months after a diagnosis.The agency also advises that, for\ncouples involving a man who has traveled to or resides in an area endemic for\nZika:The latest guidelines also recommend that women who know they've been\ninfected, have no symptoms but have recently been to a Zika-endemic area, or\nthink they might have been exposed via sex, should wait at least eight weeks\nbefore trying to get pregnant.The CDC has also advised that all pregnant women\nconsider postponing travel to any area where Zika virus transmission is\nongoing. If a pregnant woman must travel to or live in one of these areas, she\nshould talk to her health-care provider first and strictly follow steps to\nprevent mosquito bites.On Friday, CDC officials also said that 273 U.S.\nresidents in 35 states have now tested positive for infection with the Zika\nvirus.\"All are travel-related or sexually transmitted cases,\" Jamieson said.\n\"In addition, there have been 261 cases reported from Puerto Rico, 14 cases\nfrom American Samoa and 11 cases from the U.S. Virgin Islands. Of these, 99\npercent are presumed to be locally transmitted by mosquitoes in the\nterritories.\"In the majority of Zika infections, symptoms included rash (97\npercent of cases), fever and joint pain.\"Zika virus disease should be\nconsidered in patients with acute onset of fever, rash, arthralgia [joint\npain], or conjunctivitis [pink eye] who traveled to areas with ongoing Zika\nvirus transmission or who had unprotected sex with someone who traveled to one\nof those areas and developed compatible symptoms within two weeks of\nreturning,\" the CDC said.And earlier this month, scientists reported more\nevidence supporting a link between the Zika virus and microcephaly.Researchers\nnow believe that one in every 100 pregnant women infected with the virus\nduring the first trimester will give birth to a baby with the birth defect.The\nZika virus is suspected of causing an epidemic that started last spring in\nBrazil, where there have been more than 5,600 suspected or confirmed cases of\nmicrocephaly.Zika has also been linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, an immune\nsystem disorder that can occasionally lead to a fatal form of\nparalysis.Speaking earlier this month, CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden said that\n\"we are learning more about Zika every day. The link with microcephaly and\nother possibly serious birth defects is growing stronger every day. The link\nto Guillain-Barre syndrome is likely to be proven in the near future, and the\ndocumentation that sexual transmission is possible is now proven.\"First\ndiscovered in Uganda in 1947, the Zika virus wasn't thought to pose major\nhealth risks until last year, when it became clear that it posed potentially\ndevastating threats to pregnant women.Meanwhile, the virus continues to spread\nin Latin America and the Caribbean.It is not expected to pose a significant\nthreat to the U.S. mainland, federal health officials have said in the past.In\nPuerto Rico, however, the situation is \"of great concern,\" Frieden\nsaid.\"Puerto Rico is on the frontline of the battle against Zika,\" said\nFrieden, who had just returned from the island. \"And it's an uphill battle.\"By\nnext year, Frieden said, there could be hundreds of thousands of cases of Zika\nin the territory, and \"thousands of infected pregnant women.\"In a separate\nreport released Friday, the CDC stressed that effective contraception needs to\nbe made much more readily available to Puerto Ricans. In a statement, the\nagency noted that, \"approximately two-thirds of pregnancies in Puerto Rico are\nunintended, indicating a potentially unmet need for access to birth\ncontrol.\"The agency said that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\nwill boost its efforts at family planning education in Puerto Rico, so that\nwomen can help prevent unintended pregnancies -- especially those jeopardized\nby Zika infection.The Zika virus has now spread to over 38 countries and\nterritories, most in Latin America and the Caribbean. The World Health\nOrganization estimates there could be up to 4 million cases of Zika in the\nAmericas in the next year.\n\n","title":"Sexually transmitted Zika: New advice for staying safe - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Can you protect yourself from the sexually transmitted Zika virus? https://t.co/MjnayeICD5 https://t.co/ozyqX4dKWl","date":"Sun Mar 27 01:30:01 +0000 2016","favs":42,"id":{"$numberLong":"713900850532454400"},"retweets":37},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1pPL4WM"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1ac11"},"content":"Last Updated Mar 27, 2016 5:48 AM EDT**WASHINGTON --**Bernie Sanders swept\nDemocratic presidential caucuses in Alaska, Washington state and Hawaii on\nSaturday, victories he hopes will stoke a spring comeback against the\ncommanding front-runner, Hillary Clinton.The Vermont senator was trying narrow\na gap of 300 delegates won in primaries by Clinton. While Sanders faces a\nsteep climb to the nomination, a string of losses for Clinton would highlight\npersistent vulnerabilities within her own party. Sanders continues to attract\ntens of thousands to his rallies - drawing more than 17,000 in Seattle this\nweek - and has collected more than $140 million from 2 million donors.Speaking\nat a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin, before voters in Hawaii gathered\nfor their caucuses, Sanders cast his wins Saturday as part of a Western\ncomeback, citing recent victories in Utah and Idaho as a sign that his\ncampaign still had a path to the nomination.\"We just won the state of\nWashington. That is what momentum is about,\" he said. \"Don't let anybody tell\nyou we can't win the nomination or we can't win the general election. We're\ngoing to do both of those things.\"Most of his dozen primary-season wins have\nbeen in states with largely white populations and in caucus contests, which\ntend to attract the most active liberal Democrats. He's heavily favored by\nyounger voters, who were a key part of the coalition that boosted President\nObama to victory twice.In Spokane, Washington, a huge line of caucus attendees\nsnaked around a high school parking lot on Saturday morning.\"I think one of\nthe biggest things is free tuition for students,\" said Savannah Dills, 24, a\ncollege student who supports Sanders. \"And getting big money out of politics.\nHe's not paid for by billionaires.\"Retiree Dan McLay, 64, attended the caucus\nin a hard-hat, which he joked he needed because he was one of the relatively\nfew Clinton supporters in the big crowd.\"Look at this thing in Brussels,\"\nMcLay said, referring to the deadly bombings. \"We need a real experienced\nleader.\"For Sanders, turning passionate support into the party nomination has\ngrown increasingly difficult.Clinton had a delegate lead of 1,221 to 914 over\nSanders going into Saturday's contests, according to a CBS News analysis, an\nadvantage that expanded to 1,688-940 once the superdelegates, or party\nofficials who can back either candidate, were included. The number needed to\nwin the nomination is 2,383.Sanders spent several days campaigning in\nWashington state and dispatched his wife, Jane, to Alaska and Hawaii. Clinton\ncampaigned in Washington state for one day and did not send any high-profile\nsupporters to either of the other two states.Clinton has been looking past the\nprimary contests and aiming at potential Republican challengers. In\ninterviews, rallies and speeches this week, she largely focused on Tuesday's\ndeadly attacks in Brussels, casting GOP front-runner Donald Trump and Texas\nSen. Ted Cruz as unqualified to deal with complicated international\nthreats.Her campaign sees the April 19 contest in New York as an important\none, not just because of the rich delegate prize but because losing to Sanders\nin a state she represented in the Senate would be a psychological blow. She\nhopes to lock up an even larger share of delegates in five Northeastern\ncontests a week later.\n\n","title":"Bernie Sanders wins Alaska, Washington Democratic caucuses - Election 2016 - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"AP: @BernieSanders wins Democratic caucuses in Washington state: https://t.co/aEfY886G6O https://t.co/9cffmFh0UG","date":"Sat Mar 26 22:51:19 +0000 2016","favs":133,"id":{"$numberLong":"713860914127220738"},"retweets":84},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1MsrKst"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1ac18"},"content":"**NEW YORK -- **Even in an era of high-tech crime-fighting, the best line of defense against a Brussels-style attack on airports and subways has four legs and a tail.Dogs, with their exquisitely sensitive noses, have been trained in recent years to pick up the scent of explosives on people moving through crowded concourses, and so far they have proved a better early warning system than anything engineers have come up with.\"They outperform both men and machines,\" said James Waters, chief of the New York City Police Department's counterterrorism unit, which just this week graduated its latest squad of dogs capable of following the vapor from explosives such as the terrorist bomb-making material of the moment, TATP.But experts say there are not enough of these \"vapor wake\" dogs to go around. Only about 130 have gotten the patented training nationwide since its development about a decade ago. And only one dog is in Europe, according to the chief trainer.For security reasons, NYPD won't say how many of these dogs it has to cover the nation's largest subway system, with more than 400 stations and millions of riders.New York's department already has 36,000 officers, employs counterterrorism analysts, created specialized counterterror units and uses a highly sophisticated computer system linked to surveillance footage that can spot a bag sitting for too long. It also has 100 other dogs, including traditional bomb-sniffers and drug dogs.But the threat is changing -- Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) extremists are using small devices in crowded areas, as seen in the airport and subway attacks in Belgium that left 31 people dead.The NYPD's newly graduated class of eight \"vapor wake\" dogs underwent 15 months of training to sniff out explosive particles in the heat plume left by humans as they walk through a crowd, then follow the scent to the source. They're different from traditional bomb-sniffing dogs trained to smell a stationary object.A dog has 200 million olfactory sensors in its nose. By contrast, the human nose has 5 million. Even though dogs get tired and distracted, no technology can match one, officials say.One that may come close is under development at the University of Rhode Island, where professor Otto Gregory created an electronic sensor designed to continuously monitor an area, unlike a quick swab of a hand or luggage, for vapors from explosives. The sensor hasn't been deployed in any real-world scenarios yet. But one advantage is that it doesn't need training or breaks, as dogs do.\"It's an electronic trace detection system that can do and compete with a dog, and doesn't need a break. It detects 24/7,\" Gregory, a chemical engineering professor, told CBS News transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave.Gregory said that in closed spaces like airports, the sensor can detect amounts as small as 1 part per billion. He held a vial which contained trace amounts of TATP, and within seconds the computer graph spiked, alerting to the presence of the explosive.![van-cleave.png](http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/03/23/a4d0682f-11d2-4078-8a3c-11085e900a2a/thumbnail/620x350/68c98441a5d1594e6bd30efbba89c9f3/van-cleave.png)\n\nProfessor Gregory demonstrates how the TATP detection device works\n\nCBS News\n\nThe device will enter real-world testing later this year. The goal to get it\ndown to the size of a smartphone so it could be put on things like a\nturnstile, or worn by an officer.\"We would like to get it out there\nyesterday,\" Gregory said.Other animals with sophisticated olfactory ability\ncould theoretically be used, including elephants and even rats. But the\ncanine's special social relationship with humans makes it uniquely\nsuitable.Dog trainers generally say Labrador retrievers are best because they\nare social and not aggressive. Spaniels, German pointers and other breeds are\nalso used.\"They have an incredible capability for the detection of hazardous\nchemicals. But even the canine, we look at it as a technology, and over the\nyears the instrumentation has advanced, the proactive nature of dogs has\nadvanced and is still advancing,\" said Paul Waggoner of Auburn University's\nveterinary school, which pioneered the vapor wake training.Because of the\nrising threat of suicide bombings, demand for the dogs has outstripped supply.\nSince January, there have been orders for 36 more, said Paul Hammond of AMK9,\nthe security firm that works with Auburn to train the animals.They cost about\n$49,000 each and are licensed for a year, after which they are retrained to\naccount for terrorists' changing tactics.Hammond said the demand isn't just\nfrom law enforcement agencies but from major sports teams and theme parks\nlooking for a way to search large crowds safely.\"The threat is changing and\nthese animals are really at the forefront of detection,\" he said.\n\n","title":"​Dogs may be the best line of defense against subway attacks - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Calling all canines!

Cheffou is\ndescribed as a local activist known to police for trying to rally asylum-\nseekers and homeless people to radical Islam.Prosecutors would not confirm the\nBelgian media reports. A police raid was conducted at his home but no arms or\nexplosives were found, they said.Two other suspects detained on Thursday and\nidentified as Raba N. and Aboubakar A. were charged with \"involvement in the\nactivities of a terrorist group.\" In addition, a man named as Abderamane A.\nwho was taken into custody on Friday after he was shot by police at a Brussels\ntram stop is being held for at least 24 more hours.The suicide bombings during\nTuesday's peak morning travel time at the Brussels Airport and a city subway\nstation killed 31 people, officials confirmed Saturday. That toll is likely to\nrise as some body parts have still not been identified, they said.Brussels\nprosecutor Ine Van Wymersch told The Associated Press that 24 of the victims\nhave now been identified and 11 of them were foreigners. One was a former\nBelgian ambassador to the United States, Andre Adam.Of the 270 wounded, 93 are\nbeing treated at a Brussels military hospital. A doctor there said Saturday\nthat 15 people are in a serious burns unit, five of them in intensive care.Dr.\nSerge Jennes said he had treated similar injuries during his service in\nKandahar, in southern Afghanistan, but said he and his colleagues were shocked\nto see such injuries on women and children.\"I've never seen this before in my\n20 years at the center for burns,\" Jennes said. \"Injuries linked to the blow-\nback from the blast, which can mutilate.\"He said almost all the wounded had\nburst eardrums and added that his colleagues are likely to need psychological\ncounselling to help cope with what they had witnessed.Two injured women are\nseen in the main Brussels airport after two explosions, March 22, 2016.In a\nsign of the tensions in the Belgian capital and the way security services are\nstretched across the country, Belgium's interior minister appealed to\nresidents not to march Sunday in Brussels in solidarity with the victims.\"We\nunderstand fully the emotions,\" Interior Minister Jan Jambon told reporters.\n\"We understand that everyone wants to express these feelings.\"But, he said,\n\"we invite the citizens not to have this demonstration.\"Organizers quickly\ngranted his request, postponing the march.Brussels airport officials,\nmeanwhile, began to assess the damage caused by twin explosions at the\nZaventem airport departure terminal.Authorities have wrapped up their\ninvestigation of the crime scene at the airport, and engineers were let in to\ncheck the building's structural safety and information technology systems -\nand to see whether any damage can be repaired quickly.Brussels Airport, which\nhandles 23.5 million passengers annually, said it would be Tuesday at the\nearliest before flights resume. About 600 flights a day are being canceled or\ndiverted.The transport disruptions will do little to ease the worries of\njittery Europeans, who are wondering how many violent extremists remain at\nlarge, and where and when they might strike again.Brothers Khalid and Ibrahim\nBakraoui, suspects linked to the Brussels terrorist attacks, are pictured on a\nnewspaper front page in Brussels, March 18, 2016.Two brothers who died as\nsuicide bombers in the attacks were known to police as petty criminals and\npotential terrorists, CBS News correspondent Allen Pizzey reports.Ibrahim El\nBakraoui, who blew himself up in the airport, had been arrested and deported\nfrom Turkey and labelled a \"foreign terrorist fighter,\" Pizzey reports.

Cataracts can be removed but they remain the\nleading cause of blindness worldwide.The new study included more than 1,000\npairs of 60-year-old British female twins. The researchers found that those\nwho took in high amounts of vitamin C in their diet had a one-third lower risk\nof cataract over 10 years.Getting vitamin C via a supplement did not appear to\nreduce the risk, the investigators found.The study is the first to show that\ndiet and lifestyle may play a more important role than genetics in cataract\ndevelopment and severity, according to the researchers.Based on the findings,\nHammond's team now believes that a person's genetics probably account for 35\npercent of the risk of cataract progression, while diet and other\nenvironmental factors may account for the other 65 percent.However, it's\nimportant to note that this study can only show associations; it cannot prove\na cause-and-effect relationship between dietary vitamin C and cataracts.\"The\nmost important finding was that vitamin C intake from food seemed to protect\nagainst cataract progression,\" said Hammond, who is professor of ophthalmology\nat Kings College London.Vitamin C's strength as an antioxidant may explain how\nit reduces the risk of cataract progression, his team explained. The fluid\ninside the eye is normally high in vitamin C, which helps prevent oxidation\nthat leads to clouding of the eye lens. A vitamin C-rich diet may boost the\namount of the vitamin in the eye fluid, providing extra protection against\ncataract.Dr. Mark Fromer is an ophthalmologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New\nYork City. He said that \"the finding that vitamin C intake can retard cataract\nformation is a new finding that changes the way we think of cataract\nformation.\"Now, doctors have a new understanding that \"diet clearly is\nimportant in slowing the progression of cataracts, the most blinding form of\neye disease worldwide,\" Fromer said.Another expert agreed.\"This is a well-\ndesigned, prospective study that confirms what ophthalmologists have always\nsuspected -- that a well-balanced diet that includes foods that give us a\nboost of antioxidants is critical to preventing damage and the aging of our\neyes,\" said Dr. Carolyn Shih, director of research in ophthalmology at\nNorthwell Health in Great Neck, N.Y.\"As we approach the spring and summer,\neating foods high in vitamin C -- such as kale, broccoli, papaya, citrus\nfruits and strawberries -- is as essential as using sunglasses to prevent\ncataracts as we age,\" she added.\n\n","title":"This vitamin could help protect your eyes against cataracts - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"This vitamin could help protect your eyes against cataracts: https://t.co/cdXoG0vfrH https://t.co/IDATgqgbUi","date":"Sat Mar 26 08:19:01 +0000 2016","favs":65,"id":{"$numberLong":"713641391138738176"},"retweets":72},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1pN2N12"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1ac1f"},"content":"******SALT LAKE CITY --** Utah prosecutors moved to drop domestic violence charges against Olympic gold-medal skier Picabo Street after she was accused of throwing her father down the stairs and locking him in the basement of her home.Street faced misdemeanor domestic violence and assault charges after the fight with her 76-year-old father near Park City. Her lawyer contends that she was defending herself during the Dec. 23 incident.Prosecutors said in court documents filed Thursday that they have learned of additional witness statements that led them to believe the case should not be handled in court. Instead, they recommend it be sent to a state office that investigates abuse of elder and vulnerable adults.A judge has not yet signed off on the move. Street had turned down a plea deal, and a trial had been scheduled for May.Court records did not include any details about the witness statements.Phone messages left with prosecutor Ivy Telles and Street's attorney, Joe Wrona, were not immediately returned Friday.Nels Holmgren, the director of Utah's Division of Aging and Adult Services, said he could not comment on specific cases but that his division had not been involved in the Street case.Generally, when allegations of elder abuse are reported to the division, investigators will assess the person's situation and try to connect them with services they may need or law enforcement, who would remove them from a home, Holmgren said.Prosecutors said Street started the December fight that left cuts on Roland Street's elbow and neck. He told police that his daughter started yelling after he hit her house with his car while trying to drive away in snowy weather and that a physical fight broke out after they went back inside.Roland Street has not been charged. His daughter told 911 dispatchers that she \"put\" her dad down the stairs after he pulled her hair and scratched her face, according to a recording of the call. Her mother can be heard in the background disputing that description.Picabo Street cares for her aging parents as well as her children, her defense attorney said. Street was the one who called 911 for help the day of the fight, Wrona said.The skier has remained free on bail.Street had a celebrated skiing career punctuated by a gold medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, in the women's super-G event. She also won silver in the downhill at the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, and competed in the 2002 Games in Salt Lake City.She worked as an analyst for Fox Sports during the 2014 Winter Games from Sochi, Russia.\n\n","title":"Prosecutors move to drop charges against skier Picabo Street - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Prosecutors move to drop domestic violence charges against Olympic gold-medal skier https://t.co/20pc4OFCqe https://t.co/g3JboAc3ua","date":"Sat Mar 26 02:31:01 +0000 2016","favs":41,"id":{"$numberLong":"713553815191031808"},"retweets":28},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1MHtQiQ"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1ac20"},"content":"Will Trump 2.0 ever show up?Donald Trump, for all his theatrics, has\nrepeatedly hinted that at some point he'd tone down the rhetoric and begin to\nact like a more traditional candidate. \"Once you get to a certain level, it\nchanges,\" he told Greta van Susteren last month about his speaking style and\napproach to campaigning. \"I will be changing very rapidly.\" On CBS News' \"Face\nthe Nation,\" he told host John Dickerson that President would be a \"much\ndifferent person\" than candidate Trump.We've seen glimpses of a more\npresidential -- or at least less purposefully off-putting -- Trump as recently\nas his scripted AIPAC speech earlier this week. We also saw it at the last\nRepublican debate, where he mostly refrained from childish taunts.We've seen\nthis before, too, at various times this cycle, most notably as voting got\nunderway for the first three contests, when he seemed to show some restraint.\n\"Watch his latest interviews and you'll see someone becoming a better\npolitician -- shifting and moving the pieces around him with a greater degree\nof knowledge of the terrain,\" the conservative writer Ben Domenech said on the\neve of the Iowa caucus. \"This is what should really scare Republican elites:\nIt's learning.\"Yet Trump 2.0, a candidate who would keep much of his essential\nweirdness and entertainment value but tones down the cruelty and vulgarity,\nnever really materializes. Just days after that AIPAC speech, which went as\nwell as it could have possibly gone for the front-runner, he's once again out\nthere saying and doing things that would disqualify any normal candidate in\nany normal year. There was the renewed, seemingly out-of-nowhere Twitter\nassault on Megyn Kelly, which was followed by a rambling interview with the\nWashington Post editorial board where he kept talking about the size of his\nhands. Then, of course, there were the vicious attacks on Ted Cruz's wife,\nHeidi, and her appearance. The argument could be made that all this is\nworking: Trump is, after all, still the odds-on favorite to win the\nnomination. But it's practically unheard of in modern times for a Republican\nfront-runner to not have completely crushed his rivals at this point in the\ncalendar: Bob Dole, George W. Bush, and John McCain were all but their parties\npresumptive nominees by the end of March in their cycles (Romney took until\nthe end of May to clinch the nomination, the Wall Street Journal points out,\nthough his nomination never really seemed to be in doubt) and in each case the\nparty had begun to coalesce around them. Trump, meanwhile, can't get to 50\npercent of the Republican vote in any of the states he's competed in. And\nthat's not all. Despite Trump's delegate lead, all of his congressional\nendorsements, with the exception of Sen. Jeff Sessions, have come from a\nhandful of backbenchers. It shouldn't be news when Republican lawmakers say\nthey'll definitely support the party's nominee come November, but it is when\nthey say that about Trump. His promises of dealmaking and endless winning have\ndone little to win them over, it seems.This will prove to be a major problem\ngoing forward for Trump, because every time a Republican demurs when asked\nabout supporting the GOP candidate in the general election, the more likely it\nlooks like the party will be routed in the general election if he's the\nnominee. This, in turn, makes fewer Republicans say they support him, and\nwe've come full circle.And we're not just talking about Republican electeds\nand insiders, either: exit polls indicate an astonishingly high number of\nRepublican voters, some 37 percent, say they might go third party if he's the\nnominee. Why? There's some evidence to suggest many voters just don't trust\nhim. The violence at his rallies has drawn their attention, and while it's\ntrue that 80 percent of his supporters approve of the way he's handled the\nuproar, only 50 percent of GOP voters approve, and two in three of all voters\ndisapprove, according to a CBS News/New York Times poll released this\nweek.Moreover, in a week in which a U.S. ally was dealing with the aftermath\nof a terrorist attack that killed over 30 people and injured over a hundred,\nTrump has spent a couple of days in a cheap fight over the relative\nattractiveness of the wife of his chief opponent.We've finally reached the\npoint, it would seem, where Trump's theatrics are backfiring. Yes, I realize\nthat almost every pundit has written some variation of that sentence in the\nlast nine months and come to regret it. And I'm not saying that he won't be\nthe Republican nominee, or even the next president. But if he ever had a\nchance to unite a substantial majority of the party behind him going into the\ngeneral election, he may have squandered it. Maybe he can't help himself. At\nthe age of 69, he could just be set in his ways as a showman to do anything to\nget his much attention for himself as possible, consequences be damned. Or\nmaybe he thought Trump 2.0 would be an unnecessary creation -- he's still\nwinning, so why change? Whatever the reason, he's hasn't offered enough\nevidence to buttress the argument, which his surrogates and sympathizers now\npush, both on- and off-the record, that the Real Donald has the judgment to to\nbe commander-in-chief. Instead, he's kept the freak show going long after it\nshould have been dropped, or at least re-tooled into something more palatable\nto voters outside his base of support. And that's a shame, if only because\nafter months of putting up with the chaos and the bugs in this version,\nAmericans are ready and waiting for the rollout of Trump 2.0.\n\n","title":"Will Donald Trump ever seem \"presidential\"? - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"When is Trump 2.0 going to show up? https://t.co/hYyX34cDLv https://t.co/GsYiYyf1dg","date":"Sat Mar 26 02:00:01 +0000 2016","favs":30,"id":{"$numberLong":"713546014402158592"},"retweets":20},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1pN8EU2"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013513dea3b36d3ac1ac21"},"content":"**NEW ORLEANS **\\-- Backlash against a plan to remove prominent Confederate monuments in New Orleans has been tinged by death threats, intimidation and even what may have been the torching of a contractor's Lamborghini.For now, at least, things have gotten so nasty the city hasn't found a contractor willing to bear the risk of tearing down the monuments. The city doesn't have its own equipment to move them and is now in talks to find a company, even discussing doing the work at night to avoid further tumult.Initially, it appeared the monuments would be removed quickly after the majority black City Council on Dec. 17 voted 6-1 to approve the mayor's plan to take them down. The monuments, including towering figures of Gens. Robert E. Lee and P.G.T. Beauregard, have long been viewed by many here as symbols of racism and white supremacy.The backlash is not surprising to Bill Quigley, a Loyola University law professor and longtime civil rights activist in New Orleans who's worked on behalf of a group demanding the monuments come down.The South has seen such resistance before, during fights over school integration and efforts in the early 1990s to racially integrate Carnival parades in New Orleans.\"Fighting in the courts, fighting in the legislature, anonymous intimidation,\" Quigley said. \"These are from the same deck of cards that are used to stop all social change.\"For all its reputation as a party city of fun and frolic, New Orleans is no stranger to social change and the tensions that come with it. It was the site of an early attempt to challenge racial segregation laws in the Plessy vs. Ferguson case and home to then-6-year-old Ruby Bridges whose battle to integrate her elementary school was immortalized in a Norman Rockwell painting.New Orleans is a majority African-American city although the number of black residents has fallen since 2005's Hurricane Katrina drove many people from the city. Mayor Mitch Landrieu, who proposed the monuments' removal, rode to victory twice with overwhelming support from the city's black residents.Nationally, the debate over Confederate symbols has become heated since nine parishioners were killed at a black church in South Carolina in June. South Carolina removed the Confederate flag from its statehouse grounds in the weeks after, and several Southern cities have since considered removing monuments.\"There is no doubt that there is a huge amount of rage over the attack on Confederate symbols,\" said Mark Potok with the Southern Poverty Law Center, an Alabama-based group that tracks extremist activity.His group counted about 360 pro-Confederate battle flag rallies across the nation in the six months after the church shootings. Such rallies were rare before then, he said.In New Orleans, things have turned particularly ugly.In early January, as it beat back legal challenges seeking to stop the removal, the city hired a contractor to remove the monuments.But H\u0026amp;O Investments LLC. of Baton Rouge soon pulled out of the job, citing death threats, \"unkindly name-calling,\" outrage on social media and the threat of other businesses canceling contracts.One day, several protesters came while H\u0026amp;O workers took measurements. Some of the protesters wore materials \"with affiliation to white supremacy groups,\" said Roy Maughan Jr., a lawyer for the contractor.That same day, Maughan said, \"a specific articulated threat\" was phoned into city authorities warning workers at the monuments to leave for their safety. On Jan. 12, H\u0026amp;O sent the city a letter saying it was dropping out.Then, on Jan. 19, a Lamborghini belonging to the owner of H\u0026amp;O Investments was set on fire. The sports car was parked outside his office near Baton Rouge, Maughan said.A national rental crane company the city had hoped to hire also refused to be involved.The FBI and local fire investigators declined to comment. No arrests have been made.After H\u0026amp;O withdrew, the city opened a public bid process to find a new contractor - and things got messy again.When the names of companies interested in the work turned up on a city website, businesses were reportedly slammed with emails and telephone calls denouncing their involvement. The protest was organized at least in part by Save Our Circle, a group touting thousands of supporters who want a massive monument to Lee in Lee Circle preserved in the spot where it has stood since 1884.The city closed public viewing to the bidding process and has met with contractors without disclosing their names. The mayor declined requests for an interview.Michel-Antoine Goitia-Nicolas said his reasons for supporting boycotts, making calls and joining protests on behalf of the monuments are personal: He traces his ancestry to Beauregard, a Louisiana native who led Rebel troops at the opening of the Civil War. A prominent equestrian statue of Beauregard at the entrance to City Park is slated to be taken down.\"It's totally divided this city,\" Goitia-Nicolas said of the city's plans.Standing next to the Beauregard statue, Goitia-Nicolas said he was willing to chain himself to statues to stop the removal.\"Our lesson in history is that when we tear down the monuments of the past we rebuild the errors of our past,\" he said. He said he was proud of Beauregard, who he said \"never owned slaves.\"\"Why take it down? Put a statue of somebody positive in black history right here, in the midst of Beauregard, or in the midst of Lee. We support that.\"Just this month, a state lawmaker began pushing a bill meant to save the monuments. Legal challenges, too, are on appeal.\"With this city, the way things go, it might not come down,\" Lisa Huber, a 39-year-old greenhouse gardener, said as she pondered the statue of Lee atop a 60-foot-high marble column, standing in his Confederate uniform with his arms crossed, staring down the North.\"I think it should come down, just because of the symbolism behind it.\"\n\n","title":"Confederate symbols' removal in New Orleans: Death threats, intimation, possible car torching - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Removal of Confederate symbols faces backlash in New Orleans https://t.co/2JSAt2EKXl https://t.co/HlOZPnncHF","date":"Sat Mar 26 01:21:01 +0000 2016","favs":60,"id":{"$numberLong":"713536199378538498"},"retweets":65},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1MHtiJX"}

We're talking about\nType 2 diabetes and that was something I was diagnosed with over 25 years ago,\nand so I've been managing this disease for a long, long time. This is one of\nthose diseases that has a real stigma to it because people judge that\npopulation as being lazy and out of shape and not taking care of themselves.\nWhen you talk to that population, they struggle with feeling judged, so I\nwelcome the opportunity to deal with all of that.**Tell me about how it's been\nfor you to live with Type 2 diabetes.**A lot of people didn't know what was\ngoing on with me. There are 28 million people in America that are diagnosed\nwith Type 2 diabetes and another 86 million that are estimated to be at risk.\nThat number is probably way low. I was one of those people that didn't know I\nhad it. When I went to the doctor, it was because I was really having trouble\nlosing weight no matter what I did, and I was having huge fluctuations in\nenergy. They said you have Type 2 diabetes and your blood sugar is really out\nof control. I was not at all happy to be told I had a disease, but on the\nother hand, I was glad to finally have an answer. **What is the project you're\nworking on to raise awareness about Type 2 diabetes? **AstraZeneca was really\ninterested in working with me to talk about dealing with how to manage\ndiabetes because I deal with the psychological aspects of it. The disease is\nnot curable and it's not going away, so I'm going to focus on what now? What\ndo you do with it now? They were completely willing and interested to say,\n\"Let's be responsible corporate citizens and help people understand how to\nmanage this,\" so we did this really exciting campaign called the On It\ncampaign. It lives on OnItMovement.com, and I have put together six steps that\nI think cut across managing the disease for all Type 2 diabetes.The six steps\nare very doable. You don't have to be rich or have every resource at your\nfingertips. The first is what I talked about before: Move forward and get past\nthe shame and judgment about Type 2 diabetes because it's not your fault. Get\neducated and understand what this disease is all about. There's lots more info\non the website. **You're known for covering health on your show. Why did you\nwait until now to talk more openly about your struggle with diabetes? **I've\ntalked about it before, but I never focused on it. Frankly, I should have. I\nnever put together and organized a plan or call to action for people. I should\nhave. I just wasn't putting enough emphasis on it, but I am now and I'm glad\nthat I am. **You have an app, Doctor on Demand. How do people use it? **It's a\ntelemedicine app. It's something that allows you to use your smartphone,\nlaptop or desktop to get information with a board-certified physician, usually\nwith the wait time of under 45 seconds. You don't have to sit in a waiting\nroom where everybody's sick -- if you weren't sick, you'll get sick before you\nleave -- and it's been an amazing, disruptive force in medicine. It's a highly\nefficient way to get healthcare and I suspect the more you accessible you make\nhealthcare, the more you'll see a dent in these 86 million people who are at\nrisk for diabetes.\n\n","title":"Dr. Phil on Type 2 diabetes: I should have talked about it before - CBS News","twitter":{"body":"Dr. Phil on Type 2 diabetes: \"This is one of those diseases that has a real stigma to it...\" https://t.co/5OWeJZxA02 https://t.co/KRCNLgn1CV","date":"Sat Mar 26 00:31:01 +0000 2016","favs":37,"id":{"$numberLong":"713523615950626818"},"retweets":34},"topic":"all","source":"CBSNews","link":"http://cbsn.ws/1pN7FDk"}
