In terms of\npropriety, pot fans have pointed out that nearby Coors Field, the home of\nMLB’s Colorado Rockies, bears the name of a beer, although it’s also the name\nof the prominent Coors family of Golden, Colorado.Colorado was the first state\nto unveil a regulated recreational-marijuana market for adults 21 and over\nafter voters approved a legalization measure on the November 2012 ballot.\n\n","title":"Colorado marijuana company seeks naming rights for Denver Broncos' Mile High Stadium - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Colorado marijuana company seeks naming rights for Denver Broncos’ Mile High Stadium https://t.co/2aYzTeYtHe https://t.co/zlJGpeIALU","date":"Sat Apr 02 20:41:27 +0000 2016","favs":5,"id":{"$numberLong":"716364946074894338"},"retweets":16},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/1VkuWI8"}

(AP) - A federal judge cleared the way for the Navajo Nation\nto seek potentially millions of dollars in its 2012 lawsuit over Urban\nOutfitters‘ use of the “Navajo” name in clothing, jewelry and other\nmerchandise.The tribe did not unreasonably delay a trademark infringement\nchallenge against the clothing retailer, U.S. District Judge Bruce Black in\nNew Mexico ruled Thursday.Urban Outfitters Inc. had claimed the tribe knew or\nshould have known that the name had been used in items such as necklaces,\njackets and underwear for years and delayed filing a lawsuit, prejudicing the\ncompany. The retailer started using the “Navajo” descriptor in 2001, according\nto court documents.There was no evidence anyone legally associated with the\nNavajo Nation knew the retailer used the tribe’s trademarks until June 2011,\nBlack said. The tribe sent a cease and desist letter to Urban Outfitters and\nfollowed up with the lawsuit.“We’re happy with the ruling and hope to resolve\nthe matter expeditiously for the benefit of the Navajo people,” Paul Spruhan,\nan attorney for the tribe, said Friday.Court documents do not quantify the\namount the Navajo Nation could recover if it’s successful in its lawsuit, but\nit could amount to millions of dollars dating to 2008.On some claims, the\ntribe wants all the profits generated from the Navajo-themed sales. On others,\nit wants $1,000 per day per item, or three times the profit generated by\nmarketing and retail of products using the name.Lindsay DeMoss, one of a\nhandful of attorneys listed for Urban Outfitters, declined to comment. The\ncompany had said in court documents that granting the tribe a monetary\nwindfall for a situation it created with unexplained silence “would be\ninequitable and unjust.”Black’s ruling applies to Urban Outfitters and one of\nits subsidiaries, Anthropologie. The judge held off on determining whether it\nalso applies to subsidiary Free People LLC until a company representative\ncould be interviewed.The tribe’s lawsuit alleges violations of federal and\nstate trademark laws, including the Indian Arts and Crafts Act, which makes it\nillegal to sell arts or crafts in a way to falsely suggest they are made by\nAmerican Indians.Urban Outfitters says “Navajo” is a generic term for a style\nor design.\n\n","title":"Tribe can seek potentially millions from Urban Outfitters - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Judge allows Navajo Nation lawsuit against Urban Outfitters https://t.co/wnFpnajRY5","date":"Fri Apr 01 21:09:30 +0000 2016","favs":2,"id":{"$numberLong":"716009620020535297"},"retweets":8},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/1RuyUwI"}

Eventually a deal was struck with Time Inc., which, under its\nchairman, Joe Ripp, was busy reinventing itself after being spun off as a\npublicly traded company in 2014.“I thank the This Old House team for their\nhard work and commitment to Time Inc. over many years.

We’re looking\nto acquire this brand for what it is, not for how we can change it. We think\nwe can add to it, but the core of it is working very well.”Scott Omelianuk,\ntop editor of This Old House magazine the past dozen years, has decided not to\nmake the transition and is pursuing a new opportunity in the TV realm.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e34"},"content":"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday expanded its recommended\nuse of the abortion drug mifepristone, drawing criticism from pro-life\nadvocates who say it is harmful for women and their unborn babies, who may now\nbe chemically aborted up to 10 weeks into pregnancy.Mifepristone is combined\nwith the drug misoprostol to induce an abortion. The FDA’s March 30 policy\nchange will allow the drug to be used up to 10 weeks into pregnancy instead of\nseven.“The FDA has bowed to pressure from drug companies and abortion\nadvocates, but the ones who will feel the deplorable effects of this change\nwill be the women sent home to endure a painful and shocking process by\nthemselves and of course their babies,” Dr. Grazie Pozo Christie, a physician\nand advisory board member with The Catholic Association, said March 31.Maureen\nFerguson, senior policy adviser at The Catholic Association, also criticized\nthe determination.“Anyone who approves of the FDA’s decision to extend at-home\nmedical abortions up to 10 weeks of pregnancy should consult WebMD’s\ndescription of the 10 week old baby a woman will encounter as the abortion\nproceeds,” she said.That description reads: “Your baby is still small but\nlooks and acts like a baby. Arms and legs are longer and can bend at the\nelbows and knees.”Abortion providers and pro-abortion rights advocates\nwelcomed the FDA decision.Opponents of the drug cited the FDA’s summary of its\nreported adverse effects. Between September 2000 and April 2011, 14 women died\nfrom the drug, more than 600 were hospitalized, and 58 women had ectopic\npregnancies because of it.The Guttmacher Institute, a research center with\nhistorical connections to abortion provider Planned Parenthood, has estimated\nthat medication-induced abortions made up as much as 25 percent of all\nabortions in 2011.The new instructions also allow lower dosages (200mg rather\nthan 600mg) and fewer doctor visits (two rather than three) for women who use\nthe drug, the New York Times reports. It has been suggested that the lower\ndose may have fewer side effects.In recent years, doctors who prescribed the\nabortion drug often did not follow the FDA’s instructions for it, saying new\nevidence justified “off-label” use. Some states have passed laws requiring\ndoctors to prescribe the drug according to the FDA label instructions.U.S.\nRep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) strongly criticized the decision.“Not only is\nmifepristone used to kill babies, it is a poison that has harmed and even\nkilled women,” he said. He charged that the decision would put the health and\nlives of women and children at risk.“At the behest of the abortion industry,\nthe Obama Administration has extended the use of the drug to 10 weeks of\npregnancy,” he said March 30.“Abortion advocates today are celebrating FDA’s\nexpansion of ‘medication abortion,’ but women who have suffered the trauma of\na mifepristone abortion know that it is not ‘medication’– this chemical poison\nis not designed to heal, or cure, or mitigate pain.”  \n  \n_Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"FDA abortion-pill expansion targets babies up to 10 weeks into pregnancy - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#FDA expands #abortion pill to allow up to 10 weeks https://t.co/Nq9KtAEsuP #mifepristone https://t.co/Nq9KtAEsuP #AbortionPillAccess","date":"Fri Apr 01 18:38:05 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"715971511711096834"},"retweets":11},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/U37MZZ"}

By doing so, the cost of the program will increase by 50 percent, without any efforts to reduce spending elsewhere, or clamp down on the program’s waste, fraud and abuse.“Failing a major change in direction, the FCC is preparing to massively expand the size and scope of the Lifeline Program without the necessary inclusion of a hard budget or financial constraints,” conservative FCC Commissioner Michael O’Reilly wrote in his blog on the commission’s website.“Such irresponsible action will balloon a program plagued by waste, fraud, and abuse and result in higher phone bills for every American — including those already struggling in the current economy. In sum, it’s a recipe for disaster, and I can’t and won’t be part of it,” he said.The Lifeline program currently, is rife with waste, fraud and abuse.“The typical Lifeline subsidy is $9.25 per month,” Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai, explained in the National Review. “But those who live on lands designated as ‘tribal’ receive $34.25 per month, whether or not they are Native Americans. You might not think that this is a big deal, but here’s the rub. The FCC currently treats virtually all of Oklahoma as tribal land. So, for example, a non–Native American living in Tulsa is eligible for $300 more per year in phone subsidies than a low-income person in East Los Angeles or Appalachia.”Politico reported the Republican commissioners were close to striking a deal with the democratic controlled FCC to cap the program’s spending at $2 billion and include reforms. However, at the last minute Democratic Commissioner Mignon Clyburn backed out due to political pressuring. The new program passed 3-2 on partisan lines.Ms. Dowery must be thrilled.\n\n","title":"Obamaphone expands to Obama-Internet, with little thought of cost, abuse - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"WATER COOLER: #Obamaphone expands to Obama-Internet, with little thought of cost, abuse https://t.co/Wn0n2Q9r6P","date":"Fri Apr 01 18:32:09 +0000 2016","favs":4,"id":{"$numberLong":"715970021151940608"},"retweets":13},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/GeIu7p"}

A resulting workaround used by by websites, including Reddit, is the\nwarrant canary, or notice that specifically states that a company has not\nreceived any NSLs.In its 2014 transparency report, Reddit noted the site\n“never received a National Security Letter, an order under the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act or any other classified request for user\ninformation” as of January 2015.Reddit published its latest transparency\nreport Thursday, and the absence of the canary this time around quickly\nspawned speculation that an NSL has been served to the website since its last\nreport was released.“I’ve been advised not to say anything one way or the\nother,” a Reddit administrator named “spez” wrote in a post Thursday. “Even\nwith the canaries, we’re treading a fine line.”In its transparency report,\nReddit notes that its policy is to notify users “to the extent legally\npermissible” in the event their data is sought by investigators.The Electronic\nFrontier Foundation, a digital-rights group, reports that over 300,000 NSLs\nhave been issued during the last decade, with more than 56,000 issued in 2004\nalone.\n\n","title":"Reddit's removal of 'warrant canary' raises suspicions of national security probe - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Reddit's removal of 'warrant canary' raises suspicions of national security probe https://t.co/JKi2ZP2ElB","date":"Fri Apr 01 17:37:39 +0000 2016","favs":5,"id":{"$numberLong":"715956304657965056"},"retweets":6},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/1N0LaPX"}

Instead, programming is focused exclusively\non guns and related products.“We’re filling a need for manufacturers who have\nbeen selling their products the same way, primarily through print,” said GunTV\nfounder Valerie Castle.Unlike traditional home-shopping channels however,\nconsumers won’t receive any purchased firearms through direct mail. Instead\nproducts will be shipped to federal firearms licensees - specifically gun\nstores that GunTV has vetted - in a city chosen by the buyer. Background\nchecks and other paperwork will be completed at the brick-and-mortar gun\nstore, which Ms. Castle said will profit from the sale of the firearm just as\nif a customer walked in off the street.Rather than profiting directly from the\nsales of firearms, GunTV, which Ms. Castle said was privately funded by four\nindividual investors, hopes to make a profit off the hour-long sales segments\npaid for by the various gun manufacturers whose products will be featured.In\none segment shown during the premiere launch, rodeo competitor Carly\nTwisselman made the sales pitch for a Taurus 9mm pistol.Describing herself as\na firearms owner familiar with primarily rifles and shotguns, Ms. Twisselman\nraved about how little the pistol weighed as she handled it in studio.“It’s\nnice, sleek and lightweight, and something you can trust,” she said.Additional\nsegments show Ms. Twisselman clad in black at an outdoor range shooting\ntargets with the gun.“It was a lot of fun,” she said. “If I can do it then you\ncan do it.”GunTV had initially been scheduled to air in January, but final\ntouches including the finalization of vendor agreements and obtaining\ninsurance delayed the start date.“Any time we are contracting outside the\nfirearms industry, for liability insurance, has been a hugely challenging task\nfor us because of the nature of the content,” Ms. Castle said. “It just took\nexponentially longer.”The announcement of GunTV’s launch initially made waves\nin the wake of December’s terrorist-inspired mass shooting in San Bernardino,\nCalifornia - located approximately 50 miles from the Thousand Palms,\nCalifornia television studio where the channel films its segments.Ms. Castle\nacknowledged a channel devoted to firearms “is an emotional issue for people”\nbut she noted that each hour segment will have public service announcements\ndedicated to gun safety and that hosts will also stress safety throughout the\nsegments.“Our programming speaks for itself and they can witness the\ncontributions that we are making to the conversation,” she said._Story\nContinues →_\n\n","title":"GunTV aims to spread firearms knowledge in an 'entertaining, convenient format' - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"GunTV aims to spread firearms knowledge in an ‘entertaining, convenient format’ https://t.co/47RiXWMtKZ","date":"Fri Apr 01 17:10:17 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"715949419628269568"},"retweets":4},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/1/guntv-aims-spread-firearms-knowledge-entertaining-/"}

To be eligible for the monthlong pilot program,\nparticipants must be able to work in the U.S and successfully pass a security\ncheck sanctioned by the Defense Department.“In addition, successful\nparticipants who submit qualifying vulnerability reports will undergo a basic\ncriminal background screening to ensure taxpayer dollars are spent wisely,”\nthe Pentagon’s press office said.Details regarding what the screening process\nentails will be communicated to potential participants before they can submit\ntheir bugs, the Pentagon said. Individuals who opt out can still participate —\nalbeit without being eligible for a piece of the $150,000 pie that the\nPentagon will hand out to hackers.Security experts were quick to call out the\nPentagon for essentially opening up the bounty program only to individuals who\ncan pass a background test — not necessarily an easy feat, especially for\nhackers who often skirt the fine line between legal and unlawful when looking\nfor vulnerabilities.“Luckily, all the hackers who can’t pass a background\ncheck will stop hacking the Pentagon because they want to follow the rules,”\nquipped Charlie Miller, a former global network exploitation analyst at the\nNational Security Agency who now researches computer security for ride-share\nstart-up Uber.The federal government has had its fair share of problems in the\npast attempting to recruit highly-skilled hackers, and FBI Director James\nComey went as far as to suggest during a 2014 interview that the bureau should\nconsider relaxing its rules for marijuana use in order to employ pot-smoking\ncyber experts who may not otherwise be able to get a government job.“I have to\nhire a great work force to compete with those cyber criminals, and some of\nthose kids want to smoke weed on the way to the interview,” Mr. Comey told the\nFBI at the time.When bug bounty platform HackerOne announced earlier this\nmonth that it would assist with the Pentagon’s pilot program, co-founder Alex\nRice told NextGov that there was “no question” that restrictions would exclude\na sizable amount of hackers who might otherwise be able to identify security\nvulnerabilities with Defense Department websites.“As an experiment, it makes\nan incredible amount of sense to start with a constrained environment that you\nhave a lot more confidence in,” he said.\n\n","title":"'Hack the Pentagon' registration opens for some, but background checks could exclude others - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"‘Hack the #Pentagon’ registration opens for some, but background checks could exclude others https://t.co/SECVUv2k7B https://t.co/L4ZUf8Ndbw","date":"Fri Apr 01 16:13:35 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"715935149863649282"},"retweets":12},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/mw59Nx"}

The administration\npreviously said it would not allow such a move.Republicans say the U.S. should\nnot further reward Iran, in light of its recent ballistic missile tests.“As\nIran continues to undermine the spirit of its nuclear agreement with illicit\nballistic missile tests, the Obama administration is going out of its way to\nhelp Tehran reopen for business,” said House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Wisconsin\nRepublican. “The president should abandon this idea.”House Minority Whip Steny\nHoyer, Maryland Democrat, also expressed opposition.“I want to make clear my\nconcerns that the administration had indicated that there would be no further\nconcessions beyond those specifically negotiated and briefed to Congress,” Mr.\nHoyer said in a statement. “I do not support granting Iran any new relief\nwithout a corresponding concession. We lose leverage otherwise, and Iran\nreceives something for free.”Mr. Hoyer said the international community could\nconsider Iran’s further reintegration into the global economy “only when\nIranian banks fully absolve themselves of involvement in terror financing and\nmissile procurement, when Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps ceases its saber-\nrattling against America’s allies, and Iran’s leadership ends its despicable\nthreats against Israel and the Jewish people.”“Until such a time, I think we\nought to go no further than fulfilling only our obligations as laid out in the\n[nuclear agreement], and I look forward to being briefed on what the\nadministration has planned,” he said.U.S. officials said the Treasury\nDepartment is considering the matter, and that any changes would not give Iran\nsubstantial access to the U.S. financial system.At the start of the second day\nof the bi-annual Nuclear Security Summit, Mr. Obama said the Iran nuclear deal\nis achieving its intended results of preventing Tehran from developing nuclear\nweapons.“Iran has dismantled two-thirds of its installed centrifuges,” the\npresident said. “Iran has shipped 98 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile\nout of Iran. Iran has removed the Arak reactor core and filled it with\nconcrete. If Iran were to cheat, the breakout time to build a nuclear weapon\nhas gone from two to three months to about a year.”The agreement is lifting\neconomic sanctions on Iran in exchange for those limits on its nuclear\nprogram, and international inspections of its facilities.\n\n","title":"Obama praises Iran nuke deal as Congress slams effort to give Tehran access to U.S. banking system - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Obama praises Iran nuke deal as Congress slams effort to give Tehran access to U.S. banking system https://t.co/R61EbZoxE0","date":"Fri Apr 01 16:00:45 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"715931916860596224"},"retweets":7},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/1PKkUJB"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e43"},"content":"The Pentagon on Friday put the Islamic State’s top leader on notice that the\nallies are tracking him, saying it is only a matter of time before he is\ncaptured or killed by a drone-fired Hellfire missile.Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, an\nIraqi cleric who directed the rise of the Islamic State into a 25,000-person\nterror army, is now moving between his bases in Syria and Iraq, said Army Col.\nSteven Warren, the top military spokesman in Baghdad.Col. Warren suggested\nBaghdadi’s demise may come soon given the facts that U.S. intelligence knows\nhe is on the move between those countries and that the military has been able\nrecently to pinpoint and kill members of his cabinet.They include his war and\nfinance ministers who played leading roles in recruiting foreign fighters and\nmaintaining the so-called Muslim caliphate from Raqqa, Syria, to Mosul,\nIraq.“I hope al Baghdadi watches these press conferences because I want him to\nknow that we are hunting him and we will find him just like we found his\nmentor, Zarqawi, and killed him, just like we found the grand mater of\nterrorism, Osama bin Laden. We killed him,” Col. Warren told reporters at the\nPentagon via a tele-conference.Zarqawi is Abu Musab Zarqawi, a Jordanian who\nfounded the group al Qaeda in Iraq and was killed by a U.S. bomb strike in\n2006.The reclusive Baghdadi has proved to be an elusive target for over a\ndecade. He was detained near Fallujah in 2004, but released because there was\nlittle evidence he participated in a then-growing insurgency.He ended up as a\ntop aide to Zarqawi and then became the leader of a new group, the Islamic\nState of Iraq. The Iraqis announced his arrest in 2010 but the captive turned\nout to be a different man.With all U.S. troops gone from Iraq in 2011,\nBaghdadi mounted waves of suicide bombings against Baghdad. Next, he took\nadvantage of the chaos of the 2011 civil war outbreak in Syria to move in,\ncapture territory and start building the Islamic State, also known as ISIL and\nISIS. In 2014, his forces invaded Iraq from Syria.“We are going to find\nBaghdadi and he will taste justice,” Col. Warren said. “I don’t know if that\njustice will look like a Hellfire missile or if it will look like a dark\nprison cell somewhere but he will find justice one day. We know he’s alive ….\nWe also believe he moves in-between Syria and Iraq.”The U.S. says it is\nconstantly learning more about how the Islamic State operates and thus is\nfinding more targets to hit. It also has more tools with the creation of a\nspecial operations task force devoted to hunting down high-ranking terrorists.\nIt is believed the task force killed the finance minister in Syria last\nmonth.“We’re in the business of taking terrorists off the battlefield,” Col.\nWarren said. “And whether we take them off and slam them into a dark cell\nsomewhere in the international courts or put a Hellfire missile at his\nlocation, either one of those would make us equally happy. But this is a\nterrorists who has to go. And this is a terrorists who should not sleep well\never. For two reasons. One, certainly his conscience will keep him awake for\nall the brutal acts he’s been behind. But more importantly, eventually some\none is either going to come in the window and snatch him up or the entire\nhouse that he’s in will get reduced to rubble.”\n\n","title":"Pentagon taunts al-Baghdadi: Hellfire missile headed your way - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Pentagon taunts ISIS leader: A drone-fired Hellfire missile is headed your way https://t.co/jyXVYvP3dW","date":"Fri Apr 01 15:46:42 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"715928384623284224"},"retweets":11},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/1/pentagon-taunts-al-baghdadi-hellfire-missile-heade/"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e44"},"content":"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Smithsonian now plans to acknowledge the sexual-assault\nallegations against Bill Cosby at its new African-American history museum on\nthe National Mall, which will display two items related to Cosby’s career in\ntelevision and standup comedy.The National Museum of African American History\nand Culture, which opens Sept. 24, will include the cover of a Cosby comedy\nalbum and a comic book from his pioneering TV drama “I Spy” as part of its\nexhibit on black entertainers and artists. Initially, the museum planned to\ninclude historical facts about the items without mentioning the allegations,\ndrawing criticism from some Cosby accusers.The museum’s founding director,\nLonnie Bunch, said in a statement Thursday that the display would address\nCosby’s alleged behavior, although he did not specify exactly how.“Like all of\nhistory, our interpretation of Bill Cosby is a work in progress, something\nthat will continue to evolve as new evidence and insights come to the fore,”\nBunch said. “Visitors will leave the exhibition knowing more about Mr. Cosby’s\nimpact on American entertainment, while recognizing that his legacy has been\nseverely damaged by the recent accusations.”Through a spokeswoman, Bunch\ndeclined to comment further.Dozens of women have accused Cosby, 78, of sexual\nabuse. Cosby was charged last year with drugging and sexually assaulting a\nformer Temple University worker at his suburban Philadelphia home in 2004, a\ncase that is on hold amid an appeal. He also faces several civil lawsuits.The\nSmithsonian Institution also has been criticized for its recent exhibit of\nCosby’s personal art collection at a different museum. The exhibit was funded\nalmost exclusively by Cosby and his wife, Camille, in the form of a $716,000\ngift, which Smithsonian officials did not disclose until they were\nspecifically asked about it by The Associated Press. The museum’s director,\nwho is close with the Cosbys, said last year that she would not have moved\nforward with the exhibit had she known about the allegations.Cosby had no part\nin funding the new museum, and the two items that will be displayed were\npurchased on eBay, Linda St. Thomas, a Smithsonian spokeswoman, said earlier\nthis week.

But country legend Hank\nWilliams‘ inner life was one of tempestuousness and angst — his body finally\ngiving up under the duress of chronic alcohol abuse in 1953 when the singer\nwas but 29.The story of Williams‘ improbable rise and dramatic fall is told in\nthe new film “I Saw the Light,” opening Friday in the District and starring\nTom Hiddleston, perhaps best known to moviegoers as the villainous demigod\nLoki from the “Avengers” films.“I think the most surprising thing was how\ngenuinely lonely he was,” Mr. Hiddleston told The Washington Times, trading in\nthe learned Tennessee twang of his onscreen avatar for his natural British\nlilt.Because Williams‘ music was “so joyful and so infectious” it was\nsurprising to the 35-year-old thespian that Williams was so haunted given that\n“there’s no clue in that music apart from some of the mournful ballads that he\nwas as isolated as I think he was. And I think the more famous and the\nsuccessful he became, the more lonely and isolated he became.”“I Saw the\nLight” is written and directed by Marc Abraham, a Louisville, Kentucky, native\nwho grew up on the music of Williams as well as such other Nashville legends\nas Merle Haggard, Kris Kristofferson and George Jones.“Eventually you do get\ntaken back to the source material [which is] Hank and his interest in country\nmusic,” Mr. Abraham said of the music spawned less than 200 miles from where\nhe grew up.Mr. Abraham got wind nearly a decade ago that a film about\nWilliams‘ life was in the work, which spurred him to get his screenplay off\nthe ground as quickly as possible.“Someone else isn’t going to make this\nmovie,” the filmmaker recalls of his thought process at the time. “Three and a\nhalf years ago, Tom and I got together about it.”Early on in the process, Mr.\nHiddleston sent Mr. Abraham a rendition of himself performing Williams‘\nseminal hit “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry.” While it was certainly necessary to\napproximate the singular voice of the country legend, both star and filmmaker\nagreed it was more important to inhabit the spirit of the singer rather than\nperform a spot-on impersonation.“The first thing I said was you’ll never sound\nexactly like Hank Williams,” Mr. Abraham told his star, adding also that he\nhas a particular distaste for lip-synching. “Tom’s an actor, and what we\nwanted was to have a visceral experience for the audience of who this man was\nand be close enough on the music so that when the music was embedded inside\nthe film, it resonated as if it were Hank and not some mimicry of him.”For all\nof Mr. Abraham’s and Mr. Hiddleston’s wishes to do justice to their subject,\nWilliams‘ legend is rife with warts, not the least of which was his alcoholism\nand chronic infidelity to his wife, which resulted in out-of-wedlock births in\naddition to his own “legitimate” children, including Hank Williams Jr., a\nsinger in his own right.Mr. Abraham describes Williams‘ lifestyle as tragic,\nbut not quite achieving the “Aristotelian” level.“I love stories about sad\nthings. I think they’re so evocative,” the filmmaker said, adding that he\nwanted to tell the story of Williams not “through all of his greatest hits”\nbut rather of how influential he was on American music.Indeed, Williams‘\nmusical virtuosity has found its way into his descendents. Son Hank Jr., has\nenjoyed success with his combination of rock/blues/country, and even grandson\nHank III is known for his outlaw country style.It was important to the\nfilmmakers that the family of Williams approve of the end result. Mr. Abraham\nsaid he got tremendous support from Williams‘ daughters from his marriage,\nHillary and Holly, and from his daughter Jett, conceived outside of his\nmarital bonds._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Tom Hiddleston of 'Avengers' portrays Hank Williams in 'I Saw the Light' - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#TomHiddleston of 'Avengers' fame plays Hank Williams in new biopic #Nashville #ISawTheLight\nhttps://t.co/94W4S9uNe5 https://t.co/l2YbEOlfTo","date":"Fri Apr 01 15:38:28 +0000 2016","favs":2,"id":{"$numberLong":"715926310242136064"},"retweets":5},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/apr/1/tom-hiddleston-avengers-portrays-hank-williams-i-s/"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e46"},"content":"**OPINION/ANALYSIS**A healthy lifestyle involves choices – and the facts are that the choices you make today is the life you will lead tomorrow. We are in the midst of a series with respect to Weight Loss Strategies– and quite simply making healthy choices is the chief agent to success. The good news is that you are responsible for making your choices… the downside is that there are a number of hidden land mines that can prevent us from achieving our ideal weight. This series is to help in making smarter choices every day, adopting healthy lifestyle changes while developing new eating habits. You’ll not only lose weight – you will be healthier and you’ll also have more energy.While I have said it before it bears repeating, being overweight raises our risk for a number of chronic health issues including diabetes, heart disease, fatty liver, osteoarthritis, elevated cholesterol, asthma, sleep apnea, gall stones and some cancers. And too, studies show that being overweight can also impact our mental, social, and emotional well-being. Here are some additional strategies in this series for healthy weight-loss success.**Dr. Nina’s What You Need To Know About Weight Loss Strategies****Portion control**  \nIn addition to choosing nutritious foods that are low in calories and fat, how\nmuch we eat is critical to any weight loss plan. Portion control is the\nunderstanding of how much a serving size of food is and how many calories or\nhow much food energy a serving contains. And this is important because\nresearch has shown that our portions are exploding compared to 20 years ago.\nThe odds (or serving sizes) are stacked against us!Some strategies to help us\nwatch our portions include: not eating while distracted; being aware of\nsupersized portions at fast food and sit down restaurants; and making sure to\nput fiber-filled veggies on our plates so we feel full.**Don’t hang out in the\nkitchen**  \nOver the past several years, researchers have been looking at how our\nenvironment affects what and how much we decide to put into our mouth. And\nwhat they have found is that when we spend time in our kitchens, it is more\nlikely that we will consume…more. Having snacks and food right at our\nfingertips makes eating effortless and likely we will do so even when we are\nnot hungry. Additionally, today, our kitchens are often equipped with\ntelevisions, computers, and other technologies that allow us to eat, munch,\nand graze while distracted.Try hanging out in the family room instead. If we\nhave to get up from a comfy couch, go up or down a flight of stairs, or miss a\npart of our favorite show to grab something to eat, is becomes less convenient\nand more likely we will do so only when actually hungry.**Pack your lunch**  \nIn addition to being lighter on our wallets, bringing our lunch to school or\nwork can also be lighter on the number of calories, fat, and salt we consume.\nPacking our lunch in advance, as opposed to ordering when hungry, improves the\nchances that we will eat more nutritiously. For example, we may be able to\navoid the added condiments on ready-made sandwiches (e.g. mayonnaise) or be\nless likely to consume fried foods (few of us like to eat soggy microwaved\nFrench fries).**Smart snacking**  \nEating in between meals can help suppress hunger pangs, boost our energy, and\nhelp our bodies get the right amount of nutrients. However, careless snacking\nout of habit, boredom, stress or frustration can also be a landmine that poses\nserious threats to our waistlines. Many easy, grab-and-go snacks are high in\ncalories, fat, and salt, providing little to no nutritional value and creating\na battle of the buldge.But it does not have to be that way. When mindful\nsnacking is kept less than 200 calories and are rich in protein, fiber, and\nother nutrients, it can be a tool to maintain an overall healthy lifestyle.\nAnd while it may take a little planning, there are a number of fun, tasty, and\ngood-for-us snack options.**Unplugging**  \nOur computer, television, and smart phones have bright screens that can\ninterfere with our body’s melatonin production. Melatonin is a sleep hormone\nthat rises when it is dark and suppressed by sunlight…and artificial lights.\nUsing these items around bedtime, as a result, may make it more difficult to\nfall asleep. And, as we know, poor sleep can elevate our hunger hormone\nghrelin and impair rational decision-making when it comes to what we put in\nour mouths.**Fill up on fiber**  \nFiber is a type of carbohydrate that is not digested. Unlike other\ncarbohydrates that are broken down into sugar molecules, fiber is not broken\ndown and passes from our mouth to the porcelain bowel, intact. And because it\nis not absorbed from our intestines, it cannot add calories.Additionally,\nchewing celery and carrots requires time and energy. It takes your stomach 20\nminutes to signal to our brain that we are full and to “stop eating!” As a\nresult, we are affording our body the opportunity to register that we are no\nlonger hungry and are “buying time.” Additionally, we are getting more bang\nfor our buck. Fiber adds bulk and makes a meal feel larger and linger longer.  \nThe American Dietetic Association recommends that between the ages of 19 to\n50, women should consume at least 25 grams of fiber daily and men 38 grams\ndaily.Understanding how to wisely make (and manage) smart choices is what this\nseries is about in order to help support smart weight loss. Choosing to find\ntime to exercise, to make wise choices of a healthy eating plan, choosing more\nfiber, setting realistic goals, maintaining good sleep hygiene – is within our\npower of choice. You’ve got this!! – Make good choices!\n\n","title":"NINA RADCLIFF: Healthy choices: You are what you eat - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"DR.

Conservatives blame him for many things, including being\nunwilling to fight Barack Obama and the president’s radical agenda.What many\nin the conservative movement do not seem to realize is that Mitch McConnell is\nleading a lonely and crucial fight for conservatism that will shape this\nnation for decades to come.On February 13, 2016, the political world was\nshocked when Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonin Scalia died, while on a\nhunting trip in Texas. The result of Scalia’s death was nothing less than a\npolitical earthquake.The U.S. Supreme Court has been ideologically divided for\nalmost three decades, with conservative justices generally having the upper\nhand. The court could count on five justices falling on the conservative side\nof issues and four liberal justices going the other way.Scalia’s death changed\nthat.Now the left is salivating over the possibility of a liberal majority on\nthe Supreme Court. They remember the glory days of the Warren Court in the\n‘60s, when liberal activism ruled the day.Mr. Obama wasted little time in\nnominating Merrick Garland, a far left-wing federal appeals judge. On the\nbench, Judge Garland tried to attack the Heller and McDonald cases that helped\nsave the 2nd Amendment. And the odds are pretty good, he is against the\nCitizens United case, which saved the First Amendment.Even before Mr. Obama\nnominated Judge Garland, there was one voice standing up, saying no to any\nObama nominee.Mitch McConnell.Conservatives realize how much is at stake with\nthis nomination. If confirmed, Obama would get to reshape the court on his way\nout. Mr. McConnell said on Fox News, “Look, Barack Obama calling judge, this\njudge a moderate doesn’t make him a moderate. This judge would move the court\ndramatically to the left. He’s enthusiastically supported by MoveOn.org.”Mr.\nMcConnell is absolutely right about that.Mr. McConnell realizes the impact of\nanother liberal on the bench. “The next justice could fundamentally alter the\ndirection of the Supreme Court and have a profound impact on our country, so\nof course the American people should have a say in the Court’s direction,” Mr.\nMcConnell said even before Judge Garland’s nomination.Some Republicans have\nalready started to cave. Liberal Republican Sen. Mark Kirk, who is going to\nlose his bid for re-election in Illinois, called for a vote on Judge Garland’s\nnomination. Some other Republicans, including New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte\nand Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, both in tough election battles this year, have\nagreed to meet with Judge Garland. Sen. Ayotte in particular is adamant that\nthere will be no vote.In the end, the decision is Mitch McConnell’s and he is\nsaying no.Conservatives have a very bad habit of knowing what they oppose but\nnot necessarily knowing what they want. Even worse, conservatives tend to be\ntheir own worst enemies in political fights. Too often they demonize those who\nare trying to help them achieve their goals, simply because whoever the person\nis, is not perfect._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"JUDSON PHILLIPS: Mitch McConnell, conservative hero? - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"JUDSON PHILLIPS: Mitch McConnell, conservative hero? https://t.co/jOboKmREtH #MitchMcConnell","date":"Fri Apr 01 15:10:06 +0000 2016","favs":2,"id":{"$numberLong":"715919174510448641"},"retweets":4},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/9G1JjN"}

The bureau has declined\nthus far to talk about the techniques used or to identify the third party that\nwas able to provide the assistance.Reports emerged this week that the FBI had\nagreed to help unlock an iPhone and iPod that Arkansas prosecutors think could\nhold evidence in a double murder.

Apple had rebuffed requests to help the FBI hack the San\nBernardino iPhone, arguing that doing so would set a dangerous precedent.So\nthe disclosure Wednesday by Arkansas’ Faulkner County Prosecuting Attorney\nCody Hiland that the FBI had agreed to a request to try to unlock the devices\nthat belonged to two teenagers accused a double murder made waves._Story\nContinues →_\n\n","title":"FBI says no agreement to help Arkansas prosecutors hack iPhone - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"No agreement to help #Arkansas prosecutors hack iPhone, #FBI says https://t.co/yiFexZSQYK #iPhone #Apple https://t.co/KN0DK7ERcd","date":"Fri Apr 01 14:39:14 +0000 2016","favs":5,"id":{"$numberLong":"715911405036310528"},"retweets":6},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/97eQQL"}

Scott Klug, who said many in the Badger State are really pining for Mr. Ryan.“Very consciously, a lot of people are hoping it’s Paul,” Mr. Klug told Politico, adding that he personally thinks a brokered convention — respect for Ryan aside — would be “absolute chaos.”Absolute chaos, indeed. It looks like that’s what the RNC and establishment class is gunning for.\n\n","title":"Karl Rove says 'fresh face' needed in GOP presidential race, ousting Donald Trump, Ted Cruz - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Karl Rove says ‘fresh face’ needed in #GOP presidential race, ousting Donald Trump, Ted Cruz https://t.co/2ZydgeFATg https://t.co/RRPYX82h57","date":"Fri Apr 01 13:21:19 +0000 2016","favs":11,"id":{"$numberLong":"715891796048551936"},"retweets":26},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/QC3e7i"}

Bernie Sanders are\npreparing for a drag-out fight in New York, a state where they both have\nroots. Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, will hold a\nseries of events upstate, said campaign aides, to highlight her record as a\ntwo-term senator and her work helping more economically-depressed parts of the\nregion.She’s also trying to boost support among rural and working-class\nvoters, groups that have favored Sanders in previous primary contests.Her\nmanufacturing proposal centers on using federal funding to create “Make it in\nAmerica Partnerships” among universities, private companies, unions and\ngovernment. Businesses participating in the program would pledge not to\noutsource jobs or move their headquarters abroad to avoid paying U.S.\ntaxes.The new federal spending would be paid for with tax revenue from a\n“clawback” tax on companies that outsource jobs or facilities abroad, an idea\nClinton proposed in March.“We’ll really be highlighting how Hillary Clinton\nmade a real difference in the economy lives of people she served,” said\nClinton campaign senior policy aide Jake Sullivan. “She’ll have their back and\nthe back of working people as president.”Sanders, who grew up in Brooklyn, is\ntargeting younger liberals in New York City and working class voters in\neconomically-struggling areas upstate.He kicked off his campaign in the state\non Thursday night, attracting 18,500 cheering supporters to a rally in the\nSouth Bronx.

They had pulled 67 people\nalive.“There is no possibility of finding any person alive,” said S.S.\nGuleria, deputy inspector general of the India’s National Disaster Response\nForce. Engineers are being consulted about a part of the bridge still hanging\nover the disaster area, after which workers will “slowly start dismantling\nthis particular section to avoid any collateral damage to houses around\nit.”The five employees who were detained worked for the Hyderabad-based IVRCL\nInfrastructure Co., which was contracted in 2007 to build the overpass. Police\nalso sealed its Kolkata office.The officials are being questioned for possible\nculpable homicide, punishable with life imprisonment, and criminal breach of\ntrust, which carries a prison sentence of up to seven years, police said.The\npartially constructed overpass had spanned nearly the width of the street and\nwas designed to ease traffic through the densely crowded Bara Bazaar\nneighborhood in the capital of the east Indian state of West Bengal. Within\nhours of concrete being poured into a framework of steel girders on Thursday,\nabout 100 meters (300 feet) of the overpass collapsed.“I heard an explosion, a\nsolid one,” said resident Rabindra Kumar Gupta, who had been home eating\nlunch. “My apartment shook.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e56"},"content":"HAWTHORNE, Calif. (AP) — It’s the car thousands of people were waiting for:\nTesla Motors‘ new, lower-priced Model 3 sedan.Tesla unveiled the Model 3 on\nThursday night at its Los Angeles design studio. It doesn’t go on sale until\nlate 2017, but in the first 24 hours that order banks were open, Tesla said it\nhad more than 115,000 reservations. Long lines at Tesla stores, reminiscent of\nthe crowds at Apple stores for early models of the iPhone, were reported from\nHong Kong to Austin, Texas, to Washington, D.C. Buyers put down a $1,000\ndeposit to reserve the car.At a starting price of $35,000 - before federal and\nstate government incentives - the Model 3 is less than half the cost of\nTesla’s previous models. Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the car will go at least 215\nmiles when fully charged, about double what drivers get from current\ncompetitors in its price range, such as the Nissan Leaf and BMW i3.**PHOTOS:\nAffordable Model 3 is Tesla's biggest test yet**Prototypes shown Thursday\nnight looked like a shorter version of Tesla’s Model S sedan. The Model 3 has\na panoramic glass roof and an elongated hood. Inside, it seats five adults and\nhas the same large touchscreen dashboard as other Teslas. It also has Tesla’s\nsuite of semi-autonomous driving features, including automatic lane changing\nand lane keeping. Musk said it will accelerate from zero to 60 in less than 6\nseconds.Musk said the car is on schedule to go on sale at the end of 2017,\neliciting a cheer from the crowd of around 800 people. Tesla has a history of\nmissing deadlines for its vehicles to hit the market.“I do feel fairly\nconfident it will be next year,” Musk said.The Model 3 is the most serious\ntest yet of 13-year-old Tesla’s ability to go from a niche player to a full-\nfledged automaker. It could be the car that finally makes electrics mainstream\n- or consumers could continue to be skeptical that electrics will work for\neveryday use. In the U.S., they still make up less than 1 percent of annual\nsales. Either way, the Model 3 is already changing the industry, spurring\ncompetitors to speed development of electric cars and improve their battery\nrange.General Motors Co. is set to start selling the Chevrolet Bolt electric\ncar at the end of this year. The Bolt will have a similar price tag and a\n200-mile range. Hyundai’s Ioniq, which has a 110-mile electric range and could\nmatch Tesla on price, goes on sale this fall. Audi will follow with an\nelectric SUV in 2018.Musk said last month he’s not worried. He thinks the\nModel 3 will compete most directly with small luxury cars such as the Audi A4\nand the BMW 3 Series.Musk said Tesla will expand its stores and its fast-\ncharging Supercharger stations globally in order to support the Model 3. He\nsaid the company plans to double its stores worldwide to 441 by the end of\n2017, and it will double its Superchargers to 7,200. Tesla will also add\nthousands of its so-called destination charging stations at hotels and other\nlocations.Right now, Tesla sells two vehicles: The Model S sedan, which starts\nat $71,000, and the Model X SUV, which starts around $80,000. But a lower-\npriced car was Musk’s longtime goal. Musk said the Model S and Model X, along\nwith Tesla’s first car, the discontinued Roadster sports car, helped Tesla\nmake the money to invest in the Model 3.“We needed to figure out how we, as a\ntiny company with very few resources, could make a difference,” he said.Tesla\nlowered the cost of the car, in part, by making cheaper batteries. The company\npreviously assembled its battery packs with cells made in Japan by Panasonic\nCorp. But Tesla and Panasonic are building a massive, $5 billion factory in\nNevada which will supply batteries for the Model 3. Tesla says the scale of\nthe factory will lower the cost of its battery packs by 30 percent.The Model 3\nputs Tesla within reach of millions more customers. Last year, only 2.1\npercent of new cars purchased in the U.S. cost $75,000 or more, but 35 percent\n- or 5.5 million - cost $35,000 or more, according to TrueCar. The Model 3 is\na critical part of the money-losing automaker’s plan to increase sales from\naround 85,000 this year to 500,000 by 2020.Robin Santucci got the sixth spot\nin line when he arrived at the Santa Monica, California, Tesla store at 3:45\na.m. Thursday.

She had contracted bronchitis earlier this week and had a\nheart attack while being treated.In London, where she lived and worked, Mayor\nBoris Johnson tweeted that “she was an inspiration and her legacy lives on in\nwonderful buildings” at the Olympic park and around the world.Born and raised\nin Baghdad, Hadid studied mathematics at the American University of Beirut\nbefore enrolling at the Architectural Association in London in 1972.She worked\nfor the groundbreaking Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas before setting up London-\nbased Zaha Hadid Architects in 1979.Hadid’s work fused her knowledge of\nmathematics and embrace of computer technology with soaring imagination and\nambition.She designed buildings around the world - though relatively few, she\noften noted, were in Britain. Her projects included an innovative BMW plant in\nLeipzig, Germany; sleek funicular railway stations in Innsbruck, Austria; the\nglittering Guangzhou Opera House in China; Rome’s light-filled MAXXI museum\nfor contemporary arts and architecture; and the strikingly curved Heydar\nAliyev Center in Baku, Azerbaijan.Her buildings were always talking points,\nand sometimes controversial. The Dongdaemun Design Plaza in Seoul was compared\nby detractors to an ugly spaceship that had made an emergency landing. Last\nyear the Japanese government revoked her commission to build the stadium for\nthe 2020 Tokyo Olympics amid spiraling costs.Uncompleted works include one of\nthe stadiums for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and a new Iraqi parliament\nbuilding in Baghdad.Hadid twice won Britain’s Stirling Prize for architecture\nand in 2004 became the first woman to win the Pritzker Prize, known as the\n“Nobel prize of architecture.”The Pritzker jury praised her unswerving\ncommitment to modernism and defiance of convention.Like all architects, Hadid\nsometimes struggled to have her ambitious designs built. She acknowledged that\nsome of her early plans had posed engineering challenges.“I used to like\nbuildings floating,” Hadid told the BBC last month. “Now I know that they\ncan’t float.”She was also unremittingly blunt and forthright - qualities not\nalways relished in British society.Earlier this year she was awarded the Gold\nMedal by the Royal Institute of British Architects. Architect Peter Cook said\nin his citation that “in our culture of circumspection and modesty her work is\ncertainly not modest, and she herself is the opposite of modest.”_Story\nContinues →_\n\n","title":"Zaha Hadid, innovative Iraqi-British architect, dies at 65 - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Zaha Hadid, innovative Iraqi-British architect, dies at 65 https://t.co/TUQJxr9Ad2 #ZahaHadid","date":"Fri Apr 01 10:34:17 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715849762185089025"},"retweets":4},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/68srWD"}

The Pentagon last\nmonth pushed lawmakers to divert some $27.5 million from other projects to\nrepair the aerostats and keep a three-year trial program on track, a request\ndenied by the Senate Appropriations Committee.“There’s been broad concern in\nthe committee about the pace of the program,” said committee spokesman Stephen\nWorley.Those concerns, he said, only grew “when the balloon became\nuntethered.”Due to the budget cuts, the JLENS program will have to be\nshuttered until at least the next budget is passed. “The future of the program\nwill depend upon obligated funds for [fiscal year 2017] and beyond being\navailable and appropriated,” said Maj. Beth Smith, lead Department of Defense\nspokesperson for JLENS.At least part of the requested money would go for a\nspecific line item — stronger mooring cables.Defense experts said Congress\nwould be making a mistake of Hindenburgian proportions to deflate the balloons\npermanently.The blimps, which come in pairs, are designed to detect hostile\ntargets including cruise missiles, aircraft, ships, small boats and land\nvehicles. Their radars have a range of 340 miles in each direction, which\nallowed the blimps at Maryland’s Aberdeen Proving Grounds to cover much of the\nEastern Seaboard and monitor for incoming missiles several hundred miles out\nto sea.As the offensive capabilities of missiles continue to outstrip other\ndefensive systems, former Department of Defense official Chet Nagle said,\nJLENS is increasingly indispensable to national security.“The family of\nmissiles that is arrayed around the world now is huge and growing more and\nmore sophisticated, and our defenses are standing still,” Mr. Nagle said,\npointing to purveyors of cruise missiles like Russia and China. “The problem\nfor us is there’s no defense in the United States today against cruise\nmissiles. Zero. Zip.“Without the JLENS system operational, we’re naked,” he\ncontinued. “They should be not only on the Eastern sea coast, they should be\non our other coasts.”Michaela Dodge, a policy analyst at the Heritage\nFoundation’s Allison Center for Foreign Policy Studies, said there is a\nconsensus among defense experts that the United States needs to “catch up as\nmuch as we can and stay ahead if we can” of rapidly innovating missile\ntechnology._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"AWOL blimp jeopardizes funding for Pentagon program - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Congress threatens to ground #Pentagon program after blimp goes AWOL: https://t.co/MgCjQOImD5","date":"Fri Apr 01 02:53:31 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"715733805571698688"},"retweets":9},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/31/awol-blimp-jeopardizes-funding-for-pentagon-progra/"}

Open-air markets are\nbooming. Trading stops only for daily prayers conducted by al-Shabab\nleaders.As a result, many people in Barawe support the militants.“We feel\npeace when we are under al-Shabab,” said Munira Mohammed, a mother of five who\nowns a butcher shop in Barawe. “They do patrols to ensure we are safe. They\nrespect our businesses and our lives. So we are feeling good, and we want to\ntell foreign soldiers to let us keep this kind of life.”Ms. Mohammed’s\nattitude reflects how people in southern Somalia are disillusioned with\ninternational efforts to rebuild their country, said Nazlin Umar Rajput, a\npolitical analyst and chairwoman of the National Muslim Council of Women of\nKenya.Al-Shabab is extreme, but not as radical as its critics charge, Ms.\nRajput said. The militants allow women like Ms. Mohammed to own businesses and\nattend madrassas that provide religious education, for example. Many locals\nhave accepted the group’s Islamist ideology in exchange for stability, she\nsaid.“Al-Shabab started as the Somali people’s movement for an all-inclusive\ndemocracy, self-rule, true-independence and a people’s constitution,” said Ms.\nRajput. “They’re gaining popularity where it matters most — in the hearts of\nthe local Somali populace. This is the reality that the world needs to\nface.”While the African Union and Somali armed forces have severely restricted\nal-Shabab and curtailed its reach in recent years, the group is still a\npowerful force in southern Somalia.Barawe, also known as Brava, a port town in\nthe southwestern Lower Shebelle region, is an al-Shabab stronghold that hosts\ntraining camps where the much-feared group trains hundreds of fighters from\naround the world.Al-Shabab is seeking to overthrow the Western-backed Somali\ngovernment based in Mogadishu and impose Islamic Shariah law throughout the\ncountry. The group has launched a number of deadly attacks in Kenya,\npresumably in retaliation against that country’s participation in the African\nUnion’s peacekeeping force in Somalia.Last April, al-Shabab militants attacked\nGarissa University in northern Kenya, killing 148 students. The terrorist\ngroup killed 65 people in a 24-hour period in and around Mpeketoni, a town on\nthe Indian Ocean. It also was responsible for the 2013 raid on Nairobi’s\nWestgate Mall, where 67 died.Some residents complained about al-Shabab’s\nrecruiting methods for those camps, including kidnapping children and forcing\nthem to join their ranks.“Many underage boys have been abducted from schools,”\nsaid Mohammed, a young man who declined to provide his last name or other\ndetails. “They undergo tough physical combat training, but they have no option\nthan to defend their religion and country.”But many young Somalis like\nMohammed are eager to battle the African Union, Kenya and the Somali National\nArmy. Last year, Somali forces indiscriminately detained and killed civilians,\naccording to a recent Human Rights Watch report. African Union troops also\nhave been accused of raping Somalis and rampaging against al-Shabab\nsympathizers._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Al-Shabab offers Somalis security, stability in exchange for Shariah law - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#Alshabab offers Somalis security, stability in exchange for #ShariahLaw: https://t.co/iTdG2V5puv","date":"Fri Apr 01 02:28:01 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715727387959406592"},"retweets":5},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/31/al-shabab-offers-somalis-security-stability-in-exc/"}

Security Council to level biting new economic sanctions against North\nKorea.Seoul and Tokyo are seen as key to making the sanctions stick. But there\nis uncertainty over China, which imports some $860 million worth of coal from\nNorth Korea annually and has long stood as Pyongyang’s main economic\nally.South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo\nAbe emerged from joint talks with Mr. Obama on Thursday vowing to deepen their\ncollective pressure on North Korea.Mr. Obama sought to convey a similar\nmessage on his way into a one-on-one meeting with Chinese President Xi\nJingping on Thursday afternoon, claiming that the two would “discuss how we\ncan discourage actions like nuclear missile tests that escalate tensions and\nviolate international obligations.”But with so many issues on the table\nbetween Beijing and Washington — including cybersecurity, trade deficits and\nthe increasingly hectic maritime disputes in the South China Sea — many\nanalysts contend that real progress on North Korea is unlikely.“[One]\nconstraint that ends up upending U.S.-China cooperation on North Korea is that\nthere are just too many issues on the U.S.-China agenda to focus on [this],”\nsays Scott A. Snyder, who heads the Program on U.S.-Korea Policy at the\nCouncil on Foreign Relations in Washington.“The only way the both are going to\nfocus on North Korea is if it becomes the top issue between them, over the\nSouth China Sea and cybersecurity and every other issue that now burdens the\nrelationship,” Mr. Snyder said in an interview. “The only way both are going\nto focus on it is if there’s a bigger crisis than the one that’s precipitated\nby nuclear tests.”In recent weeks, Mr. Xi has drawn praise from some analysts,\nwho say his government is pursuing the U.N. sanctions against Pyongyang with\nunprecedented focus and aggression — even moving to limit the access of North\nKorean ships to certain Chinese ports.China is “at long last prepared to\nconnect the dots in its relations with North Korea,” said Jonathan D. Pollack,\na China analyst with the Brookings Institution who argues that Beijing has\n“now decided to make Pyongyang feel the pain.”“For the first time, China has\nbegun to fully acknowledge that North Korean actions pose a direct threat to\nvital Chinese security interests,” Mr. Pollack wrote on the Brookings website.\n“Beijing is no longer prepared to rationalize or ignore the threat.”He pointed\nto a March 11 editorial in China’s Global Times that called on North Koreans\nto recognize that the U.S. “has the strength to drastically change the rules\nof the game.”_Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"China backs North Korea punishment but won't abandon unruly ally, analysts say - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#China backs #NorthKorea punishment but won't abandon unruly ally, analysts say: https://t.co/9vIfUXHy68","date":"Fri Apr 01 02:18:17 +0000 2016","favs":6,"id":{"$numberLong":"715724937999302656"},"retweets":11},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/31/china-backs-north-korea-punishment-but-wont-abando/"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e5c"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**A new report says D.C. neighborhoods are seeing rising numbers of households with school-age children. Overall, that’s pretty good news. Just don’t expect the families to stay put unless public schools drastically improve in a short time.When parents of school-age children consider buying a house, condo or loft, one of the criteria at the top of their must-have list is great schools — and in this era of the universal pre-K movement, even more so.Does the nearest school offer top-drawer academic programs? Does the nearest school offer arts programs? Physical education and athletic programs? Are the campuses safe and clean?But we have to understand that school officials don’t necessarily consider those questions — or the answers to them — when drawing and redrawing school boundaries.Parents of thousands of school-age children in Portland, Oregon, are miffed about proposed boundary changes, and perhaps rightly so, considering their children would have to travel to schools miles outside their neighborhoods.Closer to home, parents in Loudoun County, Virginia, have similar concerns. Loudoun, which has an estimated population of 350,000, has 14 middle schools on the National Forum to Accelerate Middle-Graders Reform “School to Watch” list — and 14 is the most of any school system in America.Interestingly, Loudoun parents were upset that school authorities were segregating elementary schools based on race, ethnicity and income as a remedy to stem overcrowding at one grade school. Under the plan, most of the affected children would have been black and Hispanic. A compromise plan approved by school officials this week substantially modifies the redrawn boundaries.Conversely, D.C. Public Schools drew up boundary plans in 2014 that will could leave parents scrambling when classes start this summer.First of all, understand that D.C. officials don’t want kids to necessarily attend their neighborhood school (charter jealously is a reality, not a perception). Consequently, parents have to enroll in a lottery and pick first, second and third preferences.School authorities also consider whether a student is “at-risk” — that is to say on food stamps or welfare, homeless or in foster care, living in “transitional” housing and the like. They also factor in whether English is spoken as a first language in the home.And whether the child attends or wants to attend a dual-language school also is taken into consideration.By the time low-income and/or illiterate families figure out where the roadblocks are, they scream instead for a voucher — and who could blame them?Implementation of the D.C. school-boundary plan actually began in 2015, but other phases continue over the course of the next few years, including legacy enrollments, which allow a sibling the opportunity to attend the same public school as a sister or brother.The bean counting education have to carry out during discussions on school-boundary changes is an enormous and questionable undertaking, mostly because authorities are trying to articulate something they imagined as part of the Supreme Court’s Brown v Board of Education ruling in 1954. But it’s just their imagination and more a contrivance of political correctness._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"DEBORAH SIMMONS: It's the school boundaries, stupid - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"DEBORAH SIMMONS: It’s the school boundaries, stupid.\nhttps://t.co/jrDYLPYMIx #DCschools #schoolboundaries","date":"Fri Apr 01 02:07:46 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"715722293692014594"},"retweets":3},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/31/deborah-simmons-its-the-school-boundaries-stupid/"}

The attacks were so fierce\nthat, for one day at least, the billionaire developer struggled to dictate the\nmedia narrative or dominate the news cycle.Mr. Trump quickly backed away from\nthe remark Wednesday by issuing a series of statements that realigned him with\nthe widely accepted pro-life view that doctors performing abortions, and not\nwomen, should be the ones facing punishment if abortion is illegal in the\nfuture.“My position has not changed. Like Ronald Reagan, I am pro-life with\nexceptions,” said Mr. Trump.The abortion dustup was the latest in a series of\nperceived missteps on policy issues by the front-runner, including his\nadvocacy of nuclear weapons for Japan, South Korea and even Saudi Arabia,\ncontradicting the United States’ longstanding policy. White House Deputy\nNational Security Adviser Ben Rhodes took a break from President Obama’s major\nnuclear security summit Thursday to tell reporters covering the gathering it\nwould be “catastrophic” to adopt Mr. Trump’s position.Ohio Gov. John Kasich\ncriticized his rival for the 2016 GOP nomination in unusually pointed terms\nThursday, saying Mr. Trump’s comments on abortion and nuclear security showed\nhe was not ready to occupy the Oval Office.Being president “takes restraint,\nit takes judgment, it takes experience — not wild-eyed suggestions and\nbasically moving from one suggestion, and then the need to try to explain what\nyou really meant once you realize that the suggestion you made confused people\nor enraged people,” Mr. Kasich said at a news conference in New York.“It just\nshows that he’s really not prepared to be president of the United States,” Mr.\nKasich added.Bouncing back?Still, Mr. Trump has previously bounced back after\nbreaking political norms that likely would have ended the run for more\nconventional candidates.The billionaire businessman and reality-TV star\nalready had high unfavorability ratings from women voters, and his comment\npromised to further hurt his standing with female voters.The remark seemed\ncertain to provide fodder for future attack ads._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Donald Trump backpedals on abortion 'punishment' as Hillary Clinton, GOP rivals pounce - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#DonaldTrump backpedals on #abortion 'punishment' as #HillaryClinton, GOP rivals pounce: https://t.co/emMzm9C9m4","date":"Fri Apr 01 01:59:33 +0000 2016","favs":5,"id":{"$numberLong":"715720223370964992"},"retweets":9},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/31/donald-trump-backpedals-on-abortion-punishment-as-/"}

That is horrible politics, horrible for the country. That\nis just something that has got to stop.”Larry J. Sabato, director of the\nUniversity of Virginia Center for Politics, said the Democratic Party\nexperienced a similar internal struggle in 1976 when a relatively unknown\nformer governor of Georgia, Jimmy Carter, shot to the front of a 15-person\nprimary race.“National powers in the party organized an ABC movement —\n‘Anybody But Carter,’” he recalled. “Gov. Jerry Brown of California was\nencouraged to jump in and did so. Hubert Humphrey made noises too.”“Basically,\nthe leaders of ABC said Carter was both too inexperienced and too conservative\nto be the Democratic nominee. It may also be true that many of them didn’t\nknow Carter and he owed them nothing, so it was a pure power play,” said Mr.\nSabato.It was not only Mr. Trump and Mr. Romney who were losing theoretical\ngeneral election matchups as they eyed their party’s nomination. Gallup polls\nshowed Ronald Reagan behind President Carter 40 percent to 34 percent in March\n1980; George H.W. Bush trailed Michael Dukakis 53 percent to 38 percent in\nJune 1988; Bill Clinton trailed President Bush 44 percent to 25 percent in\nMarch 1992; and Bob Dole lagged behind President Clinton 47 percent to 34\npercent in March 1996.History shows that some candidates turned it around and\nothers didn’t._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Donald Trump supporters see double-standard in GOP establishment's 'unelectable' argument - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#DonaldTrump supporters see double-standard in GOP establishment's 'unelectable' argument: https://t.co/x6HOZGqILA","date":"Fri Apr 01 01:25:22 +0000 2016","favs":5,"id":{"$numberLong":"715711621721628672"},"retweets":12},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/31/donald-trump-supporters-see-double-standard-in-gop/"}

And he’s ready for more.“I intend to\noffer Americans the alternative they seek. Liberty and the freedom to succeed\nare the real American values, and I’m running for president to restore those\nvalues, make America genuinely safe, and put an end to a tired status quo,”\nsays Mr. Johnson.“One of the few constitutionally sanctioned duties of the\nfederal government is to provide for the national defense, and our government,\nin addition to being corrupt to the core, is woefully unprepared to defend our\nnation from the very real threat of cyberwar.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e62"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**The radical Islamic massacre of 79 persons, many of them Christian children, on a playground on Easter Sunday changes things in Pakistan. The terrorists’ choice of Lahore, the second largest city in Pakistan and its most sophisticated, starkly demonstrates the threat of the new terrorism. Jamaat ul-Ahrar, a splinter group of the Taliban which claimed responsibility for the atrocity, pledges its allegiance to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.Lahore is capital of Punjab province, home of more than 60 percent of Pakistan’s 185 millions. Noted for their pragmatism and modern outlook on the world, Punjabis are widely represented among the Pakistanis who have gone to live in the West. Punjab is the power base for Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his brother, the chief minister and power broker. Punjab had been largely spared the terrorism of the last two decades and the answering counteroffensive of the military.The Sharifs’ success has depended on support of the religiously devout, and the financial assistance of Saudi Arabia. Pakistan has been under military rule for more than half its existence, and the civilian rule of the Sharif brothers now stands in jeopardy. The military has been struggling to control a growing radical Islamic insurgency in Karachi, the enormous port city. Terrorists massacred 132 Muslim children at a military school in Peshawar in 2014, the northwest frontier province adjoining Afghanistan.Massacres in Pakistan, inflicting a toll far greater than in massacres in the West, have been largely ignored by Western media. These new strikes at the heart of the civilian regime signals a growing danger in an unstable country. At its creation, carved from Muslim majority areas in British India in 1947, Pakistan was made up of two disparate territories at the extremes of the subcontinent, separated by nearly a thousand miles of Indian territory. The eastern half of Pakistan broke away in 1972 and became Bangladesh. Pakistan was confronted with other contradictions. Mohammed Ali Jinnah, the founding leader of the country who died shortly after the creation, was not a devout Muslim. Neither were most of his colleagues, nor the military leadership. That changed.Pakistan has had an on-again, off-again alliance with the United States since the 1947 partition, and lately growing ties between the United States and India have soured Pakistan’s once close friendship with the United States. Closer ties between the United States and India have given rise to anti-Americanism sentiment in Pakistan.Washington policymakers had once regarded Pakistan as a bloc to Soviet ambitions to reach the Indian Ocean, and as a counter to Jawaharlal Nehru’s alliance with the Soviets. After the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan at the end of 1979, the United States used Pakistan as a base to oust the Soviets with the help of NATO allies, and later to oust the Taliban regime. If the Pakistan generals can’t curb the growing terrorist movements, Pakistan might become a fertile recruiting ground for the Islamic State and its dream of a worldwide Muslim terrorist network. That would be bad news for America and the West.\n\n","title":"EDITORIAL: Growing terrorism in Pakistan - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"EDITORIAL: Growing terrorism in #Pakistan https://t.co/jBIiuYEWb5 #LahoreAttack #LahoreBlast https://t.co/lhH2odNaQF","date":"Fri Apr 01 00:49:17 +0000 2016","favs":2,"id":{"$numberLong":"715702539644190720"},"retweets":5},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/31/editorial-growing-terrorism-in-pakistan/#.Vv3EoV4UvG8.twitter"}

That is no longer true.While he’s telling voters that he will bring “jobs back to America,” the fact is that Japan is the one creating millions of jobs in our country.Toyota, Honda and other European automakers have manufacturing plants across our country, where Americans are turning out cars, automotive parts and engines by the millions.Most of these plants are set up in right-to-work states in the South where they don’t have to deal with unions, “and that in turn has led to supplier parks being established nearby,” says ace Washington Post Fact Checker Glenn Kessler.“Michigan would have to pull up its socks in a big way,” says Gary Hufbauer, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “You might be able to bring some auto production back to the United States but not Michigan.”“In real terms, U.S. factories produced more output (looking at straight output or value added) last year than ever before in history,” says Dan Ikenson, director of trade policy studies at the free market Cato Institute.“Year after year (with the exception of recessions), the sector breaks new records with respect to output, revenues, exports, imports, return on investment,” he adds._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"DONALD LAMBRO: Donald Trump, Ted Cruz falling in polls - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Donald Lambro say images are slipping https://t.co/4WqLDbF6GW #Election2016 #Cruz #Trump https://t.co/Kl7cOn9KlO","date":"Fri Apr 01 00:46:50 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"715701924838969344"},"retweets":5},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/31/donald-lambro-donald-trump-ted-cruz-falling-in-pol/#.Vv3ECLYA3vo.twitter"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e64"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**President Obama’s cavalier attitude toward the Brussels terrorist bombing (a Benghazi bump in the road) — as well as his detachment from and “no-show” at last November’s Paris gathering of 41 world leaders showing their solidarity against the Islamic jihadi terrorist attacks — was an embarrassment for all Americans. His aloofness should not come as a surprise.He understands better than most Americans that the plague of jihadi terrorism has its roots in Islam. It explains why he directed that all training manuals be purged of anything that linked Islam with terrorism. Furthermore, Mr. Obama’s deliberate obfuscation of the scriptures of Islam, as found in the Koran and Shariah law, which drives jihadi acts of terrorism, has facilitated the spread of Islam and its supremacist ideology. It has aided and abetted the enemy.Clearly, that’s why Mr. Obama replaced the “Global War on Terror” with terms like “countering violent extremism” and “workplace violence.” It confuses the American public on the rationale derived from the Koran, Shariah law and the hadiths that drive jihadists to commit these acts of terrorism. The Islamic jihadists have been thoroughly indoctrinated in the core canonical beliefs of Islam as written in the suras (chapters) of the Koran. It certainly is not for a lack of job or education opportunities, which is part of the progressives’ nonsense propaganda.Using the term “radical Islam” to describe the jihadi terrorism implies that there is some “moderate form of Islam.” Regrettably, that is not the case, nor have these jihadists hijacked Islam. The Islamic leader of Turkey, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who supports the establishment of a worldwide caliphate, has repeatedly rejected allied attempts to portray Turkey as an example of “moderate Islam.” He states that “there is no moderate Islam. Islam is Islam. Democracy is the train we ride to achieve our ultimate objective, which is a world dominated by Islam.” According to the Koran, it is an obligation for all Muslims to conduct jihad against all infidels.While many progressives will argue that Islamic supremacism is not the only way of construing Islam, they point out that there are millions of Muslims who reject Islam’s supremacism and jihadi acts of terrors. However, this misses the point that the authoritative interpretation by the scholars of Islam is literally drawn from the scriptures. Those who stray from this line of thinking are cast as “racists” or “Islamophobic,” a term conjured up by the Muslim Brotherhood. We should never forget the Muslim Brotherhood’s creed, which is to destroy America from within by our own miserable hands and replace our Constitution with Shariah law. Further, the senior jurist of the Muslim Brother hood, cleric Yusuf al-Qaradawi, has stated that the Koran or Shariah law cannot be amended to conform to changing human values and standards. His view, is that the Koran and Shariah present the absolute norm to which all human values and conduct must conform.As Andrew Bostom points out, Shariah supremacism with its hateful bellicosity and bigotry remains, regrettably, the predominant mindset of the world’s Muslims. He states, based on the latest available information, that 77 percent of Muslims from the five largest Sunni Muslim populations (Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Nigeria) and 83 percent of Shiite Iranians want Shariah as the law of the land. Further, 91 percent of liberated Iraqis and 90 percent of Afghan Muslims support Shariah.The late political scientist, Samuel Huntington, pointed out that Islam is totally incompatible with Western culture and traditions. They can never coexist. Islam is at war with the West. It is a clash of civilizations.Even Alexis de Tocqueville, the French philosopher, commented after studying the Koran in 1838 that it only encourages but commands a holy war against all infidels, as well as the necessity for obeying the Prophet Muhammad. This what drives the Islamic State today; its members believe everything should be done as it was during the reign of the prophet.Every thinking American should be able to understand that the Koran and Shariah law command jihad warfare in order to subjugate the world to a totalitarian Islamic caliphate order. Islam is not a religion of peace. It is a “totalitarian ideology bent on world domination, masquerading as a religion.” Until the threat of Islam is understood, we will not be successful in defeating this enemy.With all the ISIS atrocities committed, President al-Sisi of Egypt felt Islam was getting a “bad image.” Therefore, on Jan. 1, 2015, speaking at the Cairo site of the Vatican version of Sunni Islamic religious education, at al-Azhar University, Mr. al-Sisi charged the leading Sunni clerics with reforming Islam, which has not happened in over 1,300 years. Regrettably, not one western leader endorsed this “dramatic call.” For that matter, neither has the pope. Our leaders continue with the drivel of expanding “interfaith dialogue,” which is nonsense since it is part of the Muslim Brotherhood propaganda to gain acceptance for Shariah law.There should be no doubt that unreformed Islam is the enemy. America must take the lead in addressing this enemy. The Islamic State is the current point of the spear which must be thoroughly crushed. A movement must also be started to support President al-Sisi’s call for a reformation of Islam to bring Islam into the 21st century.**• **_James A.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e65"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**If human rights are sidelined again this week in the Obama-Xi meeting — it will not only be an unconscionable abandonment of China’s best and brightest who today suffer jail, torture and death for freedom, but it will be a colossal strategic mistake as well.The Obama administration cannot meekly “raise” human rights concerns when it is increasingly clear that our security and economic interests with China cannot be ensured without dramatic human rights improvements and advances in the rule of law.Mr. Xi comes to Washington in a time of growing bilateral tensions. In addition to a nuclear North Korea, economic slowdowns, and strained relations with China’s neighbors, Mr. Xi has also presided over an extraordinary assault on the rule of law, human rights, religious freedom and civil society. The scope of Mr. Xi’s repression is immense, with more arrests, censorship and control now than at any time since Chairman Mao ruled China.Rights lawyers and labor organizers are jailed; Hong Kong booksellers disappear; journalists and religious leaders are harassed and detained; even the family members of overseas journalists — who dare to print information critical of President Xi — are targeted. Under his leadership, the Chinese government has pushed through new laws and drafted legislation that would legitimize and further curtail civil liberties and civil society and expand censorship of the Internet.Draconian population control policies also remain in place and gendercide — the extermination of the girl-child through sex-selection abortion — is a massive, festering problem that has catastrophic social and economic consequences.President Xi’s shift toward a hard authoritarianism is a disturbing development. More than any time in recent memory, China is becoming a garrison state, with security forces empowered to silence dissent and drive a wedge between the Chinese people and the international community. These facts have real strategic and diplomatic consequences.The Obama administration cannot continue to engage in the fantasy that avoiding human rights will somehow bring about a change of heart in Beijing. It will not. A new approach is needed. The U.S. administration must raise human rights because U.S. interests and better U.S.-China relations depend on it.There is a direct link between China’s domestic human rights problems and the security and prosperity of the United States. The health of the U.S. economy and environment, the safety of our food and drug supplies, the security of our investments and personal information in cyberspace, and the stability of the Pacific region will depend on China complying with international law, allowing the free flow of news and information, complying with its World Trade Organization obligations, and protecting the basic rights of Chinese citizens, including the fundamental freedoms of religion, speech and association.There are also clear strategic imperatives for the United States to prioritize human rights and democratic governance in China. A government that does not respect the rights and basic dignity of its own people cannot be assumed to be a responsible actor in the global arena. A government that brutally crushes the yearning of its citizens for fundamental freedoms cannot be a trusted partner able to work on a number of pressing bilateral and global issues.President Obama must end his legacy of silence in the face of China’s repression and human rights abuses. He cannot be morally neutral, but must show leadership and resolve because only the United States has the power and prestige to stand up to China’s intransigence.U.S. officials must not shy away from meeting with the Dalai Lama or other dissidents. We must use visa bans on Chinese officials who egregiously violate human rights. We must connect Internet and press freedoms as both economic and human rights priorities. And we must demand, repeatedly and clearly, that the unconditional release of political prisoners and an end to torture in detention is in the interest of better U.S.-China relations.It is appalling that Liu Xiaobo remains in prison — particularly given that a fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate resides in the White House. I do not believe the president has done enough to seek the freedom of Liu Xiaobo or his wife Liu Xia. If President Obama will only meekly seek the release of a fellow Nobel Prize laureate — then what is being done for the thousands of other imprisoned political prisoners? The answer is not enough.Until the release of Liu Xiaobo, and until many other rights defenders are a clear and consistent priority of U.S.-China relations, the Chinese government will continue to believe that it can act with impunity and without any consequences.Human rights concerns are not issues to be sidelined in a bilateral relationship. They are vital to furthering the safety and protection of our private citizens and businesses, essential to global security and peaceful dispute resolution, and critically important to ensuring the prosperity and freedom desired by both the American and Chinese peoples.**• **_Rep.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e67"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**The Republic of Turkey, long a democratizing Muslim country solidly in the Western camp, now finds itself internally racked and at the center of two external crises, the civil war in next-door Syria and the illegal immigration that is changing European politics. The prospects for Turkey and its neighbors are worrisome, if not ominous.The key development was the coming to power of Recep Tayyip Erdogan in 2002, when a fluke election outcome gave him total control of the government, which he then brilliantly parlayed into a personal dominion. After years of restraint and modesty, his real personality — grandiloquent, Islamist, and aggressive — came out. Now, he seeks to rule as a despot, an ambition that causes his country incessant, avoidable problems.Initially, President Erdogan’s disciplined approach to finance permitted the Turkish economy to achieve China-like economic growth and won him increasing electoral support while making Ankara a new player in regional affairs. But then conspiracy theories, corruption, shortsightedness and incompetence cut into the growth, making Turkey economically vulnerable.Initially, Mr. Erdogan took unprecedented steps to resolve his country’s Kurdish problem, acknowledging that this ethnic minority making up roughly 20 percent of the country’s population has its own culture and allowing it to express itself in its own language. But then, for electoral reasons, he abruptly reversed himself in 2015, resulting in a more-than-ever determined and violent Kurdish insurgency, to the point that civil war has become a real prospect.Initially, Mr. Erdogan accepted the traditional autonomy of the major institutions in Turkish life — law courts, the military, the press, banks, schools. No longer; now he seeks to control everything. Take the case of two prominent journalists, Can Dundar and Erdem Gul: because their newspaper, Cumhuriyet, exposed the Turkish government’s clandestine support for the Islamic State (ISIS), Mr. Erdogan had them imprisoned on the surreal charges of espionage and terrorism. Worse, when the Constitutional Court (Turkey’s highest) reversed this sentence, Mr. Erdogan accused the court of ruling “against the country and its people” and indicated he would ignore its decision.Initially, Mr. Erdogan maintained cautious and correct relations with Moscow, benefiting economically and using Russia as a balance against the United States. But since the reckless Turkish shootdown of a Russian warplane last November, followed by a defiant lack of apology, the little bully (Erdogan) has more than met his match with the big bully (Russia’s Vladimir Putin) and Turkey is paying the price. French President Francois Hollande has publicly warned of “a risk of war” between Turkey and Russia.Initially, Mr. Erdogan’s accommodating policies translated into a calming of domestic politics; now, his bellicosity has led to a string of minor and major acts of violence, to the point that Ankara suffers from more political violence than Baghdad, Beirut, Kabul, or Mogadishu.Initially, Turkey became a plausible candidate for membership in the European Union thanks to Mr. Erdogan’s muted behavior. Now, his slide toward despotism and Islamism means the Europeans go merely through the motions of pretending to negotiate with Ankara, while counting on the Republic of Cyprus to blackball its application; as Turkish journalist Burak Bekdil notes, “modern Turkey has never been this galactically distant from the core values enshrined by the European civilization and its institutions.”In the early months of the Syrian uprising, Mr. Erdogan offered sage advice to the dictator in Damascus, Bashar Assad, about relaxing his grip and allowing political participation. Things have gone so awry that — as Mr. Dundar and Mr. Gul reported — Mr. Erdogan now supports ISIS, the most fanatical and Islamist organization of today, and perhaps ever. That support has taken many forms: permitting foreigners to cross Turkey to reach Syria, allowing recruitment in Turkey, providing medical care, and provisioning money and arms. Despite this, ISIS, fearful of betrayal by Ankara, threatens and attacks Turks.Mr. Erdogan’s error of backing ISIS and other Sunni Islamist organizations in Syria has hurt him in another way, leading to a massive influx of Syrian refugees to Turkey, where, increasingly unwelcomed by the indigenous population, they cause new social and economic strains.Which brings us to Mr. Erdogan’s latest gambit. The many Syrian refugees wanting to go on to northwestern Europe provide him with a handy mechanism to blackmail the European Union: pay me huge amounts of money (6 billion euros at latest count) and permit 80 million Turks to travel visa-free to your countries, or I will export more Syrians, Iraqis, Afghans, Somalis, et al. to you.So far, the ploy has worked. Led by Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Europeans are succumbing to Mr. Erdogan’s demands. But this may well be a Pyrrhic victory, hurting Mr. Erdogan’s long-term interests. In the first place, forcing Europeans to pretend they are not being blackmailed and to welcome Turkey with clenched teeth, creates a foul mood, further reducing, if not killing off, Turkish chances for membership.Second, Mr. Erdogan’s game has prompted a profound and probably lasting shift in mood in Europe against accepting more immigrants from the Middle East — including Turks — as demonstrated by the poor showing of Ms. Merkel’s party in elections earlier this month.This is just the start. In combination, these errors by Mr. Erdogan point to more crises ahead.

Donald Trump is assisting with the task. The mouth that roars rarely soars, and his unthinking vulgarity is beginning to bore. It’s hard to know what he was thinking when he said women who have abortions should be punished. Surely the consequence of an unwanted pregnancy is punishment enough.Gaffes and boners and slips that could sink ships make the Wisconsin primary next week ever more crucial. The pollsters, who are often wrong but often right, say Ted Cruz, the last best hope of the Republican establishment, is gaining on The Donald. Late momentum is what produces upsets.But the elites of the establishment — the elected Republican politicians and their tail of consultants, advisers, strategists and flotsam and jetsam of the endless presidential campaign — won’t have much time to celebrate for surviving with their dignity, civility and general wonderfulness intact. Donald Trump has changed things, and permanently. The peasants have tasted milk and honey, and they like it better than table scraps.The Trump disease, as the elites regard it, is infectious and is likely to start an epidemic. A young and successful Minnesota businessman is challenging even House Speaker Paul Ryan, the pet rock of the establishment. Just out of the gate, Paul F. Nehlan III — with all those Roman numerals on his name he sounds like he might be the chairman of the house committee at the country club — talks like a thinking man’s Donald Trump.He mocks Speaker Ryan’s remarks to a pep rally for House interns the other day in the chamber of the Ways and Means Committee as an example of the washingtonspeak that the speaker and his like-minded colleagues have perfected as the capital’s lingua franca. “Mr. Ryan appealed for unity,” he told the interns, “unity in Congress, unity among the public, unity as a nation. We should test theories and ideas, he asserted, rather than impugning motives. … The system works, he explained, only if we have mutual respect for one another.“The problem is that the Washington class, of which Paul Ryan has become a top-ranking member, hasn’t had any respect for the rest of us for a very long time. Consequently, yes, we have lost faith in our representatives and in our government.”This is at the core of the Trump message, spoken with considerable less felicity in the language of those in an earlier time who were called “the horny-handed sons of toil.” There’s anger at the embrace of big government, waves of illegal immigration, job-killing international trade on terms dictated from abroad. The Donald’s rivals have said similar things, except for that nice Kasich boy who doesn’t want to hurt the feelings of his bipartisan betters.Mr. Ryan’s speech to the interns, available on the blog site of American Thinker magazine, is actually unintended mockery of the kumbaya sentiments the establishment class holds so dear. “All of us as leaders can hold ourselves to the highest standards of integrity and decency,” the speaker told them. “Instead of playing to your anxieties, we can appeal to your aspirations. Instead of playing the identity politics of ‘our base’ and ‘their base,’ we unite people around ideas and principles. And instead of being timid, we go bold.”He is said to have kept a straight face with this attempt at a Churchillian wind-up, because Mr. Ryan knows better than anyone that Republicans don’t do bold. Only former Democrats like Ronald Reagan bring a remembrance of bold to the fray. Once-born Republicans do caution, timidity and retreat. Big talk in November invariably becomes premature compromise in February.Disappointment and disgust is what’s driving the revolt of the peasants, and compels some, like Paul Nehlan, to make the charge of the Light Brigade. Mr. Nehlan is a businessman, an executive of a Wisconsin company that makes water-filtration systems. He’s also an inventor, which is no doubt what draws him to challenge the inefficiency of something that’s not working the way it should.His challenge of Mr. Ryan is a challenge of the Washington ruling class, and it’s a message for the smug and self-satisfied who hang out with the ruling class. The well of anger and disgust that Donald Trump, and Mr. Nehlan, are drawing water from is a deep one.“The things we want [our representatives] to do, Mr. Ryan and his friends in Washington can never seem to find the stomach or backbone to do. Yet they clearly have the political courage to plunge neck-deep into the things we’ve literally begged them not to do. The Ryan establishment is going bold, all right. Boldly off track. Boldly amok. Boldly wrong.”**• **_Wesley Pruden is editor in chief emeritus of The Times._\n\n","title":"WESLEY PRUDEN: Donald Trump loved by voters, loathed by establishment - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Wesley Pruden says the peasants have tasted the milk and honey https://t.co/EM0Owww5xt #Trump #PaulRyan #GOP https://t.co/miFrPG1U2s","date":"Fri Apr 01 00:36:58 +0000 2016","favs":6,"id":{"$numberLong":"715699440917561344"},"retweets":4},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/31/wesley-pruden-donald-trump-loved-by-voters-loathed/#.Vv3CQJrwlb0.twitter"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e69"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Seven years on, the size of the Obamacare disaster is only beginning to emerge. Fixing it won’t be as easy as some of the candidates for president seem to think it will be. The Congressional Budget Office estimated last week that over the next decade Obamacare will add $1.4 trillion to the nation’s debt.Many of the so-called cures are utterly unrealistic. Hillary Clinton, for example, after proposing new and expensive additions to Obamacare, now suggests a solution concocted of one part fantasy and two parts nonsense. She would impose a 4 percent tax on millionaires to pay for increased costs. But her tax would yield only $150 billion over 10 years, a fraction of what her plan would require. Even millionaires are not what they used to be.Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of Health and Human Services, said last year that the Obamacare website, the heart of the president’s scheme, cost $834 million to build. Bloomberg News puts the cost at $2.1 billion. At any price it represents the obstacle to medical progress. The exchanges that were crucial to encouraging the competition that would lower costs, have been another disaster. All but 12 of the original 23 have failed and congressional critics say the $1.2 billion lent to them is unlikely ever to be repaid.Obamacare’s promise to insure Americans who had no health insurance is increasingly suspect. Of more than 11 million who signed up by the end of the enrollment period last year, 3 million had dropped out by the end of the year. The Heritage Foundation estimates that a full quarter of those eligible either didn’t buy a plan, or later dropped out.The president’s most memorable promise, that Obamacare would not disrupt existing doctor-patient and health-care insurance arrangements, has long since evaporated. Insurers continue to drastically reduce the choice of doctors and hospitals. The industry, trying to sugarcoat a label on disaster, calls this “narrowing networks.” The Heritage Foundation says even fewer choices lie in wait for consumers in the future.The critics of Obamacare are challenged to come up with an alternative to the disaster President Obama’s scheme has wrought. But an alternate drawn up with the recklessness of Obamacare would create another and equally crippling disaster. Resolving the complexities of the American medical scene in one comprehensive program has been an invitation to debacle for more than a half-century. Health care costs account for one-sixth of the American economy, and these costs are growing as American medicine demands new and expensive technology. Comparing American medicine to medical programs in other countries, particularly those with single payer systems, ignores the cold statistics that tell the actual story. Survival rates for breast cancer, for example, are much better here than in the most advanced European health systems.Strenuous efforts to repeal and replace Obamacare must go forward, and this time common sense must be a guide. Prohibitions against crossing state lines to buy insurance must be repealed as a start. Simply removing that obstacle could go a long way toward the competition that would reduce health-care costs. One step at a time, and this time it must be a step forward.\n\n","title":"EDITORIAL: The emerging disaster of Obamacare - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"EDITORIAL: The emerging disaster of #Obamacare https://t.co/NZt5VqgPav #HealthCare #ACA https://t.co/kvEOyjjQHV","date":"Fri Apr 01 00:34:39 +0000 2016","favs":8,"id":{"$numberLong":"715698858194563075"},"retweets":23},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/31/editorial-the-emerging-disaster-of-obamacare/#.Vv3B8FodsCk.twitter"}

But they now live in different\nneighborhoods.”The number of children in the District hit a 20-year low in\n2010, with 101,340 counted, according to census data analyzed by the Annie E.\nCasey Foundation — a child welfare research foundation. By 2014, that number\nhad jumped to 115,305.The trend follows an overall population boom that\nstarted several years earlier in the District, which today has more than\n670,000 residents.“Only since 2011, the number of children began to grow, and\nin the last four years, the child population has grown at a faster rate than\nthe adult population,” the blog says.The increased child population has been\nshifting from neighborhoods east of the Anacostia to more gentrified areas\nsuch as Petworth, Brightwood and Crestwood in Northwest.To understand where\nchildren are living, the CFO used the five-year summaries from the Census\nBureau’s American Community Survey, which include data at the census tract\nlevel and cluster neighborhoods.“Most children are found in residential\nneighborhoods outside of downtown, especially in the neighborhoods just east\nof Rock Creek Park and at the southeastern edge of the city,” the blog\nsays.From 2010 to 2014, the number of children living east of the Anacostia\nRiver was 1,280 fewer than the five-year period from 2006 to 2010, the CFO\nfound.Eastland Gardens and Kenilworth, both east of the Anacostia River, had a\n50 percent decline in the number of children who lived there in the period\nfrom 2010 to 2014.The CFO called it “a continuing trend for these\nneighborhoods.”The number of children in the River\nTerrace/Benning/Greenway/Dupont Park cluster — also east of the river —\ndeclined by one-third.By contrast, the gentrifying Takoma/Manor\nPark/Brightwood Park cluster of neighborhoods has added more than 1,000\nchildren from 2010 to 2014.The boom was even bigger in the Brightwood\nPark/Crestwood/Petworth cluster, which added more than 2,000 children.Still,\nBrenda Donald, deputy mayor for health and human services, said the vast\namount of social services for children are being allocated east of the\nAnacostia River._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"D.C. child population grows, shifts to neighborhoods of young professionals - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"D.C. gains a young gentrification generation: https://t.co/2OCrn7qmfs #census #population https://t.co/umGmHmEeNz","date":"Fri Apr 01 00:22:17 +0000 2016","favs":4,"id":{"$numberLong":"715695744242593792"},"retweets":1},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/31/dc-child-population-grows-shifts-to-neighborhoods-/"}

Ryan already disqualified.With the possibility of a\ncontested convention in Cleveland very much a live option, the rule that has\nattracted attention, known as Rule 40(b), was adopted at the party’s 2012\nconvention and requires a candidate to win a majority of delegates in at least\neight states to be considered for the nomination. The move angered allies of\nformer Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who felt it was intended to minimize Mr. Paul’s\nrole at the 2012 convention in Tampa and smooth the path for nominee Mitt\nRomney.** SEE ALSO: Donald Trump says he had a ‘terrific meeting’ with RNC\nofficials **While the question of whether the 2012 rule will apply to the 2016\ngathering is a matter of sharp dispute, the fact that the debate is on shows\nthe fierce battle for every precious delegate in the increasingly scrambled\nand unpredictable Republican primary battle.Mr. Cruz argues that at this\npoint, it would be a “terrible idea” for “Washington power brokers” to change\nthe rules because they’re unhappy with the crop of candidates the voters have\npicked.“Those rules say that in order to be on the ballot, you have to have\nwon eight states. Only two of us will meet that threshold — me and Donald\nTrump,” Mr. Cruz told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt this week. “Those\nwill be the two names on the ballot.** SEE ALSO: Ted Cruz leads Donald Trump\nby 10 points in Wisconsin: poll **“And I think if the Washington dealmakers\ntry to change the rules to cook the books and insert their favorite dealmaker,\nI think there would rightly be a revolt of the voters,” he said. “We would\nhave had elections in 50 states, and we need to honor the will of the voters\nand respect what they decide.”Ironically, the rule was originally intended to\ntry to box out anti-establishment candidates like Mr. Trump, said Morton\nBlackwell, a longtime Republican National Committeeman from Virginia.Mr.\nBlackwell had unsuccessfully pushed for the rule to be changed prior to the\nstart of the 2016 primary season. But he now says that “it’s too late to\nchange the rules fairly.”“I think it would be potentially disastrous for the\nparty to alienate the huge numbers of Republicans who are not establishment\npeople, and that constitutes the vast majority of the people who participated\nin these primaries and caucuses,” he said. “It could hurt the party badly,\nsplit people, because it’s a very strong point that they would have changed\nthe rules in order to affect who gets nominated.”Mr. Trump is the only\ncandidate who has cleared the threshold so far. Mr. Cruz has won at least\neight states, but because of proportionality rules did not win a majority of\nthe delegates in all of them.Ohio Gov. John Kasich, whose lone win in the GOP\nprimary contest came in his home state, said Thursday that the convention\nrules for 2016 are not yet set in stone, and that the rules committee would\nmake those determinations.“When you’re a delegate at a convention and you have\na candidate who beats Hillary Clinton in the last Fox poll by 11 points, and\nwe’re going to say that that guy doesn’t get considered?” Mr. Kasich said on\nFox News. “I mean, come on. That’s not going to happen.”**Boxing out\nrivals**If any sort of threshold remains in place, that could also box out\npotential compromise candidates such as Mr. Romney or Mr. Ryan.

(AP) — California and New York are poised to become the\nhighest-paid minimum-wage states in the nation after governors for both\nreached deals with lawmakers to raise the lowest amount a worker can be paid\nto a record-shattering $15 an hour.Gov. Jerry Brown said he will sign\nCalifornia’s new minimum-wage bill Monday in Los Angeles after it passed the\nLegislature on Thursday.Across the country in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo\nreached a tentative deal late Thursday with his state’s top lawmakers to also\nraise his state’s minimum wage to $15.The actions in two of the nation’s most\nlabor-friendly states come as the income divide has become a key issue across\nthe U.S. in this presidential election year. President Barack Obama, who first\nproposed an increase to the federal minimum wage in 2013, applauded the\nstates’ actions and called on the Republican-controlled Congress to “keep up\nwith the rest of the country.”“California takes a massive leap forward today\nin the fight to rebalance our nation’s economy,” said Art Pulaski, executive\nsecretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation.California’s current\n$10 an hour minimum wage is tied with Massachusetts for the highest among\nstates. Only Washington, D.C., at $10.50 per hour is higher. New York’s\nminimum wage is $9.Democrats who control both legislative chambers in\nCalifornia hailed the increase as a boon to more than 2 million workers.\nBrown, also a Democrat, said it proves the nation’s largest state can get\nthings done and help people get ahead.Republicans, however, echoed fears from\nbusiness owners and economists that California’s annual increases — eventually\ntied to inflation — will compound the state’s image as hostile to\nbusiness.Assemblyman Jim Patterson, R-Fresno, said the increase would force\nsmall business owners to make layoffs “with tears in their eyes,” ultimately\nresulting in less employment.The increases would start with a boost from $10\nto $10.50 on Jan. 1. Businesses with 25 or fewer employees would have an extra\nyear to comply. Increases of $1 an hour would come every January until 2022.\nThe governor could delay increases in times of budgetary or economic\ndownturns.The tentative deal reached by New York officials Thursday would be\nphased in regionally in the nation’s fourth-largest state. It would also\neventually affect more than 2 million workers.In New York City, the wage would\nincrease to $15 by the end of 2018, though businesses with fewer than 10\nemployees would get an extra year. In the New York City suburbs of Long Island\nand Westchester County, the wage would rise to $15 by the end of 2022. The\nincreases are even more drawn out upstate, where the wage would hit $12.50 in\n2021 and then increase to $15 based on an undetermined schedule.“This minimum\nwage increase will be of national significance,” Cuomo, a Democrat, told\nreporters Thursday. “It’s raising the minimum wage in a way that’s\nresponsible.”Cuomo had initially proposed a simpler phase-in: three years in\nNew York City and six years elsewhere. The more gradual, nuanced approach was\nthe result of negotiations with Republicans in the state Senate who worried\nsuch a sharp increase would devastate businesses, particularly in the upstate\nregion’s more fragile economy.Brown was previously reluctant to raise\nCalifornia’s base wage. He negotiated the deal with labor unions to head off\ncompeting labor-backed November ballot initiatives that would have imposed\nswifter increases without some of the safeguards included in the legislation.\nBrown now says California’s fast-growing economy can absorb the raises without\nthe problems predicted by opponents._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"California, New York poised to raise minimum wage to $15 - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"BREAKING: California lawmakers approve $15 per hour minimum wage, send to Gov.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e6f"},"content":"Heading up the steps to the team plane out of Florida, Dusty Baker had one\ntitle under his belt already. In his first spring training as the manager of\nthe Washington Nationals, Baker led them to the best record in the Grapefruit\nLeague. Washington returns north after a hearty 18-4-3 record, good for an\n.818 winning percentage.No streets will be cleared, and no time at the White\nHouse reserved for congratulations for the less-than-rousing title of Kings of\nSpring Training. On Friday, the Nationals will play one of two final\nexhibition games in Washington. They will fly on Sunday to Atlanta, their new\nteam intact, to settle in for Monday afternoon’s opener against the hapless\nBraves.From the start, the Nationals will begin what is expected to be a\nseason of ground-and-pound by the National League’s top teams.Last year, the\nNL Central had three teams with 97 or more wins. In 2014, zero NL teams won 97\ngames. That year, the Nationals had the best record in the league, 96-66, to\nwin the NL East. In 2013, there was one 97-win team. In 2012, two; 2011, one;\n2010, one. Three in the same division? Forget it. There weren’t even three\nacross the league those seasons.A similar formula is expected to emerge this\nseason. In the East, the Nationals and New York Mets are aligned to bludgeon\nthe rest of the division. The Miami Marlins could provide some tussles, but\nthe Philadelphia Phillies and Braves are projected as two of the worst teams\nin baseball.It’s the same idea in the NL Central, though the Pittsburgh\nPirates, the winners of 97 games last season who were bounced after a one-game\nplayoff series, may take a step back. Regardless, it’s still the ever-steady\nSt. Louis Cardinals, the loaded Chicago Cubs and the Pirates in the Central.\nThe Milwaukee Brewers and Cincinnati Reds should be drawing checks from other\nteams thanks to the stat-padding each will provide.In the NL West, there is a\nbit more balance. The Arizona Diamondbacks could be slightly improved. Yet,\nstalwarts the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants are expected to\ncontrol the division.The only recent season somewhat comparable to last\nseason’s heavy-handed campaigns by the upper tier of the league is 2004. Five\nteams won at least 91 games that season. The Giants were among them, though\ntheir 91 wins did not place them into the playoffs; the current setup, with a\nsecond wild card, would have provided them entrance to the postseason.Another\nway to look at look at the reckoning of 2015 is from the bottom up. Six teams\nlost more than 90 games, topping the five teams that won more than\n90.Projections from the analytics site FanGraphs propose that the bottom six\nteams during this season will be from the National League. Of the bottom 10,\neight will be in the NL. Both the Phillies and Braves are projected to lose at\nleast 90 games. The Mets and Nationals will be sure to send thank-you\nnotes.The Nationals move toward this lack of parity in the league with small\nroster decisions remaining. One person from the prospective bench crew and one\nfrom the bullpen will likely be shed by Monday following the final two\nexhibition games on Friday and Saturday against the Minnesota Twins at\nNationals Park.“I think that’s our toughest decisions,” Baker said recently.\n“Who our bench is going to be and who our last couple of bullpen slots are\ngoing to be. It’s tougher now than it usually is because we have better\nplayers.”Baker’s challenge with the final roster moves is who he chooses not\nto keep on the roster despite a successful spring. On the bench, outfielders\nMatt den Dekker, Chris Heisey and Reed Johnson join infielder Brendan Ryan as\nfinal considerations.At 28 years old, den Dekker is the youngest of the group.\nHis late-season surge last year surprised, though Baker wasn’t here then, den\nDekker bats left-handed — there are already two left-handed bats on the bench\n— and the fourth outfielder spot seems to be in Michael A. Taylor’s clear\npossession. Den Dekker also has minor league options. Heisey had a mediocre\nspring, for what it’s worth, and hasn’t hit better than .237 in the last three\nseasons. In his corner is the fact he played from for Baker from 2010 through\n2013, is right-handed and had success as a pinch-hitter with a .926 career OPS\nin the role.Johnson and Ryan appear longshots. Ryan had a spectacular and\nuncharacteristic spring at the plate, where he hit .379. His bat has never\nbeen the reason he is in the major leagues. It’s his glove. Ryan had a run\nwith the Seattle Mariners where many in the league considered him the game’s\nbest defensive shortstop, but the Nationals already have a backup at shortstop\nin Stephen Drew. Ryan’s ability to play second base and even third base or the\noutfield could be beneficial. Johnson also had an excellent spring. However,\nthe 39-year-old playing just 17 games last season because of injury needs to\nbe weighed._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Dusty Baker, Nationals will find it won't be lonely at top of National League - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Dusty Baker, #Nats will find it won’t be lonely atop of National League, @Todd_Dybas writes: https://t.co/AnU2EDHXrN https://t.co/aMJzlfvIPV","date":"Thu Mar 31 20:52:03 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"715642840613797890"},"retweets":2},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/1UFWqcZ"}

There is a difference between loving your country or your culture, and xenophobia. The world understands this. It’s OK to love your country, your culture, where you came from. It’s OK to celebrate it, even if it’s European, African, Russian or yes, American.The progressive culture wants you to forget these truths and buy into the multicultural narrative that it is desirable, even mandatory, to destroy your society in the name of open borders. You are a racist if you don’t.Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn’t buy into it. He stands up for the interests of Russia in terms of geopolitical affairs. This is why the world respects him and laughs at the Obama administration and in turn, the United States of America (enter James Taylor, stage right, guitar in hand).I’m not talking about the absence of good governance, corruption, or aggressive militarism and lack of respect for others who don’t agree with you, that exist in Russia. I’m not talking about stifling the political opposition. I’m not talking about making bad economic decisions, to the detriment of the Russian people, and enriching those in power. I fully realize all of these evils are alive and well in Russia. I understand Russia has turned into a totalitarian oligarchy.What I am talking about is loving your country and putting it first when it comes to dealing with those who may threaten it. This I can respect. This is what Donald Trump was talking about when he said he respects Mr. Putin’s strength. He was talking about this aspect of Mr. Putin’s leadership and this aspect only.Mr. Putin has said Russia will not commit national suicide in the name of multiculturalism, like Western Europe. That is not a racist statement. It is not stupid. It is intelligent. It is smart.The United States has become the most wealthy, successful country in the world for a reason: Our heritage means something. It has worked better than anything else in human history when it comes to pulling millions out of poverty and inspiring greatness and prosperity. It is not broken and does not need to be fixed by some communist ideology.What is racist, stupid, or intolerant? Not going to the funeral of the most consequential U.S. Supreme Court justice in recent history because he was conservative is intolerant and petty. Not going to the funeral of the wife of the most consequential president since World War II because she was conservative is intolerant and petty. Taking race relations to their lowest point in decades during your presidency is racist. Inviting representatives of Black Lives Matter to the White House, who have advocated killing white policemen, is racist. For the president of the United States to do the wave with communist killers while the blood is still dripping from Belgian terrorism victims is extremely disrespectful and telling of President Obama’s real values.Saying you have a red line in Syria over chemical weapons and then doing nothing as bombs are dropped on civilians is stupid. Allowing Russia, Iran, and Syria to become the hegemon in the Middle East after thousands of American lives were lost and trillions of dollars were spent is stupid, the legitimacy of the Iraq War aside. Giving the largest state supporter of terrorism in the world $150 billion and allowing it to eventually acquire nuclear weapons to threaten the United States, our allies, and our way of life is stupid.Mr. Obama actually said while on a trip to Latin America recently that there is no real difference between communism and capitalism. I beg to differ. The next U.S. president needs to trumpet the real American values and heritage. He needs to stand up for our country and our way of life around the world. He needs to say the words that America was exceptional and can be again if we get back to what really made us great.Multiculturalism, as the left defines it, is dead. Political correctness is dead. Long live capitalism, love of country, and freedom.This is what the 2016 election is about.**• **_L.

Courtney indeed helped build a\ncase against his co-conspirators, but the investigation slowed once again when\nhe died of an apparent suicide in 2007.Authorities eventually charged Mark\nFuston in 2013 with burning down Desire Video and sentenced him to 2½ years in\nprison after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy. More than a decade after his\nbusiness burned down, however, Mr. Bussanich alleged in federal court last\nweek that the case against Fuston has unearthed evidence of racketeering that\nwarrants further charges being filed.“The federal prosecution of Defendant\nMark Fuston revealed, and brought to light, many other wrongs and acts\ncommitted by all Defendants named in this action,” Mr. Bussanich’s attorneys\nwrote. “Consequently, Plaintiffs — unable to bring a cause of action until\nthese wrongs were recently discovered and Defendant Mark Fuston was prosecuted\nin federal court — now seek damages as pled in this meritorious and timely\npled Complaint.”Attorneys for Mr. Bussanich say they only learned during\nFuston’s prosecution that the owners of nearby Adult Video Only and its\naffiliates were involved in the arson, and that they’ve been personally\nimplicated by both Fuston and the late informant.Had Mr. Bussanich known of\ntheir role, the lawsuit states, he may not have attempted to purchase Adult\nVideo Only from its owners a decade prior. In hindsight, however, his attorney\nsuggests it’s clear the competition engaged in racketeering, and now cites an\nalleged marijuana grow operation and video arcade tax scheme that Mr.\nBussanich claims he learned about while attempting to negotiate the purchase\nof Adult Video Only years earlier.Defendants “defrauded the Internal Revenue\nService, burnt down plaintiffs’ business, as well as attempted to do so to\nothers, grew marijuana illegally, and committed all acts as stated herein,\nrepeatedly over the course of decades, as a part of their illegal racketeering\nenterprise or association in fact to destroy competition and attempt to\nmonopolize profits and industry,” according to the complaint.Attorneys for Mr.\nBussanich and Adult Video Only did not immediately respond to requests for\ncomment when contacted this week by Courthouse News Service, where the suit\nwas first reported on Thursday.District Court Judge Ronald B. Leighton has\nasked plaintiffs and defendants to file a joint status report by June 26,\naccording to the case docket.\n\n","title":"Porn shop owner blames competitors for 2003 arson - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Porn shop owner blames competitors for 2003 arson https://t.co/55SylImoC6","date":"Thu Mar 31 18:58:29 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715614258659258368"},"retweets":1},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/i1S5k3"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e79"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump has given his critics enough ammunition this week to lose the Wisconsin primary, and quite possibly, the nomination.There’s little doubt the Republican National Committee, and others in the political establishment class, will use Mr. Trump’s gaffes this week — on abortion, on nuclear proliferation, on the federal government’s central role — to justify denying him the nomination at the Republican National Convention if he falls short of the 1,237 delegates he needs to win it outright.In Wisconsin, the anti-Trump forces are in full effect, and the ground seems to be shifting, away from Mr. Trump and to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Earlier this year, Mr. Trump had a lead in the Badger state — whose blue-collar workers are one of his key demographics — but he’s now fallen 10 points behind Mr. Cruz.As the Wall Street Journal reported this earlier week: “Top Wisconsin GOP players, from Gov. Scott Walker to state legislators to the powerful conservative talk-radio voices on Milwaukee radio, have been winning pitched battles together in defense of conservative ideals since Republicans took over state government in 2011. Now that organization is united against Mr. Trump in a way he hasn’t seen before, even in states where he faced millions of dollars in attack ads.”Mr. Trump was ridiculed on conservative talk-show host Charlie Skyes radio program, where the Trump campaign seemed unaware Mr. Skyes had endorsed Mr. Cruz and was solidly in the anti-Trump movement. Our Principles PAC and the Club for Growth are investing millions in the state, running ads that cut to the heart of Mr. Trump’s women problem.And that problem has been magnified this week. Mr. Trump’s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was accused of battery, Mr. Trump tripled-down in his defense, and then Mr. Trump went on to say how women who get abortions should get punished. The later was quickly taken back, however, it was enough to do damage — highlighting how ill-prepared the businessman can be on the issues.Mr. Cruz, on the other hand, has been coming into his own. He had a solid performance in a town-hall debate, he’s entertained events with strong women by his side — former presidential candidate Carly Fiorina and his wife, Heidi — and he was able to back down from the party’s loyalty pledge after Mr. Trump attacked Mrs. Cruz in the week prior. Instead of looking weak, Mr. Cruz has come across as strong.If Mr. Cruz wins Wisconsin on Tuesday, it will be a combination of anti-Trump organizational support, his own good performance (and dedication to the ground-game and retail politicking), and because Mr. Trump has torpedoed himself. New York will be a tougher battle, but with a momentum shift, Mr. Cruz may perform better in other states.Most of the remaining primaries are closed — which favor Mr. Cruz because of his strong ground-game — and are well-spaced. Mr. Cruz’s campaign has shown it does well when it has time to campaign in a state. There was about two weeks’ time between the last contests on March 15 and Wisconsin’s April 5 primary.The party will also begin to rally around him — and against Mr. Trump — if Mr. Cruz does well.This week, Mr. Trump acted anything but presidential.You can bet the party will remember his performance come July, no matter how many delegates he collects between now and then.\n\n","title":"Donald Trump has given critics enough ammo to lose Wisconsin, contested convention - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Donald Trump has given critics enough ammo to lose Wisconsin, contested convention https://t.co/leU501c1Ka #GOP https://t.co/U4WzQfNHXV","date":"Thu Mar 31 17:19:07 +0000 2016","favs":8,"id":{"$numberLong":"715589250822049794"},"retweets":13},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/w90WjD"}

He also was roundly criticized by his\nGOP rival and Democratic candidates, including the front-running Hillary\nClinton.Mr. Trump already had high unfavorability ratings among women, and the\nremark promised to further hurt his standing with women voters.The remark was\nbound to make it into an attack ad, and the two pro-Clinton groups wasted no\ntime making it happen.“Donald Trump’s vile assertion that women should be\npunished for having an abortion is the latest example of just how demeaning,\ninsulting and dangerous he really is for women across this country,” said Anne\nCaprara, executive director of Priorities USA. “Taking away a woman’s basic\nright to health care puts her life in danger. Trump’s latest attack on women\nis yet another reminder of just how important it’s going to be to support\nHillary Clinton this fall, and Priorities is pleased to work with Planned\nParenthood Votes to hold him accountable.”It was the first paid attack ad\neither Priorities USA or Planned Parenthood Votes has done against Mr. Trump.\n\n","title":"Donald Trump's abortion 'punishment' remark already in attack ad - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Donald Trump’s #abortion ‘punishment’ remark already in attack ad https://t.co/bSUniPLWau #DonaldTrump https://t.co/tlEpH7Pcn4","date":"Thu Mar 31 16:48:55 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"715581651254972416"},"retweets":6},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/Ea9m0o"}

Cyberbullying, including online\nthreats and harassment, can damage your or your child’s reputation, and cause\nfinancial loss and emotional harm. Chubb’s new policy helps victims reclaim\ntheir lives.”The Zurich-based, multibillion dollar insurer began offering\ncyberbullying coverage to customers in the U.K. last December and said this\nweek that it plans on expanding coverage across the U.S. in the coming months.\nSpeaking to Reuters this week, Chubbsaid it believes it is the first company\nto offer a cyberbulling policy.In the meantime, Chubb said it’s broadening its\nMasterpiece Family Protection policy in four states to include what some have\ncalled “troll insurance” that can be purchased alongside plans that cover\nexpenses related to stalking threats, air rage and child\nabduction.Specifically, Chubb’s cyberbully coverage allows policy holders to\nbe compensated for “expenses related to harassment and intimidation committed\nvia personal computers, telephones or mobile devices.”“Clients may recover\ncosts incurred when cyberbullying results in wrongful termination, false\narrest, wrongful discipline in an educational institution or diagnosed\ndebilitating shock, mental anguish or mental injury leading to the inability\nof the client or a family member to attend school or work for more than a\nweek. The coverage provides compensation for psychiatric services, rest and\nrecuperation expenses, lost salary, temporary relocation services, education\nexpenses, professional public relations services, and cyber security\nconsultants,” Chubb said.An article published in the medical journal JAMA\nPediatrics last year concluded that around a quarter of U.S. adolescents have\nbeen cyberbullied over social media, and a Pew study in 2014 determined that\n40 percent of adult Internet users have been harassed online in one way or\nanother.But Sameer Hinduja, the co-director of the Cyberbullying Research\nCenter at Florida Atlantic University, told NorthJersey.com this week that\n“the vast majority of cyber bullying cases are very minor.”While purchasing a\ncyberbullying policy might not appeal to most customers, Mr. Hinduja said, “It\ndoes matter to those who are more wealthy and looking for a safety net.”“It\nprobably plays to their fears,” he said.Indeed, Andrew Auernheimer — a self-\ndescribed “nationalist hacktivist” and notorious Internet troll who took\ncredit last week for a headline-grabbing anti-Semitic stunt that’s been widely\npanned as offensive — told The Washington Times on Thursday that “Insurance\ncompanies are finally cashing in on a cyberbullying myth meant to garner\nmiddle-class support for censorship.”“The margins on this insurance are going\nto be absolutely insane as it’s limited to being an extension to a plan for\nfamilies and thus excluding all the histrionic childless feminists and\ndeviants crying about it,” said Mr. Auernheimer, who goes by the alias\n“weev.”As The Times reported last week, Mr. Auernheimer said he is responsible\nfor executing a basic computer script that allowed him to spam the computer\nlabs at colleges across the U.S. with fliers advertising a neo-Nazi\nwebsite.The act raised security concerns at schools from Boston to Berkley,\nand an NBC News station in California reported on Wednesday that the incident\nis being investigated as a hate crime by the FBI.\n\n","title":"Chubb Limited, insurance company, expands cyberbullying coverage to U.S. - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Insurance company expands #cyberbullying coverage to U.S. https://t.co/nFvodt4lBQ  #cyberbullies","date":"Thu Mar 31 15:47:14 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"715566128211353600"},"retweets":3},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/Lb6Upc"}

Women who choose\nabortion often do so in desperation and then deeply regret such a decision.“No\npro-lifer would ever want to punish a woman who has chosen abortion,” Ms.\nMancini continued. “This is against the very nature of what we’re about.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e83"},"content":"Irony, thy name is Trump.As weeks pass by, and GOP wannabe Donald Trump sees\nhimself slowly losing delegates to other candidates who clearly know the rules\nof the nominating contest better, Trump’s braying about a “stolen nomination”\nand “unfair treatment by the RNC” grow louder.The rules governing the number\nof delegates needed to clinch the nomination were set last year - and, it’s\nworth noting, those rules were well publicized and made clear to all of the\ncampaigns so there would be no mystery about the requirements to become the\nparty’s nominee.And just for the record, what’s needed to nominate is a simple\nmajority of the delegates - in this year’s case, that’s 1,237. A simple\nmajority - no more, and no less.Moreover, the rules, as defined by both the\nRepublican National Committee and the individual state parties, stipulate that\nthe vast majority of delegates will arrive in Cleveland “bound” to a certain\ncandidate on the first ballot. If, after that first ballot, no candidate has\nthe necessary 1,237 votes to win the nomination, a second ballot will be\nconducted, at which point almost half of the delegates are freed from their\nbinding and may vote for whomever they choose. The ballots continue, with\nlarger percentages of delegates “freed up” in each round, until one candidate\nhas 1,237 votes. Those are the rules, plain and simple.But Donald Trump \\-\nnever one to allow himself to be encumbered by the rules or by the truth - has\na message for America: The nomination is being “stolen” from him. And, with\nhis signature flair for inciting controversy, he has also said, not so subtly,\nthat a failure to nominate him will result in riots.Further, besides relying\non the persuasive powers of the fear of public unrest and street riots, Mr.\nTrump is already resorting to one of his favorite bullying tactics: lawsuits.\nThe Trump campaign earlier this week filed a complaint with the Republican\nNational Committee over a delegate dispute in Louisiana and has hinted that\nother lawsuits may follow if the delegate math doesn’t work in his\nfavor.During an interview on ABC’s “This Week” this past Sunday, Mr. Trump\nsaid, referring to Sen. Ted Cruz: “I have a guy going around trying to steal\npeople’s delegates. This is supposed to be America, a free America. You know,\nwelcome to the Republican Party. What’s going on in the Republican Party is a\ndisgrace. I have so many more votes and so many more delegates. And, frankly,\nwhoever at the end, whoever has the most votes and the most delegates should\nbe the nominee.”Well, no. The GOP nomination, under the rules, does NOT go to\n“whoever has the most votes and the most delegates,” it goes to the first\ncandidate to win the votes of a simple majority of the delegates at the\nconvention.It’s worth unpacking Mr. Trump’s entire diatribe.Mr. Trump often\nuses the term “stealing” to refer to the perfectly legal and well-established\npractice of attracting delegates. Although this fact often gets lost in Mr.\nTrump’s tantrums, “not winning” is not the same as being the victim of a\nstolen nomination.Beyond the rhetoric of a “stolen” nomination, Mr. Trump’s\nwords also reveal a fundamental failure to understand the difference between a\nmajority and a plurality. The rules are set so that the nominee must secure a\nsimple majority of the delegates. With 2,472 delegates, that means a candidate\nmust receive votes from 1,237 delegates. That number is rooted in math, not\nunfairness or arbitrariness, as Donald Trump often argues.Trump’s campaign\nseems unable to grasp the significance of a majority when it argues that a\nsimple plurality should suffice. The purpose of the GOP convention in the\nsummer and the entire state-by-state nominating process up to that point is\nfor the party to settle on the best candidate who can win in the ultimate\ncontest - the general election in November. Key to the strategy of winning is\ngoing into that match-up with the absolute strongest candidate who can take on\nthe eventual Democratic nominee by shoring up the conservative base and\nappealing to Independents. And THAT is why it’s a majority, not a plurality,\nthat is necessary to win the nomination.The rich irony, of course, is that\nTrump’s loud and litigious protests about the unfairness of the GOP\nconvention’s rules may be the ultimate proof of why the rules are in place and\nare more necessary this year than ever before. After all, does the GOP really\nwant its standard-bearer and presidential nominee to win the nomination\nthrough threats of violence, bullying and lawsuits?\n\n","title":"JENNY BETH MARTIN: A primer for Trump on GOP convention - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"JENNY BETH MARTIN: A primer for Trump on the GOP convention https://t.co/96n8WEDk0X #DonaldTrump","date":"Thu Mar 31 15:18:10 +0000 2016","favs":2,"id":{"$numberLong":"715558813303193601"},"retweets":3},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/lVHzj5"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e84"},"content":"**(1)**Where is Trump’s evangelical base? Not in church (_Washington Post_)…The key to understanding Trump’s support among evangelicals is to realize that some evangelicals’ commitment to the faith is shaky, too. Trump does best among evangelicals with one key trait: They don’t really go to church. In short, the evangelicals supporting Trump are not the same evangelicals who have traditionally comprised the Christian Right and supported cultural warriors such as Rick Santorum and Ted Cruz.Recently released data from the 2016 American National Election Studies (ANES) Pilot Study illustrate this. The study was conducted from Jan. 22-28**(2)** Gene Edward Veith: Martin Luther on Vocation and Serving Our Neighbors (Acton Institute)Luther’s doctrine of vocation with its radical, neighbor-centered ethic displaces good works from the realm of the merely spiritual into the realm of the material, the social, and the ordinary.We sometimes talk about serving God in our vocations. Luther might take issue with this formulation, if by it we imagine that we are performing great deeds to impress the Lord, and especially if we mistreat others in doing so. There is, however, a sense in which we do serve God in our vocations. Jesus himself tells us that what we do (or do not do) for our neighbor in need, we do (or do not do) to him (Matt. 25:31–46). So when we serve our neighbors, we do serve God, though neither the sheep nor the goats realized at the time whom they were really dealing with (vv. 32–33).God is hidden in vocation. Christ is hidden in our neighbors.**(3)** Should you retreat from the public square?…Epicurus advocated a cautious, _ne quid nimis_, nothing in excess, moderate approach which was based on a calculated despair at ever finding a definite meaning in life. It was a sign of ignorance even to try; things happened by necessity; free will was an illusion. An insane fear of the gods plagued most people, gods which had been invented by clever politicians and poets to make rule easier by postulating mythical rewards and punishments.The only thing that made sense to him was to shut off the din of praise and blame, the passions of public life and the idiotic blather of sophists. Have nothing to do with them, said Epicurus. Stop worrying about what goes on in the heavens, or in the world, or in the city.“Withdraw from it all!” was the prudent way to deal with public affairs: get as far away as possible from the shrines, the town square, the theaters, and the academies.

Wade, as a “great gift to the country.”Judge Garland, like the Obama nominees before him, is a threat to the pro-life movement.Although he has never voted on a case involving abortion, it is clear that he will be no different than Justice Elena Kagan and Justice Sonia Sotomayor.In fact, Judge Garland’s lack of judicial paper trail on abortion and other social issues played into Mr. Obama’s decision to appoint him in the first place.Mr. Obama was hoping to quickly sneak Judge Garland through the nomination process as a “judicial moderate,” a strategy that would ensure a liberal majority on the Supreme Court for years to come.However, his plan did not work, and pro-life organizations nationwide have come together to encourage pro-life senators, both Republican and Democrat, to stand strong against approving a third pro-choice Obama nominee to the high court.Mr. Obama is “the most pro-abortion president ever to lead this nation,” Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America, told The Blaze.Ms. Hawkins is right, and if Mr. Obama’s pro-abortion presidency as is not enough to convince you, take a look at Planned Parenthood and NARAL.Both organizations have been working hard to push Judge Garland’s nomination through, urging the Senate to “do its job” and give the judge a hearing.Do you think these pro-choice groups would be supporting Judge Garland’s nomination if they had any doubts on his pro-abortion stance?Absolutely not.The stakes could not be higher and Judge Garland’s stance on abortion is clear.Having him on the Supreme Court could potentially result in the overturning of decades of progress made by pro-life proponents and organizations._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"MADISON GESIOTTO: A vote for Judge Merrick Garland is a vote against the lives of the unborn - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"MADISON GESIOTTO: A vote for Judge Merrick #Garland is a vote against the lives of the unborn https://t.co/rk40fv8g0f #SCOTUS #abortion","date":"Thu Mar 31 08:58:25 +0000 2016","favs":5,"id":{"$numberLong":"715463246572982272"},"retweets":12},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/UfsnTq"}

The police processed Mr. Mejia and he posted bond, so officers\nasked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to come get him to make sure he\ndidn’t escape altogether.But when no agents arrived, local authorities had to\nrelease the man, who has since absconded, missing court appearances and\ndisappearing into the shadows with the estimated 11 million other illegal\nimmigrants.ICE Director Sarah Saldana appeared to stumble in testimony to\nCongress about the incident, saying that agents would have responded if the\nvictim of the crash, 21-year-old Sarah Root, had already died, rather than\nstill hanging on for life at the time ICE was notified.Lawmakers said not only\ndid that seem a ridiculous standard, but they said Ms. Saldana was wrong about\nthe facts — Root had died by the time ICE was notified.Ms. Saldana, in a\nstatement, said she’s now determined to track the fugitive down.“ICE is\nworking with law enforcement authorities in Nebraska and Honduras to locate\nand arrest Mejia. ICE will work tirelessly to ensure justice is done in this\nmatter,” she said.In its most-wanted notice, ICE said Mr. Mejia entered the\nU.S. illegally in 2013. They did not say how they learned that\ninformation.Initially, ICE reportedly said Mr. Mejia didn’t meet President\nObama’s priority list for being detained. That list details the crimes that\nare serious enough that the administration says they should merit deportation,\nand under those instructions ICE doesn’t generally try to deport those who\ndon’t meet the priorities.On Wednesday, ICE said its officers and managers in\nthe field looked at the totality of Mr. Mejia’s case and decided he didn’t\nneed to be held because he didn’t meet their guidelines. But the agency said\nthe agents could have used “flexibility” to hold him anyway.“Further review of\nthe case may have resulted in the conclusion that, because of the seriousness\nof the vehicle crash, Mr. Mejia’s case rose to the level of an important\nfederal interest,” an ICE official said. “Senior ICE officials at headquarters\nhave brought this matter to the attention of all field leadership to reaffirm\nthat appropriate consideration must be given to all cases which may meet an\nimportant federal interest.”Sen. Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican who quizzed\nMs. Saldana about the incident at a hearing two weeks ago, said ICE was right\nto elevate Mr. Mejia to its most-wanted list, but it should never have come to\nthat.“Mr. Mejia should not need to be on this list — he should be in jail. ICE\noriginally said that Mr. Mejia was not an ‘enforcement priority’ but this\nmorning he was placed on their Most Wanted list,” Mr. Sasse said in a\nstatement.He sent a list of follow-up questions to Ms. Saldana, who personally\npromised a response by the end of last week. As of Wednesday afternoon, no\nresponse had been sent.ICE said it will reply directly to Mr. Sasse “as soon\nas is practicable.”\n\n","title":"Homeland Security names illegal immigrant to 10 most wanted fugitives list - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#HomelandSecurity names #illegalimmigrant to 10 #mostwanted #fugitives list. https://t.co/SmdUjHxOpp https://t.co/1Ycc7vej5p","date":"Thu Mar 31 02:13:49 +0000 2016","favs":12,"id":{"$numberLong":"715361424848105472"},"retweets":23},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/30/homeland-security-names-illegal-immigrant-to-10-mo/"}

Ted Cruz,\nwho those same polls show losing to either of their potential Democratic\nopponents.After having chosen the more moderate candidates who party leaders\nsaid were the most likely to win the White House in both 2008 and 2012, GOP\nvoters are showing far less interest this year in electability.“It is\ncertainly true that Governor Kasich is perceived as the Republican candidate\nmost in the ideological middle and often candidates who seeks that middle\nground find it the place to be — but not every four years,” said Peter Brown,\nof the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute. “Ideology is not the coin of\nthe realm in 2016. If it were, we might have different political\nenvironment.”The road to the 2016 GOP nomination race is littered with\ncarcasses of other candidates who fared well in head-to-head match-ups with\nDemocrats, but who failed to catch on with Republican voters. Florida Sen.\nMarco Rubio, who like Mr. Kasich won in polling against Hillary Clinton and\nran well against Sen. Bernard Sanders, was drummed out of the primary earlier\nthis month after he failed to win his own home state’s primary.Exit polls show\nelectability ranks relatively low for GOP voters this year, well below\nconsiderations such as having a candidates who share their values, is a\nstraight-shooter or can affect change once in office.While voters may not\ncare, though, GOP strategists do, saying either Mr. Trump or Mr. Cruz would be\na problem.“I never say never, but clearly both would start out in a hole\nvis-a-vis Clinton,” strategist Scott Jennings said.“I also think a great many\nvoters who are supporting Trump or Cruz just can’t fathom a world in which a\nsingle person would even consider voting for Hillary Clinton, so the idea that\nthey need to capitulate to some media polling telling them to nominate some\nmoderate they don’t like isn’t going to fly in this cycle,” he said.The\ngeneral election gap between Mr. Kasich and the other two candidates is\nsizable.A Monmouth University poll last week of voters nationally found Mrs.\nClinton topping Mr. Trump by 10 percentage points, and topping Mr. Cruz by 5\npoints. Mr. Kasich, though, leads her by 6 points.Former New Hampshire Sen.\nJudd Gregg backed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush in the GOP primary race, and\nnow is an unbound delegate who plans to support Mr. Kasich.“I think both Ted\nCruz and Donald Trump create very serious issues for us in the general\nelection,” Mr. Gregg said. “We probably have the weakest Democratic candidate\nin decades running in Hillary Clinton, so it is unfortunate.”Mr. Kasich is\nlooking to salvage his bid — and perhaps some vice presidential hopes — by\nsticking around and trying to convince voters that he is their strongest\ncandidate in November election._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Republican voters prove cool to John Kasich's electability pitch - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#Republican voters prove cool to #JohnKasich’s electability pitch.\nhttps://t.co/ylMs6lnhaX https://t.co/cAIdicfuUF","date":"Thu Mar 31 02:09:01 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"715360219375800320"},"retweets":8},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/30/republican-voters-prove-cool-to-john-kasichs-elect/"}

The North’s human rights abuses, taken together with a steady stream of nuclear threats against its Asian neighbors and the United States, signal the crisis that could soon spread beyond the Korean peninsula. Barack Obama’s shuttered-eye approach may soon be no longer tolerable.A new report published by a Washington-based nongovernmental organization, titled “North Korea: Ch’oma-bong Restricted Area,” offers an unobstructed aerial view of a gulag region of the Hermit Kingdom by the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea. Satellite imagery of a mountainous mining area, enclosed by a 12-mile-long security fence near the border with China, and recorded between 2006 and 2015, reveals a steady expansion of a prison camp for political prisoners. What appears to be burial mounds sprout near the mines from time to time, testimony to the consequences of hard labor that is the usual punishment for “enemies of the state,” which can include anyone.The abuse of political prisoners is no secret. “In the political prison camps of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the inmate population has been gradually eliminated through deliberate starvation, forced labor, executions, torture, rape and the denial of reproductive rights enforced through punishment, forced abortion and infanticide,” the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea has concluded.The disregard for human life that drives the Communist regime in Pyongyang to abuse its own further illuminates its dream of eliminating enemies abroad, real and imagined. Today’s editions of The Washington Times includes an advertising supplement titled “North Korea’s Nuclear Threat,” which lays out in detail the reasons why that isolated nation is the most likely trigger for nuclear Armageddon. Among the contributors are U.N. Ambassador Samantha Power, explaining the reasons behind the U.N. Security Council’s adoptions of sanctions on North Korea for its nuclear threats; Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, describing the international community’s imposition of the tough sanctions on Pyongyang, and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Ed Royce, writing about the House and Senate passage of the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016.North Korea answered the imposition of sanctions in January by conducting its 15th test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, and boasting of its ability to miniaturize a nuclear warhead that could devastate Seoul and New York. The behavior of the Hermit Kingdom puts it in a class by itself — even beyond the grim ability of the Islamic regime in Iran, which at the least negotiates, whether in good faith or not, with the international community. Where else on earth would a college boy be sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for the juvenile prank of helping himself to a banner from a Pyongyang hotel to take home as a souvenir?When heads of state gather in Washington this week for the fourth annual Nuclear Security Summit, they should send an unmistakable message to nuclear-nation wannabes, and North Korea in particular: Nuclear weapons are not to be used as a threat to strong-arm neighbors to extract tribute. Far from a way to win international respect, the North’s behavior has further solidified a consensus that the world will be a safer place once the Kim dynasty ends — or is ended.\n\n","title":"EDITORIAL: North Korea, Iran share threat to the West - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"EDITORIAL: The other face of inhumanity https://t.co/YBylxf3ylW #NorthKorea #Iran https://t.co/f5HzUdUk2A","date":"Thu Mar 31 02:06:58 +0000 2016","favs":7,"id":{"$numberLong":"715359701639290880"},"retweets":12},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/30/editorial-north-korea-iran-share-threat-to-the-wes/#.VvyFQmnV_DA.twitter"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e99"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Where did America’s regulatory state go “off the rails?” By the best measurements, modern-era America’s air and water have never been cleaner, yet you have radical environmentalists screaming for ever-increasing amounts of regulation. Worse, despite a regulatory state that, by the U.S. Government’s own estimates, cost the American economy just under $1 trillion in 2005, those same activists have driven a massive amount of new regulations over the last decade — driving up regulatory costs by an additional trillion dollars in those 10 years alone.This had been allowed to happen for a number reasons, but not the very least is an environmental policy that is and has been developed with a complete disregard for actual, scientific, comparative risk assessment (CRA). CRA is a tool that policymakers can and should use to compare and contrast risks across the spectrum of public health, safety, and environmental policies-to help us, as a people, prioritize public policy problems, assess whether something is, in fact, a problem, and to determine when or even if action is warranted.Disregard the proper assessment of risk and America faces an exploding regulatory state. Worse, real problems (like water quality in Flint, Michigan) is ignored in the face of phantom risks … like those in North Carolina.While the national political spotlight focused on North Carolina’s presidential primary, another critical development in the state went largely unnoticed when radical environmental activists and overzealous state regulators were dealt an embarrassing setback. After more than a year of issuing unnecessary, even frightening warnings to North Carolina residents about the quality of their drinking water, state health officials were forced to walk back their warnings and end one phase of their attack against a major energy producer in the Tarheel State.In a classic example of ready, fire, aim state environmental and public health officials tried to use the water quality issue as leverage to unfairly vilify and embarrass the state’s largest energy producer — Duke Energy. That effort failed, leaving North Carolina health officials with a large amount of egg on their faces.Last year, the North Carolina Health and Human Services department issued a “Do Not Drink” order for residents living near coal ash storage sites run by Duke Energy. Coal ash is a by-product of coal after coal is burned to produce power-one that can and is recycled to be used in a variety of industries. Duke Energy has several coal ash storage sites across the state. Health officials were convinced the drinking water in wells near these coal ash storage sites was polluted and they produced tests to back up their claims. Then they issued warnings to residents about their water.These actions by state officials were clearly part of a plan to attack Duke Energy and wage a broader war on coal as a reliable energy source.A year later, the state has been forced to lift the “Do Not Drink” order after additional tests revealed how water quality near Duke Energy’s coal ash sites was really no different than water taken from municipal run water supplies all across the state, including municipally-managed water supplies nowhere near Duke Energy coal ash sites.Such fear-mongering isn’t limited to North Carolina. This pattern of attacking oil companies, natural gas and other energy producers such as Duke Energy occurs with regular frequency across the country. Extreme environmental groups team up with the EPA in Washington and then with state and local regulators to make unsubstantiated allegations that grab news headlines, but are seldom based in fact.Look at the multiple year effort we have seen waged by radical environmentalists to attack hydraulic drilling for oil and natural gas. These radical environmental groups claim ground water pollution where none exists. The wild claims about alleged harm to drinking water have been widely debunked.The environmental organizations and the individuals who make these baseless allegations should be exposed by the news media for what they are — anti-fossil fuel extremists who will stop at nothing to demonize our energy industry. Government regulators have an obligation to protect the public and ensure health and safety, but they also have a duty to perform their duties in a responsible way, free from reckless actions that will needlessly alarm state residents and drive up energy costs for every household.The environmental left, their allies within the EPA in Washington, and state regulators across the country must end these campaigns to attack the fossil fuel industry and reliable energy producers who create tens of thousands of jobs.State regulators in North Carolina owe the residents more than a new notice of safe drinking water, they should apologize to residents for needlessly frightening them into thinking their water was tainted. Further, state health officials — obviously working at the behest of activist environmental pressure, should be outed and punished for unfairly demonizing an energy producer like Duke Energy in order to advance their own political agenda.When the true facts emerge, the unfounded claims made by the environmental left fall apart. It’s a shame the residents of North Carolina were forced to endure for more than a year before the truth was told.**• **_Andrew Langer is president of the Institute for Liberty._\n\n","title":"ANDREW LANGER: The price of radical enviornmentalizm - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Andrew Langer on th phantom risks and real costs of radical #environmentalism https://t.co/NOlCN94Vqq https://t.co/YO9vdidk4I","date":"Thu Mar 31 02:04:45 +0000 2016","favs":2,"id":{"$numberLong":"715359145092890624"},"retweets":2},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/30/andrew-langer-the-price-of-radical-enviornmentaliz/#.VvyEuJMDN_U.twitter"}

Chris Smith, New Jersey Republican and a leading voice on\nCapitol Hill on human rights issues, said Mr. Obama has been a disappointment\nso far, failing to use either the power of the presidency or his stature as\nthe 2009 Nobel honor to comfort political prisoners or to push back against\nauthoritarian advances by the Chinese regime.“The hope is that he will finally\nfind his voice” in the relationship with China, Mr. Smith said. “Human rights\nis always an asterisk, an obligatory paragraph in a joint communique, or less\nthan that.”** SEE ALSO: Putin snubs Obama, skips D.C. nuclear summit amid\nIslamic State fears **Mr. Smith said Mr. Obama has repeatedly ignored human\nrights in dealing with leaders of nations with poor records on the subject,\nincluding most recently in Cuba, where the president stood to the side of\nleader Raul Castro, who insisted his country does not hold any political\nprisoners.The congressman, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee\non Africa, global health, global human rights and international organizations,\nsaid he hoped Mr. Obama doesn’t take the same approach with Mr. Xi, whose\nregime holds some 1,500 political prisoners.“The president wouldn’t recognize\nhardly a name [on that list] because he never raises their cases,” Mr. Smith\nsaid. “Mr. President, you’re going to be looking face to face with Xi Jinping.\nGive him names, be very specific.”The administration, though, appeared to play\ndown the idea of confrontations, highlighting what it considers a more\nsuccessful approach of direct high-level engagement on areas where the two\ncountries can cooperate, such as climate change or security concerns.“I think\nbecause of this high-tempo senior-level engagement, we’ve been able to\nidentify opportunities for cooperation where our interests align,” Dan\nKritenbrink, the senior director for Asian affairs at the National Security\nCouncil, told reporters in advance of the visit. “For example, I think\nbilateral cooperation with China right now is exceptionally broad and deep on\nissues ranging from climate to nuclear security to development, public health,\nIran and Afghanistan.”Mr. Kritenbrink said the relationship has also allowed\nthe two leaders to talk about areas where the countries disagree.“We don’t\npaper over these differences. We don’t hide them. We don’t pull punches in\naddressing them,” he insisted.Mr. Smith said he hasn’t seen the evidence of\nthat. Instead, when pressed by reporters on confronting China, Mr. Smith said\nMr. Obama has excused the regime, saying they have a different culture.Mr.\nSmith said the words of the U.S. carry a lot of weight with those struggling\nagainst Chinese oppression — and the lack of attention also sends a signal,\nboth to the victims and the regime.“Because we have been indifferent, and\nindifferent on steroids, with regards to prisoners in China, Xi Jinping takes\nhis cue from that,” Mr. Smith said.He said the problems go beyond political\nprisoners, to include China’s attempts to extend control over religious\ndenominations and its continued use of torture on prisoners.China is also\nmoving to consolidate its ability to censor the Internet within its borders,\ndrafting rules requiring businesses offering Internet access to demand their\nusers register any websites within the country rather than overseas, the\nAssociated Press reported. The move to draft new rules was seen as a way to\nmake it easier for censors to block objectionable sites._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Nuclear security summit offers Obama last chance to push China on human rights  - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#NuclearSecuritySummit offers #Obama last chance to push #China on #humanrights. https://t.co/6eitZLTEgF https://t.co/TU7PhjNxoQ","date":"Thu Mar 31 02:04:16 +0000 2016","favs":5,"id":{"$numberLong":"715359025140002817"},"retweets":7},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/30/summit-offers-obama-last-chance-to-push-china-on-r/"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e9b"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**On March 30, the Supreme Court will hear a landmark case about Clean Water Act regulation, and whether Americans have a right to their day in court if their land is labeled as “wetlands” subject to federal jurisdiction.The hearing in U.S. Army Corps of Engineers v. Hawkes Co. would be important in any case, but it carries special significance in the wake of the passing of Supreme CourtJustice Antonin Scalia. The outcome could test how durable Justice Scalia’s legacy will prove on some key issues that held special interest for him: the boundaries of federal environmental power, and the degree to which regulators are accountable to the courts.Indeed, in one sense, the Hawkes case is fundamentally about regulatory accountability and the rule of law. From another standpoint, it is about property owners’ rights. These two perspectives merge into a single compelling question: Should landowners have the right of judicial appeal over regulatory decisions that affect their lives and livelihoods, or are unelected environmental bureaucrats their own judges and juries?The issue is brought before the court by three related, family-owned businesses — Hawkes Co., providing peat for golf courses and other sports turf applications; and Pierce Investment and LPF Properties, which own some peat land. They are prevented from using property in Marshall County, Minnesota, because it has been designated as federally controlled “wetlands.” The designation is factually and legally questionable, so the businesses want the courts to review it. But the Obama administration argues that such wetlands “jurisdictional determinations” cannot be challenged until the property owner has navigated a long and expensive permit process — and received a denial. The High Court’s decision on which side is correct could affect property owners nationwide.Now, one might ask what the Clean Water Act has to do with peat. After all, the Act on its face only covers “navigable waters.” Yet the Corps and the Environmental Protection Agency have interpreted that phrase — and its statutory equivalent, “the waters of the United States” — to cover nearly every wetland, stream, creek, and pond in the country.Justice Scalia fought back against that very broad interpretation. For example, in a 2006 plurality opinion in Rapanos v. United States, he criticized the agencies’ claimed power to regulate “storm drains, roadside ditches, ripples of sand in the desert that may contain water once a year, and lands that are covered by floodwaters once every 100 years.” He called this “an immense expansion of federal regulation of land use” that “would befit a local zoning board.”“The only plausible interpretation” of the Clean Water Act’s scope, he contended, would be much more restricted, limited to “those relatively permanent, standing or continuously flowing bodies of water that are described in ordinary parlance as ‘streams[,] … oceans, rivers, [and] lakes.’”However, Rapanos was a split decision, so controversy has continued over how broadly the Clean Water Act extends over America’s waters and property owners.Naturally, that controversy has made issues of judicial review exceptionally important. In Hawkes, federal officials denied that wetlands designations could be directly challenged in court, claiming they are not a “final agency action.” Although the Eighth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the Corps’ position, the Obama administration continued to press it, so the Supreme Court agreed to decide for the entire nation.Justice Scalia’s legacy looms large because the issue in Hawkes is closely related to another recent Supreme Court decision on the Clean Water Act, which he authored and which struck a blow for landowners’ access to the courts. In Sackett v. EPA, an Idaho couple wanted to build a family home in a residential subdivision. While their homebuilding project was underway, EPA hit them with a “compliance order” alleging that they had filled in federally regulated wetlands without a Clean Water Act permit. The Sacketts tried to challenge the order in court, but the lower courts ruled that they had no right to do so. Instead, their options were to go along with the agency’s demands, or wait for the agency to sue them, or proceed through an onerous and fruitless administrative process.The Supreme Court unanimously rejected this denial of the right to appeal. Justice Scalia declared that landowners who receive compliance orders may challenge them in court. Rejecting EPA’s arguments to the contrary, he cogently explained that the “mere possibility that an agency might reconsider does not suffice to make an otherwise final agency action nonfinal.” He concluded there is “no reason to think that the Clean Water Act was uniquely designed to enable the strong-arming of regulated parties into ‘voluntary compliance’ without the opportunity for judicial review.”The Supreme Court granted review in Hawkes just a few months before Justice Scalia’s death. The case gives the court an excellent opportunity to uphold his legacy of insisting on common sense and fairness in environmental regulations, and on the vital principle that bureaucrats are not a law unto themselves.**• **_Damien Schiff is a principal attorney with Pacific Legal Foundation, which is representing the businesses suing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the Hawkes case.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e9c"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**While now mooted because the FBI has broken the code, the media has been all over the legal struggles between the FBI and Apple — this as the FBI sought to require Apple to go behind the access code of the iPhone used by the Sacramento ISIS inspired terrorists.The primary media spin was that Apple is the guardian of our privacy while the FBI is just another federal government agency intent on violating it. However, as more facts came out, the debate moderated somewhat, in that more thoughtful reports identified the fundamental tension in the debate as another post 9/11 balance between privacy and security.But there’s much more to the story, and it’s the part that the tech and communications sectors hope never comes out — this because it draws into serious question their professed sincerity as the guardians of our privacy. It’s about big money, and here’s the background:After the telephone monopolies broke up in the 1980s and ‘90s, there were many phone company start-ups. Driven mostly by easy money, they were oblivious to the reality that, from time to time, they would be served with warrants to produce telephone records and for wiretaps — both in ongoing criminal investigations and for national security purposes, i.e., FISA. In short, most of the new carriers didn’t know how to comply with court orders for lawful surveillances, and they were not interested in learning.So, in 1994 and a carefully orchestrated legislative rush, Congress passed “CALEA” standing for the “Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act.” The law was drafted by the Justice Department — the agency having the most “equity” in the issue set — and it required telecommunications carriers to develop the technical capabilities necessary to comply with court orders.But far more important — at least for the carriers — was that Congress also gave them millions of dollars to do what the law required them to do. And, many of the carriers then “contracted out” their obligations under the new law to so-called “trusted agents.” Later, the law was expanded to include Internet service providers.CALEA set the precedent for the “new” concept that there was big government money for private telecommunications carriers and Internet providers to simply do what they were legally required to do. Stated alternatively, they didn’t have to budget and pay to design, build and operate the systems necessary to comply with the law — the government paid them to do it — and it was lots of free money.So watch for this same concept in the Apple encryption case — and watch also as their privacy-based complaints melt away with piles of “free” taxpayer money.Also starting in the ‘90s were various ideas to protect data from hackers, by using encryption — this has now become a huge moneymaker for the tech companies. There were several business models, including passive data storage services that offered backups for clients in case of natural disaster or destructive hacking.Newer data protection services offer data storage with some unique features, and the encryption technology behind them improves almost daily. This new approach has users paying for secure data storage, paying for encrypted data storage and the latest wrinkle is paying for encrypted storage that nobody can get into, whether the request is pursuant to a court order or not.So, a criminal cartel or terrorist enterprise, for example, operating under cover of a legitimate business, can now protect its data from anyone, including the system administrators — even when directed by court order. All for a big fee, of course.So, don’t be fooled by these new “privacy” debates that involve encryption. Just like the “pop up” adds that appear on your browser based on your Internet shopping, your privacy is totally for sale — and so is total encrypted protection for even the worst of the worst terrorists and criminal enterprises. For example, what do we do when we are told that “the data simply cannot be accessed by anyone?” Should we believe it or do we simply have to pay more to get it? In short, it’s “pay them to secure it” and then “pay them to get it” — the key words here are: “Pay them.”**• **_Daniel Gallington served in Washington and overseas for many years in senior national security and intelligence policy positions.

As a result, the\nadministration arranged to ship blood products from the mainland to Puerto\nRico, which has reported more than 250 locally acquired cases.Now the island\nof 3.5 million people can resume collections of its own blood, so long as it\nuses the test manufactured by Roche Molecular Systems Inc. in New Jersey.“The\navailability of an investigational test to screen donated blood for Zika virus\nis an important step forward in maintaining the safety of the nation’s blood\nsupply, especially for those U.S. territories already experiencing active\ntransmission,” said Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA’s Center for\nBiologics Evaluation and Research.Zika is a little-known virus that festered\nfor decades in Africa and the Asia-Pacific region before globe-hopping to\nLatin America, where it has spread to more than 20 countries.Its rapid\ntransmission has been tied to a sharp uptick in the number of babies born with\nabnormally small heads, or microcephaly, and Guillian-Barre syndrome, which\ncan lead to paralysis.So far, the Centers for Disease Control has documented\n273 travel-related cases in the U.S. Though Zika isn’t transmitting locally\nwithin the continental U.S., scientists said that could change once\ntemperatures climb.The Aedes aegypti mosquito is found in several southern\nstates, and the more-prevalent Aedes albopictus mosquito also is capable of\ncarrying the virus, so parts of the mainland may need to use the blood-\nscreening tool.“In the future, should Zika virus transmission occur in other\nareas, blood collection establishments will be able to continue to collect\nblood and use the investigational screening test, minimizing disruption to the\nblood supply,” Dr. Marks said.In February, the FDA said people who either\nexperienced symptoms of Zika or traveled to places where the virus is\nspreading should refrain from donating blood for four weeks.The deferral also\napplies to potential donors who have had sexual contact with someone who\ntraveled to a Zika-affected country within the last three months.President\nObama has requested $1.9 billion in emergency funding to combat the Zika\nthreat at home and aboard, though congressional Republicans say the White\nHouse should spend money left over from the Ebola fight before it seeks a\nmassive influx of new money.\n\n","title":"Zika-affected areas can screen blood with experimental test: FDA - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#ZikaVirus-affected areas can screen #blood with experimental test: #FDA.\nhttps://t.co/qtkr3kiB1u https://t.co/Vmv9i91whp","date":"Thu Mar 31 01:57:42 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"715357370772234240"},"retweets":6},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/30/zika-affected-areas-can-screen-blood-with-test-fda/"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e9e"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Recently, the death penalty has reemerged as a national topic of conversation, as botched executions, drug shortages, and new data on exonerations and racial disparity have revealed some of the shortcomings and injustices of the capital punishment system.Many people assume that police officers, prosecutors, and corrections officials are united in their support for the death penalty. We have a different perspective. We are the co-chairs of Public Safety Officials on the Death Penalty (PSODP), a new group dedicated to elevating the voices of public safety officials who are prepared to discuss and explore alternative ways to achieve a more just and effective public safety system.PSODP comprises former and current public safety professionals from across the country. Its members have served as beat cops and police chiefs in major cities, as district attorneys and state attorneys general; as corrections officers and as the heads of state corrections agencies. Some have investigated or prosecuted capital cases; some have approved or overseen executions. PSODP does not take a stance on the ultimate appropriateness of the death penalty; some members of the initiative may support it, others may oppose it. What we all have in common, though, is concern about the fairness and efficacy of the death penalty as it is currently administered, and at this critical point in our nation’s conversation about the death penalty, we feel compelled to speak up.We believe that any discussion about the death penalty should be well-informed, and we know that our experiences in the criminal justice system give us a unique perspective on the issue. While each member of PSODP has their own perspectives and concerns, here are some of the issues that we believe are most pressing.First, we are concerned about the risk of executing an innocent person. We have seen firsthand that the criminal justice system, like any other human endeavor, makes mistakes. Earlier this month, the National Registry of Exonerations released a new report finding that in 2015, a record 149 people were exonerated in the United States — including five from death row. Even more alarming is a 2012 study from the National Academy of Sciences, which estimated that 4.1 percent of those on death row are falsely convicted. There can be no greater injustice than executing an innocent person because once the mistake is made it cannot be reversed. And, as public safety officials, we know that when the innocent are wrongfully convicted, the guilty go free.We are also concerned that the death penalty runs the risk of compounding the pain of victims’ families. Capital cases are almost invariably drawn out over years or decades, during which time families are forced to continually relive the circumstances of their loved one’s death. We cannot claim to know what each family member wants, but we know that for many, the death penalty does little to contribute to a sense of justice.Finally, we are concerned about the cost of capital punishment. Many believe that it is less expensive to execute someone than to imprison him or her for a long time. However, we know that seeking and imposing a death sentence is more expensive at every step, from arrest to incarceration. In North Carolina, these costs add up to nearly $11 million per year; in California, these extra costs set the state back more than $100 million per year.We want Americans to know that the public safety community is not united in support of the death penalty. There are many reasons to be concerned about how this country administers the death penalty. Some are moral, some are practical. Our group represents all of these views, and runs the gamut from support with reservations and questions to outright opposition.We will be speaking out around the country, before policymakers, the press, and the public — especially in those states where reforms or even repeal of the death penalty are being debated. We will also be reaching out to our colleagues in the public safety community, explaining our views and urging them to join with us in the PSODP effort. We look forward to adding our voices to the crucial conversation on the death penalty in the days and weeks ahead.**• **_Kathleen Dennehy served for more than 30 years in the Massachusetts Department of Correction, rising through the ranks to serve as commissioner.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678e9f"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**The FBI investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s failure to protect state secrets contained in her emails has entered its penultimate phase, and it is a dangerous one for her and her aides.Federal law enforcement sources have let it be known that federal prosecutors and the FBI have completed their examination of raw data in the case. After the FBI acquires raw data — for example, the nature and number of the state secrets in the emails Mrs. Clinton failed to protect or the regular, consistent, systematic nature of that failure — prosecutors and agents proceed to draw rational inferences from that data.Then they proceed to corroborate those inferences, looking for other sources to support or even to contradict them. With one exception, all of this work has been done with neutral sources of evidence — documents, email metadata, government records and technical experts.The exception is Bryan Pagliano, the one member of Mrs. Clinton’s inner circle who, with either a written promise of non-prosecution or an order of immunity from a federal judge, began to cooperate with federal prosecutors last fall.Here is what he told the feds.Mr. Pagliano has explained to federal prosecutors the who, what, when, how and why he migrated an open State Department email stream and a secret State Department email stream from government computers to Mrs. Clinton’s secret server in her home in Chappaqua, New York. He has told them that Mrs. Clinton paid him $5,000 to commit that likely criminal activity.He has also told some of the 147 FBI agents assigned to this case that Mrs. Clinton herself was repeatedly told by her own State Department information technology experts and their colleagues at the National Security Agency that her persistent use of her off-the-shelf BlackBerry was neither an effective nor an acceptable means of receiving, transmitting or safeguarding state secrets. Little did they know how reckless she was with government secrets, as none was apparently then aware of her use of her non-secure secret server in Chappaqua for all of her email uses.We know that the acquisition and corroboration phase of the investigation has been completed because the prosecutors have begun to ask Mrs. Clinton’s top aides during her time as secretary of State to come in for interviews. This is a delicate and dangerous phase for the aides, all of whom have engaged counsel to represent them.Here are the dangers.The Department of Justice will not reveal to the aides or their lawyers what it knows about the case or what evidence of criminal wrongdoing, if any, it has acquired on each of them. Hence, if they submit to an FBI interview, they will go in “blind.” By going in blind, the aides run the risk of getting caught in a “perjury trap.” Though not under oath, they could be trapped into lying by astute prosecutors and aggressive FBI agents, as it is a crime — the equivalent of perjury — to lie to them or materially mislead them.For this reason, most white-collar criminal defense lawyers will not permit their clients to be interviewed by any prosecutors or FBI agents. Martha Stewart’s lawyers failed to give her that advice, and she went to prison for one lie told in one conversation with one FBI agent.After interviewing any Clinton aides who choose to be interviewed, the DOJ personnel on the case will move their investigation into its final phase, in which they will ask Mrs. Clinton herself whether she wishes to speak with them. The prosecutors will basically tell her lawyers that they have evidence of the criminal behavior of their client and that before they present it to a grand jury, they want to afford Mrs. Clinton an opportunity blindly to challenge it.Here is her dilemma.If she were to talk to federal prosecutors and FBI agents, they would catch her in many inconsistencies, as she has spoken with great deception in public about this case. She has, for example, stated many times that she used the private server so she could have one mobile device for all of her emails. The FBI knows she had four mobile devices. She has also falsely claimed publicly and under oath that she neither sent nor received anything “marked classified.” The FBI knows that nothing is marked classified, and its agents also know that her unprotected secret server transmitted some of the nation’s gravest secrets.The prosecutors and agents cannot be happy about her public lies and her repeated demeaning attitude about their investigation, and they would have an understandable animus toward her if she were to meet with them._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"ANDREW NAPOLITANO: Hillary Clinton's FBI troubles - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Andrew Napolitano on #HillaryClinton's troubles https://t.co/saAoTKL9hw #hillaryemails https://t.co/403NccKhkT","date":"Thu Mar 31 01:55:12 +0000 2016","favs":11,"id":{"$numberLong":"715356742624940032"},"retweets":13},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/30/andrew-napolitano-hillary-clintons-fbi-troubles/#.VvyClbLJcJ8.twitter"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678ea0"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Neither political party can lay claim to purity when it comes to hypocrisy, but Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, as well as others in her party, has taken hypocrisy to new depths.While campaigning in Wisconsin before next week’s presidential primary, Mrs. Clinton said that as president she would have a litmus test for any Supreme Court nominee. “I would not appoint someone who didn’t think Roe v. Wade is settled law,” she declared. Her nominee(s) would also have to show that they support overturning the Citizens United decision that established free speech rights for interest groups.She added that while she believes the Senate should hold hearings and a vote on Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama’s nominee for the Supreme Court, she would have selected someone more like Justice Sonya Sotomayor because Mrs. Clinton thinks her Hispanic heritage and underprivileged upbringing has brought a needed perspective to the high court.What about the Constitution? It seems that for the left, the Constitution is only a temporary impediment until they can appoint judges who believe the founding document is more elastic than a waistband and can be stretched to fit their agenda.About Hillary Clinton’s claim that Roe is settled law, was Plessy v. Ferguson “settled law”? That 7-1 decision in 1896 established “the constitutionality of state laws requiring racial segregation in public facilities under the doctrine of ‘separate but equal.’” It remained in force for nearly 60 years until the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling overturned it. Roe is 43 years old. By the Plessy standard, should Roe really be considered settled law?As for Hillary Clinton’s attacks on Republican senators who refuse to schedule hearings and a vote on Merrick Garland’s nomination, as a senator from New York, she took a contrary position.In 2005, Sen. Clinton said the Senate had a right to reject a president’s nominee: “I believe this is one of the most important roles the Senate plays. This, after all, is in the Constitution. We are asked to give advice and consent, or to deny advice and consent.”Denial is implied, but not written in the Constitution. What the Constitution does not require is for the Senate to hold hearings, or vote, on a court nominee.At a Democratic town hall last month, Chuck Todd of MSNBC asked Hillary Clinton about President Obama’s statement that he regrets as a senator filibustering Justice Samuel Alito’s nomination when George W. Bush was president. Mr. Todd noted that Clinton joined 24 other Senate Democrats in a filibuster against Justice Alito’s nomination and ultimately voted against Justice Alito and Chief Justice John Roberts.Her response? “You get to use the rules.”Well, yes, and while not holding hearings on Judge Garland is not a rule, it might be considered on a par with a filibuster designed to delay and, on some occasions, prevent a vote.Add to this the policy of the Democratic Party leadership which has, according to then-Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joe Biden, a lengthy and established “tradition against acting on Supreme Court nominations in a presidential year.”Let’s also recall the words of the likely next Senate Majority Leader, Charles Schumer, New York Democrat, who said in a July 2007 speech that the “presumption of confirmation” for any more nominees to the Supreme Court during the remainder of President Bush’s term should be reversed, because the court, according to Mr. Schumer, “is dangerously out of balance.” In short, not liberal enough.The fabled goose and gander analogy seems to apply here, but many voters have proven to have short attention spans and an ignorance of history, which might explain why a recent Pew Research Center poll found that 46 percent of Americans surveyed want Judge Garland confirmed, while 30 percent oppose him.If Pew surveyed those same people today and read them what Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Chuck Schumer said then and now, how many would call them hypocrites? How many would possibly change their minds about Judge Garland? I guess we’ll never know._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"CAL THOMAS: Left tweaks Constitution to fit agenda - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Cal Thomas says there's no copyright on #hypocrisy https://t.co/Cpb0qQNRJX #MerrickGarland #HillaryClinton https://t.co/Xy67ywc0Kq","date":"Thu Mar 31 01:52:24 +0000 2016","favs":2,"id":{"$numberLong":"715356034823561216"},"retweets":7},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/30/cal-thomas-left-tweaks-constitution-to-fit-agenda/#.VvyCEiYOf0Q.twitter"}

My position has not changed — like Ronald Reagan, I\nam pro-life with exceptions.”That explanation is likely to invite more\nquestions about his initial, contrary answer, and whether he understands the\npro-life position he now proclaims.Mr. Trump is a relative newcomer to pro-\nlife causes, having previously been what he described as “very pro-choice.” In\na 1999 interview he even said he would not ban partial-birth abortion. But as\nhe’s changed his position, he’s facing questions it appears he hadn’t grappled\nwith before.“Once again Donald Trump has demonstrated that he hasn’t seriously\nthought through the issues, and he’ll say anything just to get attention,” Mr.\nCruz said in a statement. “On the important issue of the sanctity of life,\nwhat’s far too often neglected is that being pro-life is not simply about the\nunborn child; it’s also about the mother — and creating a culture that\nrespects her and embraces life. Of course we shouldn’t be talking about\npunishing women; we should affirm their dignity and the incredible gift they\nhave to bring life into the world.”Pro-life organizations such as the March\nfor Life and the Family Research Council also issued statements calling Mr.\nTrump’s initial words troubling and not what the movement backs._Story\nContinues →_\n\n","title":"Donald Trump trips over policy as media presses harder for specifics - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#DonaldTrump trips over policy as media presses harder for specifics: https://t.co/k6kzOsMc95","date":"Thu Mar 31 01:51:01 +0000 2016","favs":8,"id":{"$numberLong":"715355689791696897"},"retweets":13},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/30/donald-trump-trips-over-policy-as-media-presses-ha/"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678ea2"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Tempers always run high in the run-up to choosing the candidates for president. Donald Trump, leading the Republicans, is accused of fascism, out to destroy hundreds of years of accumulated democratic values. Hillary Clinton, the Democrat most likely to succeed, is accused of breaching national security with a private email system of her own, rendering classified secrets open to hacking by alien governments, and could conceivably be indicted for felonies.Thus the results of the November election could — the operative word is “could” not necessarily “would” — challenge American civilization as we know it. But how well do we know it? It’s not merely an academic question, though it’s certainly of academic importance.An important debate on just what an educated man or woman should understand and defend as American values has opened on the campus of one the most elite universities, a reminder of what has been sacrificed to the politically correct culture. Ironically, it’s a debate ignited not by the professors but the students themselves. Next week students at Stanford University will decide whether to ask the university to restore a mandatory course, for all undergraduates, that was once commonplace on campuses everywhere.“In recognition of the unique role Western culture has had in shaping our political, economic, and social institutions,” the student petition declares, “Stanford University should mandate that freshmen complete a two-quarter Western Civilization requirement covering the politics, history, philosophy, and culture of the Western world.”Such courses taught how Western thinking was embodied in the principles of the American revolution, and how they eventually led to American leadership of the democracies of the world. The courses were originally organized for soldiers returning from World War I, to teach them about what they had been fighting for, and how they could continue to defend those things. Three decades later, these courses were taught to veterans returning from another war. They affectionately called them “Plato to NATO,” and learned to think about the profound issues that anchored the nation in a confusing, changing and shrinking world.The works included the Bible, the classics of ancient Greece and Rome, the record of political, religious and secular philosophers as different as Dante, Machiavelli, Voltaire, Darwin, Marx and Freud. Their works were analyzed and debated, examined as both positive and not so good. But what started as a survey of the great books that connect us came to be perceived as divisive and alienating. In the wild decade of the 1960s many students began to take the works of “dead white men” as explanations of racism, sexism and imperialism. The culture shed its sheet anchor.The Rev. Jesse Jackson led a protest of Stanford students in chanting, “Hey, hey, ho ho, Western culture’s got to go!” The protests not only won the argument on the Palo Alto campus, but spread destruction like Attila the Hun marching across academe. Students could soon choose from all kinds of courses to replace “Western Civ.” The diluted content of study was illustrated in one elective at Stanford called “Food Talks: The Language of Food.”This sounds like satire, but it’s serious. The good news is that many Stanford students are pushing back, struggling to restore the fundamentals of understanding what binds us together, rather than celebrating what divides us into insular covens of rage and resentment. The Stanford manifesto calls for the study of works ranging from Shakespeare’s “Julius Caesar” to W.E.B. Du Bois’ “Black Reconstruction in America.” Texts emphasize different values, such as free speech, due process and equality under the law. They’re meant to open honest debate over the American heritage, to demonstrate that the nation is not perfect, but exceptional enough to end slavery (even if it required a civil war to do it), liberate women, and harness science to enable universal communication. American Civilization courses were never perceived as indoctrination from the ivy tower, but opportunities to learn what English critic Matthew Arnold meant when he stressed the importance of learning “to propagate the best that is known and thought in the world.”The implications of such a debate reaches into the politics of a presidential election year. Hillary Clinton talked last week of what to do about the latest radical Islamic terror outrage in Brussels, emphasizing the necessity of NATO, which Donald Trump wants to reduce, though she said nothing about why, as secretary of State, she like President Obama did not fully appreciate the threat of ISIS. Perhaps she should have had a Western civ course at Wellesley College a generation ago.The Stanford debate is a window on how institutions of higher learning lost sight of what’s important to think about.

Is whatever negotiation they may have been conducting over her email server problem and any inside information she may have on him now imploding? Or have the Clintons “won” the negotiation with Mr. Obama, freeing them to hit him publicly to get her elected?Something has happened, which has led Mr. Clinton to openly slam Mr. Obama: ” If you believe we’ve finally come to the point where we can put the awful legacy of the last eight years behind us ” he said recently. A few days later, Chelsea Clinton launched a broadside on Obamacare’s costs. A classic Clintonian one-two punch, coming just days before a report that the FBI is seeking interviews with Mrs. Clinton’s top aides, and likely Mrs. Clinton herself. Most investigations interview the target last.What’s going on? No one knows for sure, but we have a clue.**PHOTOS: 21 best guns for home protection**In political scandals, sometimes it’s the person you’d least expect who says or does something that brings down the whole house of cards.On July 16, 1973, Alexander Butterfield, former deputy assistant to President Nixon but a relatively minor White House player, revealed the existence of an Oval Office taping system to the Senate Watergate Committee and the nation. That disclosure began the denouement of the Nixon presidency.Today, another relatively minor player may be revealing highly damaging information about someone who would like Mr. Nixon’s old job.** SEE ALSO: Shifting blame, White House faults war general’s 2014 ISIS assessment as he departs **Former Hillary Clinton IT specialist Bryan Pagliano, a key witness in the investigation into her use of a private server, struck an immunity deal with the Justice Department and apparently has been singing. An intelligence source told Fox News that he has told the FBI a range of details about how her personal email system was set up and maintained. The source described him as a “devastating witness.”Mr. Pagliano is a pivotal — perhaps the pivotal — key to Mrs. Clinton’s server and what was being done on and through it — and by whom.Mr. Pagliano was in charge of server(s) since the 2008 campaign. He was paid $5,000 for “computer services” by the Clintons before he joined the State Department staff. After he started working there in May 2009, Mr. Pagliano continued to receive payments from the Clintons to maintain the server.Mr. Pagliano can name all those who had access to the Clinton server and devices and when, and reportedly is doing so, allowing investigators to piece together an evidentiary timeline. It was emphasized to Fox News that Mrs. Clinton’s deliberate “creation” and “control” of the private server used for her official government business is the subject of “intense scrutiny.”Mr. Pagliano can also testify to the security of the server and what was told to whom about it. Again, the server has the documents, including the at least 22 top secret and above top secret ones deemed too damaging to national security to publicly release under any circumstances. That is a matter of some risk for Mrs. Clinton.In another deeply problematic development, the FBI is focused on documents she and her aides sent rather than received, because sending them demonstrates deliberate intent much more than receiving them would. It’s been reported that over 100 highly sensitive documents originated with her.If there are major classified emails that were sent by Mrs. Clinton, then one of my sources said “there won’t be escape from prosecution”.Mrs. Clinton’s defense has been that she neither sent nor received anything “marked classified” at the time. This is more Clintonian parsing: documents are classified “confidential,” “secret” or “top secret.” Further, in January 2009 Mrs. Clinton signed the classified information non-disclosure agreement indicating that she understood that classified information could be marked and unmarked, and that it included verbal communications.The Pagliano immunity deal is a piece of the puzzle. But in what way? As a general matter, DOJ does not like to grant offers of immunity unless it is assured something major in return._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"MONICA CROWLEY: The FBI stalks Hillary while Bill Clinton trolls Obama - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Monica Crowley says the #Clintons sense a breakdown https://t.co/GQb93yjBZe #ClintonsEmails https://t.co/VjAd2sCqIv","date":"Thu Mar 31 01:47:49 +0000 2016","favs":12,"id":{"$numberLong":"715354884111998981"},"retweets":16},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/30/monica-crowley-the-clintons-sense-a-breakdown/#.Vvx_-I5CaoU.twitter"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678ea4"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Hitting someone is not nice, and in the hot house of a political campaign where sensibility if not sense thrives, pushing someone is a no-no. So is touching, which may be the greater crime. All should all strive for civility and good manners at all times, and that applies to officials of presidential campaigns. We’ve come a long way from the bad old days when Sally Quinn, the onetime doyenne of The Washington Post’s party reporters, boasted that she would tolerate a little flirtatious touching if that meant getting the story (and Sally was one of the best).Earlier this week a Florida prosecutor charged Donald Trump’s campaign manager with misdemeanor battery for “grabbing” and pushing a reporter at a campaign event in the run-up to the Florida presidential primary. What makes this especially piquant, for connoisseurs of campaign trivia (who are particularly fond of anything that can be described in French) is that the prosecutor is a Democrat, and not just any old Democrat, but a leading member of Hillary Clinton’s Florida campaign team.The Donald and his supporters regard the reaction to the incident, much of it manufactured outrage, as what the Bard would describe as much ado about not very much. Uninvited touching, in fact, is approximately what a Clinton aide did some time ago and nothing much was made about it. But the Trump campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, is in most accounts of the incident just another Trump thug who would be fired by any other candidate.Without commenting on the merits of who did what to whom, and why, since we were not there to see it, we nevertheless wonder that if the charge against Mr. Lewandowski is another manifestation of an increasing tendency of certain politicians to use the law to demonize their rivals.The United States is meant to be a nation of laws not men, but those who control law enforcement have used the law to investigate, indict and prosecute those with whom they disagree. In Texas, an out-of-control prosecutor, a Democrat, indicted Kay Bailey Hutchinson, a senator; Tom DeLay, the House Republican majority leader, and Rick Perry, the governor, all Republicans, on flimsy and hardly imaginative charges, which the courts promptly threw out, as the prosecutor knew they would. In Wisconsin, Democratic prosecutors conducted midnight raids on the homes of Republican friends of Gov. Scott Walker. The courts threw those charges out, too.Now U.S. Attorney Gen. Loretta Lynch vows, together with Democratic attorneys general around the country, to use the law to silence critics of global warming, or climate change, since persuasion has not worked. This is a hardly “progressive” and certainly not “liberal,” as the words were once used, but effective in tainting reputations of the innocent.Mr. Lewandowski will soon appear in court to answer for his suspect manners and may even be fined for having “touched” the reporter, who in the old days would have complained to her editor, and been told to sit down and write the story and keep herself out of it. She could tell her story to admiring colleagues at the bar down the street. The Lewandowski story, too, shall pass, having generated a ton of talk and the expenditure of several hundred gallons of ink, which was exactly what the Florida prosecutor wanted. We hope the campaign manager will learn to mind his manners, and we send best wishes to the reporter who could have touched back with a sharp touch across the face. No further therapy needed.\n\n","title":"EDITORIAL: Hard times on the trail - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"EDITORIAL: Hard times on the trail https://t.co/dLBTTcX4Xl #DonaldTrump #Lewandowski https://t.co/XuCmfjMJP0","date":"Thu Mar 31 01:36:39 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"715352072313561089"},"retweets":4},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/30/editorial-hard-times-on-the-trail/#.Vvx-3C1oJkc.twitter"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678ea5"},"content":"A Minnesota entrepreneur plans to market a .380-caliber pistol later this year\nthat will resemble an ordinary, pocket-size smartphone when not in use — a\n“virtually undetectable” weapon that has already drawn ire from top cops and\nanti-gun advocates.”In today’s day and age, carrying a concealed pistol has\nbecome a necessity,” says Kirk Kjellberg on the website of his company, Ideal\nConceal. “But what if you didn’t have to conceal?”Mr. Kjellberg told NBC News\nthis week that he was motivated by a restaurant disturbance to design a\nhandgun that’s advertised as “Cunningly designed to look like a smartphone\nwhen folded up.”“A boy spotted me in the restaurant and said loudly, ‘Mommy,\nMommy, that guy’s got a gun!’ And then pretty much the whole restaurant stared\nat me,” recalled Mr. Kjellberg, a Minneapolis-area businessman.In response to\nthat incident, Mr. Kjellberg went to the drawing board and drafted Ideal\nConceal — a two-shot plastic gun that folds up to roughly 3 inches by 5 inches\nwhen it needs to be obscured. A prototype of the patent-pending pistol is\nexpected to be ready in June, with sales planned to begin in October. However,\nthe covert contraption already is raising concerns about the potential\nrepercussions of lethal weapons being designed to resemble the iPhones and\nAndroids that reside in the hands or pockets of a majority of American\nadults.Mr. Kjellberg said he already had received queries from 4,000 potential\ncustomers.“It’s extremely dangerous and would make policing even more\ndifficult,” Lt. Bob Kroll, the president of the Police Officers Federation of\nMinneapolis, told The Washington Times on Wednesday.Ladd Everitt, director of\ncommunications for the D.C.-based Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, told The\nTimes that it was “idiotic and irresponsible” to market such a handgun. “It\nwill also make it far more difficult for law enforcement officers to determine\nif they are dealing with armed individuals in the field, putting them at\nadditional risk as they try to ensure the public’s safety,” he agreed. “But\nresponsibility and safety clearly aren’t the focus here,” Mr. Everitt added.\n“Kirk Kjellberg is marketing his product to paranoid gun-toters who aren’t\ninterested in personal accountability.Their chief concern is to avoid\ndetection when armed in public, which should raise immediate concerns.”Under\nthe U.S. Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988, gun markers are prohibited from\nmanufacturing or selling weapons that can’t be discerned by metal detectors.\nMr. Kjellberg says the Ideal Conceal will have enough metal to be UFA-\ncompliant. He told NBC that he has already been contacted by the Department of\nHomeland Security and intends to supply law enforcement with X-rays so they\ncan distinguish his firearms from mobile phones. In the line of duty, however,\nthat ability to discern one item from another is already a matter of life or\ndeath — even before taking into account guns designed to look like\ncellphones.For example, four officers with the New York Police Department shot\nand killed Amandou Diallo in 1999, thinking the wallet he was pulling out was\na gun, and 13-year-old Tarmir Rice was slain when Cleveland cops mistook the\ntoy gun he was brandishing for a real one.Bill Johnson, executive director and\ngeneral counsel for the National Association of Police Organizations, told CNN\nMoney that “any kind of weapon that’s disguised, so that it’s not apparent\nthat it’s a weapon, would be cause for concern.”Mr. Everitt of the Coalition\nto Stop Gun Violence also said that there’s a “fascinating” cultural element\nto the mobile phone-modeled two-shooter.”If gun owners now want their firearms\nto look like smartphones, it suggests that being seen with firearms isn’t\nworking well for them socially,” he suggested. “Keep in mind that virtually\nevery American now owns some type of smartphone. They’re as hip as it gets.\nOnly one in five Americans owns a gun, however, and radical gun culture is\nincreasingly turning off mainstream Americans.”But even as critics complain\nthat marketing what Mr. Kjellberg touts as a “virtually undetectable” pistol\nposes safety risks to civilians and cops alike, others say his claim is\ncommercially driven. “We should note that the use of ‘virtually undetectable’\nin this case is for marketing purposes, and does not have any legal or literal\nsignificance. Legally undetectable guns cannot be sold to the public, and\nconcern material properties and imaging techniques,” said Defense Distributed\nfounder Cody Wilson, whose Texas-based organization created an international\ncontroversy in 2013 when it began freely sharing 3D-printer blueprints on the\nInternet for a functioning firearm. The open-source designs could be used by\nhobbyists to easily and affordably make their own guns, sans serial numbers,\nand attracted the attention of the State Department as a result.“I have\nnothing but warm feelings for the company and its efforts. The gun is\ninnovative, and I hope there’s a market for it,” Mr. Wilson told The Times on\nWednesday.\n\n","title":"Smartphone handgun by Ideal Conceal 'virtually undetectable' - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Double-barreled #smartphone size handgun is 'virtually undetectable.' \n\nhttps://t.co/q7JNTnSGux","date":"Thu Mar 31 01:33:35 +0000 2016","favs":4,"id":{"$numberLong":"715351300137959424"},"retweets":9},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/30/smartphone-handgun-by-ideal-conceal-virtually-unde/"}

Enriched uranium, a particular concern in the Iranian nuclear deal, is\nalso used to make bombs.But Russia, which has an enormous nuclear arsenal and\nan increasing emphasis on nuclear weapons in its defense strategy, won’t\nattend the summit. Mr. Obama’s relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin\nare rocky at best; White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Moscow’s\navoidance of the summit is “yet another consequence” of Russia’s military\naggression in Ukraine.** SEE ALSO: Nuclear security summit offers Obama last\nchance to push China on human rights **Pakistan, another nuclear power causing\nmajor proliferation concerns for the U.S., is sending a lower-level\nrepresentative after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif canceled his attendance to\ngrapple with a horrific terrorist attack targeting Christians on Easter\nSunday. Iran, which has challenged the U.S. with a string of missile tests in\nrecent months despite inking last year’s deal designed to curb its nuclear\nprograms, also will not particpate in Mr. Obama’s summit.The issue of nuclear\nproliferation has flared up on the U.S. campaign trail in recent days,\nfollowing comments last Friday from Republican front-runner Donald Trump that\nthe U.S. should consider allowing South Korea and Japan to obtain nuclear\nweapons, in part to defend themselves better and ease the burden and expense\nfor the U.S. military.Although the White House said Wednesday the proposal\nwould be “incredibly destabilizing,” Mr. Trump argued it was inevitable that\nstates such as South Korea, Japan and even Saudi Arabia would soon join the\nnuclear club.“It’s going to happen anyway,” Mr. Trump said at a town hall in\nMilwaukee Tuesday night. “It’s only a question of time. They’re going to start\nhaving them or we have to get rid of them entirely.”Although the U.S. and its\nallies still worry about North Korea, the White House believes the threat\nposed by Iran has subsided due to the nuclear deal, leaving extremist groups\nas a major concern.“We know that terrorist organizations have the desire to\nget access to these raw materials and their desire to have a nuclear device,”\nsaid White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes. “It’s important\nthat we have a discussion that addresses the most lethal threat from terrorist\norganizations.”U.S. officials say they don’t know of any imminent terrorist\nplots involving nuclear weapons or a “dirty bomb,” a device made of\nradiological material.Two of the Islamic State suicide bombers in last week’s\nattacks in Brussels had secretly filmed the daily routine of the head of\nBelgium’s nuclear research and development program, and were considering an\nattack on a nuclear site in the country, Belgian media has reported. The video\nwas found in the extremists’ apartment after the Paris terrorist attacks last\nNovember.The havoc such an attack could wreak in an urban area like New York\nor London is concerning enough that leaders scheduled a special session on the\nthreat during the two-day summit. U.S. officials said the leaders would\ndiscuss a hypothetical scenario about a chain of events that could lead to\nnuclear terrorism.**Losing steam**Some arms control advocates say the\ninternational effort to curb nuclear proliferation that Mr. Obama launched in\n2010 is losing steam.The nuclear security summits “have had a positive effect,\nbut the strategic goal of developing an effective global nuclear security\nsystem remains unachieved,” said the Nuclear Threat Initiative, an anti-\nproliferation watchdog, in a report._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Russian snub mars Obama's nuclear summit amid ISIS fears - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Russian snub mars #Obama's nuclear summit amid #IslamicState fears: https://t.co/YJ75CHQKwI #ISIS","date":"Thu Mar 31 00:55:49 +0000 2016","favs":6,"id":{"$numberLong":"715341796025507842"},"retweets":14},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/30/russian-snub-mars-obamas-nuclear-summit-amid-isis-/"}

Businessman Ross Perot got nearly 19 percent of the vote in the\n1992 presidential race against Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush — the best\nshowing by a third-party presidential candidate in the past 100 years.Mr.\nJohnson sought the GOP’s nomination in 2012, but withdrew when he failed to\nmake the stage for most of the debates and ran instead as a Libertarian,\nwinning the free-market, limited-government party’s nomination and appearing\non the ballot. He won about 1 percent of the popular vote, including nearly 3\npercent of the popular vote in Montana and over 2 percent in Alaska and\nWyoming.This year, he says, will be different, with Republicans and Democrats\ntilting further toward their extremes, leaving a difficult choice for many\nmiddle-of-the-road voters.“I’ve always maintained that I think the majority of\nthe people in this country are libertarian — they just don’t know it,” he\nsaid. “Speaking with a broad-brush stroke, that’s being fiscally conservative\nand socially liberal. … I think most people fall in that category.”Nicholas\nSarwark, who chairs the Libertarian Party, is counting on those voters to\nfinally tire of the choices the GOP and Democrats offer.“The people who have\nbeen Republicans for decades and decades [and] true-blue establishment\nRepublicans feel like they’ve been betrayed by a populist that has no moral\ncenter,” Mr. Sarwark said. “And on the Democratic side, the serious\nprogressive activists who actually don’t want to have foreign wars and don’t\nwant to keep locking people up for what they put in their bodies and want a\nmore true progressive candidate are being betrayed by their party\nestablishment.”He said the interest in Libertarians is so high that former\npresidential candidates have sounded them out about joining seeking the\nparty’s nod.“We have been approached by candidates who have dropped out of the\nold party races about running on the Libertarian Party ticket,” Mr. Sarwark\nsaid, though he declined to name names. “At this point, none of them have\njumped in but we have explored the options and talked to them about the\nlogistics of it, what they would have to do, how they would be able to become\npart of the process.”The Libertarian nominee will be decided at the party’s\nconvention in May.**Breaking the two-party dominance**After that, the\nchallenge, as always, will be to break through the major-party duopoly, one\nthat Republicans and Democrats often unite to preserve.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678ea9"},"content":"While Hillary Clinton campaigned and raised cash in New York City Wednesday,\nrival Sen. Bernard Sanders hit the stump in Wisconsin, seeking another upset\nwin in the Midwestern state’s April 5 primary that would block the former\nfirst lady’s efforts to wrap up the Democratic presidential primary and move\non to a general election campaign.Mrs. Clinton’s speech in Harlem Wednesday\nafternoon — in which she again cast herself as the only Democrat truly\nqualified to be commander in chief — signals that the former secretary of\nstate is bracing for a loss in Wisconsin next week and instead is turning her\nattention to New York. Mr. Sanders trails badly in the delegate count but, to\nthe Clinton campaign’s chagrin, keeps racking up symbolic, momentum-building\nwins in states across the country.The Vermont senator won the Idaho and Utah\ncontests last week and won primaries in Alaska, Hawaii and Washington last\nweekend. The latest polling also shows him ahead in Wisconsin.Specialists say\na Sanders victory in Wisconsin likely wouldn’t change the overall trajectory\nof the race, but it would create a “less than ideal” situation for Mrs.\nClinton — a situation in which she would go weeks without a victory in the\nDemocratic primary process.But analysts also say she’s right to focus more on\nNew York than Wisconsin given her recent history of success in states with\nlarger blocs of black and Latino voters, which tend to favor her.“A Sanders\nwin, or even a virtual tie, in Wisconsin would provide some additional\nmomentum for his campaign and could help with fundraising, since Wisconsin is\nthe only Democratic contest between March 26 and April 9,” said Eric T.\nKasper, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Eau\nClaire. “The demographics of New York, and the fact that [Mrs. Clinton]\nrepresented the state in the Senate, make it likely she will do better there\nthan in Wisconsin. If she loses Wisconsin, or barely wins here, it is less\nthan ideal for her campaign.”Still, the former secretary of state isn’t\ntotally giving up on the Dairy State, with even a close loss moving her closer\nto the total number of delegates she needs to clinch the nomination.Mrs.\nClinton told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Wednesday that she’ll be back in Wisconsin\nto campaign this weekend.“We’re going to just keep working very hard to win\nevery vote we can,” she said.Mr. Sanders is counting on high voter turnout and\nstrong backing in progressive strongholds such as Madison to carry him to\nvictory in Wisconsin next Tuesday, and polling shows he’s poised for another\nwin. A Marquette University Law School survey released Wednesday shows Mr.\nSanders leading Mrs. Clinton 49 percent to 45 percent.A loss in Wisconsin,\nwhile unlikely to make a significant difference in the delegate count, would\nonce again give Mr. Sanders a rationale for continuing his campaign.

Real change only takes place when\nmillions of people come together, stand up, fight back and say the status quo\nis simply no longer acceptable.”While Mrs. Clinton targets New York, she’s\nstill launching repeated attacks on Mr. Sanders.During her Harlem speech, Mrs.\nClinton took aim at Mr. Sanders‘ perceived lack of foreign policy prowess,\nsaying the senator is a “single-issue” candidate who cares only about income\ninequality and Wall Street reform and can’t be trusted with national\nsecurity._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Hillary Clinton focusing on New York as Bernie Sanders locks in on Wisconsin - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#HillaryClinton focuses on adopted home state of #NewYork\nwhile #BernieSanders zeroes in on #WisconsinPrimary\nhttps://t.co/nFNO9fZC9Q","date":"Wed Mar 30 23:50:32 +0000 2016","favs":5,"id":{"$numberLong":"715325367742033920"},"retweets":6},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/30/hillary-clinton-focusing-on-new-york-as-bernie-san/"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678eaa"},"content":"NEW YORK — For George Washington’s three four-year seniors, the NIT was not\nhow they wanted to go out.The Colonials landed in the runner-up tournament\nafter a weak second half of the season ended their NCAA tournament hopes.\nInstead of folding, they’re now among the last six college teams playing and\nhave a chance to become the winningest team in program history Thursday night\nin the final against Valparaiso.Now, the chance to win the last game of their\ncollege careers is more than enough for Joe McDonald, Patricio Garino and\nKevin Larsen to play for. When the team advanced to the finals Tuesday night\nin a 65-46 win over San Diego State, one of four No. 2 seeds in the 32-team\ntournament, disappointment was in the past.“I’m proud of them,” coach Mike\nLonergan said. “We are playing for a championship. We know it’s not going to\nbe easy and I can’t wait for Thursday night and I’m very happy I get to coach\nthese guys for two more days.”GW (27-10) advanced by holding the Aztecs to 29\npercent shooting and generating 15 points off 11 turnovers. The Colonials\nbroke San Diego State’s pressure with ease, getting assists on 17 of 26\nbaskets, six of them from McDonald.It was fitting that McDonald, the stocky\npoint guard with a long injury history, returned for the second half after\ntwisting his ankle just before halftime. To protect him, Lonergan stationed\nhim on the weak side of the team’s 1-3-1 zone. The zone wound up forcing San\nDiego State to finish 3-for-22 from beyond the arc and continue to shoot\nthrees after going 1-for-9 in the first half.“I think we are more confident\nthan ever right now,” Garino said. “If we do what we are supposed to do, what\nwe go through during the scout, I think we’re good.”Tuesday’s win brought a\nbit of historical revenge. San Diego State coach Steve Fisher was the coach at\nMichigan in 1993 when the Wolverines ended the deepest NCAA tournament run in\nGW history in the Sweet 16.At the beginning of this season, there were hopes\nthat the Colonials could match that performance. With a 10-1 start including\nwins over Virginia and Seton Hall, the hype grew, culminating in GW’s first\nnational ranking in a decade.The cracks began to form in a 21-point loss at\nDePaul, then widened in losses at Saint Louis and to Richmond. A win at VCU\ncould have turned things around, but the defensive presence the Colonials had\nin Madison Square Garden on Tuesday was nowhere to be found in losses to Saint\nJoseph’s, St. Bonaventure and Davidson. GW finished 11-7 in the Atlantic\n10.The team still had hope before its A-10 quarterfinal against Saint\nJoseph’s. “Win and we’re in,” Lonergan had said. When the Colonials blew a\n14-point halftime lead, the NIT was all but guaranteed.“I was heartbroken we\ndidn’t make the Big Dance, but I don’t want — I want people to hold me\nresponsible for it and not them,” Lonergan said.In the first round, the\nfourth-seeded Colonials needed a buzzer-beater from guard Alex Mitola to beat\nNo. 5 seed Hofstra. After that, it seemed the Colonials decided they wanted to\nkeep playing. GW thumped No. 1 seed Monmouth on the road and pounded the ball\ninside to beat No. 2 seed Florida at home.“I didn’t want this to be my last\ngame so I gave it everything,” Larsen said after his 14-point, 13-rebound\nnight against the Gators.Larsen, McDonald and Garino finally know when their\nlast game will be. They’ve already doubled their wins from freshman year, when\nGW went 13-17. They’ve brought the team back to the postseason and haven’t\nmissed the 20-win threshold since, but it seemed their senior years would end\non a sour note._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"George Washington aiming to end season with NIT championship victory - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#GW aims to end season with win over #Valpo in #NIT championship, @NoraPrinciotti writes: https://t.co/p2yvet0Sm8 https://t.co/XbRRb7CPlf","date":"Wed Mar 30 23:15:51 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"715316640179732480"},"retweets":1},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/1MU6HtJ"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678eab"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Officially, the NCAA has 349 Division I women’s basketball programs.In actuality, there are 348 — plus the University of Connecticut.UConn operates in its own realm of college hoops, high above so-called competitors such as Notre Dame, Maryland and Stanford. The Huskies play in a universe that’s different than any other, occupied by no other team in any sport.Is it good for women’s basketball?It has no bearing. The sport carries on just fine outside of Storrs. Teams put together good-to-great seasons. Programs build, peak and rebuild. Top prep stars scatter themselves around the country.None of that has anything to do with UConn, which has reached nine consecutive Final Fours, won 73 consecutive games and captured five of the last seven national titles — including the last three.The Huskies’ dominance became a subject for debate (yet again) when Boston Globe columnist Dan Shaughnessy wrote on Twitter over the weekend: “UConn Women beat Miss St. 98-38 in NCAA tourney. Hate to punish them for being great, but they are killing women’s game. Watch? No thanks.”They definitely killed the Bulldogs, just like they’ve killed everybody on the schedule. UConn beat Texas, 86-65, in the Elite Eight and its average margin of victory this season is a whopping 40 points. Opponents have been vanquished in 120 of the last 121 games, none of them coming within single digits.“The Huskies have no competition,” Shaughnessy wrote in a follow-up column after being excoriated for his tweet. “Sorry, but how can this be a good thing for women’s basketball?”Again, it’s not about UConn.Geno Auriemma’s program is a machine, a relentless beast that serves as the sport’s measuring stick. The Huskies are likely to rout Oregon State in Sunday’s semifinal and do likewise to either Syracuse or Washington in the championship. That would be Auriemma’s 11th national title, moving him past John Wooden for the most in NCAA basketball.But not very long ago — just four years — Baylor went 40-0 and won the title. Texas A\u0026amp;M won the season before that. UConn was knocked out in the Final Four both times. When Maryland won the championship in 2006, it was during a four-season title drought for the Huskies, who reached “only” one Final Four in that span.The point is women’s college basketball has an abundance of programs that can enjoy themselves when UConn isn’t on the other bench. Fans can relish plenty of dramatic, intense competition in games that don’t involve the Huskies, like when No. 1 seeds South Carolina and Notre Dame were upset in the Sweet 16 this week. It marked the third time in the last four seasons that a pair of No. 1 seeds lost in that round.Blowouts can be terrible for TV ratings as viewers lose interest and see what else is on, but watching UConn carve up otherwise fine teams can be a treat, too, an opportunity for fans to marvel at history in the making. Every chance to see UConn is another chance to revel in its downright dominance and utter destruction of the best of the rest. The Huskies are 36-0 despite playing the nation’s hardest non-conference schedule._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"SNYDER: UConn overshadows parity among other women's basketball teams - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#UConn's dominance overshadows parity among other women’s teams, writes @DeronSnyder: https://t.co/liXlMbLq0r https://t.co/GU1BGi9YP7","date":"Wed Mar 30 23:01:08 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"715312938186313728"},"retweets":1},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/1PGrUqU"}

Eighteen visitors\nand a National Park Service ranger were trapped in the elevator, and 22 people\nand a ranger were stuck on the observation deck at the time. Everyone was\nevacuated safely via the staircase.D.C. Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton\nexpressed concern that frequent breakdowns could have “a particularly\ndetrimental effect on, for example, visiting elderly groups, pregnant women,\nand those with disabilities.”Mr. Litterst said the park service is exploring\noptions to keep the elevator in service, including expanding the preventative\nmaintenance program and replacing the control system for the elevator.** SEE\nALSO: First D.C. woman to receive Purple Heart for Iraq war honored at City\nHall **Mrs. Norton, the District’s nonvoting representative in Congress, said\nshe spoke Tuesday with Gay Vietzke, superintendent of National Mall and\nMemorial Parks, who told her the agency is looking at the monument’s 20-year-\nold mechanical system that controls the elevator. The system was not upgraded\nduring the monument’s renovation after the 2011 earthquake, she said.“Based on\nmy conversation with Superintendent Vietzke, I believe that NPS has begun to\nunderstand that the problem goes well beyond the elevator itself, but also to\nother outdated features, such as the elevator control system,” Mrs. Norton\nsaid.In recent months the elevator has been plagued with problems, though not\nall related to the control system. In May, the monument was closed due to a\npower failure in the elevator and again in June to repair mechanical issues.\nIn August, another malfunction shut down the attraction. Last month, the\niconic symbol was closed for a few days after a contractor accidentally\ndamaged the elevator control box while working on a separate issue inside the\nmonument.The Washington Monument was badly damaged in a rare, 5.8-magnitude\nearthquake that hit the D.C. region on Aug. 23, 2011, and caused more than 150\ncracks in the marble structure.Repairing the cracks took about three years and\ncost about $15 million, half of which was funded through a donation by D.C.\nphilanthropist David Rubenstein. Taxpayer funds paid for the remaining $7.5\nmillion.A 2012 damage assessment study by engineering firms Wiss, Janney,\nElstner Associates and Tipping Mar said the elevator rails and framing should\nbe inspected and repaired as needed before reopening the monument.“The\ncounterweights were noted to have shifted in the earthquake and one of the\nbolts holding them together had failed,” the report said. “At a minimum, the\ncounterweights should be realigned and the failed bolt or rod should be\nreplaced.”There was no mention of any damage to the control system, which has\ncaused elevator outages since the monument reopened nearly two years ago.\n\n","title":"Washington Monument elevator malfunction 5th since 2014 reopening - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#WashingtonMonument #elevator malfunction 5th since 2014 reopening https://t.co/RIY5N2SNgo","date":"Wed Mar 30 22:42:23 +0000 2016","favs":6,"id":{"$numberLong":"715308216977080324"},"retweets":6},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/30/washington-monument-elevator-malfunction-5th-since/#.VvxWPwccN3Y.twitter"}

He has five daughters. I asked how he intends to explain Trump to his girls. Trump is not only repeatedly divorced, but left his wives for mistresses and brags about his sexual conquests (including with married women). The casino mogul has strip clubs under his belt. We thought Bill Clinton was bad. At least Bill had the political discreetness to deny his escapades. (How’s that for a new standard?) Trump boasts.Mark told me that he has had the “Trump talk” with his daughters. He has told them that, sadly, all morality could be out the window this election. Among the Republicans, there still are solid family men in Ted Cruz and John Kasich (as was “Choking Marco”). Unfortunately, with Trump, the moral character that Republicans have demanded in their leaders has become an utter non-issue to angry advocates. This year, Democrats will be able to tell Republicans that all their past talk of family values and criticisms of Bill Clinton was a bunch of rotten hypocrisy.The presidency is preeminently a position of moral leadership. “Morality,” said our first president, George Washington, is an “indispensable support” to political prosperity. That has not changed. What is changing is the huge number of Americans who suddenly don’t care about moral behavior in their leader, or excuse or justify it.And so, my advice to parents, especially on the Republican side: If Donald Trump gets the nomination, be prepared to sit down with your kids to have a frank “Trump talk.” Teach them not to be like that man. And always be ready to quickly change the TV channel.**(4)** David Brooks: The Sexual Politics of 2016 (_The New York Times_)Trump’s misogyny is not the historical moralistic misogyny. Traditional misogyny blames women for the lustful, licentious and powerful urges that men sometimes feel in their presence. In this misogyny, women are the powerful, disgusting corrupters — the vixens, sirens and monsters. This gynophobic misogyny demands that women be surrounded with taboos and purgation rituals, along with severe restrictions on behavior and dress.Trump’s misogyny, on the other hand, has a commercial flavor. The central arena of life is male competition. Women are objects men use to win points in that competition. The purpose of a woman’s body is to reflect status on a man. One way to emasculate a rival man is to insult or conquer his woman.**(5)** A plea to my centrist friends in the United Methodist Church, by Talbot Davis***There’s a debate going on among UMC folks over whether or not single ministers are allowed to be sexually active.

A Russian newspaper reported recently\nthat the Kremlin used mercenaries to fight in Donbass and also in Syria. The\nreport also says the group’s casualties were concealed and medals awarded in\nsecret, many times posthumously.The Guardian reports, “An investigation\npublished by Fontanka, an independent Russian newspaper, found that the\nKremlin had hired members of a private military company called Wagner to go to\nSyria and Ukraine. The use of contractors gives Mr. Putin a deniable way of\nsending trained personnel to both countries. Wagner is believed to have a\nmembership of around 1,000 mercenaries, but officially the group does not\nexist since Russian law forbids private military companies. But Wagner is\nregistered in Argentina and has a training camp in the Russian village of\nMolkino — the same village that hosts a training site of the 10th special\nforces brigade of the GRU military intelligence.”It has been patently obvious\nthat some type of Russian-backed force was operating in the Donbass region\neast of Kyiv. Some Russian soldiers have been captured and massive amounts of\nRussian armaments have been brought across the border. Scores of long truck\nconvoys have routinely brought “relief supplies” into Donetsk from the Russian\nside.Many analysts have concluded that the conflict in East Ukraine would\nsubside as the Russian expedition in Syria ramped up.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678eb1"},"content":"The negative reviews given to last weekend’s blockbuster debut of “Batman v.\nSuperman: Dawn Of Justice” were perfect testimony to an age desperately\nstruggling to stay centered around truth.Some complained that the existential\nthemes the movie reached at were beyond the grasp of characters in masks and\ntights. But having already seen the movie three times myself, I’m confident\nthat the list of things beyond the grasp of such reviewers is a long one.No\nears to hear. No eyes to see. We have made ourselves orphans to the\ntruth.Turns out orphans are also a fundamental theme in the stories of not\nonly Batman and Superman, but also the movie’s villain, Lex Luthor. Three men\nunmoored from cherished or honored upbringings as children who go on to become\nuber-men of abnormal and extreme pursuits — all undertaken in the attempt to\ncorner and capture the definition of ultimate meaning.And whether villain or\nhero, they are often confused. They are often angry. They are often riddled\nwith insecurities and doubts that must be covered up at all costs.Perhaps that\nis why the movie was perplexing to so many critics. We, the most pound-for-\npound educated people ever in the history of God’s green earth, are rarely\nprone to Socratic doubt anymore. We are absolutely as certain that Muslims are\nvictims of Islamophobia, as we are that their violent religion is simply\nunderstood when it crucifies a Catholic priest in Yemen on Good Friday, and\nmurders at least 72 Christians in Pakistan on Easter Sunday.We are absolutely\ncertain that when President Obama said last week that capitalism and\ncommunism/socialism are just two sides of the same utopian coin, he must be\nthe greatest economic thinker since Adam Smith, despite whatever evidence\nObamacare provides to the contrary.We are absolutely certain that the North\nCarolina legislature’s attempt to maintain a barrier between the men’s room\nand the ladies room is a level of bigotry on par with Jim Crow. We are\nabsolutely certain that the Georgia legislature’s attempt to protect religious\nfreedom and marriage from the fascism of the Rainbow Jihad is a legacy of a\nbygone era and backwards thinking unfit for our time.We don’t really ask big\nquestions, but we do hide from truly big answers.And while “We” most\ndefinitely isn’t all of us yet, it sure seems like it is the part of us that\nis calling most of the shots. When Lex Luthor says “Knowledge without power is\nparadoxical,” he is preaching to the current progressive age’s choir.“I am\nsmarter than you, thus I am better than you. And that goes for you, too, God.\nOr Superman. The very idea of you usurps my right to live in the flat earth of\nmy choosing. You deserve to be taunted and hazed out of existence, but falling\nshort of that, you will feel the weight of my boot on your throat.”What I am\ndescribing is a brand of Gnosticism, and our culture is drunk on it right now.\nSo when the characters of Gotham and Metropolis were similarly afflicted in\nthe movie, why should many of us see or hear anything to reflect upon? Other\nthan a nagging lecture from a parent we tuned out years ago. Or our own\nconscience, hard-wired into us by a Creator we willfully suppress the\nknowledge of.As Daily Planet editor Perry White reminded do-gooder reporter\nClark Kent, “the American conscience is dead.” And proud of it.But lest we\nthink it is only the black hats in movies who engage in such folly, we have\nBatman’s motivations to ponder.

We’re relying on our $400\nmillion investment in F-35 to provide mission systems [that] must work in some\nreasonable sense of that word.”** SEE ALSO: Russian air force bombing Islamic\nState effectively, Pentagon concedes **The F-35 program will spend $1.13\ntrillion to buy and service more than 2,400 aircraft until 2070. Each F-35\ncosts about $100 million. The jet is needed to replace older, less-capable\nwarplanes.The program has been plagued with development problems under the\nObama administration since Defense Secretary **Robert M. Gates** killed the\nF-22 fighter bomber in 2009. The scrapping of the F-22 left the F-35 as the\nsole radar-evading stealth aircraft for the future.Mr. Gilmore testified that\nthe F-35 system remains “immature” and “provides limited combat capability,”\ndespite the Marines declaring their F-35s as having initial operating\ncapability and the Air Force planning to do so later this year.** SEE ALSO:\nShifting blame, White House faults war general’s 2014 ISIS assessment as he\ndeparts **Flight tests of new software for the jet, known as Block 3i,\nrevealed “many unresolved significant deficiencies,” he added.The software\n“was so unstable that productive flight testing could not be accomplished,”\nMr. Gilmore said, adding that the software is less stable than earlier\nsoftware it replaced.The software stability problem involves frequent timing\nerrors between radar sensors and onboard computers during takeoff. The problem\nresults in system restarts and subsequent difficulties for computers in\nregaining radar pictures several minutes after restarting.The jet manufacturer\nLockheed Martin is working to remedy the problem within the software’s 8\nmillion lines of code.Earlier software problems prevented testing weapons’\ndelivery accuracy until better software for the avionics was installed.“A\nrecent example is an attempted four-ship electronic warfare ‘Super Scenario’\nmission with Block 3F software that resulted in only two aircraft arriving at\nthe range because the other two aircraft ground-aborted due to avionics\nstability problems during startup,” Mr. Gilmore said.Additionally, when the\nF-35 was flown against a dense and realistic electronic warfare airspace, the\navionics were unable to detect targets and had difficulty applying sensor\ninformation.As of the end of January, the testers found 931 software program\ndeficiencies, including 158 considered so severe that the glitches could\n“cause death, severe injury, or .

Lloyd Austin on Wednesday relinquished command of the U.S. forces\nfighting the Islamic State in Tampa, Florida — as a bit of a sour note hung in\nthe air back in Washington.President Obama has been consistently criticized\nfor a 2014 comment to The New Yorker magazine that the Islamic State, as it\ninvaded Iraq from Syria, was merely the “jayvee.” In other words, it was not\nto be taken seriously. Months later, the terrorist army controlled large\nswaths of Iraq and Syria, forcing Mr. Obama to order a new war.Then, The\nAtlantic’s Jeffrey Goldberg interviewed Mr. Obama and published a long\nfavorable story this month on the commander-in-chief’s foreign policy views.\nIn the story is this:“Early in 2014, Obama’s intelligence advisers told him\nthat ISIS was of marginal importance. According to administration officials,\nGeneral Lloyd Austin, then the commander of Central Command, which oversees\nU.S. military operations in the Middle East, told the White House that the\nIslamic State was ‘a flash in the pan.’ This analysis led Obama, in an\ninterview with The New Yorker, to describe the constellation of jihadist\ngroups in Iraq and Syria as terrorism’s ‘jayvee team.’”The quote clearly\nshowed the White House was shifting blame from Mr. Obama to Gen. Austin, a\n40-year Army combatant, leader and commander, as he went out the door.Gen.\nAustin, through his public affairs office at U.S. Central Command, has denied\never making such a remark.His supporters point out that, as the last four-star\ngeneral to leave Iraq in December 2011, he had recommended to the White House\nthat more than 20,000 American troops remain in the country because the gains\nthere were reversible.At the time that Mr. Obama downplayed the Islamic State,\nthen known by a different name, it already had built a large army in Syria and\nhad begun its expansion into Iraq.Mr. Obama has a track record of shifting\nblame. For example, when the White House plan to train Syrian rebels to fight\nthe Islamic State failed, he told an interviewer that he always knew it would\nnot work.Gen. Austin turned over command at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida,\nto Army Gen. Joseph Votel, who had been chief of U.S. Special Operations\nCommand.At the ceremony, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter heaped praise on Gen.\nAustin, a West Point graduate and recipient of the Silver Star for gallantry\nin battle.As CentCom leader for three years, he has directed operations in\nAfghanistan, Iraq and Syria, and kept watch on an expansionist Iran in the\nPersian Gulf.“The people of CentCom have met these challenges under the\nextraordinary leadership of a towering figure in the life of our military,\nGeneral Lloyd Austin,” Mr. Carter said. “It’s one of the highest compliments\nin the Army to be called ‘a soldier’s soldier.’ For more than four decades,\nLloyd Austin has not only demonstrated what it means to be a soldier’s\nsoldier. He has come to define it.”At the Pentagon on Tuesday, Peter Cook, Mr.\nCarter’s spokesman, was asked if the secretary would clear the four-star\ngeneral of the “flash in the pan” quote at the change of command.“I don’t\nthink Secretary Carter needs to clear General Austin of that,” Mr. Cook said.\n“I think General Austin himself has indicated that that statement is factually\nincorrect, and I believe there are others who have said the same. So I’m not\naware that General Austin ever made that comment, and I think I would refer\nyou to the White House as well if you want to check with them._Story Continues\n→_\n\n","title":"White House faults decorated U.S. general's handling of ISIS as he departs - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"White House faults decorated U.S. general’s handling of ISIS as he departs https://t.co/tquoYGRAIY","date":"Wed Mar 30 19:09:19 +0000 2016","favs":4,"id":{"$numberLong":"715254597200306181"},"retweets":22},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/30/white-house-faults-decorated-us-generals-handling-/"}

A gang member was informing on\nthe group and had agreed to wear a wire as he and others drove to Gar-Field\nHigh School, where they expected to attack their target with machetes and a\nsawed-off shotgun. Instead, the gang was met by law enforcement, who took them\ninto custody.But intel doesn’t always come in time to prevent gang violence in\nNorthern Virginia. In two other instances, investigators were left putting\ninformants to work to locate murder victims’ well-hidden graves.Prosecutors\ndescribed the scenarios Wednesday in opening trial arguments in a case that\ninitially had charged 13 members of MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, with crimes\nincluding three murders and the attempted murder at Gar-Field.The notably\nlarge case has shrunk from 13 defendants to seven since federal prosecutors\nfirst brought indictments against the men in 2014. Attorneys said the other\nsix men have entered into plea deals with the government, kept under seal\nuntil the trial, that will require them to testify against their fellow gang\nmembers.But the remaining seven defendants appear poised to downplay their\ninvolvement in the three homicides and an attempted murder, instead calling\ninto question the deals the government has made with those who pleaded\nguilty.In opening statements, the defense attorney for one of the seven\ndescribed a cooperating witness as a “pathological serial killer.” Attorney\nManuel Leiva, who is representing Jose Lopez Torres, said one of the former\ndefendants, Jose Del Cid, has admitted to participating in some of the crimes\nand is known to have committed at least four murders in El Salvador and two\nothers in the United States.Mr. Leiva said the men who pleaded guilty (and now\nare likely in witness protection) had “so much blood on their hands” that they\nhad plenty of reason to cooperate with the government’s investigation — and\neven to lie about others’ involvement.The complicated trial is being held in\nthe largest courtroom available at the federal courthouse in Alexandria, where\nextra security has been put in place.**Thousands of members**The defendants\nfacing trial are Mr. Torres, Omar DeJesus Castillo, Douglas Duran Cerritos,\nAlvin Gaitan Benitez, Christian Lemus Cerna, Manuel Ernesto Paiz Guevara and\nJesus Alejandro Chavez.The seven men and their attorneys took up three rows of\nseating inside the packed courtroom as opening statements began Wednesday.\nSeveral of the defendants wore white or blue button-up shirts, and one wore a\nsimple short-sleeved white polo shirt.The trial comes as local law enforcement\nofficers increasingly have become concerned about the level of violence in the\nregion attributable to MS-13. Last year, police in Northern Virginia and\nMaryland linked eight homicides to the gang. Many of the individuals who have\nbeen charged with the crimes are teenagers.Gang expert Sgt. Claudio Saa of the\nHerndon Police Department testified Wednesday that the age of MS-13 recruits\nin the region has gotten younger in recent years. Children as young as 10\nyears old are being recruited for the gang, he said.MS-13 membership in the\nNorthern Virginia is estimated between 2,000 and 3,000 people, Sgt. Saa said,\nadding that instilling fear in the community through violence is one of the\ngang’s overarching goals._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Federal trial of MS-13 gang members begins in Northern Virginia - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Federal trial of MS-13 gang members begins in Northern Virginia https://t.co/nypy1046cH","date":"Wed Mar 30 18:59:44 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715252184057823232"},"retweets":3},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/1SxTLy1"}

Cory Gardner, who has led the charge against bringing the\ndetainees to Colorado, hosted a town hall in Fremont County that drew more\nthan 100 residents and local officials concerned about the possible\ntransfer.“I will do everything I can to prevent Guantanamo Bay detainees from\nbeing brought to Florence, to Fremont [County], to Colorado and to the United\nStates of America,” Mr. Gardner said to a round of applause, according to the\nCanon City Daily Record.Pentagon officials toured federal and state prisons\nlast year in three states — Colorado, Kansas and South Carolina — but met with\nstiff opposition from Republican Govs. Sam Brownback in Kansas and Nikki Haley\nin South Carolina.Mr. Hickenlooper, on the other hand, initially said he would\nweigh the risks, costs and benefits of accepting the Gitmo detainees, many of\nwhom have ties to Islamist terrorist organizations.Closing Guantanamo Bay has\nbeen on Mr. Obama’s checklist since his 2008 presidential campaign, but the\npresident has been unable to overcome staunch opposition from Congress as well\nas governors in the states under consideration for the transfer of\ndetainees.He made a last-ditch push with the release of a plan Feb. 23 that\nexamined 13 potential sites for the transfer of the 91 remaining detainees,\nincluding prisons in the three states and facilities at unnamed military\nbases.“For many years, it’s been clear that the detention facility at\nGuantanamo Bay does not advance our national security,” said Mr. Obama at a\npress conference unveiling the plan, adding that keeping Gitmo open is\n“contrary to our values.”Congress approved a Defense Department budget last\nyear signed by Mr. Obama that prohibits the transfer of detainees to U.S.\nsoil, leading to speculation that the president may attempt to close the\nfacility via executive order.One problem is that if the president does\nrelocate the detainees, “you’ve just created Guantanamo North,” said Tom\nJoscelyn, senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.He\nnoted that the president’s own task force has deemed 67 of the 91 detainees\ntoo dangerous to release._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"John Hickenlooper blocks Obama, opposes transfer of Gitmo detainees to Colorado - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#Hickenlooper deals blow to #Obama by opposing transfer of #Gitmo detainees to #Colorado https://t.co/CkBJZnZQkW https://t.co/Q0LSqJgcKP","date":"Wed Mar 30 18:41:40 +0000 2016","favs":10,"id":{"$numberLong":"715247639474880513"},"retweets":17},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/zq2U7A"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678eca"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Donald Trump isn’t just hijacking the Republican Party, he’s hijacking the Democratic platform as well.Asked to name the three functions of government at a CNN town hall on Tuesday, the GOP presidential front-runner initially said “security, security, security,” however, when pressed, he added health care and education. He also threw in housing and “great neighborhoods,” for good measure.You’d be hard pressed to find one Republican within the conservative movement who could agree with the last three — in fact, conservatives have made it their rallying cry to oppose Obamacare and Common Core educational standards, believing private enterprise and states are better equipped to handle the issues, not the federal government.True conservatives believe in a very limited government, with strict adherence to the Constitution. No where in the Constitution does it mention health care, education or for the federal government to provide “great neighborhoods.”Mr. Trump’s popularity isn’t based in conservative ideology, that much is clear. On Tuesday, he also criticized Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker for not raising taxes to cover his state’s budget deficit. No Republican believes the government’s role should be tax and spend.“There’s a $2.2 billion deficit and the schools were going begging and everything was going begging because he didn’t want to raise taxes cause he was going to run for president,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with radio host Michael Koolidge. “So instead of raising taxes, he cut back on schools, he cut back on highways, he cut back on a lot of things.”This is a sentiment I’m sure Hillary Clinton or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders would agree with.Matter of fact, many of Mr. Trump’s policy prescriptions are more in line with the traditional Democratic platform than they are Republican.He praised President Barack Obama’s stimulus saying it was “what we need …. building infrastructure, building great projects, putting people to work in that sense.”Mr. Trump has said he “very much agrees” with Mr. Sanders’ position on trade, a self-identified socialist. Asked how he would differentiate himself with Mr. Sanders on the issue, Mr. Trump promised only he would be able to make a deal to correct trade imbalances.And on the bank bailout, which Mrs. Clinton voted for and Mr. Obama advocated, Mr. Trump told Larry King in an April 15, 2009, interview: “I do agree with what they’re doing with the banks. Whether they fund them or nationalize them, it doesn’t matter, but you have to keep the banks going.”In a debate in New Hampshire, Mr. Trump defined what he believes constitutes a conservative.“I view the word conservative as a derivative of the word ‘conserve,’ ” Mr. Trump explained. “We want to conserve our money. We want to conserve our wealth. We want to conserve. We want to be smart. We want to be smart where we go, where we spend, how we spend. We want to conserve our country. We want to save our country. And we have people that have no idea how to do that, and they are not doing it, and it’s a very important word, and it’s something I believe in very, very strongly.”No where in his answer was the mention of the Constitution, liberty or justice.In Mr. Trump’s worldview, I guess it doesn’t really matter.\n\n","title":"Donald Trump sure sounds like a Democrat - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Donald Trump sure sounds like a Democrat https://t.co/w7bxKUVded #DonaldTrump https://t.co/gH8iPUAMuU","date":"Wed Mar 30 16:41:06 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"715217297598758912"},"retweets":9},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/fYMjZW"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678ecc"},"content":"MINNEAPOLIS — Two Minneapolis police officers involved in the November fatal\nshooting of a black man will not be charged, a Minnesota prosecutor said\nWednesday.Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said his decision to not\ncharge Officer Mark Ringgenberg and Officer Dustin Schwarze for their roles in\nthe death of 24-year-old Jamar Clark was based on evidence that showed Clark\nwas not handcuffed at the time, attempted to gain control of an officer’s\nweapon and the officers believed they were in danger of being shot.Ringgenberg\nis white, and Schwarze’s race has not been released.On Nov. 15, police said\nthey responded to a reported assault in which Clark was a suspect, and he was\ninterfering with paramedics trying to treat the victim. Clark was shot during\nwhat authorities called a struggle. Some who said they saw the shooting have\nsaid Clark wasn’t struggling at the time and was handcuffed, but Freeman said\nforensic evidence shows that he was not handcuffed. Clark died a day later.The\nshooting prompted protests in Minneapolis, including an 18-day encampment\noutside a north side police precinct.Freeman decided earlier this month\nagainst taking the case to a grand jury.Investigators had video of Clark’s\nshooting from several sources, but said early on that it didn’t provide a full\npicture of what happened that night. Protesters have demanded that authorities\nrelease the video. They also demanded that the case not go to a grand jury for\nconsideration of charges.Public skepticism over grand juries, who do their\nwork in secret, grew after police officers weren’t indicted in the high-\nprofile deaths of blacks in other cities, including the fatal 2014 shootings\nof 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland and 18-year-old Michael Brown in\nFerguson, Missouri, and the 2014 chokehold death of 43-year-old Eric Garner in\nNew York. But grand juries reached indictments in other cases, including in\nChicago, where an officer faces murder charges in the 2014 death of 17-year-\nold Laquan McDonald, whose shooting was captured on video.The state of\nMinnesota investigated whether Ringgenberg and Schwarze violated state laws,\nand the FBI, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Minnesota and the Department of\nJustice’s Civil Rights Division were conducting a federal criminal\ninvestigation to determine whether police intentionally violated Clark’s civil\nrights through excessive force. That’s a high legal standard because an\naccident, bad judgment or simple negligence on the officer’s part isn’t enough\nto bring federal charges.The Department of Justice is also reviewing how the\ncity responded to protests after Clark’s death.The protesters, which included\norganizers of Black Lives Matter Minneapolis, the Minneapolis NAACP and other\ncommunity groups and citizens, raised the issue of difficult relations between\nblack residents and Minneapolis police.The unrest over Clark’s death also\nincluded demands that city and state leaders do more about persistent poverty\nseen as the root of racial tensions. The state is considering funneling\nmillions of dollars toward job training, loans and other initiatives to help\nblack residents get ahead.The protests were largely peaceful. Four men were\ncharged with felonies in a Nov. 23 attack on protesters that prosecutors say\nwas racially motivated. One of the men allegedly fired shots at protesters,\nleaving five with injuries that were not life-threatening.\n\n","title":"Jamar Clark shooting: No charges for 2 Minneapolis officers - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"No charges for 2 Minneapolis officers in Jamar Clark shooting https://t.co/6aJ8iQa4D8","date":"Wed Mar 30 16:23:17 +0000 2016","favs":2,"id":{"$numberLong":"715212814722445312"},"retweets":5},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/21TJNJK"}

When he\nthreatened to fetch his cellphone to record the encounter, the police chased\nhim down the hallway, kicked in his door and told him they were going to\ndetain him for attempting to have the family dog attack officers.The family\nsaid officers used a Taser to stun Mr. Cardenas at least seven times,\ntriggering an episode that required him to be hospitalized.“The police charged\ninto his bedroom… and attempted to restrain Kyle again.

The Obama administration said that’s why the\nAffordable Care Act built in transition programs to assume some of the risks\nin the law’s initial years.“After years of being discriminated against,\nAmericans with pre-existing conditions are no longer locked out of coverage\nbecause of a health condition like asthma or diabetes,” HHS spokesman Benjamin\nWakana said Wednesday. “It’s no surprise that people who newly gained access\nto coverage under the Affordable Care Act needed health care; that’s why they\nwere locked out of coverage before.”The administration has said it’s working\nto try to entice healthier customers to sign up for Obamacare. That would keep\npremiums in check, while clamping down on special enrollment periods that tend\nto draw higher-cost customers into the exchanges.But the higher rate of ER\nvisits Blue Cross found is difficult to reconcile with Obamacare’s goals.The\nlaw’s advocates had said the law was designed in part to get customers signed\nup with regular doctors, so they could catch problems earlier and reduce the\nneed for costly emergency room visits.Blue Cross urged brand-new customers to\ntry to avoid unnecessary ER visits, and to follow their prescriptions and make\nregular visits to a primary care doctor.“The findings underscore the need for\nall of us in the health care system, and newly insured consumers, to work\ntogether to make sure that people get the right health care service in the\nright care setting and at the right time,” said Alissa Fox, a Blue Cross Blue\nShield senior vice president.The findings are noteworthy because Blue Cross\nplans serve millions on the Obamacare’s Web-based exchanges in 46 states and\nD.C.**Insurer complaints**And they echo complaints from other top insurers\nsuch as UnitedHealth Group, which said it is hemorrhaging money on the\nexchanges due to a much sicker-than-expected customer base.UnitedHealth has\nwarned it might pull out of the Obamacare marketplace by 2017 if things don’t\nimprove, though other plans have said they plan to stick it out and see if the\nmarket stabilizes._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Obamacare customers are sicker and costlier than pre-2014 folks: insurer study - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Insurer study: #Obamacare customers are sicker and costlier than pre-2014 folks https://t.co/26XJJmx6BX #healthcare","date":"Wed Mar 30 15:31:18 +0000 2016","favs":4,"id":{"$numberLong":"715199733837524993"},"retweets":15},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/kEH1fv"}

But a group of 50 faculty members at the\nChapel Hill campus were less restrained.“The recently passed House Bill 2\nmakes it impossible for UNC-Chapel Hill and its surrounding communities to\nprotect valued faculty, staff, and students from discrimination simply because\nof who they are,” the statement signed by faculty members read. “We are\ngravely concerned that House Bill 2, and the disturbing message it sends, will\nmake it difficult for Carolina to find and retain the best faculty, staff and\nstudents.”The administration at neighboring Duke University issued a stern\nrebuke of the law last week, promising that activities at the private\ninstitution would “not be impacted” by the legislation.“Duke University values\nevery individual,” the statement said. “We are committed to equality,\ndiversity and inclusion, which makes us a better and stronger community. For\nthat reason, we deplore any effort to deny any person the protection of the\nlaw because of sexual orientation or gender identity.”And Elon University\nconcurred that the law “does not apply to private institutions and will not\nimpact Elon’s policies and practices.”“In regard to the use of restrooms, we\nreaffirm our position that individuals should use facilities in which they\nfeel most comfortable and align with their gender identity,” the college said\nin a statement.Republican Gov.

We think that is a good thing. We encouraged\nthat from the start. They said initially that their primary goal was to go\nafter ISIL in Syria, and they’re doing so now.”The change in tune apparently\nwas prompted by Russia’s large role, with Syrian government and Iranian\nforces, in wresting control of the Syrian city of Palmyra from the Islamic\nState, also known as ISIL and ISIS.In the densely confusing picture that is\nthe Syrian civil war, the Obama administration has called for the ouster of\nMr. Assad. Yet Washington views the U.S.’ main enemy in the country as the\nIslamic State, which is also a foe of Mr. Assad as well as a deadly threat\noutside its territory.That sharing of enemies prompted Mr. Cook to say the\nU.S. welcomed the fall of Palmyra, northeast of the capital, Damascus.“We\ncertainly welcome word of any loss of territory on the part of ISIL, and the\nejection of ISIL from parts of Syria we think [is] a good thing,” Mr. Cook\nsaid. “We are actively trying to eject ISIL ourselves from parts of Syria.“At\nthe same time, we have said for some time that the Assad regime is the primary\nreason for the Syrian civil war, and we think that the Assad regime’s focus\nshould be right now on trying to end that civil war and by engaging in the\ndiplomatic process that’s currently under way,” he said.Secretary of State\nJohn F. Kerry is trying to forge a permanent cease-fire between Syrian rebel\nand government forces that would lead to some type of new administration in\nDamascus.Mr. Cook was asked if the Obama administration would welcome the same\njoint force — Russian warplanes and Syrian and Iranian ground troops — to move\nnorth and try to take Raqqa, the Islamic State’s so-called capital and a siren\ncall for foreign terrorists who want to live in an Islamic caliphate.“At this\npoint, again, we’re not going to look ahead into the future as to what their\nmilitary moves might be,” he said. “We know that our focus will be the\nelimination of ISIL from Syria and Iraq, and our focus is on Raqqa.”The Obama\nadministration’s strategy for evicting the Islamic State relies on daily\nairstrikes to kill terrorists and take away their weapons, supplies and\ncash.At the same time, U.S. troops in Iraq are training Iraqi government\nforces, with the next counteroffensive being the retaking of Mosul in the\nnorth. Meanwhile, a small team of special operations forces are working with\nlocal armies in Syria to try to isolate Raqqa.All the while Washington has\ncastigated the Russians for virtually ignoring the Islamic Satte and\nindiscriminately bombing civilian areas.Air Force Gen. Philip Breedlove, top\nNATO commander, bluntly said that Mr. Putin was driving more refugees into\nEurope, calling the herding the “weaponization of immigration.”_Story\nContinues →_\n\n","title":"Putin's Russian air force bombing Islamic State effectively, Pentagon concedes - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"RT @RoScarborough: Russian air force bombing Islamic State effectively, Pentagon concedes https://t.co/BiHBc0zGo3 via @washtimes","date":"Wed Mar 30 13:51:19 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715174568680357889"},"retweets":19},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/putins-russian-air-force-bombing-islamic-state-eff/#.VvvXqDVBPmM.twitter"}

Lamberth said\nit remains to be seen whether the government did try to obfuscate matters, but\nsaid there’s at least enough smoke that Judicial Watch, the conservative\ninterest group suing to get a look at all of Mrs. Clinton’s records, should be\nallowed to press for more details about how the State Department made its\ndecisions.“Plaintiff is relying on constantly shifting admissions by the\ngovernment and the former government officials,” Judge Lamberth said.Mrs.\nClinton declined to use a State.gov email account during her term as\nsecretary, instead using an email account tied to a server she kept at her\nhome in New York.All of her messages that concerned official business were\nsupposed to be archived by the State Department, but she kept them, only\nreturning them in December 2014, nearly two years after leaving office and\nonly at the prompting of the House committee probing the 2012 terrorist attack\nin Benghazi.That meant that during her four years in office and nearly two\nyears afterward, the State Department was not searching those documents in\nresponse to open-records requests from Congress or the public.Last month, the\nState Department finally finished processing more than 30,000 pages of Mrs.\nClinton’s emails and made them public on the department’s Freedom of\nInformation Act web page — a mammoth undertaking that has put a treasure trove\nof information in the public’s eye.Judicial Watch and others argue that some\n30,000 other messages Mrs. Clinton sent from her secret address during her\ntime in office, but which she has deemed private business, should also be\nreviewed by the government.The State Department told Judge Lamberth it never\nmisled the public because it never said it was searching Mrs. Clinton’s emails\nin the first place. The department said that meant it wasn’t acting in bad\nfaith when it responded to open-records requests.Judge Lamberth, though, said\nmore evidence is needed before those conclusions can be reached.“The\ngovernment argues that this does not show a lack of good faith, but that is\nwhat remains to be seen, and the factual record must be developed\nappropriately in order for this court to make that determination,” he said in\na brief ruling.The Justice Department declined to comment on Judge Lamberth’s\nruling, which marks the third legal black eye for the Obama administration in\nrecent weeks.Last week, a federal appeals court said the Justice Department\nwas turning the law on its head to protect the IRS from taxpayers, rather than\nto protect taxpayers from the IRS.And another judge issued a “show cause”\norder demanding to know why the government appeared to conceal documents in an\nopen-records case brought against a top Obama climate adviser. Judge Amit\nMehta, who serves on the district court in Washington, D.C., along with Judge\nLamberth, raised the possibility of punishing the administration for its\nactions.Judge Lamberth’s decision Tuesday joins that of Judge Emmet G.\nSullivan, also in the district court in Washington, who earlier this year\ngranted discovery in another case brought by Judicial Watch against the State\nDepartment._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Hillary Clinton email stories 'constantly shifting,' judge says - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Hillary Clinton email stories ‘constantly shifting,’ judge says https://t.co/JJSEFqdeN2","date":"Wed Mar 30 12:56:35 +0000 2016","favs":6,"id":{"$numberLong":"715160796783845377"},"retweets":15},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/hillary-clinton-email-stories-constantly-shifting-/"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678eda"},"content":"NAYPYITAW, Myanmar (AP) — Myanmar’s slow transition to democracy took a\nmomentous step Wednesday as a trusted aide to ruling-party leader Aung Suu Kyi\ntook over as the country’s president, officially ending more than 50 years of\nthe military’s control over government.In a day full of ceremony and\nsymbolism, Htin Kyaw was sworn in along with his two vice presidents and 18\nCabinet ministers. Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace laureate and face of Myanmar’s\npro-democracy movement, takes on a prominent role as the country’s new foreign\nminister and the head of three other ministries.“The Union Parliament has\nelected me as president, which is a historic moment for this country,” Htin\nKyaw, 70, said in a speech after being sworn in. He pledged to work toward\nnational reconciliation, strive for peace with warring ethnic rebels and\nimproving the lives of Myanmar’s 54 million people.While it was a historic day\nfor this impoverished Southeast Asian country, democracy remains incomplete.\nThe military retains considerable power in the government and parliament, and\nthe president himself will play second fiddle to Suu Kyi. She cannot be\npresident because of a constitutional manipulation engineered by the military,\nand has repeatedly said she will run the country from behind the scenes.“I am\nvery happy that we have a president who represents people,” said Mar Thin, a\n50-year-old street cleaner. She said she used to own 70 acres of land that she\nand her sister inherited from their father before the military kicked them out\nand appropriated the land for the defense ministry.“I hope that the new\ngovernment can solve the land confiscation problem and let us own our land as\nfarmers. All we want is enough food, and to live without fear. I hope that\nPresident Htin Kyaw will do that for us because Daw Suu promised us a lot of\nthings, and we love her too,” Mar Thin said, using an affectionate term for\nSuu Kyi.Htin Kyaw’s swearing-in was held in an austere hall of parliament,\nwith lawmakers dressed in traditional costume. A few hours later, outgoing\nPresident Thein Sein shook hands with his successor and handed him a letter\nand a golden sash, officially transferring power.It was Suu Kyi who led her\nNational League for Democracy party to a landslide win in November elections,\nushering in Myanmar’s first civilian government after 54 years of direct and\nindirect military rule.Suu Kyi endured decades of house arrest and harassment\nby military rulers without ever giving up on her nonviolent campaign to unseat\nthem. The constitutional clause that denied her the presidency excludes anyone\nfrom the position who has a foreign spouse or child. Suu Kyi’s two sons are\nBritish, as was her late husband. The clause is widely seen as having been\nwritten by the military with Suu Kyi in mind.She has repeatedly made it clear\nthat she will run the government from behind the scenes, and in his speech on\nWednesday, Htin Kyaw paid obeisance to Suu Kyi.“The new parliament and new\ngovernment are formed in accord with the policies of the National League for\nDemocracy led by Aung San Suu Kyi,” he said, and referred to the party’s goal\nto amend the constitution.“I have the obligation to work toward achieving a\nconstitution that has democratic norms and is suitable for the nation,” Htin\nKyaw said. “I want to tell the new government, we must constantly try to\nfulfill the hope and will of the people of this country. I wish all citizens\nof this country a successful and peaceful life.”The constitution, drafted by\nthe former junta, reserves 25 percent of the seats in parliament for military\nofficers, guaranteeing that no government can amend the constitution without\nits approval. The military also heads the Home Ministry, the Border Affairs\nMinistry and the Defense Ministry, which gives it control over the corrections\ndepartment, ensuring that the release of political prisoners is its decision\nto make.The military also ensured that one of Htin Kyaw’s two vice presidents\nis a former general, Myint Swe, a close ally of former junta leader Than Shwe.\nMyint Swe remains on a U.S. Treasury Department blacklist that bars American\ncompanies from doing business with several tycoons and senior military figures\nconnected with the former junta.As Htin Kyaw was sworn in, Suu Kyi sat in the\nfront row watching. The same pledge was simultaneously read by First Vice\nPresident Myint Swe and Second Vice President Henry Van Tio.

Earlier plans had called for the Pentagon to\nrotate troops into Europe, where they would have used a set of training\nequipment pre-positioned there.The new proposal would remove the pre-\npositioned equipment, send it to be refurbished, and allow the U.S. forces to\nbring more robust, modern equipment in with them when they deploy. There are\nabout 4,500 soldiers in an armored brigade, along with dozens of heavy\nvehicles, tanks and other equipment.Wednesday’s announcement is also aimed at\neasing worries in Europe, where allies had heard rumblings about the pre-\npositioned equipment being removed and feared the U.S. was scaling back\nsupport.Officials also said the Army would send additional communications\nequipment to Europe so that headquarters units could have the radios,\ncomputers and other equipment needed to work with the brigades.The officials\nwere not authorized to discuss the announcement publicly so spoke on condition\nof anonymity.The changes underscore promises made by defense leaders to\nprotect Europe and send a message to Moscow that any aggression against allies\nwould be unacceptable. And they provide more details to budget proposals\nrolled out earlier this year that quadrupled military aid to Europe and called\nfor a more constant rotational presence.Over the past nine months, during\ntrips to Eastern Europe and in NATO meetings, Defense Secretary Ash Carter has\npledged additional military support for the region.Last June, while visiting\nEstonia, Carter announced the U.S. would spread about 250 tanks, armored\nvehicles and other military equipment across six former Soviet bloc nations to\nhelp reassure NATO allies facing threats from Russia and terrorist groups.\nEach set of equipment would be enough to outfit a military unit, and would go\non at least a temporary basis to Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland,\nand Romania.The equipment could also be moved around the region for training\nand military exercises, and would include Bradley fighting vehicles and self-\npropelled howitzer artillery guns.In February, the Pentagon announced it would\nseek $3.4 billion in the 2017 budget to increase troop rotations and military\nexercises in Europe. The plan essentially calls for the constant presence of a\nthird brigade in Europe. Two are already permanently stationed in Europe - a\nStryker brigade and an airborne brigade. And now a brigade will rotate in and\nout, likely every nine months or so, on a continual basis.The 2016 budget\nincluded about $780 million for the so-called European reassurance initiative,\nwhich covered the costs of sending hundreds of U.S. troops in and out of\nEurope for short deployments, military exercises and other training\nmissions.Carter’s proposal to quadruple that amount would allow the U.S. to\nsend more troops to Europe for short-term deployments and also provide\nadditional equipment and improve facilities so that more forces could be\naccommodated.The increased U.S. military support comes a year after the\nDefense Department unveiled sweeping plans to consolidate its forces in\nEurope, taking thousands of U.S. military and civilian personnel out of bases\nmostly in the United Kingdom and Portugal, in an effort that was expected to\nsave about $500 million each year.But, Russia’s military intervention in\nUkraine over the past year and its annexation of the Crimea region has worried\nEastern European nations, which fear they may be next._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"U.S. to beef up military presence in Eastern Europe - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"U.S. to beef up military presence in Eastern #Europe https://t.co/ZrSdSXbrwg #US","date":"Wed Mar 30 10:55:10 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715130240981450752"},"retweets":4},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/U93Gd8"}

But,\nhe said, they would also have to be able to convince activists they would be\nable to adequately represent the party.“I’m not sure that you could go in and\nsay well, this is the most important election in our lifetime, you have to\nstop Trump, put me on the ticket and I’ll do it, because we’ve heard that this\nis the most important election in our lifetime every election,” he said. “The\nprimary argument for why not to vote Libertarian. Next time — it’s always\ntomorrow with them. We’re a little bit more immune to the fear and doom than\nmost.”But he said the Libertarian Party is the logical choice for voters\ndissatisfied with the choices in the Democratic and Republican fields. He said\npeople will be thirsty for another option, given the high negatives of GOP\nfront-runner Donald Trump and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.“So I\nthink that we’ll be offering every single American the opportunity to vote for\nwhat they want instead of voting against what they’re afraid of, and then it’s\nup to them,” he said.\n\n","title":"Nicholas Sarwark, Libertarian Party chair: Former candidates have approached us about running - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#Libertarian Party chair: Former candidates have approached us about running https://t.co/4Yauca1Rce https://t.co/lunI8gHXjK","date":"Wed Mar 30 10:54:43 +0000 2016","favs":7,"id":{"$numberLong":"715130127819087872"},"retweets":12},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/1JRj4M"}

(AP) — Shortly before this poverty-stricken city began drawing\nits drinking water from the Flint River in April 2014 in a cost-cutting move,\nofficials huddled at the municipal water treatment plant, running through a\nchecklist of final preparations.Mike Glasgow, the plant’s laboratory\nsupervisor at the time, says he asked district engineer Mike Prysby of the\nMichigan Department of Environmental Quality how often staffers would need to\ncheck the water for proper levels of phosphate, a chemical they intended to\nadd to prevent lead corrosion from the pipes. Prysby’s response, according to\nGlasgow: “You don’t need to monitor phosphate because you’re not required to\nadd it.”Recalling the meeting Tuesday in an interview with The Associated\nPress, Glasgow said he was taken aback by the state regulator’s instruction;\ntreating drinking water with anti-corrosive additives was routine practice.\nGlasgow said his gaze shifted to a consulting firm engineer in attendance, who\nalso looked surprised.**PHOTOS: Flint official: State ordered no use of\ncorrosion control**“Then,” Glasgow said, “we went on to the next question.”In\nhindsight, he said, it was a fateful moment. For nearly 18 months, Flint\nresidents would drink water that had coursed through aging pipes and fixtures,\nscraping away lead from lines that ran from water mains to some homes and\nschools.By the time Gov. Rick Snyder announced in October 2015 that Flint\nwould return to the Detroit system, from which it had bought treated Lake\nHuron water for decades, scientists and doctors had reported dangerously high\nlevels of lead in numerous water samples and a spike in the proportion of\nchildren with elevated lead in their blood. Even low amounts of lead are a\nhealth threat, especially for young children, as it is linked to lower IQs and\nbehavioral problems.Flint residents still are advised not to drink unfiltered\ntap water.In a report last week, a task force appointed by Snyder to\ninvestigate the water crisis described the state as “fundamentally\naccountable,” partly because of the DEQ’s instruction to omit corrosion\ncontrols. It also assigned lesser blame to the state Department of Health and\nHuman Services, local and federal agencies and emergency managers Snyder had\nappointed to oversee city operations.The report did not fault Prysby alone\namong DEQ officials. The department’s former director, Dan Wyant, and its\nchief spokesman resigned in December. Snyder later fired Liane Shekter Smith,\nformer chief of the DEQ’s Office of Drinking Water and Municipal Assistance.\nAnother official has been suspended.But during a hearing Tuesday in Flint\nbefore a legislative committee investigating the catastrophe, Glasgow said it\nwas Prysby who told him that federal regulations on lead and copper pollution\nrequired testing the water for two consecutive six-month periods before\ndeciding whether to apply corrosion controls.The DEQ later would admit that\nwas a misreading of the rules, which instead require systems serving more than\n50,000 people to install and maintain corrosion control treatment.Prysby has\ndeclined previous AP requests for an interview. He could not be reached for\ncomment after the hearing.“I did have some concerns and misgivings at first,”\nGlasgow told the committee. “But unfortunately, now that I look back, I relied\non engineers and the state regulators to kind of direct the decision. I looked\nat them as having more knowledge than myself.”Lee-Anne Walters, who helped\ndraw official attention to the problem after high lead levels were discovered\nat her house, told the AP that learning of Prysby’s instruction to the city\nmade her “nauseous.”“That one meeting was the difference between this city\nbeing poisoned and not being poisoned,” she said._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Flint official: State overruled plan for corrosion control - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#Flint official: State overruled plan for corrosion control https://t.co/3YuAhguIob","date":"Wed Mar 30 10:33:48 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"715124865594994688"},"retweets":8},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/RhunZQ"}

He\nsaid the survey shows that people are not prepared for the high costs of home\ncare or nursing home care. The median cost of a home care aide is $20 per hour\nand the average cost of a semi-private room in a nursing home is $80,300 per\nyear.Nationwide, there are 5.4 million people with Alzheimer’s, the most\ncommon cause of dementia. The majority are older than 75.As the dementia\nprogresses, patients often need help with daily activities, such as eating,\ngetting dressed or bathing. Roughly two out of five of the more than 15\nmillion unpaid caregivers in the U.S. have a household income below $50,000,\nthe Alzheimer's Association says. Often the caregiving role falls on a\ndaughter or a spouse.Renee Packel, of Philadelphia, said that shortly after\nher husband was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 1999, she sold their car and\ntheir two-bedroom suburban home. To keep costs down, they moved into a one\nbedroom apartment in the city.“We needed money,” said Packel, 80.Art Packel,\nwho died last year, was in charge of the couple’s finances, and by the time\nshe realized something was wrong, money was missing and they were behind on\nbills. Packel said she didn’t want her children supporting them, so she got a\njob as a receptionist at a title company, where she still works.As the disease\nprogressed and her husband started falling and getting aggressive, she moved\nhim into a nursing home, where he lived for almost four years.She was lucky,\nshe said, that her husband’s veteran status granted him some benefits. But\neven with the government’s help, she still paid for a year of nursing home\ncare, about $800 or $900 per month.“It was a bad time, but it was not a dire\ntime,” Packel said, adding that selling their home helped her weather the\nstorm.The Family Impact of Alzheimer’s Survey was based on more than 3,500\ninterviews made in December. About 500 respondents said they provided\ncaregiving and/or financial aid to someone with dementia. Ninety-three percent\nwere family members and the rest were friends. On average, they spent more\nthan $5,000 per year, mostly on food, travel and medical supplies, such as\ndiapers. The highest expenses were incurred by spouses or partners.Nearly half\nof respondents said they cut back on spending. About 20 percent go to the\ndoctor less often, while 11 percent don’t get all of their own medications.\nAbout 11 percent cut back on their children’s educational expenses.Beth\nKallmyer, Alzheimer's Association vice president of constituent services, said\npeople erroneously believe Medicare covers long-term care costs, when it\ndoesn’t._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Caregivers of people with dementia face financial hardships - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#Caregivers of people with #dementia face financial hardships https://t.co/jcgipLnKt3","date":"Wed Mar 30 10:29:21 +0000 2016","favs":2,"id":{"$numberLong":"715123743673229312"},"retweets":7},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/MXzi39"}

Among his demands in the hourslong standoff\nbefore he surrendered was a request to speak to his Cypriot ex-wife and a call\nfor the release of all female prisoners in Egyptian prisons.On board what was\nsupposed to be a 30-minute flight from Alexandria to Cairo were dozens of\nforeign passengers, including eight Americans.Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis\nKasoulides told reporters in Larnaca that “from the start, it was clear this\nwasn’t an act of terrorism,” but the incident will only amplify calls for\nCairo to re-examine its security protocols right after officials rejected a\nRussian offer to help boost security at Egyptian airports.Last week, a month\nafter Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry said Cairo had accepted Russian security\nrecommendations for its airports, Russian Transportation Minister Maxim\nSokolov announced that he would station security specialists at Egyptian\nairports.The move was touted as a crucial step toward lifting Moscow’s ban on\nRussian flights to the North African country. Moscow imposed the ban after the\nOct. 31 crash of a St. Petersburg-bound airliner in the Sinai Peninsula that\nkilled 224 people. The Islamic State terrorist group said its agents planted\nthe bomb that downed the plane.A day after Mr. Sokolov made his announcement,\nthe head of the state-owned corporation that operates airports in Cairo, Luxor\nand the Red Sea resorts rejected the plan.“The idea is completely unacceptable\nbecause it violates Egypt’s sovereignty,” Egyptian Airports Co. Chairman Adel\nMahgoub said last week.The turnabout reflects how Egypt is struggling to adopt\nworld-class standards for security in its airports despite the high-profile\nincidents that have tarnished the country’s image as a tourist destination,\nsaid Ahmed Kamel Al-Beheiri, a security researcher at the Regional Center for\nStrategic Studies in Cairo.“We have a real problem in the flight safety\nprocedures, and this [requires] several measures such as hiring some\ninternational companies on a regular basis to evaluate security situations,”\nsaid Mr. Kamel Al-Beheiri.Some of the resistance stems from Egyptian officials\nwho are ideologically opposed to ceding control to former imperialistic\npowers.“We will not leave room for international powers to perform our role\nand to determine our fate and the fate of our countries, their peoples and\ntheir armies,” said one Egyptian security official who asked not to be\nnamed.Mr. Kamel Al-Beheiri said that explanation doesn’t account for other\nlapses in Egypt’s airports.**Calls for tougher security**Despite insisting it\nis at the forefront of battling Islamic terrorism, Egypt has been slow to\nbring more advanced security technology into its airports, add air marshals to\nflights or streamline the country’s bloated airport bureaucracy, Mr. Kamel Al-\nBeheiri said._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Egypt's airports rejected Russian security aid before hijacking - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Egypt's airports rejected Russian security aid before hijacking: https://t.co/zdLZ7vE1WF","date":"Wed Mar 30 02:41:05 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"715005901216870400"},"retweets":12},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/egypts-airports-rejected-russian-security-aid-befo/"}

Mark Kirk,\na Republican up for re-election in blue-state Illinois. Mr. Kirk is among 16\nRepublican senators who now say they will hold courtesy meetings with the\nnominee, despite a vow by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky\nRepublican, not to hold hearings or a confirmation vote on President Obama’s\nchoice to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia.Mr. Kirk, one\nof the most endangered incumbent Republicans this year, told reporters before\nthe meeting that he wants to be open-minded about the nomination.“I think when\nyou just say, ‘I’m not going to meet with him at all,’ that’s too closed-\nminded,” he said.The senator and the nominee met after a respected\nconservative lawyer and former George W. Bush nominee, Miguel Estrada, shot\nholes in assertions that Judge Garland is hostile to the Second Amendment. Mr.\nEstrada told NPR that evidence used to portray him as anti-gun is “thin to\nnonexistent.”Activists point to Judge Garland’s vote in 2007 for a rehearing\nof a case involving the District of Columbia’s ban on handguns, in which a\nthree-judge panel ruled for the first time that there is a constitutional\nright to own firearms for self-defense. The conservative Judicial Crisis\nNetwork has said Judge Garland’s vote suggests that he doesn’t believe the\nSecond Amendment provides for gun ownership for personal protection.Mr.\nEstrada said the rules allow judges to rehear cases “of exceptional\nimportance.” Because no federal appeals court had ever ruled that there was an\nindividual right to own a gun, he said, the case was clearly of exceptional\nimportance.The Supreme Court later upheld the lower court’s decision in a\nlandmark ruling.Progressive activists also pointed to a high court ruling\nTuesday, a 4-4 split, which upheld a lower-court ruling favorable to teachers\nunions, as another indication of the need to fill the court vacancy. Although\nJudge Garland could not have been confirmed and seated in time to make a\ndifference in the case, liberals said it was an unsatisfactory example of how\nthe Supreme Court would be forced to operate for a year or more without Mr.\nObama’s appointee.Judge Garland’s nomination also got a boost this week from a\nnationwide poll showing that a plurality of Americans — 46 percent — say the\nSenate should confirm him, compared with 30 percent who think he should be\nrejected and 24 percent who don’t know.While these developments may be good\nnews on the surface for the Garland nomination, there is no indication that\nany of it is having an impact on Mr. McConnell or Senate Judiciary Committee\nChairman Chuck Grassley, Iowa Republican.Another Republican lawmaker who has\nagreed to meet with Judge Garland, Sen. Susan M. Collins of Maine, said\nTuesday that Mr. McConnell is “not real happy” with her. The moderate lawmaker\nsaid she is “a bit perplexed” by Mr. McConnell’s position.“I know Sen.\nMcConnell cares deeply about the balance of the court,” she told WGAN radio in\nMaine. “If the next president is a Democrat, then the balance could be tipped\nway further than Judge Garland, based on what I know about him so far. Let’s\nsay that Hillary Clinton is the next president of the United States. I\npersonally believe that she would be likely to choose a nominee who is to the\nleft of Judge Garland.”She said Republican presidential front-runner Donald\nTrump is “rather unpredictable.”“Who knows who his nominee would be?” Ms.\nCollins said._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Merrick Garland begins meeting with Republican senators, gains traction - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#MerrickGarland begins meeting with Republican senators, gains traction: https://t.co/YY4NZNGzku","date":"Wed Mar 30 02:23:30 +0000 2016","favs":5,"id":{"$numberLong":"715001475823497216"},"retweets":10},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/merrick-garland-begins-meeting-with-republican-sen/"}

Ted Cruz\nfrom his own promise to back Republicans’ candidate.“He doesn’t have to\nsupport me. I really don’t believe I need his support,” Mr. Trump said in a\ntown hall from Wisconsin hosted by CNN.Minutes earlier, Mr. Cruz had declined\nto stand by the firm pledge he, Mr. Trump and the rest of the GOP field took\nlast year to back the eventual winner of the primary.Pressed by host Anderson\nCooper, Mr. Cruz said things have changed, and said his goal is now to make\nsure he doesn’t have to face that choice.“The answer to that is to beat him at\nthe ballot box,” Mr. Cruz said.The relationship between the two men has\ndeteriorated dramatically since last year, when pundits said Mr. Cruz appeared\nto be striking up a “bromance” with the billionaire businessman.Mr. Cruz said\nMr. Trump ruined that when he said in recent days he would go after Mr. Cruz’s\nwife in retaliation for an anti-Trump super political action committee’s ad\nfeaturing a racy picture of his wife, Melania, a former model.“I’m not an easy\nperson to tick off, but when you go after my wife, when you go after my\ndaughters, that does it,” Mr. Cruz said.He accused Mr. Trump of being behind a\nthinly sourced story last week in the National Enquirer tabloid that reported\nMr. Cruz had engaged in affairs with a handful of women. The story aggregated\nrumors, and the only named source was Roger Stone, an adviser to Mr. Trump,\nwho said: “These stories have been swirling around Cruz for some time.

Without Scalia, the\ncourt split 4-4, meaning the federal appeals court’s ruling against the\nteachers will remain in effect.Analysts expect other ties as the justices\nbegin to reach the end of this term and grapple with the most divisive cases,\nwhich now are likely to end in 4-4 rulings, split ideologically between the\ncourt’s four members appointed by Democratic presidents and the four\nRepublican-appointed justices.“If you have any hot-button issue — immigration,\nI think, will be another — I think you can expect a 4-4 vote,” said Richard\nEpstein, a professor at the New York University School of Law. “You’re likely\nto get more of these 4-4 votes, and it’s likely they occur in bigger\ncases.”The immigration case involves President Obama’s claims of executive\npower to grant a temporary deportation amnesty to illegal immigrants. Other\ncases include voting rights and challenges to the contraceptive mandate under\nObamacare.Mr. Epstein said the court has been through periods like this\nbefore. In the years immediately following World War II, Justice Robert H.\nJackson was absent while leading the prosecution of Nazi war crimes at\nNuremberg, leaving the court evenly split on cases.But Mr. Epstein said the\ncourt is now more ideologically polarized and faces more intensive scrutiny,\nheightening the interest in Tuesday’s ruling and the expected tie votes.The\nruling Tuesday stemmed from a challenge lodged by California teachers who\nobjected to paying dues to a labor union, saying they disagreed with the\nunion’s spending to lobby government for smaller classes and more generous\nteacher benefits.Under a 1970s Supreme Court ruling, nonunion workers can opt\nout of paying dues that go toward political operations, but states can require\nthem to pay dues that fund other operations, such as collective bargaining\n.Public-sector labor unions, however, have blurred the line, given that their\ncollective bargaining positions inherently involve public policy issues. In\nCalifornia, that amounts to $600 or $700, according to the Center for\nIndividual Rights, which pursued the case on behalf of 10 teachers.During oral\narguments, the court’s conservative justices seemed to be pushing for a new\nstandard that would free public-sector workers from the obligation to pay\ndues, while the liberal justices suggested that would give workers benefits\nthey hadn’t paid for.Tuesday’s brief ruling didn’t get into any of those\nissues and instead merely said a lower appeals court’s decision stands.“The\njudgment is affirmed by an equally divided court,” the high court said.The\nCenter for Individual Rights said it will seek a rehearing of the case, known\nas Friedrichs v.

He has\nvoiced support for equal pay. He has claimed that more of his business’ top\nexecutives are women than men, with many making more than their male\ncounterparts.Yet Mrs. Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination,\ncan use the pay issue to tap into the popular narrative that Mr. Trump is\nsexist and mistreats women, analysts say.** SEE ALSO: Donald Trump’s campaign\nmanager charged with battery **“It’s an economic extension of the many\nproblems that Trump will have with women voters,” said Democratic campaign\nstrategist Craig Varoga, who worked on President Clinton’s 1996 re-election\nteam.He called equal pay a legitimate issue that he would expect Mrs. Clinton\nto raise to underscore questions about Mr. Trump’s attitude toward women in\ngeneral.“He clearly has problems treating women respectfully, and it is\nsomething that we should talk about and it will be interesting to see the way\nhe handles it,” said Mr. Varoga.Mr. Trump’s standing with women took another\nblow Tuesday when his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was charged with\nsimple battery against a female reporter this month at a Florida press\nconference.The misdemeanor charge stems from a March 8 incident at a press\nconference at a Trump golf course in Jupiter. Breitbart reporter Michelle\nFields said Mr. Lewandoski grabbed her by the arm during a scrum and threw her\ntoward the ground.“He will enter a plea of not guilty and looks forward to his\nday in court. He is completely confident that he will be exonerated,” Trump\ncampaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement.Mr. Trump has received\nhigh unfavorable ratings among women. A recent Fox News national poll showed\n67 percent of women had negative views of Mr. Trump compared with 30 percent\nwho had favorable views.For rival Ted Cruz, 54 percent of women had negative\nviews and 33 percent had positive views.Mrs. Clinton did not do that much\nbetter, with negative ratings among 51 percent of female voters and positive\nviews from 46 percent.Mr. Trump has used his record hiring, promoting and\npaying high wages to women to deflect sexism charges, which stem mostly from\nderogatory remarks aimed at his female foes, such as calling comic Rosie\nO’Donnell a “fat pig” and disparaging the face of Carly Fiorina, a former\nrival for the Republican nomination.“Women are just going to have to see what\nI’ve done. I’ve hired tremendous numbers of women,” Mr. Trump said in an\ninterview Monday with Charlie Sykes on WTMJ-AM radio in Wisconsin. “Women are\nin highest executive positions.

But in an administration obsessed with race, not necessarily. The Obama Justice Department has instructed judges across the nation to lighten up on the poor, and especially poor minorities, or else. The lady with the blindfold and sword has tossed her blindfold aside and put the weight of her sword on the scale to favor those with the right connections.The Obama administration is all about payback. The Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division has written to municipal and state judges from coast to coast warning them that federal funds for their courthouses could be cut unless they dial back fees and fines levied against “economically disadvantaged” defendants guilty of minor crimes, particularly those of ethnic minorities who don’t have the money to pay their fines.The letter, dispatched March 14, was signed by Vanita Gupta, an assistant attorney general, and Lisa Foster, the director of the Office for Access, and lays out what they call “basic constitutional principles relevant to the enforcement of fines and fees.” Among them is a prohibition against jailing someone for failing to pay without first asking whether he is poor and whether the nonpayment was willful, together with a demand to consider alternatives to jail. Judges were warned that practices that “impose disparate harm on the basis of race or national origin” may violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964.In the wake of Justice Department investigations into civil unrest in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore, municipal authorities are sensitive to racial discrimination, as they should be, but now judges are asked to be financial analysts and cut offenders a break if they’re broke. Who says crime does not pay?Judges now must defer justice to Ancestry.com to determine the full ethnicity of defendants. Failing to account for a drop of privileged blood could have grave consequences. Last week, a California foster family discovered that to their sorrow. A 6-year-old girl they had cared for since age 2, whom they intended to adopt, was taken from them by social workers who decreed that she must live with blood relatives because she is 1/64th American Indian. The little girl was bustled into a waiting car in tears, clutching her teddy bear, and driven away from the only home she has ever known. In a the new society where race trumps all, preserving a minuscule sliver of ethnicity is in her “best interests.” Love doesn’t count.A nation that elects a black president, twice, has proved its commitment to a colorblind society, and spends 10 percent of it budget — $362 billion — on the safety net for the poor. But basing penalties on the size of what’s in defendant’s pocket, is absurdity gone too far, even for an administration that has established a new standard of incompetence.\n\n","title":"EDITORIAL: Justice Department wants to punish lawbreakers by ability to pay - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"EDITORIAL: The letter of the law https://t.co/LTcFG8sKqY #Justice #DOJ https://t.co/llJsTxna5B","date":"Wed Mar 30 01:03:13 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"714981269847851015"},"retweets":3},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/editorial-justice-department-wants-to-punish-lawbr/#.Vvsk396h4T0.twitter"}

Pretax earnings fell 3.1 percent, the most in seven years.Economists said they hoped economic growth would be a bit better in this quarter, “but not as much as they initially anticipated, with capital spending remaining weak and businesses continuing to pare back stockpiling” in the face of weak sales, USA Today reported.Another problem is “sluggish business investment,” the newspaper said. “Many economists expect growth of less than 2 percent in the first quarter.”Sluggish 2 percent growth has been the economy’s “new normal” throughout Barack Obama’s painful presidency and this year is no exception.But what about next year when a new president will be sworn into office, promising to improve on President Obama’s poor economic record? Don’t hold your breath.Hillary Clinton is running on a platform to raise taxes on “wealthy Americans,” i.e. investors, and a higher minimum wage that would result in a weaker economy and fewer jobs.Then there’s Donald Trump who wants to slap damaging tariff taxes on imports, sharply raising consumer prices across the board. Which would surely ignite retaliation by our trading partners around the world that would send both sides into a global recession.That’s the conclusion of a study by Moody’s Analytics, a respected economics research firm, that was asked by The Washington Post to create an economic model to measure the impact of Mr. Trump’s tariff plan.The bleak headline that ran across the Post’s story of the study’s findings: “A Trump trade war could cost the U.S. millions of jobs”Mr. Trump’s proposed tariff taxes on China and Mexico, 45 percent and 35 percent respectively, “would, in fact, sock it to China and Mexico,” the Post reported.“Both would fall into recession, the model suggests, if he levied his tariffs and those two countries retaliated with tariffs of their own,” the newspaper said.Unfortunately, the United States “would fall into recession, too. Up to 4 million American workers would lose their jobs. An additional 3 million jobs would not be created that otherwise would have been had the country not fallen into a trade-induced downturn.” the Post reported._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"DONALD LAMBRO: The truth about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump tax plans - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Donald Lambro on #tariffs and the sad truth https://t.co/LPB705ld6p #Election2016 #taxreform https://t.co/ode2Wr2Baw","date":"Wed Mar 30 01:00:20 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"714980547680997376"},"retweets":2},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/donald-lambro-the-truth-about-hillary-clinton-and-/#.Vvskgs5t7eM.twitter"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678eeb"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Major portions of rural America have no access to broadband. Fewer than 1 in 5 Americans (17 percent) can’t access what the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) defines as broadband, but that level is three times higher — a whopping 53 percent — when it comes to rural America. And what about those parts of rural America with broadband access? According to the 2015 State of the Internet Report, the average connection speed in rural places like Arkansas is slower than those in Estonia, Uruguay and Thailand.That’s why the millions of us who live in rural America can muster no more than two cheers for the Lifeline Reform plan recently drafted by the FCC that shifts the focus of the federal Lifeline program to broadband. It’s a good move that makes sense in the long term, but it doesn’t have to be done with such haste that it severs the wireless Lifeline phone service now helping millions of low-income residents in rural America.The problem is that the FCC timetable for shifting Lifeline from a wireless cellphone focus to “broadband only” is out of sync with the reality of the availability of adequate broadband in rural America. The FCC wants to start a phase-out of wireless Lifeline phone service almost immediately and then hang up on it altogether in 2019. After that, Lifeline would only subsidize broadband and landline phone service.That’s the wrong timetable for rural America. The FCC’s own data show that as many as 22 million rural Americans lack access to connections to broadband at download speeds of 25 megabits per second (mbps). The commission also has reported that 1 in 5 rural Americans lacks access at the even slower speeds of 4 mbps. The access gap is even worse for people living on Native American tribal lands, where the lack of access surges to 63 percent.While there is much to admire in the FCC’s plan for a $9.25 monthly subsidy focused over time on broadband, the truth is that it probably won’t result in one new mile of broadband cabling in rural America. All signs are that our communities of non-urban areas will lag for decades when it comes to access to essential broadband.In less than 45 months the current wireless Lifeline phone service will vanish. For rural Americans who have no way to use a broadband subsidy, the demise of Lifeline by 2019 will mean that they are effectively cut out of the program. Their only sin: living in rural America.To make matters even worse for those living in rural America, the FCC wants to impose minimum standards on wireless Lifeline that almost certainly would force a co-pay arrangement for subscribers. This would make participation in the program burdensome, if not completely unaffordable, for many low-income rural dwellers. Many of the poorest people with the least access to help live in rural America. These are not consumers who will be able to continue using Lifeline if they have to pony up cash that they just don’t have.By phasing out wireless Lifeline cellphone service and offering only a broadband program they can’t access, rural Americans will not be helped by Lifeline reform. Instead, will we rural Americans become the first and perhaps largest group of disconnected victims of the reforms? I ask the FCC: What good is Lifeline reform in rural America if broadband is not available now and you are killing cellphone service?**• **_Betsy Huber is president of the National Grange._\n\n","title":"BETSY HUBER: FCC rule would stop cellphone service before providing broadband - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Betsy Huber says #FCC reform would take away #America's #Lifeline https://t.co/aQfZSGjcBb https://t.co/Ep4UMTT1Lf","date":"Wed Mar 30 00:56:49 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"714979662347182080"},"retweets":2},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/betsy-huber-fcc-rul-would-stop-cellphone-service-b/"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678eec"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Despite prognosticators’ dire warnings that a contested Republican convention will be the demise of the Republican brand, there may be an alternative that needs consideration: the Republican convention could (if executed correctly) be an effective marketing opportunity for the GOP, no matter what political naysayers predict. Here’s why.It is no secret that the political rules have changed. The reasons are many, but the salient includes marketing, branding, a celebrity-based culture, the Internet — and let’s not forget social media. This “process change,” as a result of these different strategies/tactics, will transform this once-perceived boring convention into a “Super Bowl Lite” media event. This traditionally uninteresting media non-happening “yawner” can morph (if there is no clear-cut winner) into the most-watched TV reality show in history — it could be seen by millions, discussed by tens of millions, and hosted by the ultimate reality show host, Donald Trump. Viewers will be tuning in to know “What did Trump do today?” “Will Trump’s delegates walk?” “Will there be demonstration?” or the unknown, thus making it “must see” TV.This truly unscripted reality show will not only provide eyes for the Republican brand’s candidates, no matter who is selected, but there will be an additional benefit: It will expose a significant amount of Americans, who were never interested in politics, to a practical civics course on how parties select their presidential nominees and whether another alternative more relevant to the times is needed.The big event could be what happens if Mr. Trump, who currently leads with the most delegates, enters Cleveland without the required 1237 needed to secure the party’s nomination. This is a rather simple problem to resolve, especially if you have “no horse” in the race. Mr. Trump presently has over 7.5 million raw votes or 39 percent of the popular vote, which translate into 60 percent not voting for Mr. Trump in the primaries. For the technician and rules-oriented, the popular vote does not count. It’s rather all about the delegates.When one analyzes this metric, the same pattern is evident: Mr. Trump has 739 delegates or only 49 percent, which includes “winner take all” states. For those who say that Mr. Trump should get the nomination based on this data, they forget that the majority is not for Mr. Trump and that in “winner take all” states, those who did not vote for Mr. Trump lost their voice because Mr. Trump took their vote as a result of the process. This is a good argument for proportional delegate counts to be considered so that all votes count, not just a winner.Brand-loyal Republicans who do not support Mr. Trump must be considered at all costs. In marketing, you must always remember your loyal customers. It’s basic marketing. Coke made a major mistake when it introduced New Coke after research demonstrated that American tastes had changed to a sweeter cola alternative. Although the data was true, heavy Coke drinkers (brand loyal consumers) did not appreciate the change, and the rest is history. New Coke was not a success — a lesson for Republican Party leaders never to forget if they want to win in November.Being perceived as “fair” to all candidates is the secret in making the upcoming convention a success. This means that the process must continue and that the candidate who “gets to” the 1237 threshold must be the nominee. However, “almost” is only good when playing horseshoes, and if no candidate receives the required votes on the first ballot, then the process begins until a nominee is selected by the delegates no matter how many ballot counts it takes to get to a majority.A good test for Mr. Trump and great TV at its best is whether he can put into practice what he instructs others to do in making a deal. If Mr. Trump wins the delegate count, he will truly be the ultimate dealmaker. If he falls short, then the rules for business need not apply in “politics,” and the country dodges another candidate who has noble ambitions but little practical experience within another’s wheelhouse. All exciting for those who dare to watch the process live.Dealing with the 500-pound gorilla in the middle of the convention hall and how best to deal with these highly energized Trump supporters is not going to be easy — but not impossible to overcome. This can best be examined by segmenting Trump supporters into three groups: brand-loyal Republicans who will vote for anyone the party nominates; brand-loyal Trump Democrats/Independents who will only vote for Mr. Trump; Trump Democrats/Independents who have been brought to the party by Mr. Trump and are sampling Republican individual brands by listening to what the candidates have to say. The issue, then, is to focus on those two groups who are more likely to respond to “fair convention practices” and not further alienate the brand-loyal Trump folks. If this is done successfully, a Republican victory in November is still a possibility.There is no question that this will be a delicate balance of trying to make all sides happy and get them to support the nominee. Coming together is no easy task, but for those Republicans who want to win, they must use good-old political skills along with new branding and marketing tactics. The exciting event will help Americans experience our system at work through the reality-TV lens. Who knows what will happen? Perhaps even a change in the way we choose our presidential candidates.**• **_John Tantillo is the branding editor for Fridge Magazine and the author of the book, “People Buy Brands, not Companies” (Five Titles Press)._\n\n","title":"JOHN TANTILLO: How to market a political party - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"John Tantillo offers how to #market a #politicalparty https://t.co/Oyf0iVB2ce #marketingtips #Election2016 https://t.co/aX3XX9ykey","date":"Wed Mar 30 00:54:59 +0000 2016","favs":2,"id":{"$numberLong":"714979201166741504"},"retweets":3},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/john-tantillo-how-to-market-a-political-party/#.VvsjAxQ-0Pg.twitter"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678eed"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**The ruthless attacks against the airport and subway station in Brussels, killing at least 31 people and injuring hundreds, were crimes against humanity by any standard. Again, they pose the same question faced by the world community after Sept. 11, 2001: How to respond to terrorism carried out in the name of Islam?The right answer would effectively end the growth of violent Islamic extremism. The wrong answer would lead to ever greater threats.In my 1993 book, “Islamic Fundamentalism: The New Global Threat,” I argued that although the theoretical roots of this evil phenomenon date back to the first decades of Islam, it was only after the establishment of theocracy in Iran that Islamic fundamentalism became the global threat that it is today. While the differences between Shiite and Sunni fundamentalists are minimal, they have a common major objective: establishing an “Islamic rule” for the enforcement of “Shariah law.”I also argued in the book that only democratic Islam poses the ultimate challenge to fundamentalist interpretations.At the time, my book was cast as an exaggeration by an opponent of the Iranian regime. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the world saw the brutality of fundamentalism firsthand, but the United States nonetheless blundered ahead, making a major strategic mistake by invading Iraq.As subsequent mistakes were made, Iran managed to dominate Iraq, a circumstance Tehran exploited to project itself as a growing power in the Middle East. Because Tehran is the heart of fundamentalism, the groundwork was laid for the emergence and spread of ISIS as the Sunni counterpart to Iran’s Shiite fundamentalism.Fifteen years on, Europe is dealing with what could be its own 9/11. And Tehran is poised to seize the opportunity once again, free of the weight of sanctions with coffers already flushed with tens of billions of dollars in new money.The solution to Islamic fundamentalism is not engagement with its godfather in Iran; it is exactly the opposite. And it must include unwavering support for the ouster of Syrian President Bashar Assad in Syria. After all, Mr. Assad’s brutality and Iran’s sectarianism are major contributors to the social landscape that has allowed ISIS to attract more Sunnis to its extremist ideology. Remove those conditions, and the ISIS ideology and tactics quickly collapse.Last year, French President Francois Hollande said if the United States had not backtracked at the 11th hour in August 2013 from punishing Mr. Assad for his chemical attacks, the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack would likely have never occurred. Perhaps the November 13 Paris attack would not have happened either. And, now innocent blood has been spilled in Brussels.Mr. Hollande was spot on. The West, specifically the United States, should concentrate its efforts on the ouster of Mr. Assad instead of looking in all the wrong places for help against threats like ISIS. Efforts at combating ISIS will be futile without toppling Mr. Assad.The Iranian regime’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, his Iraqi puppets and Bashar Assad, have created fertile soil for ISIS to thrive, by killing, according to some accounts, 470,000 people in Syria and by marginalizing and alienating the Sunnis in Iraq.Under Washington’s watch, Baghdad and Damascus have become killing fields for Iran’s Quds Force and its criminal militias. Without a viable alternative, Sunnis have been forced to choose between these criminals and ISIS. Replacing Assad and his Iranian backers with a moderate and inclusive government, would give the Sunni population a real alternative.Let’s not forget that as Mr. Assad’s main enabler, the Iranian mullahs, weakened and more vulnerable after the sham parliamentary elections, had to concede to the cease-fire in Syria. A firm approach by the United States and its European allies can reinforce the shaky Syrian cease-fire, opening a way forward for the Geneva negotiations. Otherwise, the cease-fire will provide the opportunity Tehran seeks for another massacre of innocents in Syria.There is no doubt that Mr. Assad’s removal would mark the beginning of a strategy that could finally lead to peace for all people in Syria, Iraq, and Iran. It would also remove a serious threat to Europe.The United States and Europe face a historic decision. The victims of the horrific Brussels attacks will not have died in vain if these governments choose to pursue a genuine solution to the Syrian and Iraqi crises. Any other course of action will be judged harshly by history._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"MOHAMMAD MOHADDESSIN: Brussels attacks a wake-up call to the West - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Mohammad Mohaddessin says #Brussels is wake-up call to the #West https://t.co/8B5Vyfx4Mb #brusselsattack https://t.co/J9XYZ79t7S","date":"Wed Mar 30 00:51:06 +0000 2016","favs":42,"id":{"$numberLong":"714978223571005441"},"retweets":75},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/mohammad-mohaddessin-brussels-attacks-a-wake-up-ca/#.Vvsh5PUUQAo.twitter"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678eee"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Though President Obama’s nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia on the U.S. Supreme Court will more than likely remain in limbo until at least until after the November election, the choice should be unsettling to supporters of the Second Amendment and gun ownership rights.Begin with the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), established by the 1993 Brady Act, under which firearm background checks would be conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Once a person passed the background check, the FBI’s record of his or her identity was required to be destroyed, although it would be kept by the dealer. No records of firearm sales were allowed to be recorded at a government facility, and no system of registration of firearm owners was allowed.Nevertheless, when NICS went online in 1998 Attorney General Janet Reno signed a regulation allowing the FBI to retain full information on the firearm purchaser — name, address, race, and date of birth — for six months. She called the list an “audit log” rather than gun owner registration.In NRA v. Reno (2000) two judges of the D.C. Circuit — David Tatel and Merrick Garland — upheld the regulation. Yes, Congress mandated that the transaction records must be “destroyed,” but it didn’t say when. Yes, no record of the transactions could be transferred to a government facility, but the term “record” was unclear. And yes, no system of registration of firearm owners was allowed, but Ms. Reno called it an “audit log,” not “registration.”Judge David Sentelle wrote a blistering dissent, pointing out that Congress could not have been clearer in protecting the privacy of citizens who passed the background check. Ms. Reno’s argument that Congress did not say that she had to destroy the records “immediately” reminded Judge Sentelle of a mother telling a child to stop pulling her sister’s hair, but she continues under the excuse: “Mama, you didn’t say I had to stop right now.”Congress had to step back in and direct NICS to destroy the records within 24 hours. Problem solved, but the case illustrated that Judge Garland had no problem upholding a power grab by the executive branch to create a six-month registration of firearm purchasers.Meanwhile, two cases challenging the D.C. handgun ban under the Second Amendment were proceeding through the courts. In Seegars v. Gonzales (2005), a panel of the D.C. Circuit held that the challengers lacked standing under an extraordinarily-stringent standard. Judge Sentelle dissented because the plaintiffs wished to obtain handguns but risked prosecution if they did so.When the plaintiffs asked the D.C. Circuit to rehear the case, even the judge who wrote the panel decision argued in favor, on the basis that the plaintiffs were clearly harmed and should be able to mount their challenge. Judge John Roberts, the future Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, joined in the call for rehearing by the full court. Judge Garland voted against. The case would not be reheard.However, in Parker v. the District of Columbia (2007), the D.C. Circuit found that one plaintiff had standing and held that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to keep and bear arms, and that the D.C. handgun ban violates this right. The District of Columbia had argued that the amendment only protected the “collective right” of states to maintain militias, and that even if the right is individual, handguns could be banned because long guns were available.Now the shoe was on the other foot. The District of Columbia petitioned for a rehearing by the full court and Judge Garland voted in favor. The only obvious reason to vote in favor would be to overturn the decision.The rest is history. The District of Columbia asked the Supreme Court to hear its case and the Court obliged. The case was renamed the District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and Justice Scalia’s blockbuster opinion affirmed that the Second Amendment means what it says — “the right of the people,” meaning individuals, “to keep and bear arms,” including handguns, “shall not be infringed,” such as by Washington’s ban.Heller was a 5-4 decision and justices who dissented have called for its overturn. Justice Scalia’s untimely death leaves the Court with only four justices who supported Heller.Based on Judge Garland’s record in the D.C. Circuit, it should be clear that his elevation to the Supreme Court would create a Court majority that could not be expected to support the Second Amendment and that would uphold gun restrictions of all kinds.**• **_Stephen P.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678eef"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act is a law adopted to fight organized crime. Yet, in recent months, a chorus has emerged calling for a breathtaking abuse of RICO by state attorneys general and the Department of Justice against political opponents.Specifically, lawmakers, academics and the “green” lobby demand that prosecutors use the law to extort money from legitimate businesses who oppose them, under threat of RICO investigations and prosecution. The objective is to silence political opposition, extract a vow not to support other opponents and, finally, to force companies to underwrite the global warming industry. Yes, the global warming industry.It’s an industry that includes not only professional activists and academics but also businesses hoping to profit from peddling climate fear. They have found allies in politicians seeking to deploy the awesome weight of the federal government to investigate those blocking the industry from getting every law and policy it wants.In a recent Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, Rhode Island Democrat, pressed Attorney General Loretta Lynch about using RICO to investigate climate change skeptics. Mr. Whitehouse specifically inquired into possible action against “the climate denial apparatus that the fossil fuel industry has erected.”“This matter has been discussed,” replied Ms. Lynch. “We have received information about it and have referred it to the FBI to consider whether or not it meets the criteria for which we could take action on.”Ms. Lynch’s response — specifically her use of “could” — suggests the Justice Department is looking for some way to intervene, an approach at odds with her department’s job of assessing what it “should” do. After all, investigations are costly, intrusive and even ruinous, and should be undertaken judiciously.While RICO suits, or the threat thereof, can be costly for those at the receiving end, they can be lucrative for others. For example, we now know that the RICO chorus hopes to obtain massive settlements to fund the global warming machine’s academic and activist components.RICO predators expect targeted companies to behave ritually: pay up under threat of years of bad press and litigation. These costs are passed on to consumers, of course. But the far greater threat is to democratic debate, given the lawsuits’ other objective, which proponents openly acknowledge: to coerce their critics into silence and extract vows not to fund further opposition.Naturally, a group of largely taxpayer-funded academics echoed Mr. Whitehouse’s call. Known as the “RICO-20,” they sent a September letter asking Ms. Lynch to use RICO against opponents. Some members of Congress have specified two companies they want targeted: ExxonMobil and Shell.However, the faculty lounge cheerleaders do not limit their aspirations to targeting mere oil companies. The RICO-20 co-ringleader, George Mason University’s Edward Maibach, has acknowledged that their target — those who “knowingly deceive on climate risk” — captures individual opponents, as well.Mr. Maibach’s previous career involved running a campaign paid for by precisely the same model. So it was that he boasted, in an interview with Grist magazine, that “if a RICO suit were successful; and if there was a settlement between the government and the fossil fuel industry — there is no question in my mind that a good portion of that money should be spent on a national campaign to educate people on the risks of climate change, and build their resolve to work toward solutions.”At George Mason, Mr. Maibach now teaches climate campaigning and runs the Center for Climate Change Communication, which studies “how to mobilize populations to adopt behaviors and support public policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” Centers require funding.Global warming is big business. As an industry, it appears far more vulnerable to credible investigation than those it seeks to haul into the dock. As a recent Wall Street Journal editorial reminded us about the global warming industry’s tactics, one prematurely sent Greenpeace press release still contained the instruction, “[Fill in alarmist and armageddonist factoid here].”Under their own standard of “knowingly deceiving on climate risk,” the global warming alarmists seem ripe for investigations into, say, hyping climate risk for gain, at the expense of shareholders and communities that lose substantial tax and other revenues used for schools and infrastructure. We’re talking big bucks here — from $20 billion (for “renewable” and “green” energy vendors, by their own account) to $1.5 trillion in annual disbursements, all thanks to government edicts in the name of the elusive “climate crisis.”Demanding the Justice Department employ the full might of the federal government against opponents is cowardly bullying. It also fits the commonly accepted definition of McCarthyism, “the practice of making unfair allegations or using unfair investigative techniques, especially in order to restrict dissent or political criticism.” The global warming industry ought to be ashamed. Judged by its proclaimed standard, any investigation should be of the global warming industry rather than its critics._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"CHRIS HORNER: The global warming industry's RICO gambit  - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Chris Horner writes about the #globalwarming industry’s RICO gambit  https://t.co/46a7mFXJG5 #ClimateChange #Green https://t.co/h7vZAdJdly","date":"Wed Mar 30 00:45:12 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"714976736526667779"},"retweets":3},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/chris-horner-the-global-warming-industrys-rico-gam/#.VvsgSmryzT4.twitter"}

But all the\nmemorials are totally meaningless. They are merely a stage for politicians to\nact on, professing emotion, proclaiming unity, and calling for everyone to\njust keep calm and carry on.

He advises those fed up with teddy bears\nand candles to heed advice from the late Air Force Gen. **Curtis LeMay** when\nhe said of the enemy, “If you kill enough of them, they stop fighting.”Mr.\nBabbin noted in a follow-up message to Inside the Beltway, “For the record,\nwe’re constantly told by the Obama generals and admirals that we can’t kill\nour way out of this war. As Gen. LeMay might have said, how can we know until\nwe try?”And who was LeMay? Several sources call him “the Cold War’s fiercest\nwarrior.” The Air Force itself puts it this way about the pilot who ultimately\nbecame the fifth chief of staff for the branch:“The general built, from the\nremnants of World War II, an all-jet bomber force, manned and supported by\nprofessional airmen dedicated to the preservation of peace.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678ef1"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**The speaker of the House, the Hon. Paul Ryan, recently expressed his hope for a “confident America.” He went on to say, “We don’t shut people down. If someone has a bad idea, we tell them why our idea is better. We don’t insult them into agreeing with us.” He spoke of the superiority of persuasion to execration.Close observers of the Ryan metier thought he was addressing Donald Trump. After listening to the campaigns in both parties, I have a different view. To my mind, Mr. Ryan was urging caution on everyone campaigning for the presidency this year. Certainly, his remarks were aimed at his fellow Republicans, including Ted Cruz and John Kasich. Yet they were also aimed at Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton, both of whom whenever they take to the podium disparage Messrs. Trump, Cruz, Kasich and forget not the infamous 1 percent.Mr. Ryan calls for reflection and restraint from both parties. Nonetheless, he is in a tricky position. In a year of riotous politics, he has taken a chance of offending the rabble-rousers by calling for a sense of restraint. He even has a Tea Partier challenging him back home.Of course, he has no alternative given his lofty goals in the House of Representatives. As speaker of the House, he is responsible for getting budgets through that chamber that are acceptable to a majority while advancing his free-market policies. He has never been known for heated rhetoric and he is not calling for it now. His role is unique in national politics. He wants to be effective, which seems to be what the majority of Americans call for, but he is an advocate of free markets.Mr. Ryan comes from the Jack Kemp corner of the Republican Party. Thus, he would solve the problem of poverty and unemployment through pro-growth policies. He favors tax cuts as the route to economic growth. The War on Poverty has not worked. We have almost as many Americans living beneath the poverty level today as when LBJ began his War on Poverty more than five decades ago. All that has changed is that we have spent, by Mr. Ryan’s reckoning, $15 trillion in a futile effort to extinguish poverty. Mr. Ryan wants to try to end it with an alternative, economic growth. He will have to keep his Republicans united in the House to be successful.He also wants to repeal Obamacare. This, too, will require a united Republican Party. There are various approaches to repealing Obamacare, but his Republican colleagues are going to have to settle on one approach. Mr. Ryan has advanced the pieces. He must now bring the pieces together. Finally, he says he wants to start paring back the federal debt that President Obama has doubled in his nearly eight years in office. That is going to be tricky, too. Once again, he will need party loyalty. No wonder he has been on a crusade to cool the rhetoric.Moreover, as chairman of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland this summer, he is facing the possibility of the first contested convention in decades. He has to remain neutral. He is right to show no partiality. Whether Donald Trump arrives at the convention with the necessary number of delegates for victory or new candidates enter the race, Mr. Ryan has to be an honest broker. His role at the convention may be very large.So now he has asked that the race for the presidency proceed with dignity. At the Republicans’ last debate on March 10 there were signs that it would proceed with dignity. Since then there has been a tabloid eruption and the battle of brides on Twitter. Now my guess is that things are going to settle down. The Republicans will act like statesmen. Bernie and Hillary will continue to bore. And Paul Ryan will play his role as leader in the House and an honest broker at the Republican convention. Nevertheless, the elections of 2016 will have some surprises.**• **_R.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678ef2"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**”I have come here to bury the last remnant of the Cold War in the Americas.” That was Barack Obama’s “historic” announcement in Cuba last week. But was it true? What is the Castro regime if not a vestige of communism’s 20th century struggle against the capitalist enemy — also known as the Free World? And, self-evidently, President Obama had come not to bury the Castros but to normalize relations with them.The Republic of Cuba, as it is officially called, has in reality been a socialist dynasty since Fidel Castro, who will be 90 in August, took power through force of arms in 1959. Back then, Dwight Eisenhower was in the White House, Hawaii became the 51st state and gas cost 25 cents a gallon. Mr. Obama had not yet been born but, as he helpfully shared with his Cuban audience, that was “the same year that my father came to the United States from Kenya.” In 2008, Fidel handed power to his younger brother Raul who will be 85 in June.At one point during Mr. Obama’s Cuban sojourn, he had his photo taken in the Plaza de la Revolucion before a giant mural of Che Guevara. To college students ignorant of history, Che was a romantic, swashbuckling hero. The reality, with which Mr. Obama ought to be familiar, is rather different.“Che was a totalitarian,” wrote the distinguished left-of-center intellectual historian, Paul Berman. “He achieved nothing but disaster. Many of the early leaders of the Cuban Revolution favored a democratic or democratic-socialist direction for the new Cuba. But Che was a mainstay of the hardline pro-Soviet faction, and his faction won. Che presided over the Cuban Revolution’s first firing squads. He founded Cuba’s ‘labor camp’ system — the system that was eventually employed to incarcerate gays, dissidents, and AIDS victims.”Peruvian political commentator Alvaro Vargas Llosa has recalled that “Guevara murdered or oversaw the executions in summary trials of scores of people — proven enemies, suspected enemies and those who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.”In other words, Che was what Mr. Obama would call a violent extremist. And in what can only be called a terrible irony, contemporary violent extremists — they prefer to call themselves jihadis — were soon setting off bombs in Brussels, the de facto capital of Europe.Mr. Obama briefly took note of “these outrageous attacks” — though he didn’t look or sound outraged. He reassured the “people of Belgium” that the “thoughts and prayers of the American people” are with them — though there was nothing resembling a concrete reassurance in his assertion that, “We can and we will defeat those who threaten the safety and security of people all around the world.”The CVE (Countering Violent Extremism) experts who advise Mr. Obama emphasize job programs and improved efforts to integrate Middle Eastern immigrants into European and American society. You think that will do the trick?The president next attended an exhibition game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Cuban national baseball team. The terrorists win, he told reporters, only if we allow them to disrupt our lives. That attitude may be easier to adopt if you fly on private aircraft with armed bodyguards than if you are among the common folks dragging luggage and small children through crowded airports.Mr. Obama believes that people like me are overreacting to terrorism which, as he told the Atlantic’s Jeffery Goldberg, takes fewer lives than “handguns, car accidents and falls in bathtubs.” He does not acknowledge that the number of terrorist attacks and victims has risen steeply since he’s been in office. Nor does it seem to have occurred to him that the regimes and movements responsible are eager to increase their lethality and are working diligently to acquire the skills and weapons necessary.Such myopia is not new. In 1917, few political leaders foresaw that the advent of Leninist regimes would lead to a death toll in the tens of millions within the century. Mr. Obama did not review that history in Cuba. On the contrary, he spoke of “our two different systems” as if they were morally equivalent.He asserted that there is a commonality among the “ideals that are the starting point for every revolution — America’s revolution, the Cuban revolution, the liberation movements around the world.”That, too, is patently untrue: The American Revolution was premised on the belief that individuals are “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights.” The Russian and Cuban Revolutions were intended to establish a “dictatorship of the proletariat.” The Iranian revolution and the insurgencies that have followed in its wake are meant to re-establish an Islamic empire to which all peoples must submit. These are hardly minor distinctions.In Argentina a few days later, Mr. Obama told an audience of young people: “So often in the past there has been a division between left and right, between capitalists and communists or socialists, and especially in the Americas, that’s been a big debate.” He added: “Those are interesting intellectual arguments, but I think for your generation, you should be practical and just choose from what works. You don’t have to worry about whether it really fits into socialist theory or capitalist theory. You should just decide what works.”Were Che Guevara still with us — two years younger than Fidel, he was executed in Bolivia in 1967 — he’d doubtless be cheered to hear an American president talking that way, not to mention posing with his likeness. You and I might experience a rather different reaction._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"CLIFFORD MAY: Obama visit legitimizes Cuban dictatorship - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Clifford May on #Obama's trip to #Cuba https://t.co/3AWZUcA5XM #CubaVisit https://t.co/Rm4aDpcj4U","date":"Wed Mar 30 00:34:17 +0000 2016","favs":10,"id":{"$numberLong":"714973988531879937"},"retweets":13},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/clifford-may-obama-visit-legitimizes-cuban-dictato/"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678ef3"},"content":"A coalition of Democratic attorneys general in 16 states announced Tuesday an\nunprecedented campaign to pursue companies that challenge the catastrophic\nclimate change narrative, raising concerns over free speech and the use of\nstate authority to punish political foes.Standing beside former Vice President\nAl Gore, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said the state officials\nare committed to “working together on key climate-related initiatives,”\nincluding queries into whether fossil fuel companies like ExxonMobil have\ncommitted fraud by deceiving the public and shareholders about the impact of\nman-made carbon dioxide emissions.Two states — California and New York —\nalready have launched probes into ExxonMobil, while attorneys general from\nMassachusetts and the Virgin Islands indicated Tuesday that they would follow\nsuit. Virgin Islands Attorney General Claude Walker, an independent, is the\nonly non-Democrat involved in the campaign, called AGs United for Clean\nPower.“The bottom line is simple: Climate change is real; it is a threat to\nall the people we represent,” Mr. Schneiderman said. “If there are companies,\nwhether they’re utilities, whether they’re fossil fuel companies, committing\nfraud in an effort to maximize their short-term profits at the expense of the\npeople we represent, we want to find out about it. We want to expose it and\nwant to pursue them to the fullest extent of the law.”Mr. Schneiderman also\nannounced that 20 attorneys general representing 18 states, the District of\nColumbia and the Virgin Islands filed a brief Tuesday in support of the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency’s Clean Power Plan rule, which has been\nchallenged by attorneys general in 25 mostly red states.The campaign was\nspurred by articles last year alleging Exxon hid research conducted by its own\nscientists linking fossil fuel emissions and global warming. Exxon officials\nhave denied the claims and countered that the investigation was conducted by\njournalism entities that receive funding from foundations known for their\nclimate change activism.Suzanne McCarron, Exxon’s vice president for public\nand government affairs, said Tuesday in a statement that the accusations are\nmeritless.“The allegations are based on the false premise that ExxonMobil\nreached definitive conclusions about anthropogenic climate change before the\nworld’s experts and before the science itself had matured, and then withheld\nit from the broader scientific community,” Ms. McCarron said. “Such a claim is\npreposterous.”Marc Morano, who heads the pro-industry website Climate Depot,\nwarned that the state officials’ legal campaign against the oil-and-gas\nindustry would “have a chilling effect on free speech and scientific\ndissent.”“Gore joined with attention-seeking attorneys general to essentially\ntry to shut down any ‘global warming’ views that differ from the United\nNations’ or Gore‘s,” said Mr. Morano in an email. “Agree or face\ninvestigations is the new normal for the climate debate.”Mr. Gore, who\nnarrated the 2006 climate change documentary “An Inconvenient Truth,” said\nrising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are fueling natural\ndisasters ranging from flooding to snowstorms to the recent outbreak of the\nZika virus.“Every night on the news now it’s like a nature hike through the\nBook of Revelation,” Mr. Gore said at the New York press conference, which was\nlive streamed.Mr. Morano, whose 2015 documentary “Climate Hustle” disputes the\ndisastrous climate change scenarios, called Mr. Gore “frustrated that his\nmessage is still not resonating 10 years after his movie came out.”“So he\napparently has decided that anyone who disagrees with him on ‘global warming’\nshould face investigations, fines and penalties and be silenced,” Mr. Morano\nsaid.**A chill on free speech?**_Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Exxon climate change probe spurs Democratic AGs' crackdown on dissenters - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#Exxon #climatechange probe spurs Democratic AGs' crackdown on dissenters: https://t.co/YFaFdQTH5i #ExxonKnew","date":"Wed Mar 30 00:32:29 +0000 2016","favs":2,"id":{"$numberLong":"714973535928786947"},"retweets":8},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/exxon-climate-change-probe-spurs-democratic-ags-cr/"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678ef4"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**A reputation for doing the right thing under pressure is hard to make and easy to break. James Comey, the director of the FBI, made his reputation as a man of unimpeachable integrity when he stood up to the administration that appointed him second in command to the attorney general, John Ashcroft, in the administration of George W. Bush. He was put on “the uncomfortable spot” when President Bush wanted to reauthorize domestic eavesdropping on private conversations, eavesdropping even for a worthy cause that Mr. Ashcroft’s Justice Department had determined to be against the law.The White House was looking for a shortcut across the law, and in March 2004 Andrew Card, the president’s chief of staff, and Alberto Gonzales, the president’s chief lawyer, went to the attorney general’s bedside at a Washington hospital, where he lay seriously ill, to ask him to sign an order reversing the department’s finding and endorse the reauthorization of the eavesdropping program.Mr. Comey raced to the intensive-care unit at the hospital to urge the attorney general to stand fast, to tell him that he and others at the Justice Department would resign if need be to protest reversing the original order. Shortly afterward, President Bush decided not to seek the reauthorization. Principle prevailed. When the news of the bedside drama leaked, Mr. Comey was lionized for standing fast for what he thought was right. His reputation as the rock at the Justice Department was firmly established. Years later President Obama appointed him to a 10-year term as director of the FBI. Now hard duty calls again, and he may have to choose again between principle and politics.He has assigned nearly 150 agents to the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s careless handling of confidential emails as the secretary of State on duty at what one official describes as the “intersection of Clinton Foundation donations, the dispensation of State Department contracts and whether regular processes were followed.” There’s evidence that 1,300 of those emails included classified information, some of it “Top Secret” or higher. She insists she did nothing wrong and blames the controversy on the “vast right-wing media conspiracy” that flourishes in her troubled mind.She may also be vulnerable to several charges of “public corruption.” The FBI describes the unearthing and punishment of public corruption as the agency’s number one criminal priority. Fox News reports that it was told by a Justice Department source that “many previous public corruption cases have been made and successfully prosecuted with much less evidence than what is emerging in this investigation.”Mr. Comey’s agents will soon recommend either that charges be brought against Hillary Clinton, or not. If not the investigation will be shut down. The White House, determined to protect Hillary and the Democratic presidential campaign, whether the president likes her or not, is eager to shut down the investigation. If the FBI recommends that charges be brought and Mr. Comey declines to take them to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, there will be such anger in the ranks that leaks will water the Washington landscape like an out-of-control lawn sprinkler. If he is persuaded that the evidence is insufficient to obtain a conviction he must be prepared to stand up for those convictions, too.But if he finds the evidence persuasive, he will have to decide whether to buckle under White House pressure, or stand tall again. His decision will influence the election of a president, and thus the republic, in a profound and lasting way. His decision will be a test of the reputation he has made as an honest man dedicated to principle over partisanship.\n\n","title":"EDITORIAL: The testing of James Comey - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"EDITORIAL: The testing of an honest man https://t.co/lgZSY2CWwV #Benghazi #HillaryClinton https://t.co/qCJUpa2GxG","date":"Wed Mar 30 00:31:37 +0000 2016","favs":7,"id":{"$numberLong":"714973320861655040"},"retweets":13},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/editorial-the-testing-of-james-comey/#.VvseNoNOOqo.twitter"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678ef5"},"content":"We were saddened by the passing of Mother Angelica who died at the age of 92\non Easter Sunday. This beloved Catholic nun lived a truly extraordinary\nlife.In 1981, Mother Angelica founded the Eternal Word Television Network\n(EWTN). Starting with just $200 and working out of the garage of her\nmonastery, EWTN is today the largest religious broadcasting empire in the\nworld. EWTN now broadcasts to more than 264 million homes in 144 countries\nwith 24-hour cable television programming. In addition, EWTN broadcasts\nterrestrial and shortwave radio and operates several publishing ventures.It is\na towering achievement by any standard. It is all the more remarkable\nconsidering the difficult circumstances of Mother Angelica’s upbringing. Her\nfather abandoned the family. Her parents later divorced when she was seven.\nHer mother suffered from depression and was emotionally dependent on her young\ndaughter. Mother and daughter moved around together, under great financial\nstrain and trying to make ends meet, especially at the onset of the Great\nDepression.“She was an adult all her life,” a cousin once said of Mother\nAngelica. “She never had a childhood.”After experiencing a few years later\nwhat she believed to be a miraculous healing of several physical ailments,\nMother Angelica became totally devoted to Christ, eventually understanding\nthat she had a vocation to religious life. On August 15, 1944, at the age of\n21, she entered the Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration Monastery in Cleveland,\nOhio.Several years later, after recovering from another physical trauma,\nMother Angelica was seized with a vision to build a monastery in the South. On\nMay 20, 1962, Our Lady of the Angels Monastery in Alabama was dedicated.Nearly\na decade later, Mother Angelica began to realize a gift for teaching and an\nardent desire to share the love of God. She started with mini-books. The first\nwas about prayer. This new direction in her life would eventually lead her to\nlaunch EWTN.Charles Chaput, the Catholic Archbishop of Philadelphia, said this\nabout Mother Angelica’s legacy:“Mother Angelica succeeded at a task the\nnation’s bishops themselves couldn’t achieve. She founded and grew a network\nthat appealed to everyday Catholics, understood their needs and fed their\nspirits. Mother Angelica inspired other gifted people to join her in the work\nwithout compromising her own leadership and vision. I admired her very much,\nnot just as a talented leader and communicator, but as a friend and great\nwoman religious of generosity, intellect and Catholic faith.“After receiving a\npersonal report in the mid-1990s about EWTN’s plans to expand to all corners\nof the Earth, Pope John Paul II drew a cross on her forehead and said of\nMother Angelica, who stood before him on aluminum crutches, “Mother Angelica:\nWeak in body, strong in spirit.”Mother Angelica suffered debilitating strokes\nin 2001 and could no longer actively lead her ministry. Her main contributions\nto EWTN these past 15 years were in prayer.For someone who suffered so much in\nher life, Mother Angelica’s ability to forgive and trust in God was a\nremarkable witness of faith. Her response to God’s merciful love was\nfaithfulness.The woman whose own childhood was filled with pain and sorrow\nwanted only to spread the love of God and love of family to others.“I want\nvery much to spread devotion to the Divine Child Jesus,” she said. “Not only\nis He powerful, but what you need and I need is family, and that Child Jesus\nwill make us one again. He will put love in our hearts, back where it should\nbe.”In his letter to the Christian community in Rome, Saint Paul wrote of the\nmoral duties of Christian life, among which are “rejoicing in hope,\npersevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer.” We join the millions around\nthe world who are grateful that Mother Angelica lived such a life.\n\n","title":"NEWT GINGRICH: In remembrance of Mother Angelica - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Newt and Callista Gingrich remember #MotherAngelica https://t.co/dyd5wRtukd","date":"Wed Mar 30 00:29:52 +0000 2016","favs":12,"id":{"$numberLong":"714972878475804673"},"retweets":11},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/newt-gingrich-remembrance-mother-angelica/#.Vvsd2yYUhM0.twitter"}

Harold Rogers, Kentucky Republican.At the same time, more\nthan 60 medical schools said they will require students to learn about new\nguidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control for writing\nprescriptions.Tuesday’s blitz was part of a series of formal efforts to stem\nthe tide of opioid and heroin abuse, which is causing more deaths than traffic\naccidents do in some parts of the country. Unintentional overdose deaths from\nprescription painkillers nearly quadruped from 1999 to 2013, and heroin-\nrelated deaths increased 39 percent between 2012 and 2013, according to the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services.Experts say the epidemic is striking\nevery corner of the country with no regard to age, gender or socioeconomic\nstatus.”The good news is because it is having an impact on so many people, we\nare seeing a bipartisan interest in addressing the problem,” said Mr. Obama at\nthe summit, where he heard from a recovering addict who started out on\nprescription painkillers and shifted to heroin.The Senate has already passed\nits own legislation to push therapeutic alternatives to opioids and to\ndisburse naloxone, a drug that can reverse the effects of an overdose.Mr.\nObama on Tuesday said the bill did not provide enough funding. He called for\n$1.1 billion in his fiscal 2017 budget to address the epidemic, though GOP\nleaders have said they appropriated hundreds of millions for the effort last\nyear.Sen. Rob Portman, the Ohio Republican who co-authored the Senate bill,\nsaid if Mr. Obama were serious about fighting the problem, he would be\nlobbying for the legislation to get to his desk.“The White House can do its\npart by calling on the House of Representatives to pass this bipartisan bill\nimmediately and send it to the president for his signature,” he said.Mr.\nObama’s actions on Tuesday focused in part on regulatory steps his\nadministration could take without Congress.One proposal would let qualified\ndoctors treat up to 200 patients a year with buprenorphine, a key drug used to\nhelp people quit opioids. The current limit is 100 patients.Prescribing\nbuprenorphine for opioid addiction was a relatively new practice when Congress\nestablished the program in 2000, so lawmakers wanted to tread carefully by\nlimiting the number of patients a qualified doctor could treat while\nempowering HHS to lift the cap in the future.Years later the administration\nand senators say there are long waiting lists for doctors who’ve reached their\n100-patient limit. Mr. Portman said Mr. Obama’s push to raise the limit to 200\nwas a good start, but he is “disappointed” that he didn’t push for 500.Also\nTuesday the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services finalized “parity”\nregulations that require plans contracting with Medicaid to disclose, upon\nrequest, what type of mental health and substance abuse benefits they provide\nand disclose any reason they deny payment or reimbursement for such\nservices.“Today’s rule eliminates a barrier to coverage for the millions of\nAmericans who for too long faced a system that treated behavioral health as an\nunequal priority,” HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell said. “It represents a\ncritical step in our effort to ensure that everyone has access to the care\nthey need.”\n\n","title":"White House unveils long list of efforts to combat opioid abuse - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#WhiteHouse unveils list of efforts to combat #opioidabuse\n#opiodepidemic\nhttps://t.co/oYou4c4XU6","date":"Wed Mar 30 00:03:37 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"714966271511625728"},"retweets":3},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/white-house-unveils-long-list-efforts-combat-opioi/"}

The proposed\nconstitution allows the NCPO to appoint a panel which chooses Parliament’s\n250-member Senate, including six seats for the head of the army, navy, air\nforce and national police, plus the military’s supreme commander and defense\npermanent secretary.** SEE ALSO: Germany to migrants: Integrate and learn\nlanguage or lose permanent residency **Critics describe the Senate plan as a\n“coup in disguise,” the Bangkok Post reported in mid-March when details first\nemerged.The Senate can stage a no-confidence vote against a future elected\ngovernment, which would probably be a coalition of parties.If the move gains\nenough support in Parliament’s lower House of Representatives, the government\ncould be brought down.The bicameral Parliament could also select a candidate\nas prime minister who is not a parliamentarian or even a politician.That\nperson could become prime minister if the appointed Senate approves.Mr.\nPrayuth oversaw the writing of the constitution after he led the 2014 coup\nwhich toppled Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra and ended the previous\ncharter.“Please do not assume the [NCPO] government wants to stay in power,”\nMr. Prayuth said on March 18. ” … We want the Senate to take care [of\nThailand] for a certain period of time so the country can move forward for\nabout five years.”It is unclear if their opposition will be enough to stop the\nconstitution, which would be Thailand’s 20th in the past 84 years, punctuated\nby more than a dozen coups. Critics will have to watch their language, the\ngovernment cautioned“People who propagate information deemed distorted,\nviolent, aggressive, inciting or threatening so that voters do not vote, or\nvote in a particular way, shall be considered as disrupting the referendum,”\nthe Election Commission said on Monday. Violators can be imprisoned up to 10\nyears and fined up to $5,600._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Thailand's new constitution falls short of return to democracy, critics say - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#Thailand’s new #constitution falls short of return to democracy, critics say https://t.co/HEWoRoa9Wb","date":"Tue Mar 29 23:37:47 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714959773163196416"},"retweets":4},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/thailands-constitution-falls-short-of-return-to-de/#.VvsRvdp7wVE.twitter"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678ef8"},"content":"The Supreme Court appears to be searching for a middle ground on the Obamacare\ncontraceptive mandate, issuing an order Tuesday asking both the government and\nthe religious charities challenging the rules to try to come up with options\nthat can accommodate both sides.In an unusual move, the justices, who heard\noral argument in the case last week, asked both sides to submit additional\nbriefs proposing ways that insurance companies could provide free\ncontraception to female employees without their faith-based employers having\nto be involved.The justices, in a two-page order, even suggested one\npossibility: having charities that object to contraception inform their\ninsurers that they don’t want their plans to cover methods they oppose on\nreligious grounds.“[The nonprofits] would have no legal obligation to provide\nsuch contraceptive coverage, would not pay for such coverage, and would not be\nrequired to submit any separate notice to their insurer, to the federal\ngovernment, or to their employees,” the court’s order said.Insurance companies\nwould then notify the employees directly that “the insurance company will\nprovide cost-free contraceptive coverage, and that such coverage is not paid\nfor by [the charities] and is not provided through petitioners’ health\nplan.”Justices said they would welcome similar proposals as well. The court\nasked the attorneys to weigh in by April 12, and a decision in the case is\nexpected by late June.The contraceptive mandate is part of the Obama\nadministration’s policies in carrying out Obamacare. The Health and Human\nServices Department said most employers must provide insurance that covers\ndozens of contraceptives approved by the Food and Drug Administration,\nincluding birth control pills and the morning-after pill, which some religions\nconsider sinful.Houses of worship were exempt from the mandate, but religious-\nbased charities, including some private schools and Catholic hospitals, were\nnot. Instead, the government offered an accommodation requiring the nonprofits\nto opt out of the coverage, which would trigger the insurers or the government\nto step in.The Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Catholic nuns dedicated\nto caring for the elderly, and a number of other charities said signing the\nform would make them complicit in providing contraceptives they object\nto.During oral argument last week, liberal justices warned against allowing\nfaith-based objections to stymie important government goals such as expanding\naccess to women’s health care, while the court’s conservatives said Mr. Obama\nwas hijacking the groups’ health care plans.Both sides interpreted Tuesday’s\norder as a sign that the justices were taking their positions seriously.“This\nis an excellent development. Clearly, the Supreme Court understood the\nSisters’ concern that the government’s current scheme forces them to violate\ntheir religion,” said Mark Rienzi, lead counsel for the Becket Fund for\nReligious Liberty. “We look forward to offering alternatives that protect the\nLittle Sisters’ religious liberty while allowing the government to meet its\nstated goals.”The American Civil Liberties Union said it meant the justices\nwere concerned about the consequences for women who could not get seamless\ncoverage from their insurers.Brigitte Amiri, a senior staff attorney at the\nACLU, said the request seemed to narrow the scope of alternatives to those\nthat use the employers’ existing insurers, “rather than alternatives that are\nunrealistic,” such as contraception-only plans that do not exist.The death of\nJustice Antonin Scalia last month looms over the case. Without his vote, the\nreligious feared the court would split 4-4._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Supreme Court seeks new remedy in birth control case - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Divided Supreme Court asks opposing sides to help reach compromise in contraceptives case: https://t.co/atzaWumPFC https://t.co/thzpJPQIG7","date":"Tue Mar 29 23:29:34 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"714957705069338624"},"retweets":8},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/supreme-court-seeks-new-remedy-birth-control-case/"}

Lanier said Tuesday before Mr. Bellamy’s\narraignment. “There’s no reason for it.”About 4 p.m. Saturday, Davonte\nWashington, 15, was standing on the platform of the Deanwood station in\nNortheast with his mother and two sisters when the suspect approached him,\npolice said. There was a brief exchange of words before the suspect opened\nfire, killing Davonte, who suffered two gunshot wounds to the torso.No motive\nhas been offered for the killing. Chief Lanier said there is no reason to\nbelieve the two boys knew each other, but also said she doesn’t think the\nshooting was random.Metro Transit Police Chief Ronald A.

He has, last I checked, been in Congress for 573 years, first as a member of the House and now the Senate.His greatest (only) accomplishment was “reforming” the Veterans Affairs Department.

The number has fallen every year since then,\nto the frustration of many adoption advocates in the U.S.China, as is\ncustomary, accounted for the most children adopted in the U.S. Its total of\n2,354 was up 15 percent from 2014, but far below the peak of 7,903 in\n2005.However, there was a sharp drop in adoptions from other countries that\nhad been high on the 2014 list: The numbers fell from 716 to 335 for Ethiopia,\nfrom 521 to 303 for Ukraine and from 464 to 143 for Haiti.Even with the\ndecline, Ethiopia was No. 2 on the list, followed by South Korea, Ukraine,\nUganda, Bulgaria, Latvia and Congo.Lawmakers in Uganda passed a bill in March\nthat sets tough new conditions for adoptions by foreigners, so its numbers may\ndrop for the 2016 fiscal year from 202 in 2015. The numbers from Congo may\nrise from the 168 adoptions reported for 2015; authorities there have finally\nbegun issuing long-delayed exit permits for many children who’d been stuck\nthere for more than two years despite court approval of their adoptions.There\nwere no adoptions from Russia, which once accounted for hundreds of U.S.\nadoptions each year, but imposed a ban that fully took effect in 2014. The ban\nserved as retaliation for a U.S. law targeting alleged Russian human-rights\nviolators.The last time there were fewer foreign adoptions to the U.S. overall\nwas in 1981, when, according to U.S. immigration figures, there were 4,868\nadoptions from abroad.Concerns about corruption, child-trafficking and baby-\nselling have prompted the United States to suspend adoptions from several\ncountries in recent years, including Vietnam, Cambodia, Guatemala and\nNepal.Guatemala, which for a few years provided the most children for U.S.\nadoptions, accounted for 13 last year - cases that were pending when adoptions\nwere suspended in 2007. Nepal accounted for two U.S. adoptions last year;\nthere were none from Vietnam and Cambodia.In each case, U.S. officials have\nbeen working with local authorities to curtail corruption and trafficking,\nwith the goal of eventually giving the go-ahead for resumption of some foreign\nadoptions.Chuck Johnson, CEO of the National Council of Adoption and a critic\nof State Department adoption policy, expressed dismay at the stead overall\ndecline, saying the world’s orphan population was growing annually by\nmillions.Many countries “are begging the U.S. for help establishing\nintercountry adoption programs - and the U.S. has been slow to respond,”\nJohnson said in an email.He said some relatively impoverished nations have\nbeen told to improve their child welfare systems and cut down on child\ntrafficking in order to qualify for a full-fledged adoption arrangement with\nthe United States.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f03"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**And then there were two.The Cleveland Browns’ signing of Robert Griffin III last week marked the end of the three-quarterback drama the Washington Redskins produced over the past two seasons.Griffin, Kirk Cousins and yes, Colt McCoy all started games over 2014 and 2015 and were all in play as the No. 1 quarterback at one point or another.Remember, the only one of the three who was not benched for performance was McCoy, who after being named the starter at the end of November 2014, was hurt in a game against the St. Louis Rams. After starting and leaving a game the following week against the New York Giants, he was done for the season.Now it is just Cousins and McCoy — and, of the two, the only who had the chance to leave was McCoy. Cousins was given the franchise tag by the Redskins and not given the opportunity to leave if he had chosen. He will be paid well for his lack of freedom.McCoy, though, could have been free of the Redskins. He chose to stay and be the backup quarterback.That’s no small signal for Redskins fans. It means a guy who has seen his share of NFL dysfunction and drama since he entered the league in 2010, drafted by the Browns in the third round, decided that Redskins Park had become a place of stability and security.“I believe in what our team is doing, with Bruce [Allen], Scot [McCloughan], Jay [Gruden] and Dan [Snyder],” McCoy said, referring to the Redskins’ president, general manager, coach and owner. “I talked to all of them this spring before signing, and it just felt right.“I have confidence in the way this team is being run now. Offensively, this is tailor-made for me and what I could accomplish on the field. I feel we are going in the right direction. I think we have a chance to do something special. I think we saw a little bit of it last year winning the NFC East. I’m excited about this year, coming back, and being part of the Redskins organization.”McCoy signed a three-year, $9 million deal with Washington earlier this month that reportedly includes a $1.8 million signing bonus for 2016 and other bonuses throughout the contract. He said he had other offers, but chose to stay.“I had other options,” McCoy said. “I could have gone several other places — much more options this year than last year. So, I had to make some decisions about what I wanted to do. Being back just felt right.”McCoy, 29, entering his seventh NFL season, recently wrote about his career for the website The Players’ Tribune, trying to make the case for both his desire to be a starting quarterback and his decision to return to Washington to be a backup.“I still see a starting job for me someday,” McCoy said. “I wouldn’t be coming back to play if I didn’t feel I could still offer a lot to a team and start in this league. It is something that I want to do again. I tried to explain this in the article. It is not like it just happens overnight again.“The things I went through in Cleveland, it’s all about just climbing back up the ladder to get that opportunity again,” he said. “I felt like this is the best place for me to be part of something special and work my way back toward being a starter. In this system, with these coaches and this team, it just feels right. We’ll just have to see how this plays out. I feel like I’m doing everything I can as far as preparing and training to be ready if the opportunity presents itself to step in and do good things for my team.”_Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"LOVERRO: Unlike Robert Griffin III, Colt McCoy soldiers on with Redskins - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Colt McCoy soldiers on with #Redskins — unlike Robert Griffin III, @ThomLoverro writes: https://t.co/5Qjik0Y1ao https://t.co/cv0DpRrtXo","date":"Tue Mar 29 20:30:05 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"714912536274014212"},"retweets":1},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/22YYo9e"}

Rob Portman and Claire\nMcCaskill, who led the effort, said they were left with no choice after\nBackpage refused to comply with a subpoena issued by the Permanent\nSubcommittee on Investigations, which has been looking into Backpage’s\nactivities.“We have given Backpage.com every opportunity to comply with a\nlawful subpoena, but they have continued to stonewall our bipartisan\ninvestigation,” Mr. Portman, Ohio Republican, and Ms. McCaskill, Missouri\nDemocrat, said in a joint statement.The Senate earlier this month voted 96-0\nto go to court to enforce the subpoena — the first time in more than two\ndecades that the chamber has taken that step.Lawyers for Backpage said at the\ntime of the vote that they were eager to get the matter into federal court,\nwhere they planned to argue they have First Amendment protections under the\nfreedom of the press.But Senate lawyers argued in their legal filing that the\nusual process is for a media company to search its documents and then argue on\na case-by-case basis which ones should be exempt from the reach of a subpoena.\nBackpage CEO Carl Ferrer, however, has asserted a blanket exemption that the\nSenate lawyers say breaks new legal ground.“Mr. Ferrer’s objection appears to\nquestion whether Congress can investigate this area at all. But such a notion\nis baseless,” the Senate lawyers said.Congress and Backpage have been at war\nfor several years, and lawmakers have passed legislation aimed at cracking\ndown on online sex trafficking.Backpage sued late last year to try to stop the\nStop Advertising Victims of Exploitation (SAVE) Act from being used against\nthe company. Backpage argued that the law was written so vaguely that it could\nend up ensnaring publications that do try to weed out illicit activities but\ninadvertently miss some postings.Backpage said it feared zealous prosecutors\nmight go after websites rather than the customers who run the ads.“Criminal\nliability cannot constitutionally be imposed on a website merely for providing\na forum for speech that some individuals misuse for sex trafficking,” the\ncompany said in its 23-page complaint. “Given the enormous volume of third-\nparty content they receive and disseminate every day, websites cannot possibly\nreview every post to guarantee nothing is unlawful.”Backpage hosts online\nclassified ad pages for more than 400 U.S. cities. The ads range from car\nsales and rooms for rent to an “adult” section with postings for massages,\nsexual fetishes and escorts.Senators say some of those ads involve people who\nhave been trafficked for purposes of sex, including minors.“Sex trafficking\nhas thrived on the Internet in part because of the high profitability and\nrelatively low risk associated with advertising trafficking victims’ services\nonline in multiple locations,” the Senate subcommittee said in its report\nurging the contempt citation. “With the aid of online advertising, traffickers\ncan maximize profits, evade law-enforcement detection, and maintain control of\nvictims by transporting them quickly within and between states.”_Story\nContinues →_\n\n","title":"Senate goes to court to demand documents from Backpage.com 'adult' site - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Senate goes to court to demand documents from https://t.co/Nsz3Ed59KI 'adult' site https://t.co/xrn6eZAkUG","date":"Tue Mar 29 20:25:37 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"714911412934541313"},"retweets":2},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/1UAz0FJ"}

No presumption of innocence with them– the verdict is in, and it’s guilty!“_Who are you going to believe — the mastermind behind Trump University and his campaign manager or your lying eyes_?” questioned conservative blogger Jennifer Rubin at the Washington Post, of the video released by the Jupiter, Florida police department of the incident Tuesday.“Here is Corey Lewandowski caught in a gross, cynical lie,” Buzzfeed reporter Andrew Kaczynski tweeted, linking the video and then Mr. Lewandowski’s tweet earlier this month, saying he never touched reporter Michelle Fields.Matt Viser, national politics reporter for the Boston Globe, wrote on Twitter: “Ironic that this security footage – disproving account of Trump and his campaign manager – comes from cameras at Trump National Golf Club.”And Besty Woodruff, of the Daily Beast commented: “Trump supporters have no problem believing Ted Cruz has 34895 mistresses, but still hold firm that Corey never touched @MichelleFields.”Per the video footage, there’s little doubt Mr. Lewandowski at least briefly touched Ms. Fields.But to me, it looks like a crowded press gaggle, where Mr. Lewandowski was trying to give his candidate room, and pushed aside a reporter asking a question. These type of situations are so common on the campaign trail, I’m not surprised Mr. Lewandowski has no recollection of it.Ms. Fields didn’t fall, no other reporters came to her aid, and the traffic in the room didn’t stop.What Donald Trump’s campaign is guilty of, however, is bringing the national political discourse into the gutter – whether it’s his retweets of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s wife, the blood coming out of Megyn Kelly’s wherever, or making fun of Carly Fiorina’s looks.You see, he’s created an anti-woman narrative here, which the press and anti-Trump forces want to ingrain – no matter what the so-called evidence is at hand regarding Mr. Lewandowski and Ms. Fields’ exchange.Still, battery is a serious charge that could ruin a career.

It could be put on display at the\nlocal community center. Someone could eat or drink from it — the top is a\nglass bowl, after all — but doing so would require considerable strength and\nsome crafty maneuvering.For all the things the trophy could be, one thing it\ndefinitely does is recognize excellence, much like the Stanley Cup. To ascribe\nsuch a similar meaning to it, though, would be downright silly.“Honestly, no\none really cares about the Presidents' Trophy,” said Karl Alzner, whose\nWashington Capitals earned it for the second time in franchise history in\nMonday’s 4-1 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets. “To be honest with you,\nit’s just a nice feather in the cap, but we’re happy to get the opportunity to\nhave home ice [advantage], which is huge.”It appeared inevitable for months\nthat the Capitals would claim the best record in the NHL, with each successive\nvictory pushing them further into the league’s annals. As recently as last\nmonth, they were on pace to match, if not surpass, the Montreal Canadiens’\nrecord of 132 points in the standings — a mark that has stood since the\n1976-77 season.They have not yet lost consecutive games in regulation and have\nlost back-to-back outings just three times all season. Their next victory will\nbe their 55th, which would be a franchise record; a win in any of their three\nremaining home games would give them 30 on the season, another mark.“I think\nwe all knew it was coming,” defenseman Matt Niskanen said. “We’re not spraying\nchampagne or anything, but I think guys are happy. It’s a marathon. We won the\nmarathon, and now we get to prepare for the seven-game sprints.”The difficulty\nfor Washington will lie in translating its regular-season success to the\nplayoffs. Since its inception in 1986, the Presidents' Trophy has often served\nas a golden ticket to the Stanley Cup Final — though only three teams have\ndone so since a lockout wiped out the entire 2004-05 season.That fact is not\nlost on the Capitals, who endured one of the more noticeable playoff exits the\nfirst time they claimed the trophy in 2010. Clearly the top team in the league\n— their 121 points were eight more than the San Jose Sharks and 18 more than\ntheir nearest Eastern Conference challengers, the New Jersey Devils — they\nlost to the Montreal Canadiens in the first round of the playoffs despite\ntaking a 3-1 advantage in the best-of-seven series.Such a collapse mitigated\nthe only true spoil of regular-season success. Though they held home-ice\nadvantage throughout the playoffs, the Capitals hosted both the opening loss\nand their elimination game.Alzner posited that such an advantage helped\nWashington in its first-round matchup with the New York Islanders last season\n— a series that stretched to seven games before the Capitals advanced. T.J.\nOshie, acquired via trade in the offseason, said things such as having the\nsecond line change can create an edge in the playoffs’ traditional low-scoring\naffairs.“But at the same time, it doesn’t matter,” said center Nicklas\nBackstrom, who pointed to that first-round loss in 2010 as evidence. “For me,\nit’s just a matter of, ‘Get to the playoffs.’ Teams one through eight [can]\nbeat anyone.”That’s why coach Barry Trotz believes the Capitals’ approach to\nthe next seven games, beginning on Wednesday with a road contest against the\nPhiladelphia Flyers, a potential first-round playoff opponent, will have a\nsignificant effect on their postseason.Except for granting an additional day\noff here or there, he has already opted to not rest his players, believing\nthat their routine and collective momentum play a large role in stability.He\nalso wanted the team to understand the significance of the achievement, but\nalso to recognize that it’s now part of the past.

And I don’t even know that he\nwanted to, which is perhaps the scariest prospect of all.“He certainly was\nnever prepared or equipped to go all the way to the White House, but his ego\nhas now taken over the driver’s seat, and nothing else matters. The Donald\ndoes not fail. The Donald does not have any weakness. The Donald is his own\nbiggest enemy.”“I’ll say it again: Trump never intended to be the candidate.\nBut his pride is too out of control to stop him now,” she continued. “He\ndoesn’t want the White House. He just wants to be able to say that he could\nhave run the White House. He’s achieved that already and then some. If there\nis any question, take it from someone who was recruited to help the candidate\nsucceed, and initially very much wanted him to do so.”Ms. Cegielski went on to\ncall Mr. Trump a “self-preservationist” who only cares about himself.“The man\ndoes not know policy, nor does he have the humility to admit what he does not\nknow — the most frightening position of all,” she wrote. “And he has no\nproblem abusing your support the same way he cheated hard-working men and\nwomen out of millions of dollars, for which he is now being sued.”“No matter\nhow many times he repeats it, Trump would not be the ‘best’ at being a\npresident, being in shape, fighting terrorism, selling steaks, and whatever\nother ‘best’ claim he has made in the last 15 minutes,” she wrote. “He would\nbe the best at something, though. He is the best at looking out for Donald\nTrump — at all costs. Don’t let our country pay that price.”Hope Hicks, a\nspokeswoman for the Trump campaign, dismissedMs. Cegielski’s assertions.“This\nperson was never employed by the Trump campaign. Evidently she worked for a\nSuper PAC which Mr. Trump disavowed and requested the closure of via the FEC,”\nshe said. “She knows nothing about Mr. Trump or the campaign, and her\ndisingenuous and factually inaccurate statements in no way resemble any shred\nof truth.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f0b"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:****ANALYSIS:**It’s happening.Prominent Republicans who have served in the national security arena – or share the nation-building worldview of George W. Bush — are saying they’d rather have Hillary Clinton as president than Donald Trump.“I’m supporting Hillary, and the main reason I’m supporting her is that she is for American engagement in the world,” R. Nicholas Burns, undersecretary of state during the George W. Bush administration told the Wall Street Journal.Former CIA chief Michael Hayden echoed Mr. Burns’s thoughts on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program on Tuesday.“After [Ohio Gov. John] Kasich, the one best prepared to handle my narrow lane in the road was Hillary Clinton,” Mr. Hayden said. “With Mr. Trump it’s very clear, I can’t create any parallax between the points of light that he throws out during his campaign stops - you know when all the lines come together and I can see what is the motivational impulse. I don’t see it, all I see are stray electrons and that makes someone like me very, very uncomfortable.”It’s no surprise Mr. Trump is making the hawks squirm.Mr. Trump has disavowed the war in Iraq, saying it destabilized the Middle East. During a debate in South Carolina, he stood by his comment in 2008 that Democrats should have impeached President Bush over the invasion – absolutely blasphemy in conservative circles.In interviews given with both the New York Times and subsequent media outlets in the past week on his foreign policy views, Mr. Trump has said America is paying too much into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and not getting much in return. He’s questioned its value, and whether countries like Japan and South Korea shouldn’t be paying for U.S. nuclear protection – or developing it on their own.No wonder why Mr. Hayden is uncomfortable – Mr. Trump threatens the traditional foreign policy worldview Republicans have held for decades.But it may just reflect where the national mood is.The U.S. does pay, as a percentage of GDP, the most into NATO of any other member country. Only five of the organizations 28 members will actually spend the 2 percent of GDP on defense that is a requirement of membership.President Barack Obama rode into the White House in 2008 in part due to his opposition to the War in Iraq, and promise to reduce troop levels in the Middle East. Has Americans’ appetite for intervention, or nation-building grown since then?It doesn’t seem so, given Mr. Trump’s popularity. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio was the lone hawk left in the Republican race, and he got trounced by Mr. Trump by double-digits in his home state, forcing him to drop out.Then there’s the insurgence of Vermont Sen. Bernard Sanders, who has been hitting Mrs. Clinton from the left about her vote for the Iraq War and support for the ouster of Libyan Dictator Moammar Gadhafi – which left a power vacuum in the Middle East — when she served as Secretary of State._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Republican Hawks prefer Hillary Clinton for president over Donald Trump - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Republican Hawks prefer Hillary Clinton for president over Donald Trump https://t.co/1xnwXdMBfT","date":"Tue Mar 29 19:28:33 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"714897049616064512"},"retweets":16},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/29/republican-hawks-prefer-hillary-clinton-president-/"}

Madam” Deborah Palfrey’s escort business.But he believes the\npublic should have the right to see the records ahead of upcoming state\nprimaries and the Democratic and Republican national conventions.“It is my\nopinion that the material that is in my possession is relevant to the\npresidential election,” Mr. Sibley told The Washington Times in an interview\nMonday.Mr. Sibley declined to divulge further details, including whether the\nthree Republicans and two Democrats who remain in the presidential race might\nbe implicated by the release of the records. He initially filed a petition\nseeking a hearing on the current restraining order in January, when there were\nfar more contenders in the race.In his application to the Supreme Court for a\nstay of the restraining order, Mr. Sibley writes that if he is not granted a\nhearing on the restraining order, he intends to release the records.Palfrey\nwas convicted in 2008 of money laundering and other crimes associated with\nrunning a prostitution service that catered to members of the city’s political\nelite. She committed suicide weeks after she was found guilty.Ahead of\nPalfrey’s federal trial, Verizon Wireless provided Mr. Sibley with a CD\ncontaining account information that corresponds to 815 phone numbers related\nto the escort service. The account holder names were either former clients or\nescorts who called Palfrey’s business, Pamela Martin and Associates, according\nto Mr. Sibley’s petition to the Supreme Court. The information on the CD has\nnever been publicly released.Mr. Sibley, whose license to practice law was\npreviously suspended, said he is asking the Supreme Court to weigh in on the\nmatter because he has had no luck obtaining a hearing in the lower courts.He\nfirst tried to file a motion with the U.S. District Court for the District to\nmodify the restraining order in January, but said that Chief Judge Richard\nRoberts did not allow him to file the motion. He later filed a petition with\nthe D.C. Circuit, asking for a hearing on the matter but said the court has\nnot granted one.Sen. Ted Cruz on Friday forcefully denounced a tabloid story\nfloating rumors of extramarital affairs, calling it “complete and utter lies”\nand saying GOP rival Donald Trump and his team are behind it.“This garbage\ndoes not belong in politics,” Mr. Cruz said of a report in the National\nEnquirer that said he’d been “caught cheating — with 5 secret mistresses.”\n\n","title":"Ex-attorney says D.C.

With the assistance of cannabis and edibles, I’m able to go to sleep,”\nhe said.In an effort to ease the symptoms of other vets, Mr. Defino teamed\nwith the Dab Lounge, a private club, to freely distribute about a half-pound\nof marijuana and various weed-infused edibles to anyone with a military\nID.“I’ve seen other organizations operate, and I’m not very happy with the way\nthey do it,” he told NBC. “They need to be donating more and doing more to\nshow these guys that they actually care.”Mr. Defino said he Saturday’s\n“Springbake” event set him back about $1,400, but he’s prepared to spend\nnearly twenty times that amount for a followup event he’s planning for\nVeteran’s Day in November.“It’s just a Band-Aid, but for these guys it’s a\nstart,” he said. “It gets them out of isolation and able to mingle with\ncivilians and re-integrate into society.”While the U.S. Department of Veterans\nAffairs states on its website there is currently “no evidence” that marijuana\neffectively treats post-traumatic stress disorder, 10 states since 2009 have\nallowed doctors to prescribe medical marijuana to patients suffering from\nPTSD.Between 2002 and 2015, VA data suggests the proportion of veterans who\nhave been diagnosed as being marijuana-dependent has surged from 13 percent to\nnearly 23 percent.“Marijuana may initially provide some relief” but “it’s very\nhard to stop it once you start it,” Dr. Karen Drexler, the VA’s deputy\nnational mental health program director for addictive disorders, told The\nAssociated Press. “It gets into this vicious cycle.”\n\n","title":"Vet hands out half-pound of marijuana at Colorado cannabis club - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Vet hands out half-pound of marijuana at Colorado cannabis club to combat PTSD https://t.co/TLN6DjOtnI","date":"Tue Mar 29 19:08:37 +0000 2016","favs":2,"id":{"$numberLong":"714892032435752962"},"retweets":2},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/1V1OHEl"}

I wish he would have done that to this point, but I think he’s going\nto do that going out the door. That’s a positive.”Marijuana is currently on\nthe Schedule I list alongside drugs like LSD and heroin.

Those drugs include\ncocaine, but also certain painkillers like oxycodone that are available with a\nmedical prescription.Mr. Johnson’s campaign followed up by saying that the\nformer governor would prefer that the president remove marijuana from the\ncontrolled substances list entirely, allowing states to legalize and regulate\nas they and their voters choose.But the campaign said most discussion and a\nmore likely near-term step has centered around reclassifying it to Schedule\nII, which would remove a barrier to prescribed medical uses, though they said\nthat either move would be a step in the right direction.Mr. Obama has said\nthat Congress can move on such a reclassification.“What is and isn’t a\nSchedule I narcotic is a job for Congress,” Mr. Obama said in a 2014 interview\nwith CNN. “It’s not something by ourselves that we start changing … no, there\nare laws undergirding those determinations.”Tom Angell, chairman of the\nadvocacy group Marijuana Majority, said the attorney general and the secretary\nof Health and Human Services can move to get rescheduling done without further\nlegislation under the Controlled Substances Act.“It’s tough to predict what\nthe president will do on this issue before he leaves office, but if he’s\nwilling to uphold his pledge to set policy based on science, and he listens to\nthe majority of Americans who support marijuana reform, he will exercise his\nadministrative authority for rescheduling,” Mr. Angell said.Mr. Johnson\npointed out that there are still some “dry counties” in the country with\nrespect to alcohol and predicted marijuana would eventually be in that same\ncategory.“I think every municipality has to realize that all the planes to\nDenver every single weekend are filled up, and that they’re missing out, and\nColorado is absolutely vibrant,” he said. “Is it due to marijuana?

All of these\nsystems are seeing inquiries from interested parties.Russia doesn’t export a\nlot of things but it does make very good weapons.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f14"},"content":"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - The governor has signed a bill that makes Utah the first\nstate to require doctors to give anesthesia to women having an abortion at 20\nweeks of pregnancy or later.The bill signed by Republican Gov. Gary Herbert\nMonday is based on the disputed premise that a fetus can feel pain at that\npoint.“The governor is adamantly pro-life. He believes in not only erring on\nthe side of life, but also minimizing any pain that may be caused to an unborn\nchild,” Herbert spokesman Jon Cox said.Many doctors in Utah and across the\ncountry are concerned that the requirement could increase the health risks to\nwomen by giving them unnecessary heavy sedation in order to protect a fetus\nfrom pain that it may or may not feel.Dr. Sean Esplin of Intermountain\nHealthcare in Utah said anesthesia or an analgesic would need to go through\nthe woman in order to reach the fetus. Doctors could give a woman general\nanesthesia, which would make her unconscious and likely require a breathing\ntube, or a heavy dose of narcotics.No other U.S. state has passed this same\nlaw, said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the abortion-rights nonprofit\nGuttmacher Institute. Montana lawmakers passed a similar law in 2015 requiring\nfetal anesthesia before surgeries, including abortions, performed after 20 or\nmore weeks of gestation, but its Democratic governor vetoed the measure.Twelve\nstates ban abortions after around 20 weeks of gestation, while a handful of\nother states give women the option of having anesthesia.Previous Utah law gave\nwomen the choice to have anesthesia during an abortion.The new law by Sen.\nCurt Bramble, R-Provo, targets a small subset of women who have elective\nabortions beginning at 20 weeks. State law normally allows abortions until\nviability, which is at about 22 weeks.But it could affect women in many other\nmedical situations.Utah law defines abortions in part as “the intentional\ntermination or attempted termination of human pregnancy after implantation of\na fertilized ovum through a medical procedure carried out by a physician or\nthrough a substance used under the direction of a physician.”David Turok of\nthe University of Utah’s obstetrics and gynecology department said that could\napply to instances in which a woman is past her due date so the doctor induces\nlabor or there’s a problem with the pregnancy, such as pre-eclampsia, so it’s\nsafer to deliver the baby early. These common procedures could now require\ngeneral anesthesia, he said.“You never give those medicines if you don’t have\nto,” Turok said.Laura Bunker of the conservative group United Families\nInternational said if there is any chance a fetus feels pain at 20 weeks,\ndoctors should do everything possible to make sure they are comfortable.The\nnew law would not apply to women who must have an abortion because their life\nis at risk or the fetus will not survive outside the womb._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Utah governor, Gary Herbert, signs bill requiring abortion anesthesia - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#Utah governor signs bill requiring #abortion anesthesia https://t.co/LXsw5iWJ9o","date":"Tue Mar 29 17:31:57 +0000 2016","favs":2,"id":{"$numberLong":"714867708123340801"},"retweets":4},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/jJHH1K"}

For any woman, who has ever had a bad picture taken (that’s every woman), it was a shot across the bow — reminding them of all the underlying negatives of Mr. Trump’s campaign.It also fired up Mr. Cruz’s team, who needs a win in Wisconsin’s April 5 primary, to have a shot at gaining the 1,237 delegates that Mr. Cruz needs to secure the Republican nomination outright, or to deny Mr. Trump the majority, bringing the contest to a brokered convention.Immediately after the attack, Cruz staffers began changing their Twitter image profiles to that of Heidi Cruz, emblazoned with the logo “Team Heidi.” Cruz surrogate, and former presidential contender Carly Fiorina — who was herself a subject of Mr. Trump’s insults (“look at that face”) — hit the campaign trail telling voters Mr. Trump clearly has a problem with “strong women.”On Monday, Charlie Sykes, a popular conservative radio host in Wisconsin (and also in the anti-Trump camp), did an interview with the business mogul comparing Mr. Trump’s attacks on Mrs. Cruz to a “12-year-old bully on the playground.”Mr. Trump told the radio host his decision to retweet the controversial photo was a very “mild” response, and that: “I didn’t even know it was necessarily a very bad picture of her versus [my wife] Melania.”Yeah, right.Further coming to Mr. Cruz’s aid, was an endorsement by Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker on Tuesday, who said: “It was an easy call for me to support Ted Cruz.”Perhaps even easier after last week’s mudslinging.Mr. Cruz and Mr. Trump are running neck-and-neck in the Badger State, and that was according to polling taken before the controversy. One can only presume Mr. Trump’s negatives are going to tick up after it — especially among women.Mr. Cruz was leading the businessman by 1 percentage point in an Emerson College Polling Survey taken between March 20-22, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.6 percentage points. A poll conducted by the Washington Free Beacon, had Mr. Cruz leading by 5 percentage points.“I’m not sure anybody in the Trump campaign understands yet what a big mistake this is, and they can’t keep doing this stuff and think they’re going to get the nomination,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Sean Hannity in an interview Monday night, regarding Mr. Trump’s stunt against Mrs. Cruz. Mr. Gingrich has largely been in support of the businessman.Part of Mr. Gingrich’s concern is Mr. Trump’s favorability among women — numbers the Trump campaign needs to boost to win the Republican primary outright, not to mention in the general election, when he’ll be up against presumed nominee Hillary Clinton.A recent CNN/ORC poll found that 73 percent of registered female voters in the United States had an unfavorable view of Mr. Trump, and 31 percent of Republican women would be upset if Trump won.Mr. Trump, for his part, seems to understand the heat is on — a least not by his words, but by his actions._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Wives spat energized Ted Cruz, weakened Donald Trump - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"WATER COOLER: Wives spat energized Ted Cruz, weakened Donald Trump https://t.co/WBzhIocXnM #TedCruz #DonaldTrump","date":"Tue Mar 29 16:57:29 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"714859031433756673"},"retweets":9},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/sd2DbY"}

She\ndied in Coeur D’Alene, Idaho, where she had lived for the past quarter-\ncentury, according to Teri Weigel, the publicist for her son, actor Sean\nAstin.Duke astonished audiences as the young deaf-and-blind Keller first on\nBroadway, then in the acclaimed 1962 film version, appearing in both alongside\nAnne Bancroft as Helen’s teacher, Annie Sullivan (who won an Oscar of her\nwon).**PHOTOS: Celebrity deaths in 2016**Then in 1963, Duke burst on the TV\nscene starring in her own sitcom, “The Patty Duke Show,” which aired for three\nseasons. She played dual roles as identical cousins Kathy, “who’s lived most\neverywhere, from Zanzibar to Barclay Square” while (according to the theme\nsong) “Patty’s only seen the sights a girl can see from Brooklyn Heights. What\na crazy pair!”In 2015, she would play twin roles again: as a pair of grandmas\non an episode of “Liv and Maddie,” a series on the Disney Channel.“We’re so\ngrateful to her for living a life that generates that amount of compassion and\nfeeling in others,” Astin told The Associated Press in reflecting on the\noutpouring of sentiment from fans at the news of her death.She had “really,\nreally suffered” with her illness, Astin added. From late last week until\nearly Tuesday morning, he said, “was a really, really, really hard process. It\nwas hard for her, it was hard for the people who love her to help her….”But\nthroughout her life, she was “a warrior,” he said. “You watch this 4-foot-10,\ntiny imp of a lady who’s more powerful than the greatest military leaders in\nhistory.”Born Anna Marie Duke in the New York borough of Queens on Dec. 14,\n1946, she had a difficult childhood with abusive parents. By 8 years old she\nwas largely under the control of husband-and-wife talent managers who kept her\nbusy on soap operas and advertising displays.In the meantime, they supplied\nher with alcohol and prescription drugs, which accentuated the effects of her\nundiagnosed bipolar disorder.In her 1988 memoir, “Call Me Anna,” Duke wrote of\nher condition and the diagnosis she had gotten only six years earlier, and of\nthe subsequent treatment that helped stabilize her life. The book became a\n1990 TV film in which she starred, and she became an activist for mental\nhealth causes, helping to de-stigmatize bipolar disorder.With the end of “The\nPatty Duke Show” in 1966, which left her stereotyped as not one, but two\nsqueaky-clean teenagers, Duke attempted to leap into the nitty-grittiness of\nadulthood in the 1967 melodrama “Valley of the Dolls,” in which she played a\nshowbiz hopeful who falls prey to drug addiction, a broken marriage and\nshattered dreams.The film, based on the best-selling Jacqueline Susann pulp\nnovel, was critically slammed but a commercial sensation.During her career she\nwould win three Emmy Awards, for the TV film “My Sweet Charlie,” the\nminiseries “Captains and the Kings” and the 1979 TV remake of “The Miracle\nWorker,” in which Duke played Annie Sullivan with “Little House on the\nPrairie” actress Melissa Gilbert as Keller.“I know she’s in a better place.

As always, it helps to plan ahead and consider whether you need extra\nservices that might add to your cost.Some old strategies are losing value due\nto changes in the way airlines operate.The notion that Wednesday (or Tuesday)\nis the best day to buy your ticket isn’t always true anymore. As more airlines\nbase loyalty programs on how much you spend, not how many miles you fly, it\nhas become harder for many leisure travelers to earn free flights.**Here are\nfive tips from travel experts:****-** Know what comes with your seat by\nreading the fine print on the airline website. A cheap ticket that doesn’t\ninclude checked baggage might not be such a bargain.Delta Air Lines (and soon\nAmerican and United) has a lower “basic economy” fare. “It looks cheap, but\nit’s got a whole bunch of restrictions on it,” says Patrick Surry, the chief\ndata scientist at Hopper, a travel-research firm in Cambridge, Mass. “It’s\nimpossible to change it, you don’t get a seat assignment, and you can’t pay to\nupgrade. It’s buyer beware - you need to do your homework.”**\\- **Be flexible\nwith dates and destinations. Flying to tourist destinations will almost\ncertainly be cheaper and less crowded in September or even August than in\nJuly. That is of little help, however, to families with school-age\nchildren.**-** Check the budget airlines. For example, if you’re flying to\nEurope this year, Iceland’s WOW air and Norwegian Air Shuttle have added\nroutes across the Atlantic.“They may not be the most convenient or\ncomfortable, but they may offer some attractive savings,” says Henry\nHarteveldt, a travel analyst in San Francisco. He cautions that travelers\nwanting lots of optional services may find it’s cheaper to stick with the\nolder, more familiar airlines.**-** If you haven’t done so yet, follow the\nTwitter accounts of the airlines on your intended route and sign up for alerts\nfrom fare-tracking services - there are several of those. That way you’ll\nlearn about a flash sale before it ends.**-** Families should confirm free\nseat assignments right away when booking on American, Delta or United, says\nSummer Hull, author of the Mommy Points blog. She factors in the extra fee for\nadvance seat assignments when flying on the discount airlines that won’t let\nyou pick a seat for free.Costs can rise quickly for a family. If mom, dad and\ntwo kids each have a suitcase, that’s often $100 each way within the U.S. Want\nto sit together on a low-fare airline?

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f1d"},"content":"A federal appeals court in Georgia has upheld the conviction of Damion St.\nPatrick Baston, a Jamaican pimp currently in prison for charges of sex\ntrafficking, money laundering and aggravated identity theft.Also known as\n“Drac” — short for “Dracula” — Baston was arrested in 2013 and was later found\nguilty of 21 counts stemming from a violent prostitution ring he ran from\nAustralia to Florida.Baston “sometimes dressed up as a vampire, complete with\nyellow contact lenses and gold-plated fangs,” and “forced numerous women to\nprostitute for him by beating them, humiliating them and threatening to kill\nthem,” said Judge William Pryor for the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.A jury\nconvicted Baston on all 21 counts during trial, and he was subsequently\nsentenced to 27 years in prison to be followed by a lifetime of supervised\nrelease. Yet while Baston was quick to challenge the ruling, the 11th Circuit\nCourt of Appealsruled last Thursday that he had in fact been rightfully\nconvicted and actually should be required to compensate one of his victims to\na greater amount than previously determined.“Baston challenges the sufficiency\nof the evidence for one conviction, a supplemental jury instruction and the\naward of restitution to his victims. Those challenges fail, but the cross-\nappeal by the government about a refusal to award one victim increased\nrestitution has merit,” the appeals court ruled.Among the arguments Baston\nmade during his appeal was that the U.S. government was wrong to penalize him\nfor arranging sex work in Australia, where prostitution is lawful.He claimed\nthat “money made in Australia from a legal brothel is legal” so “sending the\nmoney by … wire transfer is not money laundering because there is nothing\nillegal about that money.”“We conclude that Congress has the constitutional\nauthority to punish sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion that occurs\noverseas,” the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last week. “We affirm\nBaston’s convictions and sentence, but we vacate his order of restitution and\nremand with an instruction for the district court to increase his restitution\nobligation.”\n\n","title":"Damion Baston, 'vampire pimp,' loses court appeal in sex-trafficking case - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Damion Baston, ‘vampire pimp,’ loses court appeal in sex-trafficking case https://t.co/j8u6EPLLt3","date":"Tue Mar 29 15:45:36 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714840943808155648"},"retweets":2},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/Zk8N7Y"}

There’s already talk that The Donald’s\nTrump Tower may be the venue, with the match kicking off just three days after\nthe U.S. presidential vote.Karjakin is likely to be a significant underdog\nagainst Carlsen, who enjoys a 3-1 edge with 15 draws in head-to-head classical\nplay, but he proved the steadiest player in Moscow, and has a rich tradition\nof Russian chess greatness to draw on.The 26-year-old Russian was a noted\nprodigy and still holds the record for the youngest player ever to earn the\ngrandmaster title at 12 years, seven months. He played for his native Ukraine\nuntil 2009, when he switched his allegiance to Russia.But despite his lengthy\ntenure as an elite player, Karjakin was not considered among the favorites in\nMoscow. He ranks only 13th on the latest FIDE world ratings list and was the\nsecond-lowest rated player in the eight-grandmaster candidates field. But he\nscored 2½ points in the final three rounds, finishing alone in first at 8½-\n5½.The drama was palpable in Monday’s final round. Karjakin and Caruana —\nbidding to become the first American champion since Bobby Fischer was stripped\nof his title in 1975 — were tied for first, but the tiebreaks virtually forced\nCaruana to play for a win with Black. He managed to created a sharp, double-\nedged position out of a Rauzer Sicilian, but the price was high — Black’s king\nwas left in the center of the board and constantly exposed to a White\ncounterattack.Black appeared to be the aggressor as both sides built up their\nattacks, but Karjakin showed he was ready to mix it up with the line-opening\n29. Bb3 Rg5 30. e5!? Rxe5 31. Rc4, giving up a pawn to pressure the Black\nposition.Caruana’s need to play for a win cost him in the end, as the Russian\nfound a killer combination in the final minutes before time control: 35. Rd4\nd5 36. Qd2 Re4? (see diagram; better was 36…Be4 37. Rxb4 Qc7 38. Rb5 Rc8 39.\nQb4+ Ke8 40. Rb7 Qc5, though it’s unlikely Black can win this position) 37.\nRxd5!! (the only winning move: 37.

The U.S. is leading a coalition whose objective, through air\nstrikes and commando raids, is to defeat or destroy the Islamic State and its\nso-called Caliphate in Syria-Iraq.“America has forgotten that Muslims do not\naccept humiliation and will not forget to retaliate,” says the article,\naccording to a translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute\n(MEMRI), which monitors jihadi communications traffic“We haven’t forgotten the\nscreams of the virgin girls who were raped when you invaded Iraq. Today, with\nAllah’s help, we will avenge them and restore every maiden’s honor. Today we\nwill blow up your honor, today we will eliminate your myth, today we will take\nyour women captive and sell them at slave markets at prices reserved for the\nmost unclean. Today we will take your children and raise them among Muslim\nchildren until they grow up, fight, and break the noses of those who remain\namong you.”The writer points to the San Bernardino massacre carried out by\nAmerican-born Syed Farook and his wife.“Then how about we send you 10 Syed\nFarooks? How about we send you eight lions like the heroes who set France on\nfire [Nov. 13] and turned it on its head,” the writer says.The Islamic State,\nalso known was ISIL and ISIS, has pledged in previously posts to infiltrate\nwith its terrorists the streams of refugees from the Syria civil war.President\nObama over the weekend said he plans to bring more migrants into the country\nas a show of opposition against ISIL.Another Al-Wafa article specifically\nthreatens Europe under the headline, “Today It Is Brussels and [Its] Airport,\nand Tomorrow It Might Be Portugal and Hungary.”The mentioning of two countries\nnot thought to be ISIL’s crosshairs appears to be an effort to show that the\nterror group can strike anywhere in Europe.“The meaning is that no European\nnation or capital is safe from ISIS attacks,” says a MEMRI analysis.States the\narticle: “They [the perpetrators] told Belgium: We have come to you today with\nbombs, explosive belts, and rifles. We will yet send you to hell in coffins.\nYes, by the Almighty Allah, we will strike you in the nightclubs, the\nstadiums, the schools, and the universities; on land, on sea, and everywhere.\nWe will target the military, the police, women, men, the elderly, and\nchildren. We will leave none of you [alive].”ISIL’s primary weapon, displayed\nin mass killings in Iraq and in Brussels, is a suicide bomber. The death toll\nin the Brussels attack has reached 35, and of the more than 300 wounded, some\n60 are in intensive care.ISIL, via ally Jamat-ul-Ahrar in Pakistan, carried\nout a horrific suicide bombing in Lahore, Pakistan, on Easter Sunday. The\ntarget: Christians. The bomber killed more than 70 Christians and Muslims in a\ncrowded park.

It was too early to tell whether North\nKorea used a land target to test the accuracy and range of its weapons or\nexperienced problems after planning a launch into the sea, said an official\nfrom Seoul’s Defense Ministry, who also didn’t want to be named because of\ndepartment rules.North Korea has fired a slew of short-range missiles and\nartillery shells into the sea and has threatened nuclear strikes on Washington\nand Seoul since the start on March 7 of the annual springtime war games\nbetween the United States and South Korea.North Korea also launched a medium-\nrange ballistic missile into waters off its east coast for the first time\nsince 2014 and touted a new artillery system it says could turn the South\nKorean capital of Seoul into a “sea of flames.” Experts say the North’s new\nartillery launchers can fire 300-millimeter shells up to 200 kilometers (125\nmiles), theoretically reaching Seoul and its surrounding metropolitan area,\nwhere nearly half of the 50 million South Koreans live.North Korea routinely\ntests short-range missiles and artillery systems but tends to do more launches\nin times of tension with the outside world. It condemns the annual military\ndrills between Washington and Seoul as a rehearsal for an invasion.

But Mr. Walker said he wanted to make sure he\nwas supporting someone and that he wasn’t against something or someone.Mr.\nWalker, who called Mr. Cruz a “constitutional conservative” capable of taking\non special interests, said the Texas senator is best positioned both to win\nthe GOP nomination and defeat Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton in the\nfall.Mr. Walker said he got to know Mr. Cruz a bit better during the\ncampaign.“He is a decent man, he loves his family, he loves his wife — he\nadores his children,” Mr. Walker said. “He loves his country. He and I are\nboth preacher’s kids, so I certainly can appreciate and feel strongly about\nthe impact that his father had on him as a minister.”Mr. Walker also pointed\nout that he and Mr. Cruz, 45, are both in their 40s, as is House Speaker Paul\nD. Ryan, 46, who is also from Wisconsin.“We actually literally came of age\nunder President Ronald Reagan, and I just see someone who’s willing to uphold\nthose same principles, and that’s why I’m proud to endorse,” said Mr. Walker,\n48.In a statement, Mr. Cruz said Mr. Walker has been “an outstanding leader in\nthe conservative movement.”“Gov. Walker courageously stood up to special\ninterests and won in a bitter fight in Wisconsin,” Mr. Cruz said. “His\nleadership has made a profound impact on the people of Wisconsin and I welcome\nhis advice on how we can unite the Republican party and defeat Hillary Clinton\nin November.”Mr. Cruz, along with Mr. Trump and Ohio Gov.

Ted Cruz of Texas, who recently called for\nstricter law enforcement patrols in Muslim neighborhoods to stamp out Islamic\nextremism in the wake of the Brussels attacks. Last year, GOP presidential\nfront-runner Donald Trump had proposed a temporary ban on Muslims entering the\nUnited States in the wake of the San Bernardino attacks.** SEE ALSO: NYPD\ncommissioner: ‘Our own citizens’ pose bigger threat to Americans than migrants\n**“I believe that inflammatory comments about patrolling and securing Muslim\nneighborhoods or barring Muslims from entering this country, having an\nimmigration policy based on religion, is counterproductive to our homeland\nsecurity and national security interests,” Mr. Johnson said.Mr. Cruz has cited\nan New York Police Department program that reportedly surveilled parts of the\ncity’s Muslim community as an example of what he was talking about, which\nsparked a back-and-forth with NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton in recent\ndays.Mr. Bratton had written over the weekend that the unit was purposed to\nmap the ethnic makeup of the city to better understand the domain of the New\nYork metro area, and its work was finished.“[W]e do not single out any\npopulace, black, white, yellow or brown for selective enforcement,” Mr.\nBratton wrote in the New York Daily News. “We do not ‘patrol and secure’\nneighborhoods based on selective enforcement because of race or religion, nor\nwill we use the police and an occupying force to intimidate a populace or a\nreligion to appease the provocative chatter of politicians seeking to exploit\nfear.”“Bratton has a difficult job, and I am grateful for all he does to keep\nthe people of New York safe,” Mr. Cruzwrote Monday in response. “I also\nunderstand that politically, he has no choice but to implement the de Blasio-\nObama liberal agenda.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f27"},"content":"WASHINGTON (AP) — He is the Republican Party’s undisputed front-runner, yet\nDonald Trump’s White House aspirations may now depend on a messy fight for\ndelegates he is only now scrambling to address.Trump’s campaign on Monday\nvowed to pursue legal action against the Republican National Committee to\nprotect his recent victory in Louisiana, one of many states that feature\ncomplicated rules allowing campaigns to influence the presidential nominating\nprocess weeks or months after their votes have been counted.A similar process\nplays out nationwide every four years. Yet Trump’s outsider candidacy is so\nfar driven largely by media coverage instead of the on-the-ground organization\nthat rival Ted Cruz boasts. Now, Trump must play catch up — especially in the\nchase for delegates previously bound to former candidate Marco Rubio.“A lot of\nTrump’s support has been through earned media, so you haven’t had the need to\nreally focus on that aspect of it,” said Jason Osborne, one of several former\nBen Carson aides tapped in recent weeks to undertake Trump’s delegate\noutreach. “But that doesn’t mean you can’t get up to speed pretty quickly on\nit.”Indeed, Trump’s campaign on Tuesday will announce plans to open a\nWashington, D.C. office to run its delegate operation and congressional\nrelations team, said campaign senior adviser Barry Bennett.In addition to the\nnew space, Bennett said Trump has hired a veteran political operative to serve\nas the campaign’s convention manager. Paul Manafort, a seasoned Washington\nhand with decades of convention experience, will oversee the campaign’s\n“entire convention presence” including a potential contested convention, said\nBennett.The move marks a major escalation in Trump’s willingness to play by\nparty rules and build alliances in a political system he has so far shunned.\nIt comes as Trump faces a Republican nomination battle that will almost\ncertainly extend until the final day of primary voting on June 7 — or even to\nthe party’s July national convention in Cleveland — if he fails to secure the\ndelegate majority needed to become the presumptive nominee.In a campaign\nseason so far defined by extraordinary insults and extreme rhetoric, the 2016\nRepublican presidential nomination fight could ultimately be decided by\nlawmakers, party activists and lawyers.Selecting the people who will be\ndelegates at the national convention is a tedious process governed by rules\nthat vary from state to state. In some states, like New Hampshire and\nCalifornia, the candidates submit slates of delegates — actual people who\nwould presumably be loyal at a contested convention.In states like Louisiana,\nIowa, Nevada and many others, delegates are selected at state and\ncongressional district conventions and caucuses. To prevent mischief, the\nnational party adopted a rule requiring delegates to vote, on the first ballot\nat the convention, to vote for the candidate who won them.“Honestly, I’m new\nto the operation. It’s obviously not perfect,” said Trump aide Ed Brookover,\nwho was Carson’s former campaign manager.Brookover vowed Trump would have “an\nactive presence” at every one of the upcoming lower-profile conventions and\ncaucuses where delegates are selected. That includes this weekend’s state\nconvention in North Dakota, where 25 delegates will be selected. All of them —\nin addition to the state’s three national committee members — will be free to\nsupport the candidate of their choosing at the GOP’s national July\nconvention.Carson himself will appear in North Dakota on Trump’s behalf,\nBrookover said, as part of outreach efforts that include hospitality suites\nfor delegates, campaign surrogates, parliamentarians and support staff for all\nupcoming contests.It takes 1,237 delegates to win the Republican nomination.\nTrump, with 739 delegates, is the only candidate with a realistic path to\nclinching the nomination by the end of the primaries on June 7.Rubio’s recent\nexit gave Trump’s rivals an opening to help make his path harder. Most\ndelegates are free to support the candidate of their choice if their preferred\ncandidate drops out. The Florida senator suspended his campaign earlier in the\nmonth after accumulating 166 delegates — a trove that Cruz’s campaign is\naggressively courting._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Donald Trump scrambles to address delegate fight  - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Donald Trump scrambles to address delegate fight https://t.co/lnXFQd2OeC #DonaldTrump https://t.co/Bu9miTWb1e","date":"Tue Mar 29 12:28:05 +0000 2016","favs":2,"id":{"$numberLong":"714791234661924864"},"retweets":7},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/9RWP3V"}

A law enforcement official, who declined to be identified because\nthe person was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation, said the\nFBI was assessing whether a similar situation occurred at MedStar.“We can’t do\nanything at all. There’s only one system we use, and now it’s just paper,”\nsaid one MedStar employee who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity\nbecause this person was not authorized to speak with reporters.There were few\nsigns of the attack’s effects easing late Monday, with one employee at\nGeorgetown University Hospital saying systems were still down, and saying some\nmanagers had to stay late and come in early because of the disruptions.Company\nspokeswoman Ann Nickels said she couldn’t say whether it was a ransomware\nattack. She said patient care was not affected, and hospitals were using a\npaper backup system.But when asked whether hackers demanded payment, Nickles\nsaid, “I don’t have an answer to that,” and referred to the company’s\nstatement.MedStar operates 10 hospitals in Maryland and Washington, including\nthe Georgetown hospital. It employs 30,000 staff and has 6,000 affiliated\nphysicians.Dr. Richard Alcorta, the medical director for Maryland’s emergency\nmedical services network, said he suspects it was a ransomware attack based on\nmultiple ransomware attempts on individual hospitals in the state. Alcorta\nsaid he was unaware of any ransoms paid by Maryland hospitals or health care\nsystems.“People view this, I think, as a form of terrorism and are attempting\nto extort money by attempting to infect them with this type of virus,” he\nsaid.Alcorta said his agency first learned of MedStar’s problems about 10:30\na.m., when the company’s Good Samaritan Hospital in Baltimore called in a\nrequest to divert emergency medical services traffic from that facility. He\nsaid that was followed by a similar request from Union Memorial, another\nMedStar hospital in Baltimore. The diversions were lifted as the hospitals’\nbackup systems started operating, he said.Some staff said they were made aware\nof the virus earlier, being ordered to shut off their computers entirely by\nlate morning. One Twitter user posted a picture Monday he said showed blacked-\nout computer screens inside the emergency room of Washington Hospital Center,\na trauma center in Northwest Washington.Monday’s hacking at MedStar comes one\nmonth after a Los Angeles hospital paid hackers $17,000 to regain control of\nits computer system, which hackers had seized with ransomware using an\ninfected email attachment.Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, which is\nowned by CHA Medical Center of South Korea, paid 40 bitcoins - or about $420\nper coin of the digital currency - to restore normal operations and disclosed\nthe attack publicly.

The hijacker had earlier freed most\nof the passengers but kept seven people — four crew members and three\npassengers — with him.Just minutes before the arrest, local TV footage from\nthe airport showed several people disembarking from the aircraft and a man who\nappeared to be a crew member climbing out of the cockpit window and sliding\ndown the side of the plane.Alexandros Zenon, the permanent Secretary of the\nForeign Ministry in Cyprus, confirmed the hijacker’s surrender and subsequent\narrest, saying the situation was “over.” The arrest was also reported by\nEgypt’s prime minister, Sharif Ismail, and Civil Aviation Minister Sharif\nFathi.“All passengers and crew are safe,” Fathi said on state television.The\nman’s motivation was unclear, but Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades said the\nhijacking was “not something that has to do with terrorism” and a Cyprus\ngovernment official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing\ninvestigation, said the man “seems (to be) in love.”Anastasiades, appearing\nalongside European Parliament President Martin Schulz in Nicosia, was asked by\nreporters whether he could confirm that the incident was about a woman.\n“Always, there is a woman” involved, he replied, drawing laughter.A Cyprus\npolice official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he’s not\nauthorized to disclose details of the situation, says the hijacker walked off\nthe plane and was taken into custody by special anti-terrorist police. The\nofficial said the man wore a belt but there were no explosives in it. The\nCypriot woman who the hijacker had asked to speak to is his former wife with\nwhom he has four children, the police official said. The hijacker had also\ncomplained about the current Egyptian government and had demanded the release\nof female prisoners from Egyptian jails.A civil aviation official, also\nspeaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t allowed to talk to the\nmedia, said the man gave negotiators the name of a woman who lives in Cyprus\nand asked to give her an envelope. It was not clear if she was his former\nwife.The flight MS181 took off from the Mediterranean coastal city of\nAlexandria on Tuesday morning en route to Cairo with at least 55 passengers,\nincluding 26 foreigners, and a seven-member crew.An official with flight-\ntracking website FlightRadar24 said the plane showed no immediate signs of\ndistress. The flight between Alexandria and Cairo normally takes about 30\nminutes.There was also confusion about the hijacker’s identity. At a news\nconference in Cairo, Egypt’s Civil Aviation minister, Sharif Fathi, refused to\nidentify him.Earlier, Egyptian government spokesman Hossam al-Queish said the\nhijacker was Ibrahim Samaha, but an Egyptian woman who identified herself as\nSamaha’s wife said her husband is not the hijacker and was on his way to Cairo\nso he could fly to the U.S. to attend a conference.The woman, who identified\nherself only as Nahla, told the Egyptian private TV network ONTV in a phone\ninterview that her husband had never been to Cyprus and that a photo on\nEgyptian and regional TV channels that supposedly showed the hijacker was not\nhim. Later, the official Middle East News Agency gave a different name for the\nhijacker.Egypt’s state news agency, MENA, later identified the hijacker as\nSeifedeen Mustafa.

With over seven\nyears as the owner of Running Hare Vineyard in Prince Frederick already to his\ncredit, the Maryland entrepreneur is turning his energies and attention to\nsatiating awaiting thirsts of the District’s — and the nation’s — ever-\nexpanding craft brewery market.“I’ve just come to the conclusion that beer has\nbecome the new wine,” Mr. Scarborough told The Washington Times of his Calvert\nBrewing Company, which opened to the public this spring in Upper Marlboro.“If\nyou’re making wine, some of the technology and the skill set that you learn\nthere you can transfer over to the beer side,” he said.Calvert opened the\ndoors at its 20,000-sq.-ft. facility to the public in February, serving up its\ncream ale, Good Company Pale Ale and Route 4 IPA, named for a nearby Maryland\nthoroughfare. The response has so far been extremely positive.Mr. Scarborough\nsaid he hopes that Calvert, named in honor of one of Maryland’s most historic\nfamilies, will help slake the thirsts of the “underserved” greater District\nand Baltimore area.“I know that there’s tremendous opportunity in this part of\nthe country without any question,” he said, adding he believes choosey\ndrinkers along the entire eastern seaboard from Philadelphia to Virginia are\nhungering for new and better beers beyond the offerings of the Big\nThree.Calvert’s brewmaster, Matt Ducey, certainly looks the part of a\nconcocter of suds, sporting a generous full beard and a happy-go-lucky\nattitude. He related how, as a young man, he brewed at home, against his\nparents’ wishes, before being found out.“I revealed to them what was\ninevitably a terrible batch of beer, and they were unhappy,” Mr. Ducey\nrecalled of the parental scolding. “They said ‘don’t ever do it again.’ I\nnever listen.”After such adolescent experiments, Mr. Ducey decided he could\nmake fermenting fluids his professional virtuosity. He worked at Annapolis\nHome Brew before being hired by Mr. Scarborough.It was indeed a bold stroke to\nname their brewery after one of Maryland’s founding families, but Mr.\nScarborough said that it is incumbent upon new brewers in the expanding beer\nindustry to stand out from their competition as well as to foster a local\nidentity.“One of the things that we learned from talking to distributions is\nthat you need to own your own market,” Mr. Scarborough said. “The Calvert\nfamily is one of the two founders of the state of Maryland [and] everyone\nknows the name. So it allows us to essentially attach to that and own what is\narguably in our own backyard.”Calvert is open for tours and tasting Wednesday\nto Friday from 3 to 9 p.m. and Saturday 12 to 9 p.m.“it’s all about the beer,”\nMr. Scarborough said. “It’s all about the liquid.”\n\n","title":"Calvert Brewing Company of Maryland using state's most historic family name  - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"@Calvertbrewing of Maryland use state's iconic family name for #beer. #brewing #beernews\nhttps://t.co/EWrWVUD0Ap https://t.co/X89MW52ruc","date":"Tue Mar 29 02:20:53 +0000 2016","favs":4,"id":{"$numberLong":"714638427464024064"},"retweets":2},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/calvert-brewing-company-maryland-using-states-most/"}

Rob Bishop, Utah Republican and\nchairman of the Committee on Natural Resources, gives the House a starting\npoint ahead of the March 31 deadline set by Speaker Paul D. Ryan to address\nPuerto Rico’s $70 billion plight.Both sides of the aisle are picking through a\ndraft that circulated around Capitol Hill over the weekend, and congressional\naides say the legislation will change before the committee considers the bill\nin mid-April.“The committee is continuing to work on a bipartisan basis to\ndraft legislation that offers Puerto Rico tools to create positive change over\nits finances, meet its obligations and restore confidence in its\ninstitutions,” committee spokesman Parish Braden said.The draft legislation\nurges Puerto Rico to reach voluntary debt-restructuring agreements with its\ncreditors. As a last resort, the oversight board may authorize a petition for\ncourt-supervised restructuring, though it would not be allowed to file under\nthe Chapter 9 bankruptcy mechanism that congressional Democrats had sought.The\nfive-member oversight board would operate within the Puerto Rican government\nbut is not subject to the control of the governor or legislative\nassembly.Commissioner Pedro Pierluisi, a Democrat who serves as the island’s\nnon-voting House member, said the board is too powerful.

Puerto Rico, for example, will soon have to start tapping general revenues for some $750 million annually just to cover its pension IOUs.Stateside, a similar day of reckoning fast approaches the United Mine Workers of America. Unfortunately, as the UMWA’s pension fund nears insolvency, some lawmakers want to bail it out.That would set a dangerous precedent. Rewarding the irresponsible and reckless actions of UMWA officials and pension managers would encourage other plans to follow in their footsteps.When the pension plan was created, the UMWA fought to give pensions to workers who never earned them. Since then, it has continually negotiated for and promised larger pensions than it can afford to pay. Despite its acknowledgement that its pension plan will be insolvent within a decade, the UMWA issued special pension bonuses in 2014, 2015 and 2016.Coal mining is not an easy job. Yet, many workers took jobs in the mines — despite the hard labor and dangerous conditions — because it would at least provide a secure retirement. It’s not the coal miners’ fault that money they were promised isn’t there, but it’s also not the fault of taxpayers or the UMWA’s competitors. Yet, that’s who the UMWA and some lawmakers want to pay for the union’s irresponsible behavior.H.R. 2403 and S. 1714 siphon off nearly a half-billion dollars annually from taxpayers and the Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation Fund (AML) to make up the shortfall in the UMWA’s health and pension plans.The AML was established to clean up environmental damage caused by pre-1977 mines. Millions of Americans live within a mile of these abandoned and as-yet-uncleaned sites, and the AML itself is already underfunded, with assets of only $2.5 billion in the AML and more than $6 billion in high priority cleanup sites still to go. This shortfall has led the administration to ask for an AML fee increase.AML fees are paid by coal producers according to their output. In 2015, UMWA coal producers accounted for about 9 percent of total coal production, and therefore, about 9 percent of all AML fees. The remainder came from other union mines (5 percent) and non-union coal producers (86 percent).All non-UMWA coal companies are already forced to subsidize the UMWA’s unfunded retiree health care costs. Making them shoulder UMWA pension costs on top of that would further reduce what they can provide for their own workers, and could lead to the demise of mines now struggling to stay afloat.The unfairness is compounded by the fact that a bailout would line the pockets of select mine owners and union officials by wiping liabilities — promises they made knowing they couldn’t keep them — off their books.If the feds bail out UMWA pensions, the message to other troubled union pension plans will be clear: don’t worry about making promises you can’t keep; just hire the right lobbyists, pressure the right politicians, buy the right political influence, and the government will pay what you can’t.The problem for taxpayers is: the government can’t bail out everyone. The UMWA pension fund is but one of approximately 1,300 multiemployer plans covering about 10 million participants across the U.S. Between 84 and 99 percent of these plans are underfunded, to the tune of about $500 billion.Moreover, the federal government has its own unfunded obligations. Without reform, Social Security benefits will be cut by 23 percent in 2034. And the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation — the government entity that’s supposed to provide a backstop for insolvent private pensions like the UMWA — is on track to become insolvent and cut benefits by 90 percent or more in 2024.Not a single taxpayer dollar should be used to pay the unfunded promises of favored unions. Instead, the federal government should address its own unfunded obligations._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"RACHEL GRESZLER: Congress wants union pension bailout, but can't afford Social Security promises - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"RACHEL GRESZLER: #Congress wants #unionpension bailout, but can’t afford promises. https://t.co/OSuHWzWWAd","date":"Tue Mar 29 01:58:50 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"714632882145345537"},"retweets":4},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/rachel-greszler-congress-wants-union-pension-bailo/"}

New evidence about the impact of greenhouse gases on the earth’s temperatures indicates that the president and his Environmental Protection Agency have some explaining to do. His account should spell out exactly what he expects to accomplish by spending a large fortune on climate control.Harvard researchers published a paper in the journal Geophysical Research Letters last month indicating that U.S. levels of atmospheric methane, a greenhouse gas, increased more than 30 percent between 2002 and 2014. The scientists compiled satellite and surface readings of methane to arrive at their finding, one that directly contradicts the EPA’s estimate that methane during that period had not risen at all, owing to the agency’s efforts to hold it down with air-quality regulations.The implication of the research is unsettling. It challenges the central premise of the president’s climate change policy — an undeniable link between increasing greenhouse gases like methane and rising temperatures — and that the government must step in with strict regulations to save the planet. In defiance of computer-model forecasts, there has been an 18-year “pause” in the warming trend even as heat-trapping gas was supposed to have billowed across the landscape. The contradiction between prediction and measurement has the look of a well-cooked hypothesis.Stubborn environmentalists reached a different conclusion from the new study. In an upcoming cover story in The Nation magazine titled “Global Warming’s Terrifying New Chemistry,” Bill McKibben, a “climate activist,” accuses the EPA of failing to block hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a natural gas drilling technique in which methane sometimes escapes into the air. “We need to stop the fracking industry in its tracks, here and abroad,” he argues.This is a convenient argument for opposing fossil fuels in any form, an argument drawn from fantasy, not facts. “The global burden of atmospheric methane has been increasing over the past decade, but the causes are not well understood,” say the Harvard researchers. “The U.S. has seen a 20 percent increase in oil and gas production and a ninefold increase in shale gas production from 2002 to 2014 … but the spatial pattern of the methane increase seen by [the satellite] does not clearly point to these sources.” Just as methane doesn’t track with states where fracking is concentrated, the measurements don’t track with higher temperatures. “Facts are stubborn things,” John Adams observed.It may be stubborn facts that have led EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy to concede last week that her agency’s heavy-handed regulations are more about showing the climate change flag than actually saving the climate. Asked at a House committee hearing to explain the point of air quality rules that won’t have measurable impact on temperatures, Ms. McCarthy answered, “We see it as having had enormous benefit in showing sort of domestic leadership as well as garnering support around the country for the agreement we reached in Paris.” This is a version of the old ‘60s mantra, “if it feels good, do it.”Mr. Obama should explain what benefit America can expect to derive from the payment last week of $500 million to the United Nations Green Climate Fund as part of the Paris agreement. Such “leadership” costs a lot, and it won’t change the temperature.\n\n","title":"EDITORIAL: Climate change facts vs. fantasy - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"EDITORIAL: Weather facts vs. fantasy https://t.co/sN5oKCUA6A #climatechange #Weather #globalwarming https://t.co/WVCrAYgx2q","date":"Tue Mar 29 01:17:16 +0000 2016","favs":5,"id":{"$numberLong":"714622418480922624"},"retweets":6},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/editorial-climate-change-facts-vs-fantasy/#.VvnVshAlS4o.twitter"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f33"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**”The workers love me.”It’s a common refrain in a Donald Trump stump speech. And recent history backs him up: The Republican front-runner has now racked up decisive victories in blue-collar strongholds Illinois and Michigan. One recent survey found that 55 percent of his supporters are white working class, indicating that the Donald is indeed tapping into deep-seated frustration among working Americans.But would a President Trump actually make things better for the rank and file?His record suggests otherwise.At the Republican primary debate in Florida, Mr. Trump again threatened to impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods “if [the Chinese] don’t behave.” Yet the overwhelming majority of economists agree that taxing foreign goods would do little more than raise the price of those goods in the United States — effectively shifting the cost of the import tax onto the consumer at the checkout line. This applies to all kinds of everyday goods American shoppers depend on — from shoes and shirts to diapers and vacuum cleaners.Some economists argue that Trumpian trade policies could even trigger a global recession. It goes without saying that another recession wouldn’t help the American worker. Keep in mind that the Smoot-Hawley tariff, which was passed during the Great Depression in 1930 and which drastically raised the price of imported goods, is widely credited with worsening and prolonging the depression. U.S. imports and exports subsequently contracted by about two-thirds and unemployment doubled from 8 percent in 1930 to 16 percent in 1931.Facts be darned, the real estate mogul has stuck to his claim that foreigners are “killing us on trade.” This is hypocritical. Many of Mr. Trump’s clothing items — from ties to dress shirts and suit coats — are made in China. And most of those that aren’t come from Bangladesh, Vietnam and other Southeast Asian countries. Mexico — another frequent target of Mr. Trump’s ire — is also known for manufacturing the Donald Trump Signature Collection.Mr. Trump recently admitted “It’s very hard to have apparel made in this country.” Really? Mr. Trump ties go for about $60 on Amazon. Given that other brands sell ties for $200 or more, the Trump brand could tack on a few extra dollars to manufacture them in the United States if he were willing to put his money where his mouth is. One recent analysis found that none of Ivanka Trump’s clothing line is made exclusively in the United States — 354 items are listed as made in China.Mr. Trump sees global trade as a zero-sum game: One more Chinese or Mexican job means one less American job. This is simplistic. The savings Americans enjoy on foreign-made goods stimulate job creation and economic activity at home.And Mr. Trump’s cozy relationship with Big Labor — which he has described as “great,” “wonderful,” and “refreshing” — may not help. He has been chummy with union bosses for years : “I’ve made many billions of dollars dealing with unions,” he said back in 2011.But his good relations with union bigwigs does nothing to help American workers. Nor does Mr. Trump’s failure to support or even mention proemployee legislation such as the Employee Rights Act (ERA), which will protect employees by updating basic American labor law for the first time since the 1940s. About 80 percent of Americans — including union and non-union households — support the ERA’s eight key provisions, which include guaranteed secret ballot union elections and an employee privacy guarantee. Ted Cruz is a co-sponsor, as are more than 120 senators and representatives.Predictably, the democratic reforms in the ERA are opposed by “establishment” union officials and their puppet crony candidates. More remarkably, Mr. Trump has yet to criticize the crony union scams that protect six-figure salaries for union officials at the expense of those who are forced to pay dues or lose their jobs.If Mr. Trump really wants the workers to love him he would drop his support for counterproductive tariffs and support the ERA. It can’t be too big a risk to aggressively support a law that polls 80 percent favorable among those who love you.It’s become obvious that Mr. Trump’s disregard for political correctness and outrageous statements make him a dream candidate for many frustrated Americans. But the substance of his positioning and history should give them nightmares.**• **_Richard Berman is the president of Berman and Company, a public affairs firm in Washington, D.C._\n\n","title":"RICHARD BERMAN: How a President Trump would harm workers - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Richard Berman on how  a President #Trump would harm #workers https://t.co/JAuA23yMcj https://t.co/OYsyLZD1z5","date":"Tue Mar 29 01:11:10 +0000 2016","favs":6,"id":{"$numberLong":"714620882833031170"},"retweets":8},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/richard-berman-how-a-president-trump-would-harm-wo/#.VvnUxE3_-EQ.twitter"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f34"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Last week the gentlemen first and second in the line of succession to the presidency delivered contrasting speeches that speak, volumes about the contemporary state of American politics.The first, delivered by House Speaker Paul Ryan to a group of Capitol Hill interns, called for increased cooperation and civility in our politics to better further the public’s interest. A former intern himself, Mr. Ryan knows full well how the starry-eyed wonder of youth first engaged in the business of government can so easily be supplanted by the cynicism of the alleged grown-ups supposedly mentoring and advising them.The second was given by Vice President Joe Biden for the specific purpose of refuting one of his own speeches delivered several decades ago concerning the obligation of the Senate to confirm or even consider a presidential appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in a presidential election year.For those who missed it, Mr. Biden wants everyone to ignore his belief back in 1992 that he and his fellow senators had no moral, political or constitutional obligation to act on President George H.W. Bush’s appointee to a vacant Supreme Court seat in an election year in favor of his belief today that the Senate has just such an obligation in light of President Obama’s desire to fill a vacancy under very similar circumstances. He has come to the conclusion after all these years that the Senate shouldn’t allow presidential politics to interfere with what he now believes to be its constitutional responsibility to act expeditiously on Mr. Obama’s appointee.As is so often the case with politicians, Mr. Biden wants us to forget his past positions in favor of his current desires. That is something his former Senate colleagues are not about to allow. “If the Constitution requires a hearing for every nominee, then Vice President Biden violated the Constitution in 1992 when, as Judiciary Committee chairman, he denied a hearing to more than 50 Republican nominees. If the Constitution requires a floor vote on every nominee, then he sought to violate the Constitution nearly 30 times by voting to deny floor votes to Republican nominees,” his former colleague, Utah Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, said in reaction to last week’s speech.Mr. Biden’s continuing partisan hypocrisy is an example of the kind of thing that has fueled the public demand for an outsider and helped send our politics down the path that Mr. Ryan is urging us to abandon. People are tired of politicians they see putting partisan interests and the desires of Washington’s privileged ahead of their own. Donald Trump recognizes this and has profited from that recognition. We may or may not like his answers, but we ought to at least understand why so many are drawn to his message.The Republican Party is undergoing what economists would call creative destruction as Republican voters — the party’s customers — are demanding a redesigned product lest they begin shopping elsewhere. Mr. Trump has tapped into their dissatisfaction with the old models while others in the Republican establishment would prefer to repackage the same old product and see if they can’t get their customers to continue buying it.Their day may be over, or it may not. The competition for the future of the party — among those who are just angry, those who seek a harder line on trade, immigration and defense, those who urge a more compassionate approach to the problems of the poor even if it might entail using the power of government to bring about change, and those trying to simply reassert the Reagan vision of a national government limited in breadth and scope — will eventually result in a new consensus and, hopefully, a better product.Republicans have been there before. Ronald Reagan shook things up quite a bit when he hit town, but the party and the country survived. The cynicism that motivates the Trump voter is not that different from the frustration that motivates those rallying around Sen. Bernie Sanders in the other party — a sense that politicians are more interested in their own than the public’s interests and a growing disdain for just the sort of transactional approach to principle that Mr. Biden articulated last week.Messrs. Ryan and Biden were, of course, talking across each other. While it is only coincidence these two speeches were given within days of one another, they encapsulate perfectly the division that exists between politics and principle that prevents cooperation and ignites conflict on Capitol Hill. In a very real sense, Mr. Biden’s appeal is to the politics as usual crowd while Mr. Ryan at least made an attempt to move on, to appeal to what Lincoln once called the “better angels of our nature” in the hope that politicians might recover the civility and dedication that would allow them once again to be seen as public servants.**• **_Peter Roff is a Washington writer who appears weekly on the One America News network._\n\n","title":"PETER ROFF: Paul Ryan, Joe Biden pan politics as usual  - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Peter Roff shares a revealing tale of two speeches https://t.co/oYTOUb6s3i #Biden #Ryan #politics https://t.co/h6b5qgH18D","date":"Tue Mar 29 01:08:22 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"714620178588438528"},"retweets":4},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/peter-roff-paul-ryan-joe-biden-pan-politics-as-usu/#.VvnUlIcLKhg.twitter"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f36"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**It’s terribly sad, but true. The slaughter in Brussels isn’t a surprise. It didn’t sneak up on anyone, undetected, and erupt suddenly, without warning. The perverse ideology that produced the mass killings has been festering there for years for all to see, feeding on itself, gathering its strength, and striking out periodically at innocent civilians. The warning bells have been clanging about Belgium, but Belgian politicians, both Flemish and French, have been too busy bickering with each other to take notice, until now. It’s the funeral bells that may have got their attention.Molenbeek, a working class district, on the northwest edge of Brussels, home to about 95,000 people, has been a rat’s nest of Islamist radicalism for at least two decades. It is one of Europe’s “no go” zones, a Muslim enclave, unassimilated, where the government’s writ is worthless unless enforced with massive force. On a per capita basis, Molenbeek contributes more jihadi foreign fighters to Syria and Iraq by far than any other place in Europe. By July 2015, about 120 of them had returned from the fight, many to Molenbeek. What did Belgium’s politicians think these battle-hardened fighters were up to?In 2001, the district’s denizens were connected to the assassination of anti-Taliban leader Ahmad Shah Massoud. One of them participated in the Madrid train bombing in 2004. The violence went local in May 2014, when Islamist gunmen killed four people at a Jewish Museum in Brussels. In January 2015, Molenbeek produced the Charlie Hebdo attacks, and a disrupted plot to kill Belgian police officers. In August 2015, three Americans thwarted one of its killers on the train from Amsterdam to Paris. In November 2015, Molenbeek Islamists killed and wounded 498 innocent civilians in Paris. Now well over 300 people, and counting, have been killed and injured in Brussels.The Belgian government’s failure to address this growing threat is infuriating. Prime Minister Charles Michel said after the Paris attacks: “I notice that each time there is a link with Molenbeek. We’ve tried prevention. Now we’ll have to get repressive. It’s been a form of laissez faire and laxity. Now we’re paying the bill.” It’s a remarkable admission by a leader forced by the dead and wounded to pay attention to the cancer in his country. Parisians can have been forgiven if they grumbled that when Mr. Michel noticed the problem, his country wasn’t paying the bill, they were.Now with more than 300 of their own citizens dead or injured, Belgium’s leaders have swung into action, grand pronouncements, police cars with blue lights flashing, soldiers in full combat gear patrolling the streets, all to reassure a frightened people their leaders are on top of it. The response is as predictable as the attack, politicians scrambling to avoid opprobrium, justly deserved, for their negligence and incompetence.The aggressive police operations currently underway look like a dragnet, their purpose to stop another attack by arresting anyone suspicious, leaving it for someone else to sort out later. It’s about the best the police can do, because they lack the resources to sustain a long-term, focused counterterrorism effort. It’s another product of the government’s indifference. The Belgium’s State Security Service former director, Alan Winants, said after the Paris attacks that he’d been pleading with government leaders for three years to give him the money he needed to meet the Islamist threat. Their response each time was more cuts to his budget.The downward funding spiral stopped after the planned police assassinations in 2015, and more money was promised after the Paris attacks. Now the government trumpets that it has allocated $670 million to the police, but it is all too late. In the security world, more money doesn’t translate instantly into more security. It takes time to build the infrastructure, recruit and train the people, purchase the equipment, and develop the intelligence.The Belgian government’s admittedly “laissez faire” attitude in the face of an obviously dangerous and growing threat has endangered all of Europe and the United States. Unfortunately, it also supports the call in some quarters for a reexamination of NATO. Belgium has for years failed to meet NATO’s minimum acceptable funding level for national security. It spends less than 1 percent of gross domestic product, one of the lowest levels in Europe, despite Brussels benefiting hugely from a new NATO headquarters, and from its 622 million euro operating budget. In terms of its own protection, Belgium is what President Obama rightly calls a “free rider.”The Belgium people deserve better than they got. It’s a shame, and the United States and our NATO allies should do everything we can to help them. At the same time, the alliance needs to step up.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f37"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Now that fighting terrorism is a hot campaign issue, it’s worth knowing just why we have not had a successful foreign terrorist attack since Sept. 11, 2001.Two days after the attack, FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III briefed President George W. Bush on the bureau’s efforts to investigate the crime.“They talked about how the terrorists got plane tickets, got on planes, moved from one airport to another, and then attacked our citizens,” Andy Card, Mr. Bush’s chief of staff, told me for my book “The Secrets of the FBI.” “And the president, while he was very interested in that report, said, ‘Mr. Director, that’s building a case for prosecution. I want to know what you have to say about the terrorist threats that haven’t materialized yet and how we can prevent them.’ “Mr. Mueller carried the message back to headquarters: Instead of simply responding to an attack, the FBI must uncover plots and roll them up before it’s too late.Of course, the FBI had always sought to prevent terrorist attacks before they occurred. But under former FBI Director Louis Freeh’s leadership, the FBI tended to treat each incident as a separate case, instead of recognizing the larger threat and mounting an effort against the entire terrorist organization, as the bureau had done with the Ku Klux Klan and the Mafia.On top of that, before Sept. 11, because of relentless media criticism and a lack of clear authority under Justice Department guidelines, the FBI had become so gun-shy and politically correct that even though terrorists were known to hatch their plots in mosques, the FBI was averse to following suspects there.Under guidelines in place before Sept. 11, FBI agents could not even look at online chat rooms to develop leads on potential suspects who might be recruiting terrorists or distributing information on making explosives. The FBI had to determine first that there was a sound investigative basis before it could sign on to chat rooms that any 12-year-old could enter.“We were told before 9/11 that we were not allowed to conduct investigative activity on the Internet, even though it’s public,” Arthur M. “Art” Cummings II, who headed counterterrorism investigations as the FBI’s executive assistant director, says. “Same thing with a mosque. It’s a gathering open to the public, but we were absolutely precluded from going into a mosque as an FBI agent. And precluded from having a source in a mosque report on anything in the mosque, or look at anything in the mosque, unless we had a specific target within the mosque.”That changed after Mr. Mueller came back from his meeting with Mr. Bush. Mr. Cummings told agents, “We’ve got this new mission. It’s a prevention mission.”Moreover, while the FBI’s primary goal had always been locking up the bad guys, Mr. Cummings told agents that could actually put the country at risk. Instead of bringing a prosecution, the primary goal should be gathering intelligence to penetrate terrorist organizations and prevent future plots.When an agent would say he wanted to take down a suspect, Mr. Cummings would tell the agent: “So you’re telling me you’ve done your job, you know everything there is to know about him, his organization, everything around him, all his travel, all his friends, and all family members? He’s not a viable source, and he’s not producing any productive intelligence whatsoever?”Often there would be silence.Mr. Cummings would say to the agent, “This is a deliberate judgment you have to make. Your objective is not to make the arrest. Your objective is to make that suspect our collection platform. That guy now is going to tell us just how big and broad the threat might be. He now becomes a means to collection, instead of the target of collection. I want you to understand his entire universe.”Then Mr. Cummings would tell the agent, “If he’s not a viable source, and his intelligence isn’t productive, then knock yourself out and use your law enforcement powers to make that arrest.”This new approach, along with other proactive measures and a stream of tips from the CIA and National Security Agency, has paid off. While attacks that are inspired by ISIS or al Qaeda have taken place, no foreign terrorist network has successfully orchestrated an attack in the United States since Sept. 11._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"RONALD KESSLER: The secret to fighting terrorism - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Ronald Kessler offers the secret to fighting #terrorism https://t.co/VzM0s4RsxA #ISIS #IslamicState https://t.co/iZcBDMmmTU","date":"Tue Mar 29 00:57:48 +0000 2016","favs":4,"id":{"$numberLong":"714617518976057344"},"retweets":10},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/ronald-kessler-the-secret-to-fighting-terrorism/#.VvnSPC3cpkw.twitter"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f38"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**President Obama opened the annual Easter Egg Roll at the White House this year by saying it was a bittersweet moment: It would be his last time hosting it.The term “Easter egg” is also used to indicate little surprises hidden on a website or DVD menu. Of course, those surprises are pleasant and intended to be found. As the Obama administration approaches the end of its term, however, we can expect a different type of surprise — and certainly not the friendly kind.I’m referring to federal regulations, which have been growing at an alarming rate. The 2015 “Red Tape Rising” report from the Heritage Foundation (the 2016 one will be out soon) found that 27 new major rules were added in 2014, for a total of 184 over the first six years of the Obama administration. The cost, as estimated by the regulators themselves: $80 billion annually. (And that’s not even the full amount.)Who pays that cost? You and me. It’s passed on to all of us, even non-taxpayers, in the form of higher prices for everything.But for now, let’s consider a bigger question: Why do federal agencies have so much power to begin with? In simplest terms, it’s Congress’ fault. The lawmakers you elect to make law have gotten into the habit of passing remarkably vague legislation.The law your senator or representative votes for to do Good Thing X is often full of blanks. Somebody has to fill in those blanks — to specify all the details about how X will be accomplished. Increasingly, that somebody is not a man or woman who’s directly answerable to you, but someone you’ll never meet. Someone who can’t be voted out of office for failing to look after your interests.The situation is exacerbated by something known as the Chevron Doctrine, which evolved out of a Supreme Court case in the 1980s. It boils down to this: When a federal court is interpreting an ambiguous federal law, it should defer to the agency that enforces it when deciding what the law means.So if, for example, the Environmental Protection Agency says some pollution-prevention law should be interpreted a certain way, the court will — unless there’s some compelling reason to rule otherwise — let the EPA’s reading of the law stand.Rep. Tom Marino, Pennsylvania Republican, recently provided an example of how things can go awry under the Chevron Doctrine. Noting the presence of a small stream by several farms near his home, he said the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers tried to push through a rule stating that because a farm sometimes has some standing water after a rainstorm, the Navigable Waters Act gives the EPA control over that farm.“I’ve been living out where I live for 15 years, and I have yet to see a ship go through that little stream that goes past my house,” Mr. Marino said.Now, by and large, Congress likes the Chevron Doctrine. It makes the job of legislating easier, obviously. No need to sweat the details — let bureaucrats do that. The executive branch likes it, too: When a rule is challenged in court or elsewhere, an administration can point to the Chevron Doctrine.But We the People shouldn’t like it. As Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah has put it: “You don’t trust [the power to legislate] to other people. As hard-working, well-intentioned, well-educated and highly specialized as they might be, the men and women who work within our executive branch agencies don’t work for you. You cannot fire them, almost regardless of what they do. You have no opportunity to review their work at regular intervals. And that is a recipe for tyranny.”He’s right. Our system of government relies on checks and balances. Under the Chevron Doctrine, things have become remarkably unbalanced. For the sake of our freedoms, it’s time to recalibrate.**• **_Ed Feulner is the founder of the Heritage Foundation (heritage.org)._\n\n","title":"ED FEULNER: Rule by bureaucrat - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Ed Feulner on rule by bureaucrat https://t.co/paITIdr4Sn #rulers #Politics https://t.co/8O3syFyn24","date":"Tue Mar 29 00:55:58 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"714617057497784320"},"retweets":2},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/ed-feulner-rule-by-bureaucrat/#.VvnR6PgaGWE.twitter"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f39"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Are the increasing incidents of terrorist attacks in Europe the “new normal”? Must Europeans and Americans become resigned to the inevitability of regular jihadi assaults? Must we endure more meaningless bromides about not “overreacting” because we might offend the world’s 1.6 billion Muslims, playing into the hands of terrorists who promote the notion that the “Christian” West is at war with Islam?Following the Brussels bombings, Belgian Justice Minister Koen Geens noted his country has a law banning police raids on private homes between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. This is not a joke. Authorities think the mastermind behind last November’s terrorist attack in Paris, which killed 130 people, might have been holed up for at least two nights in Brussels and could have escaped because of this indefensible law.The jihadis have no laws controlling their behavior.It is the same with America’s “rules of engagement” in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. Does our restraint hold back the killers? Do we get points from extremists for trying not to kill women and children, when they make no distinction about age or gender while carrying out their heinous acts? Are we converting any of them to our way of life? Hardly. It is more likely they are encouraged by what they regard as our weakness.Osama bin Laden revealed what he and many radical Muslims believe about American weakness in a 1998 interview with John Miller of ABC News: “We have seen in the last decade the decline of the American government and the weakness of the American soldier who is ready to wage cold wars and unprepared to fight long wars. This was proven in Beirut when the Marines fled after two explosions. It also proves they can run in less than 24 hours, and this was also repeated in Somalia.”He added that jihad is a “form of worship” and “We do not worry about Americans’ opinion, or the fact they place a price on our heads. As Muslims, we believe our fate is set. Even if the whole world decides to get together and kill us before our time has come, we will not die.”This week in the Washington, D.C., suburb of Lanham, Md., President Obama and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are expected to open the largest American mosque in the world. According to the mosque’s website, the $100 million Turkish-American Culture and Civilization Center “was built with Turkish funding under the supervision of the Turkish religious foundation (Diyanet).”In Northern Virginia there is also a large mosque named Dar al-Hijrah, which some have accused of serving as a Hamas front. It was the home of the terrorist spiritual leader Anwar al-Awlaki, who was accused of mentoring two of the Sept. 11 hijackers.What a perfect setup for a jihadi pincer movement on the nation’s capital from Maryland and Virginia.Also worth remembering is a statement by Turkish President Erdogan: “There is no moderate or immoderate Islam. Islam is Islam and that’s it.” Why would we not take seriously statements by bin Laden and Mr. Erdogan? Denying symptoms and refusing to see a doctor does not make an ailment disappear. Neither does denying the terrorist threat diminish the threat.Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair wrote this following the attacks in Brussels: “We are at war with Islamist extremism. We need a different rhythm of thought in respect of it; preparing for a conflict that is longer than anything we have seen in modern times.”There is still time for the United States to turn things around, less so in Europe. But we had better be serious about our efforts and respond as we have to other threats in the past. History and current events prove jihadists are serious.**• **_Cal Thomas is a nationally syndicated columnist.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f3a"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Beltway pundits spend almost all their time warning that the Republican Party is about to implode as the fight for its presidential nomination exposes rifts within the party that they believe or in some cases, hope, will make it impossible for the eventual nominee to win in November. Republicans acknowledge the difficulties they face as their nomination race heats up, party regulars begin to distance themselves from Donald Trump and either declare they won’t vote for him if he’s nominated or rally to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as the lesser of two evils.But the Democrats have their own problems. Hillary Clinton will almost certainly win the Democratic nomination because her friends within her party’s establishment rigged the rules to guarantee her coronation. Republican outsiders speak with disdain about their party’s leaders, but the Republican establishment’s ability to control the outcome of a Republican nomination fight pales in contrast to the leverage establishment Democrats have within their party. This becomes more evident by the day as Mrs. Clinton’s challenger wins state after state and falls further behind as the party’s “super delegates” line up behind her.When outsiders begin to believe the insiders have rigged the game they tend to revolt, and that’s happening within both parties. Trump and Cruz supporters within the Republican Party are threatening to walk away if their favorites are deprived of the nomination in Cleveland by insiders who manipulate the rules in favor of one of their own. Insiders never really appreciate the outrage of those who play by the rules, see themselves on the verge of winning, and find the rules changed on them at the last minute. If insiders within the Republican Party had any grasp of this, they wouldn’t be on television bragging that it will be them — rather than those who attended the caucuses and stood in line to vote for their favorites in the early primaries — who will choose whoever they want when they get to Cleveland.The same thing is happening within the Democratic Party. As Vermont’s Bernie Sanders demonstrates that he can win caucuses and primaries alike, his true believers are beginning to realize they are not playing on a level field with Mrs. Clinton’s forces, and that realization is growing day by day.Both parties within a two-party system are of necessity coalitions of voters who party leaders hope agree more than they disagree, but who at least see their party as somehow superior to the other. The coalition frays and eventually breaks down when large numbers of voters begin to feel either that there isn’t much operational difference between their party and the other or conclude that their party’s leaders are interested in their votes but not their opinions. To suggest that large numbers of voters in both the Republican and Democratic parties are reaching these twin conclusions is an understatement.Republicans who believe it doesn’t matter which party controls Congress and even the White House have been visible for some time. They are the ones who regard Republican officeholders who can’t or won’t do what they promised once elected as no better than the Democrats they beat and refer to them dismissively as “RINOS” or “Republicans in Name Only.” These are the Republican voters that the party establishment loathes but whose votes are essential on Election Day.What the pundits are only lately beginning to realize, however, is that the Democratic Party is facing essentially the same problem. Many of those who have deserted Mrs. Clinton to be a part of the Sanders “revolution” are beginning to believe that Mrs. Clinton and the establishment of their party isn’t any better than the Republicans they are supposed to be ready to defeat in November. They are beginning, in fact, to talk about either finding a more “progressive” independent candidate to back should she win, or sitting this one out. They are also beginning to talk about “DINOS” or “Democrats in name Only.”The true believers in both parties are wrong. It does make a difference who wins in this country and while the dynamics of a two-party system may make it difficult for the leadership of either party to do everything the true believers want, they would in most cases do so if they could. Disgruntled Cruz, Trump and Sanders voters may agree on very little, but they are all reacting in the same way to being told to sit down and shut up by party leaders who are, in fact, much more interested in their votes than their opinions.**• **_David A.

His landmark breakthrough album, “Surfing With the Alien,”\nremains the gold standard in instrumental rock and served as a guidebook to\nlegions of wannabe ax-slingers that followed.A few years back Mr. Satriani\nteamed up with Sammy Hagar, Michael Anthony (both of Van Halen) and Chad Smith\n(Red Hot Chili Peppers) to form Chickenfoot, but news on the street on the\nsupergroup has been quiet of late.The still-young year sees Mr. Satriani\ntouring with a show that looks back at his 30 years of sonic stunts and guitar\ndaredevilry.

Every once in a while the feeling you get from a promoter is that your\nfans are really hungry for as much of you as they can get. That brings up the\nwhole concept of “An Evening With…” concert where you don’t have an opener.\nYou put in an intermission and you can give the fans more songs from your\ncatalog than they would ever get in any other concert setting.It’s really a\nlot of fun. It’s a lot of guitar playing. My hands feel it. Artistically, when\nyou walk off stage, you really feel like you gave the audience everything.**Q:\nHow many songs do you play in the show?****A:** We have got to fit the whole\nevening into three hours because of curfews at venues. We’re playing anywhere\nfrom 20 to 25 songs.**Q: How many guitars do you take with you on the\nroad?****A:** The least amount I’ve ever done is three. For this “Evening\nWith…” tour? Definitely six. Maybe more. The thing that really determines the\namount of instruments is tuning — if you wind up having a lot of songs that\nneed different tunings. On this run I am playing more guitars with standard\ntuning. Not too bad this time.**Q: Are there any songs in there you haven’t\nplayed in years?****A: **Yes, absolutely. It’s funny that the tour is called\n“From Surfing to Shockwave” because we are going back even one more record\nbefore “Surfing With the Alien” to the first full-length record I put out\ncalled “Not of This Earth.” We are playing the title track.I decided to put\n“If I Could Fly,” which has had a storied history, back in the set. It’s nice\nto sort of reclaim it.**Q: When did you first start playing guitar, and why\nthe guitar over any other instrument?****A:** I was the youngest of five kids.\nBorn in ‘56. I watched my older siblings go through all the music of the ‘60s.\nWhen they all moved out of the house, I inherited all the singles and all the\nLPs.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f3c"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:****ANALYSIS/OPINION:****ANALYSIS/OPINION: **If you believe Cassandra and other doom-criers, this may be remembered as the year they gave an election and nobody came. The Republican Party’s skepticism of Donald Trump is exceeded only by the Democrats’ growing terror at the prospect of campaigning with Hillary Clinton. It looks like a bipartisan meltdown.But appearances, as they often do, only deceive.Preparations for November will proceed, the easily frightened in both parties will calm their hysteria, and you hardly need odds to bet that we’ll elect a new president on Nov. 8 and the republic will survive whomever the people choose.But both Hillary and the Donald will inflict a lot of bruises before then, and the election, as it always does in a nation evenly divided between conservative and liberal, Democrat and Republican and this year between male and female, could go either way. That’s the nature of a divided beast.Nearly all the media ink and gasbaggery has been spent so far to lament the rise of Donald Trump, speculating that he will lay waste to Republican fortunes for at least a century, and this obscures the cloud, already considerably larger than a man’s hand, hovering ever closer over the Lady MacBeth of Little Rock, Washington, Gotham and points between. She’s a woman in trouble, and not in a family way.She’s counting on a big turnout from voters too young to remember who, exactly, she was and is, but a Fox News poll finds that 67 percent of voters 35 and under have an unfavorable view of her and of what kind of president she would likely make. When pollsters asked these younger voters whether they were “enthusiastic,” “pleased,” “displeased,” or “scared of her,” 29 percent say they’re “scared.” Only 6 percent say they’re enthusiastic. (Counting both sides of her family, they alone might be enough to make up 6 percent.)Bernie Sanders is still the long-shot candidate to deprive her of the Democratic nomination, but he clearly has the lady spooked. He wants another debate with her in advance of the New York primary on April 19, and she sounds too frightened to agree to it. A top Hillary aide says Bernie will have to change his “tone” to get even consideration of another debate.“This is a man who said he could never run a negative ad ever,” Joel Benenson, who admits that he’s the chief Clinton strategist, told CNN News. “He’s running them now. They’re planning to run more. Let’s see the tone of the campaign he wants to run before we get to any other questions.”It’s tough to be the inevitable nominee and then a fortnight later to be the frightened front-runner, startled by shadows and flinching at the creaking sounds of ghosts in the attic. Bernie Sanders boasts that he has the momentum, coming off three overwhelming victories in the West, as the campaign moves past the halfway mark in the endless schedule of primaries and caucuses. Who can doubt him?The Sanders triumphs in the West were not unexpected, and they were triumphs in out of the way places, but they were impressive nonetheless for his margins — winning 73 percent in Washington state, 70 percent in Hawaii and 82 percent in Alaska. Those are landslide numbers any time and anywhere, and together with other late results they tell Hillary loud and clear that nobody likes her very much, just as a lot of Republicans don’t seem to like the Donald very much.Mr. Sanders, who is trying to get sharp with Hillary now, may regret playing the patsy in the earlier primaries, saying most of all that he was tired of hearing questions about Hillary’s “damn emails” and putting beyond polite Democratic discussion the speculation about a criminal indictment of her. An indictment is, in fact, highly unlikely. When a president tells his Justice Department to jump, the only acceptable answer is, “how high?”But the party elders understand how a beating like Hillary is beginning to take can damage a candidate, particularly a candidate trained to expect a cakewalk, for the real campaign of summer and fall. Donald Trump, if he is in fact the Republican candidate, does not do the patsy, even for a gentle lady hotly pursued by the FBI.The next big tests for both Hillary and the Donald lie dead ahead next week in Wisconsin. If Hillary wins she can halt “the bern” moving toward New York. If Bernie wins, the momentum takes him to New York where a victory would scramble the arithmetic good and proper. Joe Biden would be entitled to regrets for not getting in when the getting was good, and wondering whether there’s still one last chance. Hillary should remember Satchel Paige’s famous warning: “Don’t look back. Something might be gaining on you.”**• **_Wesley Pruden is editor in chief emeritus of The Times._\n\n","title":"WESLEY PRUDEN: Bernie Sanders gaining on Hillary Clinton - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Wesley Pruden on the dark menace gaining on #HillaryClinton https://t.co/JICHujgWyg #Election2016 #Biden https://t.co/c6L4LaPiI4","date":"Tue Mar 29 00:47:06 +0000 2016","favs":4,"id":{"$numberLong":"714614828933988352"},"retweets":5},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/wesley-pruden-donald-trump-gaining-on-hillary-clin/#.VvnP_bwrUYE.twitter"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f3d"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Baseball requires brains as well as brawn, and the tango is erotic without vulgarity. The president of the United States, whoever he is, is entitled to indulge both. Only a churl would begrudge Democrat or Republican enjoying a season behind the third base line or a season on the dance floor with a beautiful woman in his arms. But everything has its rightful season.Fear and loathing is in season, too, as Europe and indeed the civilized world stands in fear and trembling in the wake of the latest violence by radical Islamic terrorists, this time in Belgium and Pakistan. Even as the blood was cleaned from the walls of the waiting room at the Brussels airport, the president was “doing the wave” with Raul Castro at a baseball game in Havana, and departing soon after for Argentina and a lesson in the art of the tango. All the while, horror grows on both sides of the Atlantic.There’s never a scarcity of outrage. By reliable accounts, ISIS carried through with a threat on Good Friday to crucify a Roman Catholic priest it had kidnapped in Yemen, mocking both the priest and Christians everywhere on the holiest of Christian holidays. The Taliban, allies of ISIS, killed 60 persons in Pakistan in another radical Islamic affront to decency.The president makes brief statements about the depth of the tragedy and his intention to make the destruction of the terrorist network his highest priority in policymaking. The empty ritual is familiar now, and impresses no one. His insistence that the terrorist threat is not “existential” to U.S. security belies a lack of seriousness. The president’s insistence that the terrorists are on the run is obviously wishful thinking. The attacks continue, numbering now more 175 across the globe, along with the growing amalgamation of terrorist groups in Africa and Asia.The president’s partisans argue that the aim of the terrorists is to disrupt lives and purposeful routines — to lend importance to their acts of violence would accomplish just that. American life has, indeed, not been much affected by these terrorist episodes. Not yet. Life does go on, but each attack further erodes the lives of all. The administration argues that closer attention to atrocity would create a hysteria that would focus prejudice and violence against the Muslim minority in America. The restraint of the Christian nation is remarkable, and the accusation of “Islamophobia” against efforts to identify the origins of radical Islamic terrorism only paralyzes the needed effort to eliminate it.If the poison of radical Islam is to be eliminated, the Muslims themselves, in the Middle East and elsewhere, must do more to pursue the terrorists. The Saudis finance hundreds of mosques in the United States and the West that tolerate and encourage religious hatred and violence. Qatar is a chief sponsor of the Muslim Brotherhood, the source of much Muslim misery. Many good and peaceful Muslims who are eager to eliminate the terrorists in their midst — radical Islam has killed far more Muslims than Christians and Jews — will be grateful for effective help from the West.The president’s doing the wave and dancing the tango are largely irrelevant to the struggle against radical Islamic terrorism (which the president cannot bring himself to call by its rightful name), but gestures are important.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f3e"},"content":"Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton urged her supporters to demand\nthat the Senate approve President Obama’s Supreme Court pick — even though she\nherself seemed to undercut Judge Merrick Garland, saying she wanted justices\nwith more varied “life experience” than what he brings to the bench.Mrs.\nClinton said she wouldn’t second-guess Mr. Obama’s decision to pick Judge\nGarland to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia,\nbut added that if she were in the Oval Office she would search for nominees in\nthe mold of Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Mrs. Clinton said Justice Sotomayor’s\nHispanic heritage and underprivileged upbringing brought needed perspectives\nto the high court.Mrs. Clinton also said she would impose litmus tests on\nabortion and campaign finance. Her nominees, she said, would have to prove\nthat they would uphold the Roe v. Wade decision establishing a national right\nto abortion and would have to show that they would overturn the Citizens\nUnited decision that established free speech campaign rights for interest\ngroups.“I would not appoint someone who didn’t think Roe v. Wade is settled\nlaw,” Mrs. Clinton said while campaigning in Madison, Wisconsin, where the\nnext primary is slated for next week.Mrs. Clinton mixed her own call to inject\nmore civility into the judicial selection process with combative rhetoric.She\nspecifically called out two Republicans, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and\nSen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Both\nhave joined the vast majority of their Republican colleagues in saying\nScalia’s seat should be filled by the next president, after voters have a say\nat the polls.“You know, we chose a president. We chose him twice. And now\nRepublicans in the Senate are acting like our votes didn’t count and President\nObama is not still the nation’s leader,” she said. “Today, I’m adding my voice\nto the chorus asking Sen. Grassley to step up and do his job. He should hold a\nhearing, and he should schedule it as soon as the Senate returns from\nrecess.”Republicans counter that they scored huge victories in the 2014\nmidterm congressional elections, with voters signaling that they wanted a\ncheck on Mr. Obama. Senate Republicans say the president has the power to\nnominate, but it’s the Senate’s choice whether to act.Mr. Grassley, in a\nstatement Monday, said Mrs. Clinton’s attack on him was a campaign ploy to try\nto divert attention away from her secret email account during her four years\nas secretary of state. Both Mr. Grassley and Mr. Johnson have been\ninvestigating her emails.Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short\nsaid Mrs. Clinton’s attacks were odd because she herself took part in\nfilibustering President George W. Bush’s judicial picks, including an\nattempted blockade on Samuel A. Alito Jr.“The only reason Hillary Clinton is\ncalling on Republicans to breach decades of bipartisan precedent of not\nconfirming election-year Supreme Court nominees is so she could have a liberal\nmajority on the court to help her carry on President Obama’s legacy of\nexecutive overreach if elected,” Mr. Short said.Mrs. Clinton and her fellow\nDemocrats appear to be getting the better of Republicans in the debate, though\nthe matter is not settled among the public.A Pew Research Center poll released\nMonday found that 46 percent of Americans surveyed wanted Judge Garland\nconfirmed to the Supreme Court, while 30 percent opposed him. The rest had no\nopinion about the matter.Democrats have predicted that Republicans will cave\nto public pressure and confirm Judge Garland, but just a few Senate\nRepublicans have dissented from their leadership’s blockade.Mrs. Clinton said\nopposition to Judge Garland is born of the same fire that is spurring the\ninsurgent campaign of Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, who\nbefore the 2012 election challenged Mr. Obama’s citizenship._Story Continues\n→_\n\n","title":"Hillary Clinton would impose abortion, campaign finance litmus tests on Supreme Court nominees - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#HillaryClinton would impose #abortion, #CampaignFinance litmus tests on #SupremeCourt nominees: https://t.co/09Znm1Cfvp","date":"Tue Mar 29 00:13:07 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"714606275963797504"},"retweets":14},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/hillary-clinton-would-impose-abortion-campaign-fin/"}

Walther, vice president of communications\nfor the Knights of Columbus, which has warned of a “genocide” targeting\nChristian communities in the Islamic world, said the slaughter of adults and\nchildren during the Easter celebration “highlights that Christians, especially\nin countries where they are a small minority, are often targeted.”“And, as a\nwhole, Christians are the most persecuted religious group in today’s world,”\nsaid Mr. Walther, citing a recent Pew Research Center study examining violence\ntargeting religious groups.The White House and State Department came under\nfire Monday for failing to mention in statements condemning the Pakistan\nviolence that the victims gathered at the park in Lahore, Pakistan, were\nsingled out for their Christian faith, drawing a fresh round of\ncriticism.“This was a very targeted attack of a known Christian population,\nand of course it was Easter Sunday,” said Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of\nAmerican Center for Law and Justice, which operates an office in Lahore.“I’m\nvery disappointed that the State Department not only did not call it Islamic\njihadism, but would not acknowledge that this was a targeted attack against\nChristians, which the perpetrators have acknowledged,” Mr. Sekulow said. “I\nthink we’ve got to start saying exactly what this is.”In Pakistan the army\nlaunched raids Monday and rounded up suspects in Lahore and other major cities\nin the Punjab province, including Faisalabad and Multan. An army spokesman\nsaid on Twitter that a number of suspected “terrorists and facilitators” were\narrested, and that a “huge cache of arms and ammunition” was\nrecovered.“Terrorists cannot dent our resolve. Our struggle will continue\nuntil the complete elimination of the menace of terrorism,” said Pakistani\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif in an emotional televised address.While the attack\nwas aimed at members of Pakistan’s tiny Christian minority, who make up just\n1.6 percent of the population, a large number of the victims were Muslim,\naccording to Pakistani authorities.Pope Francis, who has championed Christians\nin the Middle East and elsewhere persecuted by Islamic extremists, denounced\nthe attack Monday as a “cowardly and senseless crime” and called on\nauthorities to protect “in particular, the most vulnerable religious\nminorities.”“Easter Sunday was bloodied by an abominable attack that massacred\nso many innocent people, for the most part families of the Christian minority,\nespecially women and children, gathered in a public park to joyfully pass the\nEaster holiday,” the pope told those gathered in St. Peter’s Square.The Obama\nadministration’s reluctance to condemn specifically the targeting of Pakistani\nChristians comes a week after Secretary of State John F. Kerry drew cheers\nfrom religious liberty groups by declaring that Islamic State, also known as\nISIS and ISIL, “is responsible for genocide against groups in areas under its\ncontrol, including Yazidis, Christians and Shia Muslims.”In a statement\nMonday, however, State Department spokesman John Kirby condemned the\n“appalling attack” that “targeted innocent civilians in the Gulshan-e-Iqbal\nPark,” but failed to mention the connection between the attack by Islamic\nextremists and Easter celebrations.Former Republican presidential candidate\nBen Carson said Monday he was dumbfounded by the omission._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"War on Christianity feared as radical Islamists warn of more attacks - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Global war on #Christianity feared as radical Islamists warn of more attacks: https://t.co/kLP5Avo3gJ","date":"Tue Mar 29 00:12:15 +0000 2016","favs":14,"id":{"$numberLong":"714606056241020929"},"retweets":27},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/war-on-christianity-feared-as-radical-islamists-wa/"}

The latest to\njoin the offensive is Florida; GOP Gov. Rick Scott signed a bill Friday that\nbars Planned Parenthood from accessing state funds.Defunding has been blocked\nby court action in some states. But cutbacks in other states are forcing\nPlanned Parenthood to drop contraceptive services, health screenings and other\nprograms serving thousands of low-income women.“It’s been a non-stop assault —\nwith devastating consequences for the patients we serve,” said Dawn Laguens,\nPlanned Parenthood’s executive vice president. “At what point do you hit a\ntipping point where it has same impact as if a federal bill had\npassed?”Planned Parenthood is a national target because of its role as the\nlargest U.S. abortion provider. Federal law and the laws of most states\nalready prevent public money from paying for abortions except in rare\ncircumstances, but the recent defunding bills prohibit state money for any\nservices by an organization that also provides abortions.During debate in\nFlorida, state Sen. Aaron Bean offered this rationale: “We pay their light\nbill, we pay their salaries, we pay all kinds of things when the state\ncontracts with these clinics… Let’s get Florida out of the abortion\nbusiness.”Many of the measures surfaced after anti-abortion activists began\nreleasing secretly recorded videos last July alleging that Planned Parenthood\nsold fetal tissue to researchers for a profit in violation of federal law.\nPlanned Parenthood denied any wrongdoing, and investigations by several\ncongressional panels and states have produced no evidence that it acted\nillegally.Despite that, some Republican governors and lawmakers have cited the\nvideos as justification for defunding.States where defunding has been blocked\nby litigation include Alabama, Louisiana and Utah. In some other states, the\nimpact of defunding may be slight - Mississippi, for example, is pursuing that\nstep even though Planned Parenthood received less than $1,000 in state money\nin each of the past five years.However, Planned Parenthood says the cuts have\nhad tangible impact in several states. It cites Indiana, saying funding cuts\nled to closure of a Planned Parenthood clinic that was the only HIV testing\ncenter in Scott County - the subsequent site of an HIV epidemic.A look at some\nother states where defunding has had an impact:___TEXASTexas was one of the\nfirst states to target Planned Parenthood’s funding, saying it would not send\nMedicaid funds to organizations that provided abortions. The Republican-led\nstate government culminated a multiyear effort by ousting Planned Parenthood\nfrom the Texas Women’s Health Program in 2013 and opting to fund the program\nentirely with state money so it would not run afoul of federal law.Dr. Paul\nFine, medical director of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast, said the move\naffected health screenings and contraceptive services for more than 13,000\nlow-income women, many of them in areas with limited health care\nalternatives._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"State-by-state strategy wielded to defund Planned Parenthood - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#PlannedParenthood target of state-by-state strategy to defund.\nhttps://t.co/b70VcpBBNa https://t.co/dGCYnmuTnE","date":"Tue Mar 29 00:06:53 +0000 2016","favs":7,"id":{"$numberLong":"714604707361202176"},"retweets":6},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/state-by-state-strategy-wielded-to-defund-planned-/"}

Mr. Obama said this “splintering”\ncreates a “different world with different facts” for viewers of Fox News,\ncompared with readers of the New York Times.But Mike Gonzalez, a former Wall\nStreet Journal and wire-service reporter, said the president’s criticism stems\nlargely from liberals having lost their monopoly on the news media.“The left\njust cannot get over the fact that the media has become democratized, that the\nmedia’s no longer controlled by liberals,” said Mr. Gonzalez, a senior fellow\nat the conservative Heritage Foundation. “They used to have a lock on it. They\nstill have academia, they still have Hollywood, but they have lost the control\nthey had on the media. And that has driven them nuts — berserk.”** SEE ALSO:\nClinton would impose campaign finance, abortion litmus tests on court nominees\n**Jens David Ohlin, an associate dean at the Cornell Law School, said the new\nmedia environment “has been difficult for Obama.”“I don’t know whether that\nsomething in particular about Obama, or whether it’s just the new dynamic we\nhave between the press and the president,” Mr. Ohlin said. “When we elect the\nnext Republican president, it will be interesting to see whether that same\ndynamic plays in reverse.”Mr. Ohlin said he agrees with the president that the\nmedia “has become a lot more polarized.”“People go to a particular [news]\nsource to confirm their views, rather than challenge their views,” he said.\n“That has a feedback loop, so our politics also are becoming increasingly\npolarized. I certainly think that’s affected the presidential race. I just\ndon’t think the Republican race would have played out the way it did without\nthat kind of polarized media environment. There’s a sense, I think, that\njournalism ought to be making people less committed to their ideas, rather\nthan more committed to their ideas.”The popularity of Fox News and other\nconservative news outlets, and the explosion of social media in the last\ndecade, has presented the White House with a far different landscape than the\nera of three major television networks and a handful of national\nnewspapers.Mr. Obama has said the fragmentation makes it more difficult for a\npresident to govern, with the public divided rigidly on issues ranging from\nnational security to climate change policy to the confirmation of a Supreme\nCourt nominee.Few developments have cut into Mr. Obama’s job approval rating\nmore in the past year than terrorist attacks, such as the massacres in Paris,\nBrussels and San Bernardino, California. After the Paris attacks last\nNovember, the president expressed concern that the media coverage was\noverblown, saying “the media needs to help” because “how we report on this has\nto maintain perspective.”He warned that heavy news coverage of the attacks\ncould boost the Islamic State “or elevate them in a way that makes it easier\nfor them to recruit or make them stronger.”Studies of news coverage have shown\nthat Mr. Obama has received relatively favorable treatment from the media,\nperhaps more so when he was campaigning for the presidency in 2008 and during\nhis first term. A Pew Research Center study of the 2008 general election found\nthat Mr. Obama’s media coverage was “somewhat more positive than negative, but\nnot markedly so,” while media coverage of Sen. John McCain, the GOP nominee,\nwas “heavily unfavorable” and became more unfavorable as the campaign went\non._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Obama pans 'splintered' media - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#Obama pans ‘splintered’ #media https://t.co/8L0qvn9xpb","date":"Tue Mar 29 00:01:12 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714603275203555328"},"retweets":4},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/obama-pans-splintered-media/#.VvnFugVTO0E.twitter"}

Mrs. Clinton’s talking\npoints bristle with such words as “fairness” and “justice” — with a few\njiggers of “progressive” thrown in for good measure. Her efforts are as\nrelentless as her 2008 bid for president — which was supposed to be her year\nto win. But some say she was running for the nation’s top office almost a\nquarter-century ago.“The first time Hillary Clinton ran for president was, in\nfact, 1992. Long before Claire and Frank Underwood conspired to form a\nconjugal presidential ticket on ‘House of Cards’, Hillary and Bill Clinton\nwere test-driving a real-life co-presidency on the campaign trail, the\nculmination of a 20-year political partnership. Governor Clinton boasted that\nby voting for him, you could ‘buy one, get one free’,” writes **Sean\nBraswell**, a senior writer for OZY, a news and opinion site.“The Clinton\ncampaign had devised what they called a ‘slow build for Hillary‘ in 1992, a\ngradual insertion of the Arkansas first lady into the spotlight — and into\nwhat they hoped would be the hearts of millions of Americans. That approach\nwent out the window in late January when, weeks before the critical New\nHampshire primary, a former cabaret singer named **Gennifer Flowers** came\nforward with allegations of an extramarital affair with the governor,” Mr.\nBraswell notes, recounting the further complications which were to follow,\nalong with a prediction from Mrs. Clinton herself: “We’ll have a woman\npresident by 2010.”**‘DISTINCT SHADES OF HILLARY’**Hollywood’s creative teams\nhave not forgotten the aforementioned Mrs. Clinton’s role as wife-of-steel and\ncomponent of a famous power couple, apparently.

The\nfederal government covers most of the costs of the expansion.Yet in many\nstates Republicans say their Medicaid programs are already bloated, and that\npiling on new enrollees will bust their budgets down the road. They also don’t\ntrust Washington to hold up its end of the funding.On Capitol Hill GOP leaders\nwant to scrap Obamacare, period, and start over with “market-oriented”\nreforms, rendering the expansion debate moot.Countering those arguments, HHS\nhighlighted Republican-led states they said could benefit from expansion.For\ninstance, nearly a quarter of Texans whose incomes would qualify them for\nMedicaid post-expansion suffer from mental illness or a substance abuse\ndisorder, according to the study. The proportion is even higher in Florida, at\n27.7 percent, HHS said.The study said 16.4 percent of insured people with\nsubstance abuse or behavioral problems sought treatment during 2010-2014 in\nstates that haven’t expanded Medicaid, compared to 11.5 percent of similarly\nsituated, yet uninsured, persons in those states.The timing of the report\ncoincides with efforts on Capitol Hill to address the opioid and heroin\nepidemic that is ravaging the country and forge bipartisan mental health\nreforms despite election-year politics that are otherwise splintering\nCongress.“As we talk to states, both on the Republican side and Democratic\nside, behavioral health inevitably comes up as a topic of discussion,” said\nMr. Frank, adding the talks are fueled in part by the opioid crisis.“We\nthought it was a good time to inject some new facts into that discussion,” he\nsaid.\n\n","title":"HHS says Medicaid expansion will combat opioid crisis, mental illness - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"HHS says #Medicaid expansion will combat #mentalillness and #opioidepidemic. #opioid #MedicaidIntegrity\n\nhttps://t.co/uIAv3S1pmn","date":"Mon Mar 28 22:31:26 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714580685797908480"},"retweets":2},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/hhs-medicaid-expansion-will-combat-opioid-crisis/"}

The exact date of the inaugural festivities is\nunknown, but Mr. Kelly says it started soon after the zoo opened in\n1889.Thousands of children with their families enjoyed a brisk spring day at\nthe National Zoo on Monday, taking in views of exotic animals and taking part\nin traditional holiday activities.George Lambert, president of the Greater\nWashington Urban League, said the origins of the zoo’s Easter program are\nrooted in segregation.** SEE ALSO: D.C. is worst place for doctors to\npractice: WalletHub **It became a “pseudo-holiday for black domestic workers\nwho had to work on Easter Sunday and were banned from attending the\ntraditional White House Easter Egg Roll because of segregation,” Mr. Lambert\nwrote in a 2014 letter to The Washington Post.Segregation of the White House\nEaster festivities ended in the 1950s under President Dwight D. Eisenhower,\nbut the event at the zoo has remained a mainstay, with about 20,000 people\nattending each year.Gloria Knight, Emory’s grandmother, traveled from\nSouthampton, Virginia — a four-hour drive — so that her two grandchildren\ncould enjoy the Easter events.“We started out at 4 a.m., and I made her take\nthe ride with me,” Ms. Knight said, pointing to her friend Trisha Conley, who\nwas taking pictures of Emory and his 9-year-old sister, Nevaeh Green.Ms.\nConley said that since her grandchildren had the week off for spring break,\nshe thought it would be a good idea to take them up to the District for a few\ndays — and the first stop was the famed Easter egg hunt at the zoo.Joy Cato\nbrought her 3-year-old son, Silas, to the Easter events for the first time\nthis year.“We came for the Easter egg hunt, but he’s more interested in the\nmusic,” Ms. Cato said as Silas danced around to a jazz band that was set up on\na small stage next to the egg hunt pen. “We’ll definitely be coming back next\nyear.”The annual event hasn’t gone without controversy. In 2014, two teenage\nboys were shot on Easter Monday, just an hour after the family events had\nended and visitors were leaving the zoo.At the time, some residents called for\nan end to the festivities, but zoo officials decided to take measures to\nincrease security.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f47"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Bats, balls and gloves.Caps, pine tar and resin.Bubblegum, sunflower seeds and smokeless tobacco.They are Major League Baseball’s starting lineup, nine ubiquitous elements of the nation’s pastime at the highest level.However, we subtract the last, toxic ingredient when the focus is minor league, college, high school or youth baseball. The disgusting and debilitating habit of chaws and dips is reserved exclusively for “The Show,” giving young players an additional aspiration to reach the big leagues and emulate their role models.  \nNo one except tobacco executives wants to hook new customers, but you can be a\nhealth advocate and still be concerned about lawmakers’ motivation to prohibit\nthe substance.Chicago’s city council is set to vote this week on a measure\nthat bans the use of smokeless tobacco in big-league ballparks and other\nsports venues. Similar legislation has been passed in Boston, San Francisco\nand Los Angles; New York mayor Bill de Blasio says he will sign a ban passed\nlast week by city legislators. Oakland, Anaheim and San Diego are set to join\nthe number in 2017 when a new California law takes effect.“It’s very important\nfor the health of our players, and for the city as a whole,” de Blasio said\nSunday on ESPN’s “Outside the Lines.” “Young people look up to baseball\nplayers, and they look up to all athletes, and we want to protect everyone’s\nhealth.”Here’s the thing though: We can’t even protect folks from ingesting\nillegal substances. How in the world can we force them to stop using over-the-\ncounter products?Bans on smoking are much easier to defend. You can puff\ncigarettes to your lungs’ content in your house or car, but you don’t have the\nright to choke me on your fumes at the ballpark or restaurant. Secondhand\nsmoke is a legitimate health risk that non-smokers shouldn’t be forced to\ntolerate in public places.Maybe there’s an epidemic of smokeless tobacco users\nsplattering innocent bystanders at games. Maybe nasty cleanups have risen\nsharply due to spittle-filled bottles that are dropped accidentally. Maybe the\nsight of brown expectoration makes waves of onlookers physically ill, making\nmedical attention necessary.But those possibilities aren’t behind the\nsmokeless tobacco ban. Players are the reason and the target. For the\nchildren’s sake.“It’s time for Major League Baseball and its players to accept\nthe inevitable, set the right example for our kids and promptly agree to\nprohibit smokeless tobacco use at all major league ballparks,” Matthew Myers,\npresident of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said in a statement after the New\nYork City Council approved the ban in a 44-3 vote.“Our national pastime should\nbe about promoting a healthy and active lifestyle, not a deadly and addictive\nproduct,” Myers said. “Today’s vote sends the right message to youth that\nchewing tobacco is dangerous and should not be an accepted part of sports\nculture. It also provides further momentum for our nationwide campaign to get\ntobacco out of baseball for kids, the players and the future.”I understand the\nconcern, but this is dangerous territory, subjecting the players’ clubhouse\nand umpires’ locker room to questionable legislation. This is singling out\nworkplace activities that are legal and carry no harmful secondary effects to\nbystanders. This is one step away from banning the consumption of beer and\ncoffee in private offices due to health concerns._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"SNYDER: MLB will soon find out how far smokeless tobacco bans are received - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#MLB will soon find out how far smokeless tobacco bans are received, writes @DeronSnyder: https://t.co/r3RQ5gRXwx https://t.co/YoQjmYpW7G","date":"Mon Mar 28 22:09:10 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714575081813491713"},"retweets":1},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/1qcdVo1"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f48"},"content":"CHICAGO — After housing the misery that comes with an unforeseen collapse, the\nvisiting locker room at United Center was quickly moved back to being just a\nroom. There were only Virginia signs still hanging in various stalls — no\npeople once the Cavaliers had moved out. Signs associated with the NCAA were\nplucked off walls in the hallway as the area was stripped back to nondescript\nwhite concrete.But, that room will forever be the place that Virginia’s\nsinking feeling first reached its gut after a 68-62 loss in the Elite Eight\nagainst Syracuse. At halftime, the Orange had both feet in a bear trap. By the\nend, they were trying to explain how they are going to the Final Four in\nHouston.This loss, perhaps more so than the early NCAA tournament exits of the\npast two seasons, will sit with the Cavaliers. Because of it, almost\neverything changed. The only idea that sticks is Virginia’s reputation as a\nregular-season powerhouse that can’t live up to its seeding in the NCAA\ntournament.“I will look back through stuff,” Virginia coach Tony Bennett said.\n“I’ll watch the film, and I’m sure there will be things I’ll look at and all\nthat stuff will come.”There are two key considerations from Sunday night.\nFirst is the decision-making by Virginia against Syracuse’s press. Just two\nnights before, when also trailing by double digits in the second half, Iowa\nState tried the same rallying tactic against the Cavaliers. It opted for a\nfull-court press. Virginia shredded it, easily breaking the press in the\nbackcourt by using primary ballhandlers London Perrantes and Malcolm Brogdon.\nThe Cavaliers converted with ease against the Cyclones until the Iowans\ncapitulated.Against Syracuse, Virginia often broke the press with the same\namount of precision. But, once in the frontcourt at full speed, conversions\nwere a problem. Mix in a couple turnovers, and second-guessing begins. Should\nVirginia, which had a substantial lead, wants to play a plodding game and gave\nSyracuse fits in the half court, have pulled the ball out after breaking the\npress?“We’ve had some trouble against presses, but we’ve had such success\nattacking it and getting points on the board,” Bennett said. “And there’s\nmaybe a couple we got going a little fast, we could have backed out perhaps.\nI’ve got to watch the tape and get a feel for it.“But when you have two-on-\nones or three-on-ones, I think you have to look to take it, and again, so I’m\nOK with what I saw, but perhaps I’d change my mind, maybe there’s one or two\nwe could have backed up. I think it was more the turnovers, whether it was a\nball that went out of bounds, and there was a little miscommunication when we\nwere inbounding it, that hurt us. We scored a couple of those, but not\nenough.”Another vital second-half change was Syracuse abandoning offensive\nball screens. Instead, it drove the ball one-on-one, passed it out if\nnecessary, then drove it again. This dictated play to Virginia the way the\nCavaliers’ superior help defenses dictated it to the Orange in the first half.\nIt also put Virginia in foul trouble, and kickstarted freshman Malachi\nRichardson, who scored 21 points in the second half — much of it against\nBrogdon, the ACC defensive player of the year. Richardson’s 21 points were the\nsame total the Orange had as a team in the first half.“He’s an extremely\ntalented freshman,” Brogdon said. “He has a hesitation to his game that makes\nyou freeze a little bit, and he can shoot it from range and he can get to the\nrim. I thought we struggled with him all game. He was able to get to the line,\nand I think that really hurt us.”Three key seniors leaving the program will\noverhaul Virginia’s look heading into next season.The impact of Brogdon’s\ndeparture is hefty and apparent: He was the ACC player of the year. That will\nbe a load to replace emotionally and statistically. Anthony Gill and Mike\nTobey are graduating as well. That is a towering blow.Gill and Tobey combined\nto play 33.7 minutes per game. At times, they played together. More often,\nthey substituted for the other. Those two leaving means 6-foot-11 freshman\nJack Salt will become the team’s most experienced big man. He averaged 6.6\nminutes in 21 games this season. Jay Huff, a 6-foot-10 center from Durham,\nNorth Carolina, has also signed to play for the Cavaliers next season.The\nchanges in the post will make Virginia a very wing-oriented team next season.\nPerrantes will be back as the starting point guard. Fellow starters Devon\nHall, who said he will never forget Sunday’s loss, and 6-foot-7 Isaiah Wilkins\nalso return. Guards Marial Shayok, who showed flashed in the tournament, and\nDarius Thompson will also have more time in the rotation.The Cavaliers won’t\nbe inexperienced. They will likely start a senior, a redshirt junior, a\njunior, and either a redshirt junior or junior to go with the raw Salt. But,\nthey will be distinctly different, saddled with an inescapable bad memory that\ntook hold in a United Center locker room.\n\n","title":"Another NCAA tournament exit leaves Virginia questioning its decisions - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Another NCAA tournament exit leaves #UVa questioning its decisions, @Todd_Dybas writes: https://t.co/6uwwRNaxuA https://t.co/PK3kPzpjPZ","date":"Mon Mar 28 22:08:11 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"714574833938522113"},"retweets":1},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/1PBKctt"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f49"},"content":"VIERA, Fla. — Michael A. Taylor walked away from the batting cage shaking his\nhead and smiling, a blend of frustration and satisfaction as the ball he\nscorched down the left-field line appeared as if it wasn’t ever going to come\nback down. With a short, compact swing, he turned on Ali Modami’s inside pitch\nand hooked it sharply around the foul pole, well beyond the 340-foot marking\non the wall.“I couldn’t get one all day,” Taylor said.Modami, the Washington\nNationals’ left-handed batting practice pitcher, was bringing it before the\nteam’s game against the Miami Marlins at Space Coast Stadium. Taylor finally\nfigured a way to get a hold of one, just as he has done all spring.Entering\nMonday, Taylor was leading or at the top of nearly every offensive category.\nHe has 20 hits in 44 at-bats — a .455 batting average — and 15 RBI, all of\nwhich are team highs. His four home runs and five doubles rank tied for first\nand his nine runs are tied second. His .500 on-base percentage and .841\nslugging percentage total for a 1.341 OPS — more than 200 points higher than\nany other player on the team that has had at least 10 at-bats in spring\ntraining.The point, which is obvious by now, is that Taylor is producing at a\nstunning rate, and manager Dusty Baker is dead set on finding him at-bats in\nthe regular season. As the fourth outfielder behind left fielder Jayson Werth,\ncenter fielder Ben Revere and right fielder Bryce Harper, the chances will\ncome in a variety of ways. In the last four seasons, the Nationals have needed\nat least 400 plate appearances from a fourth outfielder, whether it be injury\nor production related.Taylor played 138 games in his first full season in\n2015, filling in for center fielder Denard Span, who battled various injuries.\nHe hit .229 with 14 home runs and 63 RBI, along with a team-high 16 stolen\nbases. When Span hit free agency, the Nationals whiffed on signing Jason\nHeyward and ultimately traded former closer Drew Storen for Revere.“Ben is\nsupposed to get on base and score runs and Michael has the capability of doing\neverything,” Baker said. “But, you can only play three at a time. It’s not a\nquarterback controversy. It is what it is.”There’s one other category Taylor’s\nname is atop. He has 12 strikeouts, tied with Werth for a team high. Last\nseason Taylor struck out 158 times — second behind former shortstop Ian\nDesmond.“I think that’ll improve by not focusing on it when I’m out there,”\nTaylor said. “It’s kind of the talk of my game right now. I think the more I\nmake it a point, the more it becomes a problem. I have a good approach and a\ngood plan and just let it fall where it may.”In Saturday’s 7-0 win against the\nSt. Louis Cardinals, Taylor, on his 25th birthday, clubbed a ground-rule\ndouble in his first at-bat. It was his next at-bat, in which Taylor drew a\nwalk, that made hitting coach Rick Schu proud. Taylor exhibited the same\ndisciplined approach, the one that Schu remembers seeing in the Nationals’\nregular-season finale in 2015. Facing the New York Mets on a sunny October\nSunday afternoon, Taylor drew a 10-pitch walk against New York Mets pitcher\nJacob deGrom.“For him it’s the mentality,” Schu said. “It’s in there, you just\ncan’t give at-bats away. [Last year] he’s facing deGrom, in the shadows,\nthrowing 98. He goes down 0-2, fouls some off, takes a couple pitches, fouls\nsome off, it’s a 10-pitch walk. If he has that mentality every at bat, the\nstrikeouts will cut down.”Taylor has drawn four walks this spring. With a\nbetter understanding of the strike zone, Taylor has shown more confidence at\nthe plate, according to Schu, which is helping the young outfielder keep his\nswing simple. When he does that, his power is often on full display.During an\n8-2 win against the Cardinals last Thursday, Taylor hit a two-run double to\ntie the score, 2-2, in the bottom of the fourth inning. The next inning, the\nright-handed hitter belted a two-run home run to opposite field to make it\n7-2.“This is what’s great about big-league baseball,” said pitcher Max\nScherzer, who earned the win that day. “We brought in Ben Revere and it only\nmade Michael Taylor better. When you have competition around, it brings out\nthe best in everybody and what we’re seeing right now is he’s growing up right\nin front of our eyes and that’s even better. He puts a smile on everybody’s\nface. You want to see somebody have success because at the end of the day,\nwe’re all pulling on the same rope.”Taylor’s spring has been eye-opening for\nBaker, too. The Nationals’ manager didn’t know him until this season and has\ncalled it “a pleasure” to coach him.  \n“Sometimes he acts like he’s not listening,” Baker quipped. “But he’s always\nlistening.”_Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Michael A.

With that\nfeature suspended, investigators could then attempt to enter all four-digit\npassword combinations until they found the right one to unlock the phone.Apple\nattorneys argued that by assisting the FBI in hacking the phone, the company\nwould set a dangerous precedent and open a backdoor into the iPhone’s system\nthat would weaken the security of all their products versus all governments\nworldwide.“The U.S. government has asked us for something we simply do not\nhave and something we consider too dangerous to create,” said Apple CEO Tim\nCook at the outset of the legal battle.But the notoriety of the FBI\ninvestigation apparently brought out a slew of private sleuths who went to\nwork trying to crack the iPhone’s security features.“People have come from all\nover the globe with suggestions,” said FBI Director James B. Comey last week,\ndiscussing an onslaught of input the agency has received from outside\nparties.Just last week a court hearing on the matter was postponed after the\ngovernment announced that a third party had come forward with a method that\ncould possibly help them access the data without Apple’s aid.“Our decision to\nconclude the litigation was based solely on the fact that, with the recent\nassistance of a third party, we are now able to unlock that iPhone without\ncompromising any information on the phone,” said U.S. Attorney Eileen Decker\nin a statement issued after the motion to vacate the ruling was filed Monday\nafternoon._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Justice Department to drop encryption case against Apple: report - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"BREAKING: Justice Department reportedly will drop encryption case against Apple: https://t.co/mKUfqulCP4","date":"Mon Mar 28 21:45:36 +0000 2016","favs":9,"id":{"$numberLong":"714569152237867008"},"retweets":25},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/justice-department-drop-encryption-case-against-ap/"}

First, we learned that the scaffolding that has been surrounding the U.S. Capitol since 2014 was coming down. Second, we witnessed people around the globe converging on the nation’s capital to begin celebrating the glorious Yoshino cherry trees encircling the Tidal Basin on the National Mall. Then, unfortunately, we heard Monday there was a shooting at the U.S. Capitol, and a suspect is in custody.Events like these during times like these often lead law enforcers to take drastic measures, to sometimes forget that atop the dome of the Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom and that she stands atop a globe encircled with the motto E Pluribus Unum, or out of many, one.America can’t contain or take down all global terrorist threats, though our leaders continue to try.We overreacted after homegrown terrorists exploded a truck bomb in Oklahoma City in 1995, killing 168 persons and injuring hundreds more. At the time it was the worst ever terrorist attack on U.S. soil, and law enforcers and Washington bureaucrats responded by erecting concrete bollards, and closing and blocking public access to the White House and other major federal properties, fearful of terrorists.We grew fearful again on Sept. 11, 2001, when foreign terrorists hijacked four airplanes and used them as bombs in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania. More than 3,000 people were killed, making it the most deadly attack on U.S. soil. The 15th anniversary of that horrifying day is this year.We need to remain vigilant and on the lookout for the crazies, like those involved in the 2013 Boston Marathon attack by pressure cooker that left three people dead and more than 260 maimed and otherwise injured.Be not so fearful as to change America’s identity.Let not Monday’s shooting at the Capitol leave us overreacting with flurries for gun control.**A capital misunderstanding**People who help run the government forget the nation’s capital isn’t the province of the D.C. government.

Council do not dictate to the Capitol Police nor the sergeant-at-arms of the Senate, who happens to be the nation’s highest-ranking federal law enforcement officer.By the way, both Metropolitan and Capitol Police share something highly visible: Their badges and shields display the U.S. Capitol Building — not the John A.

And then we go back into [his] library and add some of our\nchanges we came up with that morning.”“We would just throw out ideas all day\nand come back with the best,” said co-star Wyatt Russell. “And by the time it\ncame time for the actual shooting of the film, it had pretty much been nailed\ndown in improv.”Mr. Powell and Mr. Russell developed an informal competition\nover ping pong at Mr. Linklater’s ranch, and their rivalry even found its way\ninto the respective characters’ dynamic.“We played probably 40 games a night,\nand it was this rivalry that just went on,” Mr. Powell said. “And this\ndialogue that you see in the movie is actual dialogue that went on” while they\ncompeted.In addition to massaging the script with his cast, Mr. Powell said\nthe filmmaker coached he and his fellow actors on “the do’s and don’ts of the\nera,” which included a musical education of “hundreds of songs” and making\nsure they didn’t make references that were anachronistic to the film’s\nsetting.Mr. Powell, a veteran of “The Dark Knight Rises,” said Mr. Linklater\nfostered an incredibly collaborative atmosphere at his ranch — and was the\nfirst to invite his actors to address him informally.“You know Rick more than\nfive minutes, calling him ‘Richard‘ feels really weird,” Mr. Powell said with\na laugh of the filmmaker also responsible for “Slacker” and the “Before”\ntrilogy.The actors clearly enjoyed themselves during rehearsal, on set and\nribbing one another during their press tour. Mr. Powell recalled a sex scene\nhe had, during the filming of which the actors continued trying new twists on\nsome of the script’s lines.“We were literally kind of riffing [on the lines]\nwhile this naked girl was on top of me,” he laughed.“You really see more naked\nWyatt Russell than anyone else in this movie.”“That’s true,” Mr. Russell\nconcurred.“It’s the most surprising nudity you’ll see this year: Wyatt Russell\nin a cowboy hat doing yoga.”“If I was a Kardashian, I’d be famous,” Mr.\nRussell laughed.\n\n","title":"'Everybody Wants Some!!' cast members Glen Powell and Wyatt Russell on improv rehearsal process - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#EverybodyWantsSome cast improv'd through sex scenes. #everybodywantssome awesome #Texas\nhttps://t.co/4l1ELQJ8w0 https://t.co/fsO1qqjRhV","date":"Mon Mar 28 20:41:11 +0000 2016","favs":6,"id":{"$numberLong":"714552942175633408"},"retweets":4},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/everybody-wants-some-cast-members-glen-powell-and-/"}

Chief Verderosa said thousands of people\nvisit the Capitol every day and about 2 million are screened through the\nVisitor Center every year.The police chief said the incident started about\n2:39 p.m. Monday when a man entered the north screening facility of the\nCapitol Visitor Center, drew a weapon and pointed it at officers. An officer\nshot the man, who underwent surgery at Washington Hospital Center in\nNorthwest. His condition was not known, the chief said.No officers were\ninjured, but a 35- to 45-year-old female bystander received minor injuries and\nwas treated at a hospital, Chief Verderosa said without elaborating about her\ninjury.He said no charges had been filed but an investigation was continuing.\nEarlier reports that an officer had been shot were erroneous.“We do believe\nthis is an act of a single person who has frequented the Capitol grounds\nbefore, and there is no reason to believe that this is anything more than a\ncriminal act,” the chief said.Chief Verderosa declined to identify the suspect\nbut said officers and bomb disposal specialists were examining his\ntruck.Several news organizations identified the man as Larry Dawson of\nAntioch, Tennessee. Mr. Dawson was arrested in October after disrupting a\nsession of the House by yelling that he was a “prophet of God,” and reports\nsaid he assaulted an officer on the House balcony. Mr. Dawson was charged with\nassault, and D.C. Superior Court ordered him to stay away from the Capitol.The\nincident prompted a one-hour lockdown at the Capitol, and staffers were\ndirected to shelter in place until the situation was resolved. The Capitol’s\neast plaza filled with police vehicles as the intercom system blared a warning\nabout shots fired. The White House also was locked down briefly.The Visitor\nCenter remained closed pending completion of the investigation. Chief\nVerderosa said the center would reopen Tuesday.Unlike the White House, where\naccess is more strictly controlled, the Capitol is open to the general public\nfor regular tours.Calls for more security at the Capitol arose after two\nCapitol Police officers were killed by a single gunman in 1998.

His\nIslamic State kidnappers, who also killed 16 Christian nuns, nurses and\npatients, had issued threats to execute him using the same method used by the\nRomans on Jesus and marked on Good Friday every year.According to a report in\nthe Salzburg News, Cardinal Christoph Schonborn of Vienna said at his Easter\nVigil Mass that the Islamist group had followed through on those threats.\nThere had been no official confirmation from the priest’s order, the\nresponsible diocese or the Vatican.**PHOTOS: BOOM!

(AP) — When he died in 2003, Fred Rogers was described in many\nheadlines as gentle, beloved, kind and — of course — neighborly.But how about\nradical? Counter-cultural? Trouble-maker?Scholars and others are using such\nadjectives as they assess the legacy of the late creator and host of the long-\nrunning “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.”For all his much-parodied gentle voice\nand manner, the Latrobe native actually worked from a steely social\nconscience. He used his program, with its non-threatening benign puppets,\nsongs and conversation, to raise provocative topics such as war, peace, race,\ngender and poverty with his audience of preschoolers and their parents -\npatiently guiding them across the minefields of late 20th century political\nand social change.Rogers was no “meek and mild pushover,” wrote Michael Long,\nauthor of the recent book, “Peaceful Neighbor: Discovering the Countercultural\nMister Rogers.”Rogers was “a quiet but strong American prophet who, with roots\nin progressive spirituality, invited us to make the world into a counter-\ncultural neighborhood of love,” said Mr. Long, a professor of religious\nstudies and peace and conflict studies at Elizabethtown (Pa.) College.An early\nexample could be seen on a recent afternoon in a classroom at the Fred Rogers\nCenter for Early Learning and Children’s Media on the campus of St. Vincent\nCollege in Latrobe. The center was formed to carry on his legacy, and that\nincludes learning to be bold advocates when needed, said its co-director,\nJunlei Li.Li, a professor of psychological science, is teaching a seminar this\nsemester titled, “What Would Fred Rogers Do?”Many of the students had watched\n“Mister Rogers” as preschoolers. Now as adults, they have been studying such\nbroadcasts in an intensive course that blends psychology, child development\nand - apropos for a show produced by an ordained Presbyterian minister -\ntheology.For a recent class, the students viewed an archived “Neighborhood”\nprogram. The black-and-white video and the characters’ hairstyles reflected\nits 1968 vintage, but the onscreen conflicts seemed to arise straight out of\ntoday’s newscasts with their high-definition anxiety.The puppet King Friday\nXIII was posting border guards, installing barbed-wire fences and drafting\npassersby to keep out the those fomenting social change.“Down with the\nchangers!” he proclaimed. “Because we’re on top!”The episode aired when other\ntelevision programs were bringing the Vietnam War into American living rooms,\nand when “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” had just gone into national\ndistribution from its Pittsburgh production base. It was part of weeklong\nseries on conflict, change and distrust.King Friday’s declaration of national\nemergency to preserve the status quo “is a political statement,” said Li.\n“It’s not a plot line merely to entertain children. It’s the idea that when we\nresist change, it’s because we want to maintain our position.”To underscore\nthe episode’s relevance, Li interspersed news clips of the current\npresidential campaign, with Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s\npledge to bar Muslim immigrants and wall off migrants from Mexico._Story\nContinues →_\n\n","title":"The 'radical' legacy of television's Mister Rogers - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Mister Rogers’ counter-culture neighborhood https://t.co/79GywU0V2P #MisterRogers https://t.co/TqnNe4OAHx","date":"Mon Mar 28 16:41:53 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"714492720614666241"},"retweets":3},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/8QIVTM"}

As a result, he\nsaid, they aren’t effective tactics in the long term.“The sweeps are like band\naids, they look good on the 5 o’clock news but they have no effect on the\nactual gangs,” Mr. Valdemar said.More successful are operations that charge\ngang leadership through Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations\nstatutes, which can help to disassemble the organizations by ensnaring gang\nleaders who may not be the ones actually carrying out the most violent crimes,\nhe said.ICE spokeswoman Sarah Rodriguez said some of those arrested are being\ncharged as part of RICO investigations but she declined to say how many or\nwhere the investigations were centered because they are ongoing.The majority\nof the gang members or affiliates — 1,001 people — were charged with criminal\noffenses ranging from attempted murder to tampering with a witness and\nnarcotics-related charges. The remaining 132 people were arrested\nadministratively for immigration violations.Some of those who were criminally\ncharged are also immigrants, as ICE officials indicated that 239 of the 1,133\npeople arrested as part of the operation are foreign nationals.Another gang\nresearcher, Alex Alonso of Cal State University, was critical of the sweeps,\ncalling them “rhetoric and propaganda” meant to build support for law\nenforcement programs and deportation policies.The operation, dubbed Project\nShadowfire, was meant to crack down on gang activity across the country but\nofficials said that enforcement action was most active in the Los Angeles, San\nJuan, Atlanta, San Francisco, Houston, and El Paso areas. In the greater Los\nAngeles area, a total of 185 people were arrested.A handful of gang arrests\nwere also made in the D.C. region, where local law enforcement have been on\nthe lookout for an uptick in MS-13 activity.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f5e"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:****ANALYSIS**The only white people Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton is winning consistently is women older than 65.On Saturday, Mrs. Clinton got whooped by rival Vermont Sen. Bernard Sanders in Washington state by 40 points. He also claimed decisive victories in Alaska and Hawaii.Why?Because all those states have a relatively small margin of African-American voters in their electorates. Hawaii’s Democratic voting electorate is 3 percent black, and Alaska’s and Washington’s is about 4 percent, according to past exit polls.Mrs. Clinton’s sweep of the southern states — and prominent delegate lead — was driven by her turning out black votes and winning them by 80 percent margins. Much of her appeal within that demographic is her promise to continue with President Obama’s legacy, many of whom adore the sitting president.White voters, on the other hand, are one of Mr. Sanders‘ core constituencies. His populist message has appealed to white-working class voters, who view U.S. trade-deals as a threat to American jobs, and see Wall Street — and establishment politics — as an insiders’ game only benefiting the rich and/or well connected.The dissatisfied white male helped propel Mr. Sanders to a surprise victory in Michigan; the white, youth-vote helped him achieve a virtual tie in Iowa; and the white woman helped Mr. Sanders’s cinch New Hampshire. However, he continually loses the African-American and Hispanic vote to Mrs. Clinton, and in most states, loses women over the age of 65.According to an analysis by The Washington Post, when the composition of the black Democratic electorate has been below 7 percent for states where Democratic primary exit polling in 2008 or 2016 was available, Mrs. Clinton has lost by an average of 30 points this year. When it’s more than 7 percent, Mrs. Clinton has won by 26 percentage points.So what does this mean moving forward? Mrs. Clinton will most likely become the presumed Democratic nominee because the most of the big prized states on the calendar (New York, California) are more diverse, and she has a near insurmountable super-delegate lead.Moving into the general, however, Mrs. Clinton will need to improve her messaging with white voters — especially those who identify with Mr. Sanders‘ view on the economy and trade.You see, Republican front-runner Donald Trump is fueling his campaign with an outsider, economic message. In Michigan and Mississippi, six in 10 Republican primary voters said free trade cost the country more jobs than it produced, and they overwhelmingly voted for Mr. Trump.On the Democratic side, in Michigan, among those Democrats who felt income inequality was their top issue, Mr. Sanders beat Mrs. Clinton 60 percent to 39 percent, and again, by a double-digit margin of those who think trade takes away jobs.By the time November rolls around, who knows what Mr. Trump’s popularity will be, how vicious the anti-Trump forces will become, or how his presumed nomination will galvanize minorities — and the Democratic base — to turn out for Mrs. Clinton.But we also don’t know where the U.S. economy will be. Mr. Trump’s rails against trade, Wall Street and the political establishment class may just turn out to be his trump card.\n\n","title":"Hillary Clinton's white, middle-class problem - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"WATER COOLER: Hillary Clinton’s white, middle-class problem https://t.co/7EEBK3hUui #HillaryClinton","date":"Mon Mar 28 16:33:39 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"714490645394636800"},"retweets":4},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/S9zwOB"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f5f"},"content":"MIDDLETOWN, Pa. (AP) — When Andrea Lichtman, of Middletown, eloped, neither\nher Catholic parents nor her husband’s Jewish parents would accept the\ninterfaith marriage.“My parents didn’t speak to me for five years. It was very\nhard,” she said. Still, the couple married. “We were very sure in what we were\ndoing.”Times have changed. Nowadays, a marriage of two people of different\nfaiths has become the norm.Nearly 40 percent of adults living in the United\nStates who married between 2010 and 2014 had a spouse who practiced a\ndifferent religion, according to data from the Pew Research Center. Before\n1960, that number was 19 percent, the center’s data shows.The reason for the\nincrease in interfaith marriages, some area religious leaders say, is that\nAmericans no longer live in homogeneous communities based on their religion or\nethnicity. The ties that used to bind people to their neighborhood, church or\nsynagogue aren’t as strong as they once were. Young people travel more for\ncollege, work or the military.“The number of marriages now that are interfaith\nis probably more the rule than not the rule,” said the Rev. Michael C.\nDiIorio, pastor of St. Michael the Archangel Roman Catholic Church in\nTullytown. He estimated that 60 percent to 65 percent of the marriages\nconducted at his parish are of a Catholic and someone of another faith, most\ncommonly another Christian denomination.The numbers are greater within the\nJewish community; 58 percent of Jews who married between 2005 and 2013 had a\nspouse who practiced a different religion, according to the Pew data. Rabbi\nRobyn Frisch, executive director of Interfaith Family Philadelphia, said the\nfigure is as high as 71 percent for Reformed Jews.Hadassah, the Women’s\nZionist Organization of America, wanted to learn more about how the Jewish\ncommunity can be more responsive and accepting of such couples, so it called\nFrisch for help. The law school graduate, rabbi and leader of the\nInterfaithFamily Network in Philadelphia held a conference earlier this month\non interfaith marriages at Shir Ami in Newtown Township.More than a dozen\nparticipants joined in the conversation. Most were parents whose adult\nchildren were dating or planning to marry someone of another faith, or who\nalready were married and raising children in an interfaith household. One\nwoman asked about the notion of Jewish identity coming through the mother’s\nside. Others had questions about blessings and rituals. One wondered why her\nchild chose not to marry another Jew.“Identity is much more complex” now than\nit was in bygone eras when families lived in homogeneous communities where\ntheir children’s chances of meeting and marrying someone like themselves were\nmuch more likely, Frisch said. Now, she said, interfaith couples come to her\nnot just asking for advice, but saying they are going to marry.It’s not a\nrejection of a religion if someone marries outside the faith, Frisch\nsaid.Parents should realize that their child’s choice of a spouse doesn’t\nreflect on them, she stressed. “The reality is they fell in love with someone\nof a different faith. The power dynamic shifts when they are out of the house.\nIt’s your adult child.”Parents of an adult child who marries someone of\nanother faith should respect their son or daughter’s decision, Frisch said.\nAnd they should respect the culture and beliefs of their child’s spouse, she\nadvised. She also warned against the use of “insider language” that could make\nsomeone of a different faith feel like an “other.”A wise woman once told her\nto offer advice when asked for it, and that’s good advice, she said. And be an\n“active listener” - something she learned about in rabbinical school.The same\ngoes for the couple in the interfaith marriage, she added. They need to\nrealize that old ways are hard for older people to forget. They should include\ntraditions from both faiths in a wedding ceremony if possible._Story Continues\n→_\n\n","title":"Interfaith marriage a sign of the times - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Interfaith marriage a sign of the times https://t.co/NStg9IDJjn","date":"Mon Mar 28 16:05:27 +0000 2016","favs":4,"id":{"$numberLong":"714483551383609344"},"retweets":9},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/BnAXaC"}

Nathan Deal knuckled under to a tidal wave of\npressure by vetoing a religious liberty bill.Mr. Deal, a Republican, said\nHouse Bill 757, which sought to protect religious wedding vendors from\nparticipating in same-sex marriage ceremonies, was not warranted in Georgia,\nwhere no such disputes have risen — yet.“While most people would agree that\nthe government should not force such actions, there has not been a single\ninstance of such taking place in Georgia,” the governor said in a statement.\n“If there has been any case of this type in our state it has not been called\nto my attention.”In neighboring North Carolina, a similar culture war began to\nplay out as transgender rights groups filed a lawsuit to halt the state’s\nbathroom bill, which they claim is discriminatory, amid more threats from big\nbusiness about of a boycott of the state for not toeing the line on sexual\nliberation.Two transgender people, a lesbian law professor, the American Civil\nLiberties Union of North Carolina and Equality North Carolina brought a\nlawsuit to federal court saying the law singles out gays and the transgendered\nfor “disfavored treatment.” It also says the law violates federal equal\nprotection rules such as Title IX, which bars discrimination on the basis of\nsex.Top lawmakers in the state House and Senate dismissed the lawsuit as\ntrying “to argue with a straight face that there is a previously undiscovered\n‘right’ in the U.S. Constitution for men to use women’s bathrooms and locker\nrooms.”In Georgia, Mr. Deal commended the state legislature for working to\nensure that the bill did not protect bigotry, as gay rights advocates\ncontended. But the governor concluded that — despite a revision that\nprohibited “invidious discrimination” — it still presented “too great a risk\nto take.”He vetoed the bill after several major corporations, including Walt\nDisney Co., the National Football League and Intel, made clear that it would\nimpair their ability to do business in Georgia.A spokesman for Disney, which\nhas filmed Marvel films such as “Ant-Man,” “Captain America: Civil War” and\n“Guardians of the Galaxy 2” in Atlanta, said the company would “plan to take\nour business elsewhere should any legislation allowing discriminatory\npractices be signed into state law.”The NFL hinted that the measure could\nthreaten any Atlanta bid to host a Super Bowl. Other companies that urged Mr.\nDeal to veto the legislation included Apple, Time Warner and\nSalesforce.Although Mr. Deal did not mention lobbying from big business in his\nreasoning for the veto, others read between the lines.Ryan T. Anderson, a\nsenior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation, said the governor “caved to\npressure from large corporations and special interests.” He also accused\nHollywood of hypocrisy for forcing its values on other companies that also\nwant to work according to their beliefs.“The hypocrisy of Hollywood, the NFL\nand the big business lobby in this case is astounding,” Mr. Anderson said in a\nstatement. “They want to freely operate in Georgia according to their values,\nbut they don’t want small-business competitors to be free to do the\nsame.”Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin, who issued a clarion call\nfor Hollywood to boycott Georgia if the bill became law, said Mr. Deal heard\nthe voices of the entertainment industry.“The message to Gov.

A\nformal announcement was set for Monday.Emanuel is trying to replace\nSuperintendent Garry McCarthy, whose firing was part of a frantic effort to\nrestore trust in the Police Department and his own leadership following the\nrelease in November of dash-camera footage showing a white police officer\nfatally shooting an unarmed black teenager 16 times.Johnson, who is African-\nAmerican and a 27-year veteran of the force, was not among the police board’s\nrecommendations. A former commander of the Gresham police district on the\nSouth Side, Johnson was promoted to deputy chief of patrol in 2012 and chief\nof patrol in December.The statement said Johnson is a Chicago native who grew\nup in the now-demolished Cabrini Green housing project until he was 9 years\nold. As chief of patrol, Johnson commanded 8,000 officers, the statement\nsaid.Johnson will take over during a time of immense turmoil marked by\nprotests over police shootings. In one of the more high-profile cases, officer\nJason Van Dyke has been charged with first-degree murder in the 2014 shooting\ndeath of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald, which was captured on squad-car video\nand has prompted investigations, including a federal civil rights probe of the\nPolice Department.Alderman Anthony Beale said the mayor’s office reached out\nwith news of Johnson’s selection ahead of the official announcement. Beale\nsaid he supported the mayor’s decision.“Eddie Johnson knows Chicago, he knows\nthe police department and the challenges facing our neighborhoods,” he said.\n“He is a true leader and will bring the fundamental changes CPD needs right\nnow. I look forward to getting to work with Eddie right away.”Anabel Abarca, a\nspokeswoman for Alderman George Cardenas, a prominent member of the Chicago\nCity Council’s Latino caucus, also told The Associated Press the alderman had\nbeen notified of Johnson’s selection in advance. Cardenas and Hispanics on the\ncouncil had expressed frustration that the police board had passed over\ncurrent Interim Superintendent John Escalante, who is Hispanic and has been\nrunning the department since McCarthy’s firing. Escalante has said he applied\nfor the job. The AP emailed Escalante’s spokesman asking for his comment, but\ndid not get a reply Sunday.A city ordinance allows Emanuel to appoint an\ninterim chief and ask the police board for a new list of finalists.“While each\nof the finalists had strong qualifications, the mayor did not feel that any of\nthem were the complete package that Chicago needs at this time and thus none\nwere offered the position,” Emanuel spokeswoman Kelley Quinn said earlier\nSunday. “The mayor called each of them individually late Saturday to let them\nknow of his decision.”One of the board’s initial nominees, Cedric Alexander,\ntold AP on Sunday that Emanuel offered him the job on Thursday during a\nmeeting in Washington, D.C., and that the mayor told him he intended to make\nJohnson his first deputy. But he said Emanuel phoned him Saturday night to say\nhe had changed his mind.“He did offer me the position in D.C. on Thursday, and\nlast night he called and said he’s going in a different direction,” said\nAlexander, the public safety director in Georgia’s DeKalb County. NBC5 in\nChicago first reported that Alexander said he’d been offered the\nposition.Alexander told AP the plan had been for him to fly to Chicago on\nMonday and that the announcement was to have come Wednesday.“I would like to\nthank the Chicago Police Board for giving me the opportunity to apply,”\nAlexander said. “Clearly the mayor is going in another direction, and I would\njust like to wish the very best for the people of Chicago.”_Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Rahm Emanuel, Chicago mayor, to introduce new interim police superintendent - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Rahm Emanuel, #Chicago mayor, to introduce new interim police superintendent https://t.co/JEXzQlX50M #ChicagoPD https://t.co/kawsNhkcsA","date":"Mon Mar 28 14:15:38 +0000 2016","favs":1,"id":{"$numberLong":"714455913155936256"},"retweets":7},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/bTkKgE"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f69"},"content":"HAVANA (AP) — Fidel Castro responded Monday to President Barack Obama’s\nhistoric trip to Cuba with a long, bristling letter recounting the history of\nU.S. aggression against Cuba, writing that “we don’t need the empire to give\nus any presents.”The 1,500-word letter in state media titled “Brother Obama”\nwas Castro’s first response to the president’s three-day visit last week, in\nwhich the American president said he had come to bury the two countries’\nhistory of Cold War hostility. Obama did not meet with the 89-year-old Fidel\nCastro on the trip but met several times with his 84-year-old brother Raul\nCastro, the current Cuban president.Obama’s visit was intended to build\nirreversible momentum behind his opening with Cuba and to convince the Cuban\npeople and the Cuban government that a half-century of U.S. attempts to\noverthrow the Communist government had ended, allowing Cuban to reform its\neconomy and political system without the threat of U.S. interference.Fidel\nCastro writes of Obama: “My modest suggestion is that he reflects and doesn’t\ntry to develop theories about Cuban politics.”Castro, who led Cuba for decades\nbefore handing power to his brother in 2008, was legendary for his hours-long,\nall-encompassing speeches. His letter reflects that style, presenting a sharp\ncontrast with Obama’s tightly focused speech in Havana. Castro’s letter opens\nwith descriptions of environmental abuse under the Spaniards and reviews the\nhistorical roles of Cuban independence heroes Jose Marti, Antonio Maceo and\nMaximo Gomez.Castro then goes over crucial sections of Obama’s speech line by\nline, engaging in an ex-post-facto dialogue with the American president with\npointed critiques of perceived slights and insults, including Obama’s failure\nto give credit to indigenous Cubans and Castro’s prohibition of racial\nsegregation after coming to power in 1959.Quoting Obama’s declaration that “it\nis time, now, for us to leave the past behind,” the man who shaped Cuba during\nthe second half of the 20th century writes that “I imagine that any one of us\nran the risk of having a heart attack on hearing these words from the\nPresident of the United States.”Castro then returns to a review of a half-\ncentury of U.S. aggression against Cuba. Those events include the decades-long\nU.S. trade embargo against the island; the 1961 Bay of Pigs attack and the\n1976 bombing of a Cuban airliner backed by exiles who took refuge in the\nU.S.He ends with a dig at the Obama administration’s drive to increase\nbusiness ties with Cuba. The Obama administration says re-establishing\neconomic ties with the U.S. will be a boon for Cuba, whose centrally planned\neconomy has struggled to escape from over-dependence on imports and a chronic\nshortage of hard currency.The focus on U.S-Cuba business ties appears to have\nparticularly rankled Castro, who nationalized U.S. companies after coming to\npower in 1959 and establishing the communist system into which his brother is\nnow introducing gradual market-based reforms.“No one should pretend that the\npeople of this noble and selfless country will renounce its glory and its\nrights,” Fidel Castro wrote. “We are capable of producing the food and\nmaterial wealth that we need with the work and intelligence of our people.”\n\n","title":"Fidel Castro to Obama: We don't need your 'presents' - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Fidel Castro to Obama: We don’t need your ‘presents’ https://t.co/oA8iAG6BiI #Cuba #FidelCastro #Obama https://t.co/lgQIRqxuLq","date":"Mon Mar 28 13:38:13 +0000 2016","favs":45,"id":{"$numberLong":"714446496758964225"},"retweets":91},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/oL6reO"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f6b"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:****ANALYSIS**Rhetoric matters.The American people aren’t stupid – after the attack in Brussels they feel like their country is vulnerable, that the U.S. isn’t winning the war on terrorism, and that Belgium – through its weak information sharing and lose immigration policies – could’ve done more to prevent ISIS from claiming victory there last week.But that’s not how the Obama administration sees it.In an interview with ABC News late last week, Secretary of State John Kerry didn’t want to condemn Belgium for their handling of the attack.Since the terror event, Turkish officials said they warned the Belgium government about one of last week’s suicide bombers, and Belgian prosecutors admitted they missed a chance to question SalahAbdeslam, the only alleged perpetrator of November’s Paris attacks still alive, about future terrorists’ plots.Moreover, Mr. Abdeslam was only a few days prior to the attacks, discovered in his family neighborhood of Molenbeek, Brussels, roaming around the immigrant-heavy neighborhood in plain sight, despite the international manhunt for him.Yet, Mr. Kerry didn’t want to cast blame on Brussels.“I wouldn’t come to the conclusion that they screwed up,” Mr. Kerry said in an interview to ABC News, regarding Belgium’s security and intelligence failures before the attack last week. “They were the ones who captured Salah Abdeslam and that may have triggered this event. So I just think it’s unfair to keep leaping to the conclusion here.”Mr. Kerry also wanted to reassure the American people the U.S. is winning the war with ISIS, despite the terror attack. When questioned by CBS News after the attack, Mr. Kerry stood firm.“We are winning,” he said. “The fact that you can strike by sending a couple of would-be suicidal people into an airport to blow up a bomb does not indicate that they’re winning. It means they’ve just struck a horrible blow and been willing to take lives with them.”Compare Mr. Kerry’s rhetoric with Republican Donald Trump, who openly questioned America’s effectiveness in the war on terrorism, and has called out Brussels for its weak immigration policies and security network.“The terrorists are totally winning,” Mr. Trump said in an interview with Breitbart News after the Brussels attacks. “The terrorists are making us look like fools.”And there’s more to come, he warned.“I think this whole thing will get worse as time goes by,” Mr. Trump said in an interview last week on Fox News, predicting more attacks. “It’s being, you know, perpetrated all over the place now. Brussels is in very bad shape, but many cities will be this way with what’s taking place, and it’s really the policies of people who don’t know what they’re doing.”_Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"John Kerry v.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f6d"},"content":"The GOP has gone full Cold War, with the party’s two top presidential\ncandidates enmeshed in a heated debate over the composition of the North\nAtlantic Treaty Organization, formed to fight the Soviet Union.While the USSR\nevaporated a quarter-century ago, NATO has lurched along, taking on new roles,\nintervening in human rights crises, ousting autocratic leaders and assisting\nin the war on terror.But GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump challenged\nthe alliance’s usefulness, sparking what analysts said is a broader debate\nover the U.S. role in the world.“I don’t mind NATO per se, but it has to be\nreconstituted, it has to be modernized,” Mr. Trump said Monday on “Fox and\nFriends.” “You know, we’re dealing with NATO from the days of the Soviet\nUnion, which no longer exists. We need to either transition into terror or we\nneed something else, because we have to get countries together.”In the wake of\nlast week’s deadly terrorist attacks in Brussels that left about three dozen\ndead and dozens of others wounded, analysts said the timing of Mr. Trump’s\nquestioning the organization’s relevance was a bit odd.“It’s a little strange\nthat Trump has been so over-the-top about its relevance as nonexistent,” said\nGary Schmitt, co-director of the Marilyn Ware Center for Security Studies at\nthe American Enterprise Institute. “I think the strange thing is with the rise\nof Putinism, you would think NATO’s relevance would be important.”The\n28-member alliance of North American and European countries, originally signed\nin 1949, emerged as a major bulwark against the old Soviet Union during the\nCold War.Mr. Trump has pointed out that he was simply answering a question\nabout NATO, which came during a Washington Post editorial board meeting the\nday before the Brussels attacks and ended up helping precipitate the current\ndebate. He hasn’t backed down from his position in subsequent interviews,\nhowever, and says that after a few days of criticism, people are now agreeing\nwith him.But Sen. Ted Cruz, Mr. Trump’s top rival in the 2016 GOP race, has\nsaid Mr. Trump’s comments betray his lack of foreign policy\nknowledge.“Abandoning Europe, withdrawing from the most successful military\nalliance of modern times makes no sense at all,” Mr. Cruz said on “Fox News\nSunday.” “If Donald were president [and] he actually did what he said he would\ndo, withdraw from NATO, it would hand a massive victory to Putin, a massive\nvictory to [the Islamic State]. ISIS would be dancing in the street at the\nweakness and isolationism of Donald Trump.”Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the third\nremaining GOP candidate, appeared open to a discussion on rethinking the role\nof the alliance, using an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” this week to\ncall for a “dramatically reformed NATO.”“Right now we think of NATO as a\nmilitary organization,” Mr. Kasich said. “I think it needs to involve itself\nin policing and in intelligence gathering because, when we look at Europe\nright now, we find there’s so many holes and an inability of — their ability\nto get their act together.”Terrorism intelligence and information-sharing\nbetween NATO countries has come into sharp focus in the wake of the attacks in\nBrussels. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said last week that Belgian\nauthorities ignored a warning about suspected suicide bomber Ibrahim El\nBakraoui, who had been deported from Turkey last year.Emma Ashford, a visiting\nresearch fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, said it was “a bit\nunexpected” that Mr. Trump started talking about NATO.But, she said, it feeds\ninto one of his overarching themes of dividing everything into wins and\nlosses.

The only way to beat Donald Trump is with\nunity.”Cruz is positioning himself to win Wisconsin, next Tuesday’s only\ncontest, and the first primary since he began collecting the backing of\nestablishment Republicans, such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, adamant about\neliminating Trump.As Cruz campaigned across the state ahead of the Easter\nholiday, he was following a winning roadmap drawn by Wisconsin governor — and\nformer 2016 presidential hopeful — Scott Walker in 2010, up Wisconsin’s rural\nand working-class midsection, the same demographic that has driven Trump’s\nsuccess thus far.Cruz has mined the GOP vote-rich swath of farms and factories\nfrom south-central Wisconsin, up the Fox River Valley’s corridor of paper\nmills, small towns - among them, some of the most swing-prone counties in the\ncountry.The Fox River Valley, suburban Milwaukee and the rural counties\noutside Madison are home to 75 percent of Wisconsin’s most reliable Republican\nprimary voters, said Keith Gilkes, a veteran Walker adviser who worked for his\n2010 GOP primary campaign.“How Gov. Walker won was basically by winning the\nlower Fox Valley down through the Southeast,” Gilkes said. “That’s the holy\ngrail demographically for the Republican Party in Wisconsin.”Trump has\nslightly fewer than half of the Republican delegates allocated so far, short\nof the majority needed to clinch the nomination before the party’s national\nconvention this summer. Cruz has more than a third of the delegates, but is\nfocused equally on stopping Trump and uniting most of the party against him.If\nCruz wins most of the 42 delegates — which, in Wisconsin, are allocated on the\nbasis of state and congressional district winners — then the remaining winner-\ntake-all contests, in Delaware, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey and North Dakota\ncould determine the future of this competition. A solid Cruz win in Wisconsin\nwould likely require Trump to win those five contests to avoid clawing for the\nnomination at the party’s national convention in Cleveland.With that in mind,\nCruz and his wife Heidi campaigned last week in Waukesha County just west of\nMilwaukee, where expensive homes now occupy ground dairy herds once ruled. He\nappeared at a conservative conference with influential radio host Charlie\nSykes, a vocal Trump opponent who has a loyal suburban following and has\nendorsed Cruz.Cruz then pivoted, from the national security and values-minded\nsuburban voters, to the economic frustrations of more working-class voters in\nonetime industrial hub Janesville in south central Wisconsin.“I want to take a\nminute here and I want to talk to all the single moms who are working two and\nthree part-time jobs,” Cruz told more than 400 people Thursday.Cruz rebuked\nTrump’s criticism of Heidi Cruz, a detour from policy to personal that\nreceived sharp condemnation from some voters._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Donald Trump ready to visit Wisconsin, but Ted Cruz has head-start - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Donald Trump ready to visit Wisconsin, but Ted Cruz has head-start https://t.co/oXbCss7WfI #Wisconsin https://t.co/Le0ioqg9p0","date":"Mon Mar 28 10:57:44 +0000 2016","favs":4,"id":{"$numberLong":"714406109851869184"},"retweets":10},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/f6UUSG"}

Their advance marks the latest in a series of setbacks for IS, which has\ncome under mounting pressure on several fronts in Iraq and Syria in recent\nmonths.In comments reported on state TV, President Bashar Assad described the\nPalmyra operation as a “significant achievement” offering “new evidence of the\neffectiveness of the strategy espoused by the Syrian army and its allies in\nthe war against terrorism.”**PHOTOS: Syrian troops drive IS out of historic\nPalmyra**“new evidence of the effectiveness of the strategy espoused by the\nSyrian army and its allies in the war against terrorism.”Gen. Ali Mayhoub\nannounced on the station that that the fall of Palmyra “directs a fatal blow\nto Daesh, undermines the morale of its mercenaries, and ushers in the start of\nits defeat and retreat,” referring to IS by its Arabic acronym. He said it\nlays the ground for further advances toward Raqqa, the IS group’s de facto\ncapital, and Deir el-Zour, an eastern city it largely controls.Troops in\nPalmyra are now dismantling explosive booby traps planted by IS, the station\nreported. State TV and a Britain-based monitoring group later reported that\ntroops captured a military airport to the east.The advance marks a strategic\nand symbolic victory for the government, which has sought to portray itself as\na bulwark against terrorism. The town was an important juncture on an IS\nsupply line connecting its territory in central and northern Syria to the\nAnbar province in Iraq, where the group also holds territory.IS drove\ngovernment forces from Palmyra in a matter of days last May and later\ndemolished some of the best-known monuments in its UNESCO world heritage site,\nincluding two large temples dating back more than 1,800 years and a Roman\ntriumphal archway.State TV showed the rubble left over from the destruction of\nthe Temple of Bel as well as the damaged archway, the supports of which were\nstill standing. It said a statue of Zenobia, the 3rd century queen who ruled\nan independent state from Palmyra and figures strongly in Syrian lore, was\nmissing. Many of the Roman colonnades, however, were still standing.Artefacts\ninside the city’s museum also appeared heavily damaged on state TV. A\nsculpture of the Greek goddess Athena was shown decapitated, and the museum’s\nbasement appeared to have been dynamited, the hall littered with broken\nstatues.Still, state media reported that a lion statue dating back to the 2nd\ncentury, previously thought to have been destroyed by IS militants, was found\nin a damaged but recoverable condition.The extremists beheaded the\narchaeological site’s 81-year-old director Riad al-Asaad last August after he\nreportedly refused to divulge where authorities had hidden treasures before\nthe group swept in. They have destroyed a number of historical sites across\ntheir self-declared caliphate, viewing such ruins as monuments to idolatry.IS\nalso demolished Palmyra’s infamous Tadmur prison, where thousands of\ngovernment opponents were reportedly tortured.Syrian state TV hailed the\ngovernment’s advance, and a local reporter spoke live from inside Palmyra,\nshowing troops in the center of the town. Some of the nearby buildings had\nbeen reduced to rubble.Syrian Culture Minister Issam Khalil described the\nrecapture of Palmyra as a “victory for humanity and right over all projects of\ndarkness.” Maamoun Abdulkarim, director of the museums and antiquities\ndepartment in Damascus, said Palmyra’s Great Colonnade had suffered only minor\ndamage. “We will rebuild what you have destroyed,” he said, addressing\nIS._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Syrian troops drive ISIS out of historic Palmyra - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Syrian troops drive #ISIS out of historic #Palmyra https://t.co/T90yXOZkKn #Syria #IslamicState https://t.co/wEgx4Vm4u3","date":"Mon Mar 28 10:51:28 +0000 2016","favs":7,"id":{"$numberLong":"714404532646707201"},"retweets":8},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/dVAWP1"}

Chain\nrestaurants still don’t have to tell you, despite a 6-year-old law requiring\ncalorie labels on menus.Passed as part of the health care overhaul in 2010,\nthe rules will eventually require restaurants and other establishments that\nsell prepared foods and have 20 or more locations to post the calorie content\nof food “clearly and conspicuously” on their menus, menu boards and\ndisplays.This month, the Food and Drug Administration said it will delay the\nrules - again - until 2017.The years of delays have come as supermarkets,\nconvenience stores and other retailers that are covered by the rules but never\nwanted to be part of the law have fiercely lobbied against them. The move will\nleave the final step to a new president, despite the Obama administration’s\nstaunch support of menu labeling and other food policy to help Americans eat\nmore healthfully. And it will give opponents more time to gather support for\nlegislation that would roll back some of the requirements.Restaurants and\nother retailers originally had until the end of 2015 to comply. Last summer,\nthe FDA pushed that deadline back to the end of 2016. This month, they pushed\nthe deadline back again.Grocery stores and convenience stores have said the\nrules would be more burdensome for them than they would be for restaurants,\nwhich typically have more limited offerings. Pizza chains like Domino’s have\nalso opposed the rules, saying they don’t make sense for companies that take\nmost of their orders online.Margo Wootan is a lobbyist at the Center for\nScience and the Public Interest who was part of the original coalition and has\npushed for the supermarkets to be included. She says she is frustrated that\nconsumers are still waiting for the calorie information.“Not only is it simple\nand straightforward but so many states and localities have already done this,”\nshe said.Menu labeling is already required in a handful of places, including\nVermont, New York City and Montgomery County, Maryland. But several other\nstates put off their laws in anticipation of the federal rules.California, for\nexample, passed a law in 2008 but put that on hold after the federal standards\nbecame law in 2010. Today, menu labeling still isn’t enforced there.“We are\nvery frustrated,” says Harold Goldstein of the California Center for Public\nHealth Advocacy. “We call on the federal government to issue its regulations\nimmediately and allow both state and federal law to go into effect.”The latest\ndelay came after Congress included language in a year-end spending bill in\nDecember that allowed FDA to put off the December 2016 date until a year after\nit publishes the final guidance for retailers who have to put the rules in\nplace. This month, the agency said it is still working on those\nguidelines.“The FDA cannot speculate on the timing on when final guidance will\nbe issued,” said spokeswoman Lauren Kotwicki.Retailers have said compliance\ntakes time. Robert Rosado of the Food Marketing Institute, an association that\nrepresents grocery stores, said the delays only seem fair as some of the rules\nare complicated. In grocery stores, for example, the labeling rules apply to\nprepared foods, but exclude those that are typically intended for more than\none person. That could mean cut fruit or other foods would be labeled in a\nsalad bar, but not in a larger container for sale.“The anxiety is that they’re\ngoing to get it wrong,” Rosado said. “Maybe the font size isn’t right for\ntheir label or they rounded the calorie count the wrong way.”_Story Continues\n→_\n\n","title":"Looking for calorie labels on menus?

A breakaway Taliban faction, which publicly supports the Islamic\nState group, has claimed responsibility for the attack.Meanwhile, in the\ncapital of Islamabad, extremists protested for a second day outside Parliament\nand other key buildings in the city center. The demonstrators set cars on\nfire, demanding that authorities impose Islamic law or Sharia. The army, which\nwas deployed Sunday to contain the rioters, remained out on the streets.** SEE\nALSO: Facebook apologizes for activating ‘Safety Check’ feature for users\nnowhere near Lahore attack **The military reported raids in eastern Punjab\nprovince, where several deadly militant organizations are headquartered, and\nsaid dozens were arrested. Also Monday, Pakistan started observing a three-day\nmourning period declared after the Lahore attack.The Lahore bombing took place\nin a park that was crowded with families, with many women and children among\nthe victims. At least 300 people were wounded in the bombing.Even though a\nbreakaway Taliban group, known as Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, said it specifically\ntargeted Pakistan’s Christian community, most of those killed in Lahore were\nMuslims, who were also gathered in the park for the Sunday weekend holiday.\nThe park is a popular spot in the heart of Lahore.Of the dead, 14 have been\nidentified as Christians and 44 as Muslim, according to Lahore Police\nSuperintendent Mohammed Iqbal. Another 12 bodies have not yet been identified,\nhe said.Ahsanullah Ahsan, a spokesman for the breakaway Taliban faction, told\nThe Associated Press late Sunday that along with striking Christians\ncelebrating Easter, the attack also meant to protest Pakistan’s military\noperation in the tribal regions. The same militant group also took\nresponsibility for the twin bombings of a Christian Church in Lahore last\nyear.In recent weeks, Pakistan’s Islamist parties have been threatening\nwidespread demonstration to protest what they say is Prime Minister Nawaz\nSharif’s pro-Western stance. They have also denounced provincial draft\nlegislation in Punjab outlawing violence against women.Sharif had earlier this\nmonth officially recognized holidays celebrated by the country’s minority\nreligions, the Hindu festival of Holi and the Christian holiday of\nEaster.After a meeting with his security officials Monday, the prime minister\ncalled the perpetrators of the Lahore attack “cowards” and vowed to defeat the\n“extremist mindset.” Sharif also cancelled a planned trip to Great Britain.In\nLahore, dozens of families were bidding final farewell to their slain kin\nduring funeral ceremonies Monday.Shama Pervez, widowed mother of 11-year-old\nSahil Pervez who died in the blast, was inconsolable during funeral prayers.\nHer son, a fifth grader at a local Catholic school, had pleaded with her to go\nto the park rather than stay home on Sunday, and she said she finally gave\nin.On the outskirts of Lahore, in the Christian area of Youhanabad, mourners\ncrowded into a church that was targeted in an attack a year ago.“How long will\nwe have to go on burying our children,” said Aerial Masih, the uncle of Junaid\nYousaf, one of the victims in Sunday’s bombing._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Pakistan PM vows to fight terror after 70 died in Lahore - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Death toll from Easter bombing in #Pakistan reaches 70 https://t.co/4t5VDeiuPI #PakistanAttack #Easter https://t.co/uKGvnWQ1Ri","date":"Mon Mar 28 10:04:35 +0000 2016","favs":8,"id":{"$numberLong":"714392735705333760"},"retweets":26},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/dKwemk"}

Mr. Trump was awarded 18 delegates, so was Mr. Cruz, and Mr. Rubio got 5 delegates.So what happened between March 5 and Sunday? Mr. Rubio dropped out, and under Louisiana delegate rules, those pledged to Mr. Rubio became unbound — meaning they were free to choose whatever remaining candidates were left in the race. Looks like they chose Mr. Cruz.Mr. Cruz knows that in order to secure the number of delegates he needs to take the Republican nomination, he’s going to have to woo over Mr. Rubio’s supporters — and although he’s fallen short of an endorsement from the senator from Florida (as of now), many in the establishment lane are seeing Mr. Cruz as the only way to stop Mr. Trump.Not to mention the grunt work Mr. Cruz’s team is putting in.Mr. Cruz’s campaign has worked a state-by-state delegate strategy — both encouraging his supporters to run as delegates and by lobbying them to run and serve on various committees at the Republican National Convention.As The Wall Street Journal noted last week: “Mr. Cruz’s supporters seized five of Louisiana’s six slots on the three powerful committees that will write the rules and platform at the Republican National Convention and mediate disputes over delegates’ eligibility this summer in Cleveland.”Mr. Trump can threaten a lawsuit — but if he wants to win in politics, he needs to learn how the game’s played.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f74"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks here at home, I got into the habit of checking my email immediately upon waking to check in on the condition of the world. For the first year after 9/11 we had no idea what to expect day to day; we certainly believed more attacks were on the way.Unfortunately, every now and then for the past 15 years, the morning mail-check delivered news about another terror attack. Last week it was Belgium, and the immediate personal reaction is, what’s the plan? How are we helping?During President Obama’s presidency, learning of another terror attack also brings up the question: Will this be the act that compels him to behave as though something of enough importance has happened? Will he adjust his schedule and at least pretend to act like the president of the United States?Last week, we were again disappointed. The supposed Leader of the Free World essentially ignored several bombings in Brussels, the capital of the European Union. While in Cuba, Mr. Obama spent a full 51 seconds responding to the news of the Brussels attacks. He then went to a baseball game with one of Cuba’s communist dictators and did the spectator “wave.”After leaving the adulation of Cuba, the Obamas headed to a state dinner in Argentina where Mr. and Mrs. Obama thought it would be swell to dance the tango.We learned from our esteemed president that one does not need to fiddle as the world burns; one can choose to dance, instead. Mr. Obama was determined to make sure the inconvenience of dead people wouldn’t interfere with his recreation or imagined legacy.Americans are embarrassed by this behavior as it signals to us a man who doesn’t care; a man we elected and elevated to the greatest office in the world and he thanks us by using our trust and money to degrade the office and depress the people.But we did elect him and one could argue that we chose badly and must endure. Yet, Mr. Obama’s petulance, boredom and self-obsession during a time of war also has deadly consequences. While we get depressed and enraged at a president who spent more time attacking the dance floor than reflecting on another terrorist mass murder, the enemy sees surrender.We may get depressed, Islamist terrorist become emboldened. Mr. Obama’s behavior after the Brussels attacks signaled, at best, ambivalence about the slaughter. What sort of message do you think that sends?On Friday, with much fanfare, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter had a press conference announcing we had killed ISIS’ second in command in a Special Ops raid in Syria. This, you see, is supposed to show how committed we are to confronting and killing the terrorist menace.So why just one guy? Oh sure, it’s nice to blow up their leaders, but ISIS is now implementing the al Qaeda strategy of unleashing autonomous groups abroad, who act on their own. The scum who perpetrated the Paris and Brussels massacres weren’t waiting for instruction from Syria, they operated independently.Killing ISIS leadership means less every day as the cancer metastasizes. Leaders are replaced as hundreds, if not thousands, of fighters are allowed to live, train, and return bringing mass murder to the West.But don’t worry — Mr. Obama does have an additional weapon to complement his “Kill a guy every now and then” strategy — he insists we must fight them with words. The Weekly Standard reports:“President Obama has a new way to defeat the Islamic State: by telling the terror organization they are weak. Obama revealed his strategy at a press conference today in Argentina…“[W]e defeat them in part by saying you are not strong, you are weak. We send a message to those who might be inspired by them to say you are not going to change our values of liberty and openness and the respect of all people. And I mentioned at the baseball game yesterday, one of my proudest moments as president was watching Boston respond after the Boston Marathon attack.”_Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"TAMMY BRUCE: Obama behaves as if terrorism doesn't exist - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"TAMMY BRUCE: Nero fiddled; #Obama danced https://t.co/PBeAl0cOxW","date":"Mon Mar 28 09:06:13 +0000 2016","favs":9,"id":{"$numberLong":"714378047860957185"},"retweets":10},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/4akh0x"}

Ryan, saying that after donating\nto the Wisconsin Republican’s past campaigns he feels “betrayed” by the\nspeaker on trade deals and immigration.The businessman, who is not yet\nrevealing his identity, promised that his run will “shake up the establishment\nin a profound way,” according to a political consultant close to the\nprospective candidate.The emergence of a viable Republican challenger in\nWisconsin’s 1st Congressional District is the culmination of a monthslong\nrecruitment effort by tea party activists who say they were double-crossed by\nMr. Ryan when he passed a $2 trillion spending package late last year.Eric\nOdom, a conservative activist and political consultant in Wisconsin, confirmed\nwith “100 percent certainty” that a local business leader would be running to\noust Mr. Ryan.“I’ve had the privilege of attending multiple meetings with this\nindividual, during which he has expressed his sense of betrayal by Speaker\nRyan. He has a strong desire to see real representation for the people of the\ndistrict versus a congressman who represents special interests in Washington,”\nhe said.“It’s very personal for him,” Mr. Odom added. “He intends to run a\nfull-scale candidacy that will shake up the establishment in a profound\nway.”He acknowledged that it won’t be easy to defeat Mr. Ryan, who was the\nparty’s 2012 vice presidential nominee, currently ranks as one of the most\npowerful Republicans in Washington and has more than $5 million in his\ncampaign war chest.The businessman is prepared to put a substantial amount of\nhis personal fortune into the campaign, Mr. Odom said.“He was pushed to the\nedge and betrayed,” he said.While it’s often an uphill run, there is precedent\nfor a tea party challenger toppling a member of the House Republican\nleadership. Eric Cantor, while serving as majority leader, lost his seat in a\nRichmond, Virginia, suburb in a 2014 primary upset to tea party-backed Dave\nBrat.However, Mr. Ryan’s predecessor as speaker, John A. Boehner, easily\ndefeated a tea party-backed primary challenger the same year in Ohio. At the\ntime Mr. Boehner faced widespread opposition from conservatives and a revolt\nin the House Republican conference, which ultimately prompted him to resign in\nOctober.Mr. Ryan did not seek the speakership but was drafted by conservative\nand mainstream House Republicans who saw him as a unifying figure who could\nmend the divide in the conference.Still, the discontent on the homefront for\nMr. Ryan is part of the ongoing tension between conservatives who want\naggressive action to implement a right-wing agenda and party leaders who have\ntaken a measured approach.Mr. Ryan’s campaign team previously shrugged off\ntalk of a primary challenge. A spokesman did not immediately respond to\nquestions about confirmation that a viable candidate was getting into the\nrace.Mr. Ryan came under fire from conservatives shortly after he took the job\nof speaker in October and almost immediately pushed through the $2 trillion\nspending bill, which renewed popular tax breaks and increased the federal\ndeficit by hundreds of billions of dollars._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Paul Ryan faces primary challenge from wealthy businessman 'betrayed' by House speaker - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#PaulRyan faces primary challenge from wealthy businessman 'betrayed' by House speaker: https://t.co/JUDRBKLKjC #teaparty","date":"Mon Mar 28 04:11:26 +0000 2016","favs":29,"id":{"$numberLong":"714303863969472512"},"retweets":46},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/28/paul-ryan-faces-primary-challenge-wealthy-business/"}

Boasting not only first-rate fuel economy, the 2016 Mazda CX-3 also\noffers a nice style with a sporty feel and plenty of features inside that are\nmeant to stand out against the competition.With the subcompact crossover\nmarket offerings pretty saturated anyway, a few to compare include the Jeep\nRenegade and the Honda HR-V on the short list and there is also the Nissan\nJuke.The trim levels on this Mazda SUV include the Sport, Touring and Grand\nTouring. On the Sport base trim, you get 16-inch steel wheels, dual exhaust,\nrear roof spoiler, push button ignition, automatic headlights, intermittent\nwipers, tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel, push-button ignition, cloth\nupholstery, power accessories with cruise control and the technology add on\ngoodies like Bluetooth, six speakers, rearview camera, USB port, voice\ncontrols and a seven-inch touchscreen interface with a control knob on the\nconsole.Up one trim level and the Touring will give you not only heated\nmirrors, but a keyless entry and ignition, a front-row armrest, heated front\nseats and upgraded vinyl upholstery with a leather wrapped steering wheel and\nshift knob.On the high-end Grand Touring, you get 18-inch alloy wheels, LED\nfog lights, headlights and taillights, sunroof, leather and suede upholstery,\nnavigation system, automatic climate control, upgraded instrumentation and\nsteering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters. There is also a rear cargo cover and\nthe audio offers seven Bose speakers.The upgraded Grand Touring package is\ncalled i-Activsense and it adds automatic high beam headlight control and\nwipers with extra safety features that include lane departure warning and a\nforward collision mitigation system with automatic braking.If you want a few\nof the higher-end Grand Touring features on the lesser trims, there is the\nPremium package that gives you a sunroof, rear cargo cover and a higher end\naudio system.Under the hood, the 2016 Mazda CX-3 has a 2.0-liter four-cylinder\nengine with 146 horsepower and 146 pound-feet of torque with an automatic six-\nspeed transmission. While you can opt for all-wheel drive, front-wheel drive\ncomes standard.The 2016 Mazda CX-3 covers safety with antilock brakes,\nstability and traction control, front side and side curtain airbags as well as\na rearview camera. The Touring trim adds the blind-spot monitoring and rear\ncross-traffic alert and the Grand Touring includes the extra package with the\nforward collision mitigation system.As for the ride experience inside, the\nMazda folks have incorporated high-quality materials that combine with a\nclassy styling to give the driver and riders a sophisticated experience. On\nthe higher-end Grand Touring, there is even the tachometer and easy to read\ndigital speedometer that seems to fit the overall interior atmosphere just\nright.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f77"},"content":"President Obama’s deportation amnesty for illegal immigrant Dreamers approved\n93 percent of all applications decided through December — a strikingly high\nnumber that will likely play a role next month when the Supreme Court hears a\nlegal challenge to a broader amnesty.The program for Dreamers was considered a\ntest run for the broader amnesty Mr. Obama announced in late 2014, and which\nhas been held up by lower courts as judges sort out whether the administration\nhad the authority to grant tentative stays of deportation, issue work permits\nand make illegal immigrants eligible for some taxpayer benefits.For Mr. Obama,\nthe key to his argument is that he is not rewriting the law but only offering\nguidance on how to prioritize enforcement. He insists his officers still have\ndiscretion in every case to grant or deny amnesty, even if someone meets all\nthe criteria for the program, known in governmentspeak as Deferred Action for\nChildhood Arrivals, or DACA.But his opponents say the 93 percent approval rate\nundercuts that argument.“It tells me that they’re rubber-stamping DACA\napplications. Any program that four years after its initiation is still\napproving 93 percent of applicants is a program that doesn’t have very high\nstandards,” said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for\nImmigration Studies, which advocates for an immigration crackdown.Although\nDreamers were in little danger of being deported under Mr. Obama’s policies,\nDACA went further. It granted a proactive two-year stay of deportation, issued\nwork permits and Social Security numbers, and made illegal immigrants eligible\nfor some taxpayer benefits.The administration began accepting DACA\napplications in August 2012, in the middle of Mr. Obama’s re-election bid. In\n2014, after his party was crushed in midterm congressional elections, Mr.\nObama tried to expand the amnesty to three years and making as many as 5\nmillion illegal immigrant parents eligible.Texas led 25 other states in suing\nto stop the program, known as Deferred Action for Parental Accountability, or\nDAPA. Judges have halted the amnesty for parents while the case winds through\ncourts. The Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments April 18 and could\nissue a ruling by the end of June.While DACA is different from DAPA, the two\nare so closely related that the lower-court judges have used the performance\nof the Dreamer amnesty to inform their rulings on the broader program for\nparents. That’s why the DACA approval rate has become an issue.At of the end\nof last year, nearly 715,000 people had been approved and fewer than 55,000\nhad been rejected. That rate is similar to the 94 percent success rate of a\nfarmworker amnesty that was part of the 1986 amnesty. Reports said fraud\nwithin that program could have been as high as 50 percent.No such widespread\nfraud charges have been leveled against DACA, and advocates for Dreamers say\npart of the reason the approval rate is so high is that the immigrants\nthemselves have done a good job of making sure they are eligible before they\napply. That means there are fewer borderline cases to be judged, and possibly\ndenied.Also, the nearly $500 cost makes immigrants think carefully before\napplying, said Tom Jawetz, vice president of immigration policy at the Center\nfor American Progress.“There are a number of very good reasons why you would\nexpect to see an approval rate around where the approval rate is,” Mr. Jawetz\nsaid.He said a 7 percent denial is a “meaningful amount” that the lower court\njudges shouldn’t have dismissed.The 93 percent initial approval rate is lower\nthan at the beginning of the program._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Obama amnesty undercut by sky-high applications approval rate for illegal immigrant Dreamers - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#Obama #Amnesty undercut by sky-high approval rate for #Dreamers: https://t.co/24YIbKFW8e","date":"Mon Mar 28 01:28:15 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714262795123093504"},"retweets":8},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/27/obama-amnesty-undercut-by-sky-high-approval-rate-f/"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f78"},"content":"CHICAGO — At halftime, the unraveling seemed unthinkable. All of Virginia’s\nstaples were on point then, a period that an hour later felt like a lost era.\nIt defended viciously. Its offense pulled apart the Syracuse zone from the\noutside in. A rally for the Orange, after such an abysmal half against a\nveteran and top-seeded Virginia team, was almost unreasonable to suggest.Yet,\nVirginia walked off the floor with drooped heads after Syracuse came back for\na 68-62 win in the Elite Eight on Sunday night. The Orange, the No. 10 seed in\nthe Midwest Region, celebrated wildly following its hard-to-believe rally\nagainst Virginia, which was previously 68-0 under Tony Bennett when leading by\n10 points at halftime. It was up 14 points at the break on Sunday, spurring\nchecks for flights to Houston, the host city for the Final Four. At the horn,\nall viewers, the joyous and crushed, wondered what had just happened.“Just\nbeing so close to something you wanted so long, that’s the biggest shock,”\nAnthony Gill said.Virginia’s season closed with a mood-crunching thud,\nspreading the usual sorrow through a locker room, ending one of the greatest\nthree-year runs in program history. Malcolm Brogdon and his fellow seniors\nleave having accomplished things at the school not done since the early 1980s.\nThey tied for the most wins for a senior class. In the last three seasons, the\nCavaliers won more games than they had in any other three-year period. It’s\nlittle solace after being stopped again in the tournament as a heavy\nfavorite.For three consecutive seasons, Virginia has been ousted by a lower\nseed. No. 4 seed Michigan State toppled the Cavaliers in 2014, then again in\n2015 as a No. 7 seed. This time, it was the lowest-seeded Syracuse team\ncoached by Jim Boeheim in his 40 seasons at the school.“Did anyone here think\nthat would happen?” Boeheim asked from a stage on center court.There was no\nevidence for anyone to answer Boeheim in the affirmative. An initially\nstagnant Virginia offense was fixed by London Perrantes’ shooting in the first\nhalf. He made five 3-pointers before halftime, working varied celebrations as\nemotion grew with each make.Syracuse made one first-half 3-pointer in the\nfirst 20 minutes. Freshman Tyler Lydon lost a shoe, pump faked, then scored.\nThe make was so rare — the Orange had eight turnovers and made eight field\ngoals in the half — it was not out of line to suggest then that Syracuse may\nhave been more effective if everyone was a one-shoe shooter. Only two of\nSyracuse’s first-half field goals were from the initial halfcourt offense. The\nrest were putbacks or on the fast break. It trailed at the half, 35-21.Boeheim\nplotted. If Syracuse could move within 10 points, he would turn on the press.\nHe also altered the Orange’s offensive strategy. The ball screens Syracuse\nused often in the first half, an approach Virginia gobbles up with hard-\nhedging help defense, were set aside. He opened space for his prime players to\nwork alone. Virginia could not stop it.If Virginia had one mark, it was its\nmechanical processing of the good and bad. Led by Brogdon’s flatlined\nexpressions and Bennett’s limited reactions, the Cavaliers were built through\nolder players who souls were taught not quiver when the tension rose.Yet,\nSunday night, they cracked in an odd way. Virginia was often able to beat the\npress in the backcourt, only to be foiled when it had an advantage going to\nthe rim. Gill traveled. Lydon blocked a shot. Each time, Syracuse came back to\nscore.“In reality, they missed some plays they would normally make,” Boeheim\nsaid.By the end of the game, the first-half problems Syracuse went through\nappeared to have taken place on another planet. The Orange went on a stunning\n25-4 run to pull ahead 64-58 with 3:27 to play. Syracuse drove and drove to\nthe rim, putting Virginia in early foul trouble in the second half. Freshman\nMalachi Richardson could not be contained by the esteemed Virginia defense and\nBrogdon, the ACC defensive player of the year. For his work, Richardson, just\na freshman, was named the Midwest regional most valuable player after scoring\n23 points.“We turned the ball over when they started press —\nuncharacteristically,” Perrantes said. “They made some plays, some tough\nshots. It came down to turnovers and them making plays.”Virginia will look\ndistinctly different next year. Brogdon, Gill, Mike Tobey and Evan Nolte will\nbe gone. Perrantes will move into a role of senior point guard. The likelihood\nof the Cavaliers making it back atop the ACC, into the NCAA tournament as a\nNo. 1 seed and to the Elite Eight will be low._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Syracuse stuns Virginia, advances to Final Four after second-half rally - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Syracuse stuns #UVa, advances to #FinalFour after second-half rally, @Todd_Dybas writes: https://t.co/N1Dix3YqOg https://t.co/y75OTXiged","date":"Mon Mar 28 01:14:23 +0000 2016","favs":16,"id":{"$numberLong":"714259306850422784"},"retweets":7},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/1MuxRwn"}

Now the\nnational motorcycle club has inspired some legislation, based on the\norganization’s unwavering support for the “chair of honor” — a simple but\neffective public reminder of some 83,000 troops still missing in action or\nheld as prisoners of war.Each chair bears the stark, familiar POW/MIA emblem\nand remains permanently unoccupied; currently, there are chairs of honor\nplaced in 100 indoor and outdoor sites around the nation, including several\nmajor sports stadiums.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f7c"},"content":"The GOP presidential race is turning into a trench warfare fight for every\nlast delegate, and nowhere will that be more true than in Pennsylvania, where\nthe delegates themselves are elected directly by voters in the primary.That\nmeans that Republicans will go to the polls April 26 hoping to decide between\nDonald Trump, Ted Cruz and John Kasich — but their even bigger decision will\nbe between the likes of Christopher Vogler, Joan Miller and Cody Knotts, three\npeople who are among the 150 or so running for individual delegate slots to\nthe July convention.Unlike most states, where delegates are assigned to\ncandidates based on how the state votes, Pennsylvania puts most of its power\ndirectly into the hands of the delegates. The vast majority of its delegates —\n54 of 71 — are directly elected and go to the convention “unbound,” which\nmeans they can vote for whomever they want.Normally that’s not so important,\nwith a clear national winner emerging and all the delegates jumping on board.\nBut this year, with the prospect of a divided convention looming, each of\nPennsylvania’s unbound delegates could help tip the scales toward or against\nfront-runner Donald Trump come July.That makes Mr. Knotts, a filmmaker running\nfor one of the three unbound delegate slots from the state’s 9th Congressional\nDistrict, a hot commodity — though he says he’s publicly committing to vote\nfor Mr. Trump.“I am supporting Donald Trump,” he said, adding, “it kind of\ngets old being told that you are doing it because you are ill informed,\nignorant or stupid.”Mr. Knotts said after he signed up to run as a delegate,\nMr. Trump’s campaign sounded him out in January to see where he stood. It was\na striking show of organization for a campaign operation many analysts have\ndeemed amateurs in the delegate chase.“The big question they had way back was\n‘how do you feel about Ted Cruz?’” Mr. Knotts said. “It was still early enough\nthat they didn’t know what was going to happen in Iowa. They were prepared\nthat this was a race between Trump and Cruz. That is impressive [that] they\nhad enough foresight that they might need these delegates and had prepared to\nrecruit them.”The chances for a contested convention are higher than they’ve\nbeen in a generation. Mr. Trump has captured 754 of the 1,237 delegates needed\nto win the nomination, but would need to win about 60 percent of the bound\ndelegates across the remaining contests to guarantee victory on a first\nballot.Should he be short of the 1,237, he will either need to sway unbound\ndelegates such as the dozens from Pennsylvania, or else hope he can win over\nothers’ supporters if the race moves to a second ballot and beyond.Not all of\nthose running to be delegates in Pennsylvania are as certain as Mr. Knotts\nabout who they’ll support.Mr. Vogler, running for a slot from the state’s 1st\nCongressional District, said he had planned to back Sen. Marco Rubio, but now\nis leaning toward Mr. Kasich, governor of neighboring Ohio.“My main rationale\nof who I am going to vote [for] is who I feel is the best candidate to win in\nthe fall,” he said.Mr. Vogler is virtually assured of being a delegate since\nhe’s one of three people on the ballot for the three delegate slots from his\ndistrict.That makes him a good target for the campaigns, but he said he hasn’t\nheard from any of them yet. He did, however, receive a telephone call from a\nman urging him to vote for Mr. Trump._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Pennsylvania's directly elected, unbound delegates could tip scales in contested convention - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#Pennsylvania's directly elected, unbound #Delegates could tip scales in contested convention: https://t.co/yRLbmSKkNb #PennsylvaniaPrimary","date":"Mon Mar 28 00:07:23 +0000 2016","favs":4,"id":{"$numberLong":"714242443227566082"},"retweets":9},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/27/pennsylvanias-directly-elected-unbound-delegates-c/"}

In dire need to pay off a family debt, she accepted an\nemployment offer by a broker to work as a domestic helper in Malaysia only to\nfind herself trapped as a family slave and shared by four households.She\narrived from Cambodia with her 18-year-old daughter. They were supposed to\nwork together but, like the rest of the contract, that was a lie. Mother and\ndaughter were sent to different families.Thousands of such stories blight East\nAsia, stories made familiar by well-meaning nongovernmental organizations and\ncharities and a glittery cast of A-list Hollywood celebrities — including\nAngelina Jolie, Susan Sarandon and Minnie Driver — that have pushed their\ncause. But despite the star power and sometimes fawning media coverage, there\nare mounting questions about the transparency and effectiveness of some of the\norganizations purporting to help Ms. Srea and others.In Malaysia, an eight-\nhour day turned into 14 and Ms. Srea was ordered to clean the houses of her\nemployer’s mother, brother and sister. Her broker, who was eventually\nimprisoned, robbed Ms. Srea of her meager savings, and she was rescued only\nafter her father made a fuss with authorities.“I still haven’t heard from my\ndaughter in five months. I just want to find her and bring her back to\nCambodia,” she said in a hot and dusty union office in a dilapidated suburb of\nPhnom Penh.Hers is by no means an isolated case.In Hong Kong, a study released\nthis month by the Justice Center, which focuses on the plight of locally\ntrafficked people, found an astonishing 50,000 domestic workers — one in six —\nhad been forced into servitude.The report casts heavy doubt on the prevailing\nmyth that their plight has improved in recent years. It also calls into\nquestion the roles of NGOs and their cozy relationships with Western\ncelebrities, as well as the legislative reforms and efforts by enforcement\nagencies to end the scourge.“Current regulations can actually increase the\nvulnerability of workers to exploitation, and victims face very real barriers\nin seeking assistance and justice,” said Piya Muqit, executive director of the\nJustice Center.Hong Kong has a better reputation than most others for the\ntreatment of foreign maids, suggesting the numbers are even worse elsewhere in\nthe region.Malaysia and Singapore, where domestic help has emerged as a\nmiddle-class status symbol, face constant criticism for their treatment of\nmaids from authorities in the Philippines, Indonesia and Cambodia about poor\nliving conditions, minimal vacation and paltry wages.Press-ganging into the\nThai fishing industry or onto Malaysian rubber and palm oil plantations has\nproved equally worrisome, and the trafficking of girls into the sex industry\nis probably the most egregious example of the dreadful business.The\nInternational Labor Organization estimates that 21 million people are\ntrafficked annually.**Roles of NGOs**Private nongovernmental organizations\nhave taken up much of the work of highlighting and fighting the scourge.\nSeeking attention and funding, many have jumped onto the celebrity bandwagon\nsince 1997, when Britain’s Princess Diana became a torchbearer for land mine\nvictims during her famous visit to Angola._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Celebrity-backed efforts to fight human trafficking in Southeast Asia tainted by corruption - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Celebrity-backed efforts to fight human trafficking in Southeast Asia tainted by corruption: https://t.co/1CyXFAFKtZ","date":"Sun Mar 27 23:38:50 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"714235259110440962"},"retweets":9},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/27/celebrity-backed-efforts-to-fight-human-traffickin/"}

The Marine Corps lacks sufficient aircraft to fully\ntrain pilots. The Army and Marine Corps can wage small wars but doubt they can\nmeet the demands of a major conflict against, say, China or Russia, in a time\nframe called for in official military strategy.After this sober news, the\nHouse Armed Services Committee sounded the alarm: “Concerns are growing louder\nand more frequent about the real-life consequences of cuts to personnel,\ntraining, equipment and other military resources as the security situation\naround the world becomes more precarious by the day.”Rep. Mac Thornberry,\nTexas Republican and committee chairman, issued scary statistics. The Marine\nCorps’ major, or “Class A,” accident rate has shot up from an average of 2.15\nper 100,000 flying hours to 3.96.“We track this very closely, and the simple\nfact is that we don’t have enough airplanes to meet the training requirements\nfor the entire force,” said Gen. Robert Neller, Marine commandant. “The force\nthat’s deployed is trained and ready.”“Our ability to meet other regional\nrequirements for major contingency plans, we would build to do that, but we\nwould probably not be able to do it within the time frame that the current\nplans call for us to arrive to participate in that conflict,” Gen. Neller\nsaid.Gen. Mark Milley, Army chief of staff, said rotary pilots need a minimum\nof 14 flying hours a month to stay sharp but are getting only 10 hours.\nMeanwhile, the Army’s major accident rates are increasing.“It does have our\nconcern,” he testified. “Our aircraft accidents have increased, and we’re very\nconcerned about it.”Gen. Milley said the force, cut from more than 490,000 to\na planned 450,000, is sufficient for counterterrorism missions in Afghanistan\nand Iraq. But the overriding strategy of being able to fight a major overseas\nwar is in doubt.“If that were to happen, then I have great concerns in terms\nof readiness of our force, the Army forces to be able to deal with that in a\ntimely manner,” he said. “I think the cost, both in terms of time, casualties\nand troops, and the ability to accomplish military objectives would be very\nsignificant.”The reason: The overall status of Army Combat Brigade teams to\nmobilize and deploy has dropped.The Army supplies about 70 percent of troops\nand equipment requested by combatant commanders and has suffered nearly 70\npercent of all war casualties since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.“So you’ve got\nthe largest force, the largest demand, the largest stress and the least\nbudget,” he said.Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain, Arizona\nRepublican, has taken to issuing a readiness report at each service’s budget\nhearing._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"U.S. military's ability to fight major overseas war in doubt - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"U.S. military's ability to fight major overseas war in doubt: https://t.co/bxZcASa65x","date":"Sun Mar 27 22:56:49 +0000 2016","favs":11,"id":{"$numberLong":"714224686658424832"},"retweets":28},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/27/us-militarys-ability-to-fight-major-overseas-war-i/"}

Bernard Sanders of Vermont claimed the momentum Sunday in the race for\nthe Democratic presidential nomination, celebrating a trio of landslide\nvictories over the weekend and calling on the party’s superdelegates to defect\nfrom front-runner Hillary Clinton.Mr. Sanders got the burst of energy after\ncrushing Mrs. Clinton in Democratic caucuses Saturday in Alaska, Hawaii and\nWashington, three contests in which he topped her by an average 49 points.“We\nare making significant inroads in Secretary Clinton’s lead,” Mr. Sanders said\non CNN’s “State of the Union” program. “The momentum is with us. A lot of\nthese superdelegates may rethink their position with Secretary Clinton.”Mr.\nSanders, a self-described democratic socialist whose far-left agenda has\ncaught fire with young and liberal voters, turned his sights on superdelegates\nas he pivoted toward upcoming key contests in Wisconsin and New York, where he\nhopes to keep closing in on Mrs. Clinton.He has got to convince party leaders\nand voters that he can make the math work to win the nomination, which is\nstill a long shot.In Wisconsin, which votes April 5, Mr. Sanders will\nchallenge Mrs. Clinton’s appeal to blue-collar workers. And then he hopes to\nput Mrs. Clinton on defense with liberal voters in her adopted home state of\nNew York, which votes April 19.Despite Mr. Sanders‘ huge victories this\nweekend, Mrs. Clinton remains the prohibitive favorite. She still maintained a\nmassive lead in the delegate hunt, in part due to her dominance of the\nsuperdelegates, who are elected officials and party leaders who are free to\nback whomever they chose at the convention.Mrs. Clinton had 1,712 delegates,\nincluding 469 superdelegates, and Mr. Sanders had 1,004 delegates, including\n29 superdelegates, according to a tally by The Associated Press.It takes 2,383\ndelegates to secure the Democratic nomination.“A lot of these superdelegates\nmay rethink their position with Secretary Clinton, a lot have not yet\ndeclared, and then you have superdelegates that are in states where we win by\n40 or 50 points,” said Mr. Sanders. “I think their own constituents are going\nto say to them, ‘Hey, why don’t you support the people of our state [and] vote\nfor Sanders.’”He argued that the superdelegates also should rethink their\nallegiance in light of polls that show him beating Republican front-runner\nDonald Trump by larger margins.A recent Fox News poll showed Mr. Sanders\ntopping Mr. Trump by 14 points in a theoretical matchup, compared to Mrs.\nClinton beating the billionaire businessman by 11 points.Mr. Sanders continues\nto draw crowds of thousands to his events, which dwarf Mrs. Clinton’s rallies.\nHe regularly beats Mrs. Clinton with young voters and liberal voters, although\nMrs. Clinton has dominated with minorities and older voters.Mr. Sanders also\ndoes well in caucuses and when there are large turnouts, as was the case\nSaturday.Mr. Sanders overwhelmed Mrs. Clinton in Alaska 81 percent to 18\npercent, in Washington 72 percent to 27 percent and in Hawaii 69 percent to 30\npercent, according to unofficial results._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Bernie Sanders urges superdelegates to abandon Hillary Clinton - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#BernieSanders weekend wins give momentum in race with #HillaryClinton.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f81"},"content":"For a religion in which wine plays such a central role, Christianity may prove\nsurprisingly effective at curbing drug use, according to a study.Data analyzed\nby DrugAbuse.com in “Drugs and Devotion: Comparing Substance Abuse by\nBelievers and Nonbelievers” show a correlation between religious belief and a\nreluctance to experiment with narcotics.Americans who said they are not\nreligious are more likely to have used a host of illicit drugs, ranging from\nmarijuana and alcohol to Ecstasy and heroin. Nonbelievers in the study, for\ninstance, were 12 times more likely to use LSD and more than four times likely\nthan their religious counterparts to try cocaine in the past\nyear.Additionally, states with the lowest rates of religious belief had some\nof the highest rates of drug use. The least-religious state, Vermont, where\nonly 32 percent of residents said religion is “very important” in their lives,\nhad the third-highest rate of illicit drug use. The most religious state,\nAlabama, where 77 percent said faith plays a significant role in their lives,\nhad the sixth-lowest rate of illicit drug use.Greg Jao, director of campus\nengagement and vice president of InterVarsity Christian Fellowship, said\nseveral components of Christianity, such as its emphasis on truth and\ncomprehensive view of eternity, discourage nihilistic tendencies that may open\nthe door to drug use.“For me as a Christian, part of what my faith in Jesus\ndoes is it calls me to face reality ruthlessly in my own life and in the world\naround me,” Mr. Jao said. “I think it changes my perspective and timeline. I’m\nchallenged as a Christian to think in terms of eternity — so, yes, this year\nor decade may be bad, but it’s not the whole of my existence.“And I think\nChristianity challenges you to actually experience God in the quotidian, day-\nto-day experience of life,” he said. “So my need for an altered, super high is\nquite low because, in fact, while I may not always be happy, there’s a deep\nexperience of regular joy.”The study supports the notion that Christian\ntheology discourages drug use. When asked for “very important” reasons not to\nuse marijuana, 67 percent of religious eighth- and 10th-graders said it is\nagainst their faith. Nonbelievers in the study had little reason not to use\nmarijuana. Only 27 percent of nonreligious high school students said it would\nviolate their beliefs.But Gen. Arthur Dean, chairman and CEO of Community\nAnti-Drug Coalitions of America, emphasized the role that community plays in\nsnuffing out drug use.“Being involved in a religious service is what we would\ncall a protective factor, which means that you are less apt to get involved in\ndrugs or other negative activities that young people are involved in, if you\nare involved in some kind of a faith community,” Mr. Dean said.“What we find\nis that involvement in structured activities, whether they be religious or\nwhether they be sports or other kinds of activities, all serve as protective\nfactors,” he said. “I believe if you did research on them, you would find\nsimilar results that you found on religion.”The study also supports the\nhypothesis that communal norms best explain lower rates of drug use among the\nreligious. Fifty-nine percent of religious high school students said their\nfriends don’t use marijuana, compared with 39 percent of nonreligious\nstudents; 62 percent of religious students said their boyfriend or girlfriend\nwould disapprove of drug use, compared with 42 percent of nonreligious\nstudents; and 81 percent of religious high school students said their parents\nwould disapprove of marijuana, compared with 62 percent of nonreligious\nstudents.The religious eighth- and 10th-graders were also more likely to say\nmarijuana is not widely available and that they would not like being around\nothers who do use the drug.Although he acknowledged the crucial role that\ncommunity plays in reinforcing norms, Mr. Jao said Christianity specifically\nprovides a remedy against addiction that other groups may not.He said\nChristians believe they are “addicted to sin,” comparing the faith’s\nfundamental tenants of resisting temptation, confessing wrongdoing and\ntransformation to addiction-fighting programs such as Alcoholics\nAnonymous._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Christianity helps curb drug use, study finds - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#Christianity helps curb drug use, study finds: https://t.co/0cFxY1vaQA","date":"Sun Mar 27 22:38:33 +0000 2016","favs":22,"id":{"$numberLong":"714220090783350785"},"retweets":24},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/27/christianity-helps-curb-drug-use-study-finds/"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f82"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**We’re going to miss Alfred Morris.It’s not the 1,613 yards he gained in his 2012 rookie season we’re going to miss. That’s long in the past, as the running back’s production has dropped every year since, down to 751 yards last season.It’s not his effusive personality we’re going to miss. He was a likeable guy from most accounts, but we never really heard much from Morris, who was reluctant to talk to the media and, like his run production fell, grew more reluctant as his years in Washington went on.What is it we are going to miss about Morris? His car. His 1991 Mazda 626.  \nWe rooted for Morris because he was the sixth-round draft pick who came out of\nnowhere in 2012 and set the Redskins’ single-season rushing record. We fell in\nlove with him because he drove a clunker.We felt we knew Morris because he\ndrove a car that many of us would have driven in high school. He was an\neveryman. It became his identity, and, in an era of bankrupt athletes holding\nsigns begging for money on Rockville Pike, he came to become a symbol of the\nfootball star as every man.“It has some sentimental value to it now,” Morris\ntold reporters in 2012. “It just keeps me grounded, where I came from and all\nthe hard work for me to get to this point. So, that’s what helps me.“I love my\ncar, and that’s what I’m going to drive,” he said. “I’m a lot better off than\nI was but at the same time … I feel like it’s a waste of money to go buy a new\ncar if my car is running perfectly fine, you know? I just don’t get that\nconcept.“I’m not a flashy guy,” Morris said. “I don’t like showing off. I’m\nreal reserved. I like flying under the radar; I don’t like drawing extra\nattention to myself. At the end of the day, I’m just a normal guy. My car\nstill gets me from Point A to Point B, and that’s more than enough for me.”It\nbecame a media event when Mazda offered to refurbish the car — he called it\nhis “Bentley” — but still spoke of what the car symbolized to him.“She hasn’t\nchanged,” he told reporters. “I mean, she looks different, but it’s still the\nsame car. It a feel thing. Sometimes when something changes, you’re like, ‘Oh\nman, I want it the old way.’ But when I sat in her, I still got that feeling.\nShe’s still The Bentley.”You can’t buy the attention that Morris got because\nof his car.Hours after the news surfaced on Tuesday that Morris signed a two-\nyear deal with up to $5.5 million with the Dallas Cowboys, the headline on a\nDallas website read, “Why new Cowboy Alfred Morris makes millions, but drives\na 1991 Mazda.”He may have stumbled on to something — the clunker as a public\nrelations symbol. The rich professional athlete driving a Rent-A-Wreck makes\nnews.Sports Illustrated did a lengthy profile of San Antonio Spurs star Kawhi\nLeonard, yet the one item that made headlines was the fact that he drives a\n1997 Chevrolet Tahoe — the car he drove as a teenager. “It runs, and it’s paid\noff,” Leonard said._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"LOVERRO: Alfred Morris' old car helped create identity as Redskins' everyman - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Alfred Morris’ humility will be missed most after leaving #Redskins, @thomloverro writes: https://t.co/QCQF2Qv9at https://t.co/CjN8cZ9mY3","date":"Sun Mar 27 22:30:22 +0000 2016","favs":2,"id":{"$numberLong":"714218029375234048"},"retweets":4},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/1RyrKWX"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f83"},"content":"VIERA, Fla. — Dusty Baker sat in the dugout and knocked on the handle of his\nred-barreled bat. The Washington Nationals’ manager does not consider himself\nto be superstitious, but he did it anyway.With the regular season just eight\ndays away, Baker doesn’t want to take any chances. Aside from pitcher Bronson\nArroyo’s shoulder injury, the Nationals have made it through spring training\nwith a fairly clean bill of health.“We’re doing outstanding,” Baker said\nbefore the Nationals’ 7-2 split-squad win against the Atlanta Braves on Sunday\nat Space Coast Stadium. “We’ve got to knock on wood. I don’t believe in\njinxes, but things are going pretty well.”Staying healthy is paramount for\nevery team in the spring, but especially so for the Nationals, who were\nravaged by injuries in 2015. Former center fielder Denard Span, infielder\nAnthony Rendon and left fielder Jayson Werth — the projected top three hitters\nin the order — all got hurt before opening day and missed a combined 257\ngames. First baseman Ryan Zimmerman was placed on the disabled list in June\nwith plantar fasciitis in his left foot and played in 95 games.Zimmerman, 31,\nhas been handled the most carefully this spring as the Nationals try to manage\nthe injury. He did not play in a spring training game until March 13 and even\nthen, he spent his first two games as the designated hitter. Since then,\nZimmerman has played in a total of 11 games with seven starts at first base.In\nSunday’s win against the Braves, Zimmerman was at his best. He went 3-for-4\nand drove in three runs before exiting the game in the top of the eighth\ninning. On the first play of the second inning, Zimmerman dove to his right to\nglove a grounder hit by catcher Tyler Flowers and flipped it to pitcher Gio\nGonzalez for the out.“Body feels great,” Zimmerman said. “I’m happy with my\nat-bats. The key down here for veteran guys is just to stay healthy, get some\nat-bats, not care too much about the results. You trust yourself by now that\nwhen the season starts, it is what it is. You can hit .600 down here or .200\ndown here and the key is to stay healthy, get into game shape and get ready to\ngo. I feel good. Feel like I’m in a good spot and I’m excited about this\nyear.”For Zimmerman, that excitement follows two years filled mostly with\nfrustration. There was a time when the Nationals’ slugger was incredibly\ndurable and played 142 games or more in six of his first eight seasons as\nfull-time starter. However, he combined to play only 156 games in 2014 and\n2015. Last year, it was the plantar fasciitis. Before that, it was an ongoing\nright shoulder injury — which ultimately led to his switch from third to first\nbase — and a torn hamstring.“I was fairly healthy, playing a lot of games a\nyear and I took a lot of pride in that,” Zimmerman said. “To not be able to\nplay and get hurt is frustrating because we all want to play, we all want to\ncompete and to not be able to do that sucks.”He chalks his injuries up to\nequal parts bad luck and normal wear and tear. What’s perhaps most frustrating\nabout the last two years is how well he has been playing when he’s actually on\nthe field. Zimmerman and the Nationals were able to manage the plantar\nfasciitis injury enough for him to return on July 28. In his next 39 games,\nZimmerman hit .311 with 11 home runs and 39 RBI. His season ended when he\ninjured his left oblique on Sept. 7.Now, Zimmerman has to cautiously approach\nhis offseason workouts. He said he hardly runs anymore and has tweaked his\nexercises.“Nothing cool to talk about,” Zimmerman quipped.He’s eschewed heavy\nweights for core exercises and muscle stretching and joked that his warmup and\nrehab exercises take longer than the actual workout, except only that it’s\ntrue.It’s just little things,” Zimmerman said. “You concentrate on things that\nfive years ago you didn’t have to. When you’re young, you have to learn what\nto do to have success early without experience. Once you have experience and\nstart to get older, you have to learn how your body adapts and what you need\nto do to stay on the field.”When Zimmerman has been on the field this spring,\nhe has felt comfortable, much like he did when he had the foot injury under\ncontrol last season. Right now, maintaining that same level of comfort is all\nhe can hope for as he tries to steer clear of any setbacks._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Nationals' Ryan Zimmerman taking steps to prevent recurrence of foot injury - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"#Nats’ Ryan Zimmerman taking steps to manage recurring foot injury, @AnthonyGulizia writes: https://t.co/bnOeFiYKOW https://t.co/sbQYATKypr","date":"Sun Mar 27 22:21:50 +0000 2016","favs":2,"id":{"$numberLong":"714215881593761792"},"retweets":3},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/1RmQbaZ"}

Ted Cruz blaming front-runner Donald Trump for planting a\nsex scandal story about him in the National Enquirer.The two men and their\nallies have been trading insults, threats, accusations and denials for days,\nincluding jabs at the candidates’ wives that have reduced the Republican race\nto a gutter brawl.Amid the bickering over who insulted who’s wife, the\nNational Enquirer rocked the Cruz campaign with an expose saying the\nconservative, Bible-thumping senator from Texas had cheated on his wife,\nHeidi, with five women.“This story is garbage. It is tabloid smear, and it\ncame from Donald Trump and his henchmen.” Mr. Cruz said on “Fox News\nSunday.”He noted that the only person quoted on the record in the article was\nRoger Stone, a former top political adviser to Mr. Trump, and that National\nEnquirer publisher David Pecker is a close friend of the real estate\ntycoon.Mr. Cruz challenged the claim that Mr. Stone had parted ways with the\nTrump campaign.“Roger Stone remains the henchman, the hatchet man, the\nenforcer for Donald Trump,” he said. “He’s pushing these attacks. And, by the\nway, he’s been pushing them for many months.”It was the latest round in an\nincreasingly dirty fight between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz.Despite his anti-\nestablishment reputation, Mr. Cruz has become the champion of the Republican\nParty’s “Never Trump” effort.In an appearance on ABC’s “This Week,” Mr. Trump\ninsisted that he had nothing to do with the National Enquirer story that said\nMr. Cruz’s extramarital affairs included “a hooker, a teacher \u0026amp;\ncoworkers.”“I have nothing to do whatsoever with the National Enquirer, and\nneither did the campaign. And I will tell you, for him to try to say that I\nhad [something] to do with it and put the shoe on the other foot is\ndisgraceful,” Mr. Trump said.He added: “And, by the way, he’s the one that\nstarted it.”The reality TV star blamed Mr. Cruz for initiating the exchange of\nattacks about the candidates’ wives.Those personal exchanges began when an\nanti-Trump super PAC called Make America Awesome, in an ad before Utah’s\ncaucuses, used a revealing picture from a GQ photo shoot of Mr. Trump’s former\nsupermodel wife, Melania.In the ad, a nude photo of Mrs. Trump sprawled on a\nfur rug was accompanied by the caption: “Meet Melania Trump.

Chuck Grassley during his regular county meetings in Iowa on\nMonday and Tuesday over his refusal to hold hearings on President Obama’s\nnominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Merrick Garland.Each year, Iowa’s senior\nsenator holds the town-hall-style meetings in all 99 counties, a feat known as\nthe “Full Grassley” tour. But during the Senate’s two-week Easter recess this\nspring, activists from groups such as MoveOn.org and Credo Action are holding\nevents in the home states of Republican senators opposed to granting a hearing\nfor Judge Garland.Mr. Grassley, chairman of the SenateJudiciary Committee, is\nfacing re-election and is a prime target.A conservative operative said he\nexpects “there will be a lot of attention” on Mr. Grassley’s meetings, to be\nheld in the state’s most conservative counties, Osceola, Lyon and Sioux in the\nnorthwestern corner of the state. An Iowa group called Why Courts Matter has\nset up a “Where Is Chuck” hotline and email network to encourage attendance at\nhis meetings.Mr. Grassley, who broke with Senate Majority Leader Mitch\nMcConnell, Kentucky Republican, by agreeing to meet with Judge Garland after\nthe recess, said in a statement that representative government “is a two-way\nstreet.”“I’m one-half of the process and the people of Iowa are the other\nhalf,” he said. “You can’t have representative government without dialogue\nbetween elected officials and the people we represent. I appreciate the\nopportunity to hold town meetings, answer questions and take comments.”Senate\nDemocrats have been harsh in their criticism of Mr. Grassley. Senate Minority\nLeader Harry Reid of Nevada has accused him of “allowing himself and his\ncommittee to be manipulated by the Republican leader for narrow, partisan\nwarfare.”Democrats are hoping that Mr. Grassley is vulnerable to a challenge\nby former Iowa Lt. Gov. Patty Judge, a Democrat who announced her candidacy\nafter the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.But Mr. Grassley,\nrunning for his seventh term in the Senate at age 82, seems an unlikely target\nfor cracking under pressure. Longtime colleague Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, Utah\nRepublican, recently observed: “You’re never going to bully Sen. Grassley to\nchange his mind.”Mr. Grassley also has the support of Iowa Gov. Terry\nBranstad, a Republican who happens to be the second cousin of Judge Garland.\nMr. Branstad said he is proud of his cousin but added, “I also respect and\nappreciate and support Sen. Grassley in his position.”Still, Democrats are\ngleeful about other gaps emerging in the Senate Republicans’ united front.\nLast week, Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas became the third Republican to announce\nthat he favors hearings and a vote on Judge Garland’s nomination, joining\nRepublican Sens. Susan M. Collins of Maine and Mark Kirk of Illinois.Mr.\nMoran, who led the Senate Republicans' campaign committee in 2014 and is\nrunning for re-election this year, is facing a backlash from conservatives.\nAdam Brandon, head of the conservative activist group FreedomWorks, said Mr.\nMoran’s support for a vote on Judge Garland “is a perfect example as to why\nconservative activists have no faith in their elected officials.”“They send a\nsignal that Republicans will sell out their principles when it becomes\npolitically convenient to do so,” he said.Hoping to head off a firestorm, Mr.\nMoran issued a statement of clarification late Friday that he plans to vote\nagainst Judge Garland if the confirmation process gets that far._Story\nContinues →_\n\n","title":"Chuck Grassley faces Merrick Garland hearing supporters on Iowa tour - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Sen.

Before we got here, a suspect in November’s terrorist attack in Paris was captured. Not less than three days later — in what seemed to be an accelerated operation — a major attack was carried out in Brussels, leaving more than 30 people dead and hundreds more wounded.Belgians are shell-shocked; it has been a long time since Belgium has played a major strategic geopolitical role, so they are wondering why they have been targeted. There is speculation here on the ground that the attack was initially planned for Paris, but changed once one of the major conspirators was arrested.All of Europe is on high alert, with first responders armed with automatic rifles patrolling the streets. In the wake of the attacks, France boosted security, tightening border controls and deploying over 1,600 additional police officers in an effort to keep anyone without the appropriate identification and tickets from getting access to public areas at train stations and airports.But people are bewildered nonetheless, feeling a sense of helplessness on why they are being targeted and what, if anything, can be done to prevent these senseless murders.Terrorism is a complex idea to grasp for many of us living in the West — difficult to conceptualize, and understandably so. There is a significant gap in intelligence and conceptual understanding of the threat and of who they, the radical Islamists, are. These gaps don’t just end there but also correspond to a gap in the tools, tactics and techniques that law enforcement have at their disposal to deal with Islamist violence.Sunni Muslim terrorism is a symptom of defeat, anger and fear of annihilation. Terrorists believe that the world as it exists is not beneficial to their way of life or values or religion, a belief not without some justification. Muslim populations have been utterly destroyed in the aftermath of the Iraq War — due both to internecine violence between various Muslim sects and the invading armies of the West. Civilian deaths occur on a scale that is unimaginable to the West. There are multiple Paris-style attacks every month in Syria, Pakistan and Iraq. So there is a sense of an injustice being done at home to their people, and many see the West as supporting the regimes that foment such violence.Saudi Arabia has been a major exporter of terrorism — both in terms of providing financial support for ISIS and a comfortable home for the Wahhabist strain of Sunni Islam that has formed the ideological backbone for Islamism. That 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden came from a wealthy Saudi family is not of minor significance. And while the government of Saudi Arabia has been an ally of the U.S. for several decades, the U.S. military presence on Saudi soil has not been warmly received by many of the nation’s religious leaders.And yet, “for every Osama bin Laden or Ayman al-Zawahiri, 50 people are joining the Islamic State driven by anger, not ideology,” said Robert Ford, former U.S. ambassador to Syria. Though the ambassador spoke of orthodox Sunni Muslims, his logic could apply to any religious group believing it faces extinction or degradation of its values and beliefs. Let us recall Buddhist monks set themselves on fire during the Vietnam War.Sunnis see their recent history as one of uninterrupted humiliation and defeat. One only needs to look at what has occurred and what is currently in process: Palestine, two Russian wars in Chechnya, the 2001 rout of the Taliban, the 2003 Iraq War that impoverished and disenfranchised Iraq’s Sunni minority, the drone campaigns in Pakistan and Yemen, the bombings of Syria and Iraq, and the complete destruction of the Iraqi Sunni towns of Tikrit and Ramadi.For Sunni Muslims, their entire universe has been centered on defeats and catastrophe. Beirut, Baghdad, Sanaa and Damascus — four historical Sunni capitals, have all fallen to their Shiite enemy. Deep corruption, harsh demographic realities of overpopulation, crippling unemployment — specifically for the youth and poor — along with a lack of quality education are all factors that have led to an environment of anger and hostility.Many have wrangled over the best course to take in defeating the threat to public safety that these radicalized Muslims pose to the world. There is no easy answer. But understanding the threat demands that we become better students of these terrorist organizations, their ideological influences and their ultimate aims._**• **Armstrong Williams is on the ground in Paris with his HSH TV and social media crew._\n\n","title":"ARMSTRONG WILLIAMS: Deciphering the Islamic State mindset - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Armstrong Williams on decoding what the #IslamicState is up to. #ISIL #Belgiumbombing\n\nhttps://t.co/rudPh4gKHi https://t.co/r108xNtOxQ","date":"Sun Mar 27 21:45:30 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"714206739286110209"},"retweets":8},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/27/armstrong-williams-deciphering-the-islamic-state-m/"}

Together\nthey comprise what is widely known as Los Cabos. In some ways the locations\ncould not be more different but they are held together by a steady stream of\nvisitor traffic flowing from a 20-mile corridor of hotels and resorts fondly\ntagged Millionaire’s Row.For the glitterati of Hollywood, this means roiling\nbreakers and golden sun are but a two-hour private jet tootle from Santa\nMonica. For the rest of the world the all of what Los Cabos has to offer, from\nart galleries and haute cuisine to simple crab chasings along the tide pools,\nis an easy trip on commercial airlines from a variety of U.S. destinations and\none that is likely to be as affordable or as expensive as one wishes.Luxe\nLodging in CabosThe lively line-up of luxury lodging along the lavish\noceanfront corridor runs the gamut of mid to luxury class budgets. Think adult\nall-inclusive, such as Secrets Marquis, to such five-star citadels as the\nOne\u0026amp;Only Palmilla, Capella Pedregal, Rosewood’s Las Ventanas al Paraiso,\nand Auberge Resorts’ La Esperanza. Tucked into to this cast of luminaries is a\nfamily-owned hotel that whispers luxury rather than shouts it and puts it in\nreach of a wide range of pockets.The Hacienda Encantada in Cabo San Lucas is\nan easy 20-minute drive from the international airport and a convenient spot\nabout equal distance from the harbor hamlet of Cabos San Lucas and the tony\ntown of San Jose del Cabo. However, as an all-inclusive with five dining\nvenues, endless pools, a spa and plenty of loungers looking over the breaking\nwaves, there is not a lot of reason to leave.The property has 150 rooms with\nprecious kitchenettes, couple-sized Jacuzzi tubs with windows into the room\nand views, amble closet space, granite and Spanish tile bathrooms, walk-in\nshower, private commode and pretty much anything else you can ask for. Yes,\nthere is coffee, thanks to handy Hamilton Beach Brew Stations and daily\npackets of sustenance. But there is breakfast too, probably a highlight of the\nday in the Las Marias buffet overlooking the surf.There, wait staff know your\nname and get your favorite eggs as you pore over the plethora of fresh fruit\nand hot meal dishes around the food station. The restaurant leads down to some\nlower levels where gourmet dining lights up the evenings while a harpist\nstrums, waves break and a delicious breeze blows in from the east. Guacamole\nlovers can learn to make a mean mixture of their own in cuisine classes\noffered onsite, chips included.Unlike many of its compadres along these golden\nmiles of, Hacienda Encantada is family owned and you can see touches of that\nin the décor, the paintings, the furniture choices where flourishes seem to\nhave the personal eye of mothers, aunts and actively involved sons. According\nto Gabriel Ibarra, Director of Sales and Marketing for Mexico Grand Hotels,\nthe hotel’s parent branding, his uncles made their start with opening Carlos\n‘n Charlies and Señor Frog’s. The hotel business was not far behind with\nMarina Fiesta located right in the center of the action in Cabo San Lucas, and\nHacienda Encantada on the tourist corridor.Opening this spring is the El\nEncanto de la Hacienda on a stunning spread of oceanfront just steps away from\nthe Hacienda’s established accommodations. These are 52 owned studios and\nmulti-bedroom units that will have their own amenities — infinity pool,\nrestaurants, a swim-up bar and a designated event space for weddings, as well\nas total access to all of the amenities at the main resort. For guests of any\nGrand Hotel location, an option to book room only is always on the table. But\nfor guests that choose the all-inclusive plan, they can dine at all of the\nresort’s restaurants including those restaurants and eateries located in the\nparty-focused marina of Cabos San Lucas.Los Cabos: Beyond Los ArcosOnce the\ndining and the sun dosing pass their prime, and that itch to explore beyond\nthe pool bar takes hold, Los Cabos has a wealth of options for easy day trips\nthat move well past the iconic Los Arcos imprint of the destination. At\nHacienda Encantada, there is usually a dedicated concierge or two available to\ncreate a packaged outing from most interests. And there is no shortage of tour\nmongers peddling trips to nearby beaches, whale watching, dolphin petting,\nhorseback riding, dirt-biking, fishing, sailing, snorkeling and the latest\ndarling of must-do activities: flyboarding. Costs run from $30 to $300 per\nperson, depending on choices and time allotments. What is clear, however, is\nthat Los Cabos is much bigger than beach, desert and margaritas. A modicum of\ncuriosity can bring plenty of unexpected action.Adventurists, especially those\nwith skateboarding proclivities, will want to press their feet to the flyboard\nfor a good 30 minutes of running loops and jumps over the waves. With special\nboots connected to a skateboard-sized flyboard, an attached hose lets sea\nwater power the rider well above the waves – up to 45 feet in the air. Rates\nrun around $200 for 30 minutes of flight: helmet, lifejacket and boot-rigged\nflyboard included.Boat trips into the Sea of Cortez to see the famous Arc-\nshaped rock formations, as well as the beaches they hide (calm and casual\nLover’s Beach and the wave pounded Divorce Beach adjacent) are usually managed\non small, motorized skiffs or Zodiacs with little shade against the sun. Whale\nwatching is a must for those who want to witness the mighty mating habits of\nthe world’s mammoth cetaceans. Of the world’s 11 species of whales, eight\nventure to the waters off Los Cabos, (iminke, bryde, fin, sei, humpback, gray\nand blue among them) during their winter breeding season in warm\nwaters.Jacques Cousteau called the Sea of Cortez the World’s Aquarium and it\nlives up to its name with sea lions, whale sharks, manta and mobula rays,\ndolphins, all manner of microfish and some fascinating bird life.Art and\nCulture in the Baja_Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"LARK GOULD: Visit the Bijoux on the Baja - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"LARK GOULD: The Bijoux on the #Baja: #Travel to #Mexico's #LosCabos. \nhttps://t.co/x9odnrZ1zK https://t.co/S16h41U8Mr","date":"Sun Mar 27 21:14:05 +0000 2016","favs":9,"id":{"$numberLong":"714198831236268032"},"retweets":6},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/27/lark-gould-visit-bijoux-baja/"}

Many believe there is no such thing as a terrorist threat; others are simply ignorant of the jihadi mindset. The media gets in a huff when a terrorist attack occurs but other than that, they don’t say much about terrorism. Politicians are reticent about the subject nowadays. Yet the FBI investigates terrorist-related organizations and activities in all 50 states.Brussels is replete with terrorist cells that are thriving in its midst. One such cell received its wake-up call to go into action on the morning of March 22. More than 30 individuals conspired and participated to launch their murderous attack against the citizens of that great and pristine Belgian city.Likewise, America possesses its share of what are currently inert jihadi cells living an innocuous daily existence under the nation’s radar of suspicion. However, the time is coming whereby one or more of these groups, whether the Islamic State or al Qaeda, will receive its call to launch murder and mayhem against America. These terrorists’ avowed hatred of the United States is so intense that the use of a low-yield nuclear device, a radioactive non-nuclear weapon or a biological or chemical discharge in either Washington or New York cannot be considered merely as an exercise of academic conjecture.Although warning signs of another mass-destruction attack have been flashing for years in the United States, the general population doesn’t have a clue what is coming.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f8b"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Nonprofit advocacy organizations spring up in Washington like mushrooms after a hard rain in early spring. Most of them profess to be working to build a better world, and some are. But few of them do very much of anything. They issue studies and statements that nobody reads, hold press conferences that few attend and raise money, sometimes a lot of money, to pay for studies, press conferences and the expense of raising more money. Many of the non-profits are staffed by men and women who are well motivated and well-meaning. Others are run by those who come to Washington to do good, and stay to do well.Occasionally one of them accomplishes something important and makes a lasting mark on the landscape. Last week several hundred supporters of one nonprofit organization, which has accomplished more bang for its buck than most, gathered to celebrate its work of a quarter of a century, and the extraordinary woman who presides over it. The group is Families Against Mandatory Minimums, and the remarkable woman is Julie Stewart. Few nonprofits can claim the support of so wide an array of men and women in Washington, ranging from President Obama’s White House legal counsel to senators to the Koch brothers.Julie Stewart moved to Washington in the 1990s to take a job at the Cato Institute. She knew little about the criminal-justice system, or that men and women caught up in the toils of the law could be sent to prison for years, decades or life for relatively minor first-time non-violent crimes,while murderers, rapists and other violent felons are put back on the streets after a short time behind bars. In 1991, her brother was arrested in the state of Washington for growing a few marijuana plants. He was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison by a judge who said he thought the sentence far too harsh, but who was required by law to impose a mandatory minimum sentence.Julie was outraged. She studied the law and its implications and decided to do something about it. The result was Families Against Mandatory Minimums, or FAMM, and over the years organized 3,000 volunteer lawyers to work for those unfairly sentenced to harsh penalties for minor crimes, sparked a bipartisan discussion of the law, and won the release of thousands of prisoners.FAMM is no “criminals’ lobby,” but an organization of men and women who believe that lawbreakers should receive appropriate sentences for breaking the law. A dozen former prisoners, including several freed from unfair life sentences after decades in prison, were guests at the celebration of last week. Miss Stewart is regarded by them as a saint, someone who gave them hope when reason told them there was none, and fought for their release.She regards herself as neither saint nor heroine, but a good citizen who saw something cruel and inhumane and set out to do something about it by “putting one foot ahead of the other,” and repeating that for 25 years. Dedication and hard work are always the keys to reform. In the eyes of those who benefit from her vision and dedication, she is a heroine, and maybe even a saint. We think so, too. \n\n","title":"EDITORIAL: Julie Stewart deserves honors for her work - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"EDITORIAL: Julie Stewart deserves sainthood for her works with @CatoInstitute\n\nhttps://t.co/aKons5oYC2 https://t.co/mAI1glTgIr","date":"Sun Mar 27 20:56:37 +0000 2016","favs":8,"id":{"$numberLong":"714194435379183616"},"retweets":18},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/27/editorial-julie-stewart-deserves-honors-for-her-wo/"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f8c"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**Everyone but the president of the United States seems to understand that the civilized world is in an all-out struggle with the pure evil of radical Islam. The Islamic State, or ISIS or ISIL, is gaining ground and by consolidating the several radical Islamic terrorist groups around the world it has become a formidable foe.President Obama’s speech last week in Havana was directed, he said, to the Cuban people as well as their Communist leaders and the American public. It was a plea for a new era of communications and collaboration with the Castro dictatorship. It was the tenor of his remarks that was disturbing, particularly his not-so-subtle innuendo that before 1969 the United States tried “to control Cuba,” a throwaway line in his endless apologies for America’s leadership of the free world. If the president actually believes that he needs a refresher in American history. After victory in the Spanish-American War more than a hundred years ago, when Cuba could have been taken as permanent American territory and many Cubans wanted to become an American state, the United States helped the revolutionary leader Jose Marti establish Cuban independence.Cuba faces an uncertain future now. President Raul Castro is 84 and the dictatorship is clearly on its uppers. Its Soviet sponsor is long gone and its Latin American friends are in even deeper economic and political trouble. But President Obama, whether intended or not, threw the Castro brothers a lifeline with his visit and gave them a helping hand. Neither he nor the Cuban people got anything in return. Throwing new political prisoners into jail, and beating up the wives of those already there, was not a good omen, nor were Raul Castro’s childish gestures of petty rudeness.Mr. Obama demonstrated his obliviousness of the world on fire when he insisted on delivering his formal prepared speech at just the moment when a new chapter of terrorism was being written in Brussels. There is hardly a terrorist expert anywhere who does not think that radical Islamic violence in Europe is soon to be repeated in the United States. The bombing of the Boston Marathon, murder at Fort Hood, deadly shootings at military installations in Chattanooga and Little Rock, and savagery at San Bernardino is inevitably a foretaste of more to come.Mr. Obama’s 51-second acknowledgment of the Belgian atrocity was grudging and insufficient. Counter-terrorist officials in Belgium and in Berlin and London say privately they are overwhelmed by the prospects they see dead ahead. The sophistication of the weaponry and the coordination at Brussels tell them that ISIS is gaining on the Americans and the Europeans. In Iraq and Syria, ISIS is using all the tools of the new digital world. The American response has been a limp incremental effort to bring the terrorists to heel, with no long-term strategy.The president must begin the preparation for a merciless effort with no quarter given to destroy ISIS. Whether the struggle is indeed World War III, as Pope Francis calls it, the needed campaign demands the president’s full attention and the mobilization of a new military effort in the Middle East. The American public is no doubt weary of wars and rumors of wars, but a president cannot lead from behind with soft words and eloquent condolences after every outrage. Leadership requires a determined effort to resolve threats to the nation’s survival, and that begins with the acknowledgment of the seriousness of the threat. \n\n","title":"EDITORIAL: Islamic State must be destroyed - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"EDITORIAL: #IslamicState must be completely destroyed. #ISIL #Iraq #Syria\nhttps://t.co/ogxAJXcb4a","date":"Sun Mar 27 20:51:22 +0000 2016","favs":15,"id":{"$numberLong":"714193117663084544"},"retweets":16},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/27/editorial-islamic-state-must-be-destroyed/"}

Bush****Public Affairs, $29.99, 400 pages**Given the parlous condition of the print media, perhaps it is no surprise that what has been called “the nation’s most exclusive publication” is no longer available in a paper-and-ink format.Credit — or blame, if you prefer — President Barack Obama for the demise of the print version of the CIA’s “President’s Daily Brief,” or PDB, a taut summary of vital intelligence which CIA officers have used to brief the chief executive six days a week since the John Kennedy years. Mr. Obama opted to have the intelligence presented to him via his iPad. The final hard-copy edition was published Feb. 15, 2014, just 10 months shy of its 50th anniversary.The explanation given by Michael J. Morell, formerly CIA’s deputy director, was that Mr. Obama “absorbs information best by reading, and he did so on his own, not with others in the room, not at the daily intelligence briefing.” Perhaps the chosen mode was of no import, given that a report issued in September 2012 found that Mr. Obama attended his intelligence briefings on only 43.8 percent of his days in office.David Priess, a CIA officer who served as a daily intelligence briefer during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, has written a thoroughly engaging account of how “The Book,” as it is known in Agency parlance, came into existence, and how presidents used (or ignored) it.The PDB originated with less-formal briefing papers prepared for Presidents Truman and Eisenhower that drew heavily upon excerpts from lengthy reports, supplemented by staff presentations. Kennedy disliked taking the time for personal briefings, preferring written presentations he could consume in half an hour or less. Handed a longish document, he would comment, “Do I have to read it all?”The estimates crafted for Kennedy were first known as the President’s Intelligence Checklist, or PICL — giving the producing office the designation as “the pickle factory.” Thus was born the PDB, which Mr. Priess writes “contains the most sensitive intelligence reporting and analysis in the world.” Included are reports from CIA spies, listening posts of the National Security Agency and space photos from the National Reconnaissance Office.Presidents paid varying degrees of attention to the brief. For instance, CIA impressed President Lyndon Johnson in 1967 by predicting the outbreak of a Middle East war — and that Israel would prevail within seven days (victory required six days).President Nixon, who denounced CIA as being “full of left-wing liberals who hate me,” shunned the PDB. CIA began providing him the reports before his inauguration. Nixon’s staff eventually returned a stack of unopened envelopes containing 2,179 pages of unread reports.President George W. Bush supplemented his reading by asking tough follow-up questions of his briefers. He was impressed when a briefer would tell him, responses, “Let me get it for you.” CIA’s answers satisfied him.President Bill Clinton annoyed briefers by appearing late — if he appeared at all — for briefings. He would pop his head out of the Oval Office and say to an underling, “Would you take the briefing?”Even more disturbing was Mr. Clinton’s insistence on bringing public relations people into the briefings, despite their lack of clearances for the material being discussed. Press aides George Stephanopoulos and Dee Dee Myers, sitting at the back of the room, would talk about “who would background The Washington Post and The New York Times, and who would go on the Sunday talk shows.”_Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"BOOK REVIEW: 'The President's Book of Secrets' - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Book review: New tome reveals how presidents get their daily intel. #IntelligenceBrief\n\nhttps://t.co/t29UC05KAb https://t.co/k195fcHgRb","date":"Sun Mar 27 20:31:17 +0000 2016","favs":11,"id":{"$numberLong":"714188062813790209"},"retweets":12},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/27/book-review-the-presidents-book-of-secrets/"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f8e"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**In the wake of the Islamist terrorist bombings in Brussels, we learn a number of things of high significance. We learn, from an Associated Press dispatch, that the Islamic State, or ISIS, has sent some 400 trained terrorists into Europe with the wave of refugees flooding into the Continent. We learn that Belgium lacks the law enforcement and security services needed to monitor the current level of terrorist activity in the country. We learn that certain Brussels districts, notably Molenbeek and Schaerbeek, have Muslim populations that are sufficiently large (approaching 50 percent in Molenbeek) and culturally coalesced to harbor dangerous terrorists and shield them from government security forces. We learn that some 5,000 Western European Muslims have traveled to the Middle East to connect with ISIS, and that many of these (including many European citizens) are filtering back with the know-how and intent to kill Europeans.What does all this add up to? It adds up to the reality that Europe’s problem with Muslims is first and foremost an immigration problem. Europe has allowed into its midst too many Muslims on the theory that they will be assimilated into the prevailing Western culture. Many have assimilated just fine, but large numbers have not and will not. The gap in religious thinking and cultural sensibility is just too large. The historical hostility between Islam and the West is just too intense and goes back too far.No one is supposed to say such things. Until recently — before the terrorist attacks in Paris, Brussels and San Bernardino, as well as Donald Trump’s devil-may-care assault on political correctness — many people felt inhibited from suggesting as much by the prospect of ferocious counterattacks with such bludgeon terms as “xenophobe” and “racist.”The view of the Western globalist elites, with their push for mass immigration, goes something like this: Western civic values and cultural sensibilities are superior to those of the rest of the world, and people from the rest of the world want to come here to share in those values. Hence over time the result will be successful assimilation into a homogenized culture. It will all work out just fine.The late Samuel Huntington of Harvard punctured that view with brutal realism when he said, “Some Westerners have argued that the West does not have problems with Islam but only with violent Islamist extremists. Fourteen hundred years of history demonstrate otherwise.” He elaborated by saying the underlying problem for the West is not Islamic fundamentalism but rather Islam itself, “a different civilization whose people are convinced of the superiority of their culture and are obsessed with the inferiority of their power.” The problem for Islam, conversely, is not the CIA or U.S. military but rather the West, “a different civilization whose people are convinced of the universality of their culture” and thus assume an “obligation to extend that culture throughout the world.”Mr. Trump took a plenty of heat when he said there is a lot of hatred toward the West within Islam. He wasn’t supposed to say that; instead he was supposed to carefully isolate out Islamist terrorism as a special phenomenon that has nothing to do with the broader civilization of Islam. But Mr. Trump’s characterization didn’t seem to have much impact on his political standing, based on polls and subsequent primary results. Why?Perhaps it’s because many ordinary Americans know that that is true, irrespective of what the elites want them to believe. Leslie Gelb, one of the leading foreign policy thinkers of his generation, said recently in an interview with The National Interest that the rise in “anti-Muslim nationalism” results in large measure from deeply held concerns about the growing refugee problem. “It’s frightening,” he said. “And it’s frightening because they seem to be angrier than other groups that Europe and America has absorbed. And there’s uncertainty and fear about where this anger will turn.”And why wouldn’t they be angry, given the West’s intrusive meddling in the lands of Islam over many generations?There is much tough talk among this year’s presidential candidates about “destroying ISIS,” defeating the caliphate at the source. This isn’t going to happen because this is a civilizational clash — and civilizational clashes, as Huntington pointed out so lucidly at the dawn of the post-Cold War era, are the most difficult to adjudicate or settle. The issues involved are too emotional, too grounded in cultural identity. Certainly ISIS can be contained, and must be. But the cultural sensibilities that fuel ISIS aren’t going away and will spawn similar movements in hospitable venues in the Middle East and North Africa.That’s why the first line of defense should be an immigration defense. The more immigration the West gets from Muslim lands, the greater the prospect for jihadi cells to emerge; the greater the prospect for population enclaves that quietly abet and succor terrorist activity; the greater the likelihood that the numbers will challenge or even overwhelm the capacity of a nation’s security forces, as they have in Belgium.It’s all about the numbers. In Europe, the numbers pose a fearsome challenge, as Mr. Gelb points out. In America, less so — but the numbers are moving in the direction of the European experience.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678f8f"},"content":"**ANALYSIS/OPINION:**No issue is more entwined in paradox than free trade versus protectionism. Here’s the first. Polling suggests that voters recognize the benefits of free trade more now than at anytime in many years, even as the presidential candidates advocate more protectionism.The polling company Gallup recently studied public attitudes on trade over the past quarter century. The question Gallup has asked over the years is whether free trade is more of a “threat” to America or an “opportunity.” In 2016, 58 percent said trade was more on “opportunity” versus 34 percent who said it is “a threat.” This may not be an overwhelming acclamation for international trade, but it is the most support Gallup has recorded. See chart.Yet on the presidential campaign trail, Donald Trump keeps scoring victories in Republican primaries with his protectionist threat of a 45 percent tariff imposed on China. Meanwhile on the Democratic side of the aisle, Hillary Clinton and especially Bernie Sanders keep bashing free trade for shrinking the middle class.These attacks against international trade are mostly spurious because American workers engaged in export industries get paid 15 to 20 percent on average more than workers in domestic-only jobs. We export high-value added products and import low-cost consumer items.Dan Mitchell of the Cato Institute notes that free trade has become the convenient political scapegoat for voter frustration with a stagnant economy. “The U.S. economy isn’t performing because of a hostile tax and regulatory policies,” he notes. “That is why companies and jobs are leaving.” He’s right. Open-trade borders force the politicians to take competitiveness seriously — something Washington hasn’t done for years.Thank goodness we don’t allow California to close off its borders to commerce with Arizona and Texas or taxes in the Golden State would really skyrocket.Here’s another trade paradox. Voter support for free trade is rising among Democrats and independents, but falling among Republican voters. As Investor’s Business Daily recently reported, in the latest Gallup polls, “63 percent of Democrats and Independents said trade is mainly an opportunity (up from the low 30s a decade ago). But just 50 percent of Republicans feel this way, which is down from a high of 57 percent in 2002.”Now we see why Mr. Trump’s tariff talks are resonating with a segment of conservative middle class voters. Some of this rejection of trade among Republicans may be a knee-jerk reaction to Mr. Obama’s support for the Asia trade deal, which is now being disparaged as ObamaTrade.The final paradox is that so many liberals like Bernie Sanders keep claiming that free trade hurts the poor. Wrong. Protectionism via tariffs is a regressive tax and would almost certainly exacerbate income inequality. The people who benefit the most from low-cost imports from China and sold at Wal-Mart or Target are the working poor. Hillary Clinton and George Soros surely don’t shop at Wal-Mart.On a global scale, the nations that tend to be the poorest in the world, for example, North Korea, Bangladesh tribal African countries, don’t engage in international trade. Opening up markets to trade is one of the best anti-poverty programs ever — much more effective than welfare or foreign aid.The Gallup data seems to confirm that most voters instinctively get all this. That’s the good news. The bad news is the paradox that they don’t seem to be voting that way._• __Stephen Moore is an economics consultant at Freedom Works._\n\n","title":"STEPHEN MOORE: Free trade more appealing to voters now - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Stephen Moore discusses the free trade paradox. #economicoutlook #moneywins\n\nhttps://t.co/5ItYQ4aOh7","date":"Sun Mar 27 20:09:39 +0000 2016","favs":4,"id":{"$numberLong":"714182618787553280"},"retweets":5},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/27/stephen-moore-free-trade-more-appealing-to-voters-/"}

One of his main rallying cries is that he’s self-funding — that he’s not beholden to any outside interest groups, unlike “corrupt politicians.”So the question now becomes: Will Mr. Trump be willing to part with $1 billion of his own money (which may or may not be liquid) in order to win the general, or will he start relying on the very outside groups his campaign is dead-set against?The candidate himself hasn’t been so clear.“I have not made that decision,” Mr. Trump said during a debate in Miami when asked whether he would take outside contributions in a general election.“My decision was that I would go through the entire primary season, and I have turned down probably $275 million worth,” Mr. Trump said.The very next day, at a press conference in Palm Beach, Fla., he said he wouldn’t rely on outside groups in the general and would instead ask the party to help raise funds.“I wouldn’t be taking money,” Mr. Trump said. “If anything, the party would be taking money. I’m not going to take any money. It’s something I haven’t given much thought to.”He needs to start.So far, Mr. Trump’s campaign has been coasting off free, earned media. The New York Times estimates Mr. Trump has received about $2 billion in such ads, and he’s bragged to the paper how little his campaign needs to spend because of it.Advertisements are one thing — but building a solid campaign structure to defeat Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton is another.So far, Mr. Trump has spent little to nothing on such endeavors, compared to Mrs. Clinton, who is building a general election juggernaut. In February alone, she spent $354,000 on polling, and paid $2.7 million in payroll to nearly 800 employees across the country._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"KELLY RIDDELL: Donald Trump's money problem - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Kelly Riddell: #DonaldTrump may have to spend $1 billion of own money to win election.\nhttps://t.co/mOam2tcIQM https://t.co/2W7ElhjmOP","date":"Sun Mar 27 20:06:37 +0000 2016","favs":13,"id":{"$numberLong":"714181854153293824"},"retweets":38},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/27/kelly-riddell-donald-trumps-money-problem/"}

None contained classified information, and most pertained to\nroutine business such as scheduling and logistics.The Pentagon has long banned\nthe use of personal email for official business. Carter’s use of his personal\nemail account, starting when he took office in February 2015, was especially\nremarkable given the burst of public criticism that followed disclosures in\nMarch that Hillary Clinton had used a private email account exclusively to\nconduct government business while she was secretary of state.When The New York\nTimes was first to report Carter’s use of a personal email account, on Dec.\n17, Carter aides said his actions were a mistake and that he had quit the\npractice.The emails released Friday show that while he used the personal\naccount much less frequently starting in about September, he did not halt the\npractice entirely until December.In a Nov. 21 email using his personal account\nhe wrote, “My work email isn’t working on my iPhone. If you need me this\nweekend please email me here and cc my work address too.”In what appears to be\nan auto-response message sent from his personal account on Dec. 18, Carter\nwrote, “I am no longer utilizing personal e-mail for the remainder of my time\nas the Secretary of Defense.

(AP) — The six astronauts at the International Space\nStation got an early Easter treat this weekend with the arrival of a supply\nship full of fresh food and experiments.Instead of the usual bunny, Saturday’s\ndelivery came via a swan — Orbital ATK’s Cygnus capsule, named after the swan\nconstellation. The cargo carrier rocketed away from Cape Canaveral on Tuesday\nnight.NASA astronaut Timothy Kopra used the station’s big robot arm to grab\nthe capsule, as the two craft soared 250 miles above the Indian Ocean.\n“Excellent work, gentlemen,” Mission Control radioed. Four hours later, the\ncapsule was bolted firmly to the complex.It’s the first of three shipments\ncoming up in quick succession. A Russian cargo ship will lift off Thursday,\nfollowed by a SpaceX supply run on April 8. NASA has turned to private\nindustry to keep the space station stocked.The newly arrived Cygnus holds\nnearly 8,000 pounds of groceries, equipment and research. Among the newfangled\nscience: robotic grippers modeled after geckos’ feet and the ingredients for a\nlarge-scale, controlled fire. A commercial-quality 3-D printer is packed\ninside as well; anyone will be able to order prints, for a price, from the\nMade In Space company. Virginia-based Orbital ATK hints Easter eggs may also\nbe on board.The blaze — confined to a box inside the Cygnus — won’t be set\nuntil the capsule departs in May with a load of trash. NASA researchers want\nto see how fast the cotton-fiberglass fabric burns, in hopes of improving\nfuture spacecraft safety. Following the experiment, the capsule will burn up,\nfor real, during re-entry.As it turns out, the Cygnus had an out-of-the-\nordinary ride to orbit. The first-stage booster of the normally reliable\nunmanned Atlas V rocket stopped firing six seconds early, and the upper stage\nhad to compensate by burning a minute longer, to get the capsule in the right\norbit. Rocket maker United Launch Alliance has delayed its next launch, a\nmilitary satellite mission, to figure out what went wrong.The commander of the\ndoomed space shuttle Columbia, meanwhile, is being honored with this latest\ndelivery. Orbital ATK named this Cygnus after Rick Husband, who piloted the\nfirst shuttle docking at the space station in 1999. He died aboard Columbia\nduring re-entry in 2003, along with six other astronauts. Kopra called him a\n“personal hero” and said he was honored to welcome the “S.S. Rick Husband”\naboard.___Online:NASA:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/main/index.htmlOrbital ATK:\nhttp://www.orbitalatk.com/\n\n","title":"Easter delivery: Cargo ship arrives at International Space Station - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Easter delivery: Cargo ship arrives at International Space Station https://t.co/9Aow4ZBRGs #ISS #OrbitalATK #space https://t.co/9M8lh12djM","date":"Sat Mar 26 17:09:43 +0000 2016","favs":12,"id":{"$numberLong":"713774946804215809"},"retweets":14},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/DTFvQx"}

This time, U.S. forces\nwere armed with briefing books and press invitations, here to seal the\npresident’s 2014 opening to Cuba with a string of expertly crafted public\nevents that saw Obama call for democracy live on state television, then attend\na Major League Baseball exhibition game with Cuban President Raul Castro.The\nweek ended with Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood and Charlie Watts\nfiring “Jumpin’ Jack Flash” ”Sympathy for the Devil” and “Satisfaction” into a\njubilant crowd from 3-story-tall high-definition television screens and\nthumping towers of speakers.From Sunday evening to late Friday night, it felt\nas if the full force of the 21st century had landed with bone-rattling impact\non an island that still feels mostly cut off from the modern world.“Havana,\nCuba, and the Rolling Stones!” Jagger cried. “This is amazing! It’s really\ngood to be here! It’s good to see you guys!”The Stones romped through 18 of\ntheir classics, picking up force as the crowd in the open-air Ciudad\nDeportiva, or Sports City, jumped and chanted “Rollings! Rollings!”The Rolling\nStones were the biggest mainstream rock act to play in Cuba since its 1959\nrevolution brought a communist government to power and isolated the island\nfrom the United States and its allies. At its heyday, Cuba’s communist\ngovernment frowned on U.S. and British bands. Fans had to hide their Beatles\nand Stones albums in covers borrowed from albums of appropriately\nrevolutionary Cuban groups.But times have changed. Former supermodel Naomi\nCampbell, actor Richard Gere and singer Jimmy Buffet partied in the VIP\nsection of the concert. Castro’s son Alejandro, one of the driving forces\nbehind Cuba’s declaration of detente with the United States, greeted friends\nand relatives after the show.Far from the Cuban and international elites,\nordinary Cubans said they felt shot through with energy, reconnected with the\nworld.“After today I can die,” said 62-year-old night watchman Joaquin Ortiz.\n“This is like my last wish, seeing the Rolling Stones.”Rivers of spectators\nflowed north and south from the concert site after the show, watched over by\nhundreds, perhaps thousands, of security officials.Few were willing to comment\non the connections between the concert and Obama’s visit earlier in the week,\nbut many said the concert had implications beyond simple entertainment.“The\nRolling Stones being in Cuba at this time is like several steps up the\nladder,” said Jennifer Corchado, a 23-year-old biologist. “It’s like three\nsteps up the staircase toward global culture, toward the rest of the\nworld.”Among the spectators was a large contingent of foreign tourists, for\nwhom seeing Cuba was as novel as seeing the Rolling Stones is for Cubans.Ken\nSmith, a 59-year-old retired sailor, and Paul Herold, a 65-year-old retired\nplumber, sailed to Havana from Key West, Florida on Herold’s yacht._Story\nContinues →_\n\n","title":"Rolling Stones in Cuba: Band unleashes rock and roll on massive Havana crowd - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"‘Satisfaction’: Rolling Stones unleash rock and roll on massive Cuban crowd https://t.co/Dy0Xm1QNe1 #Cuba #Havana https://t.co/UuGoDFNbjK","date":"Sat Mar 26 15:45:15 +0000 2016","favs":7,"id":{"$numberLong":"713753692562960384"},"retweets":7},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/jiJGUk"}

Cheffou is described as a\nlocal activist known to police for trying to rally asylum-seekers and homeless\npeople to radical Islam.Prosecutors would not confirm the Belgian media\nreports. A police raid was conducted at his home but no arms or explosives\nwere found, they said.Two other suspects detained on Thursday and identified\nas Raba N. and Aboubakar A. were charged with “involvement in the activities\nof a terrorist group.” In addition, a man named as Abderamane A. who was taken\ninto custody on Friday after he was shot by police at a Brussels tram stop is\nbeing held for at least 24 more hours.The suicide bombings during Tuesday’s\npeak morning travel time at the Brussels Airport and a city subway station\nkilled 31 people, officials confirmed Saturday. That toll is likely to rise as\nsome body parts have still not been identified, they said.Brussels prosecutor\nIne Van Wymersch told The Associated Press that 24 of the victims have now\nbeen identified and 11 of them were foreigners. One was a former Belgian\nambassador to the United States, Andre Adam.Of the 270 wounded, 93 are being\ntreated at a Brussels military hospital.

IS drove out government forces in a matter\nof days and later demolished some of the best-known monuments in the UNESCO\nworld heritage site. The extremists believe ancient ruins promote idolatry.The\nmilitants also demolished the town’s infamous Tadmur prison, where thousands\nof Syrian government opponents were reported to have been tortured.Retaking\nthe town would be a major victory for President Bashar Assad’s government,\nwhich has made steady gains in recent months against IS and other\ninsurgents.The battle for Palmyra, now entering its fourth week according to\nthe Observatory, has not been easy. Government forces lost at least 18\nsoldiers on Friday alone, including a major general, the Observatory and IS-\naffiliated media sites reported. The Observatory’s figures indicate at least\n56 soldiers have died in fighting this week.Footage broadcast on Lebanese\nstations aligned with the Syrian government showed smoke rising over Palmyra’s\nskyline, as tanks and helicopters fired at positions inside the town. IS began\nevacuating civilians this week to other parts of its territories in Syria. No\ncivilians remain in the town, a Palmyra resident who left earlier this week\ntold The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity out of safety\nconcerns.The fate of the archaeological site was not immediately clear.\nActivists citing sources among advancing government forces said the two sides\nwere fighting over the area, while the Observatory said government forces had\nretaken the site. Syrian state media made no mention of the area.The head of\nSyria’s antiquities and museums authority described the condition of the\nremaining monuments — including the grand amphitheater, the market place,\npublic baths, and a long colonnade — as “excellent,” with only minor damage,\nbased on footage captured by a drone and broadcast on Russian television\nFriday.Maamoun Abdulkarim, head of the government’s antiquities and museums\ndepartment, said civil servants are prepared to assess the monuments and plan\nfor their restoration “as soon as we are given the green light from the Syrian\narmy.”“We will present our studies to UNESCO so that Palmyra can once again be\na world heritage site,” said Abdulkarim. “Palmyra is not just for Syrians, it\nis for the world.”In addition to IS’s destruction, a 2015 satellite study of\nSyria’s numerous archaeological sites published in the journal Near Eastern\nArchaeology found evidence of widespread looting in areas controlled by\ngovernment and opposition forces too.If Syrian government forces retake\nPalmyra, they will be positioned to advance on the two largest Syrian cities\nheld by IS, Deir Ezzor and Raqqa.The IS group is on the back foot in Iraq and\nSyria, where forces on the ground have been backed by US-led airstrikes\nagainst the extremists.

{"_id":{"$oid":"57013252dea3b36d28678fa3"},"content":"WASHINGTON (AP) — Bernie Sanders pushed for a trifecta of wins in Saturday’s\nDemocratic presidential caucuses in Hawaii, Alaska and Washington state,\nhoping to stoke a spring comeback against the commanding front-runner, Hillary\nClinton.The Vermont senator spent much of the week on the West Coast, trying\nto build his enduring support among liberal activists into a Saturday sweep\nthat could help him narrow a gap of 300 delegates won in primaries behind\nClinton. That’s about double the margin that then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama\nheld over Clinton in the 2008 primaries.While Sanders faces a steep climb to\nthe nomination, a string of losses for Clinton would highlight persistent\nvulnerabilities within her own party. Sanders continues to attract tens of\nthousands to his rallies — drawing more than 17,000 in Seattle this week — and\nhas collected more than $140 million from 2 million donors.But turning that\npassionate support into the party nomination is growing increasingly\ndifficult. Clinton has a delegate lead of 1,223 to 920 over Sanders, according\nto an Associated Press analysis, an advantage that expands to 1,691-949 once\nthe superdelegates, or party officials who can back either candidate, are\nincluded.Based on that count, Sanders still needs to win 58 percent of the\nremaining delegates from primaries and caucuses to have a majority of those\ndelegates by June’s end.His bar is even higher when the party officials are\nconsidered. He needs to win more than 67 percent of the remaining delegates\noverall — from primaries, caucuses and the ranks of uncommitted superdelegates\n— to prevail.“I have gotten 2.6 million more votes than Bernie Sanders,”\nClinton told supporters crowded into a union hall in Everett, Washington, this\nweek. “We are on the path to the nomination, and I want Washington to be part\nof how we get there.”Sanders implored thousands of supporters in Spokane to\ncome see him speak again Saturday — at a caucus. “Get there early,” he said.\n“Let’s have a record-breaking turnout.”On Tuesday, Sanders won caucuses in\nUtah and Idaho but lost Arizona — the largest delegate prize — to Clinton.\nBecause Democrats allocate their delegates on a proportional basis, meaning\nthat the popular vote loser can still pick up a share, those victories netted\nSanders a gain of about 20 delegates.He hopes to avoid a repeat of that\nperformance by pulling out a win in Washington, which awards more than double\nthe number of delegates than Hawaii and Alaska combined. He’s also looking to\ncontests that follow in Wisconsin on April 5 and Wyoming on April 9 as a way\nto build momentum.Most of his dozen primary-season wins have been in states\nwith largely white populations and in caucus contests, which tend to attract\nthe most active liberal Democrats. He’s heavily favored by younger voters, who\nwere a key part of the coalition that boosted Obama to victory twice.Sanders\ndispatched his wife, Jane, to Alaska and Hawaii. Clinton, who held a\nconference call with supporters in Hawaii, did not send any high-profile\nsupporters to campaign on her behalf.Both candidates held several events in\nWashington state earlier this week.Clinton has been looking past the primary\ncontests and aiming at potential Republican challengers. In interviews,\nrallies and speeches this week, she largely focused on Tuesday’s deadly\nattacks in Brussels, casting GOP front-runner Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted\nCruz as unqualified to deal with complicated international threats.Her\ncampaign sees the April 19 contest in New York as an important one, not just\nbecause of the rich delegate prize but because losing to Sanders in a state\nshe represented in the Senate would be a psychological blow. She hopes to lock\nup an even larger share of delegates in five Northeastern contests a week\nlater._Story Continues →_\n\n","title":"Bernie Sanders seeks caucus trifecta win to close delegate gap  - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Bernie Sanders seeks caucus trifecta win to close delegate gap https://t.co/IL6YdkAlHY #BernieSanders https://t.co/IefflD2ZOq","date":"Sat Mar 26 13:34:44 +0000 2016","favs":3,"id":{"$numberLong":"713720846548877313"},"retweets":7},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://goo.gl/jcnXxD"}

Some critics said Mr. Obama should have cut short his trip and\nreturned to the U.S.The president said giving in to fear would only serve the\nmilitants’ goals.“They want us to abandon our values and our way of life. We\nwill not,” he said.The White House also announce that NATO Secretary General\nJens Stoltenberg will visit the White House on April 4 to discuss with the\npresident efforts of the U.S. and its allies to “defeat and degrade” the\nIslamic State and to alleviate the refugee crisis in Europe caused by the\nSyrian civil war.In his weekly address, Mr. Obama said the U.S. has been\ntaking out Islamic State leadership, including the killing this week of the\nextremist group’s finance minister, Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli. He was\nreportedly killed in a special forces operation in Syria.“We removed one of\ntheir top leaders from the battlefield — permanently,” Mr. Obama said. “A\nrelentless air campaign — and support for forces in Iraq and Syria who are\nfighting ISIL on the ground — has allowed us to take approximately 40 percent\nof the populated territory that ISIL once held in Iraq. We’re supporting Iraqi\nSecurity Forces who are beginning to put pressure on the ISIL stronghold of\nMosul.

This sounds too\nmuch like when the country still had ‘colored’ sections and racially\nsegregated water fountains. But this happened in March 2016.“The servers said\nit wasn’t about race. But for us, and for many other patrons, it was,” they\nwrote. “Privilege often blurs the blatant issues of race right in front of our\neyes. We’re not the first people that this has happened to. But let’s be clear\n— no business can kick people out just because they’re Black.”The Brig manager\nHeidi Wilson told The Huffington Post that the allegations of racial\ndiscrimination are “absolutely false.”“It’s not a racial thing whatsoever;\nthat is 100 percent false,” Ms. Wilson said. “It’s because they were loitering\nand didn’t purchase anything.”“They refused to leave and the police were on\nour side and escorted them out,” she added.Ms. Conner and Ms. Coleman said\nthey bought two drinks before the confrontation began. They said they haven’t\nruled out litigation against The Brig, the Post reported.\n\n","title":"ACLU lawyers say they were kicked out of California bar for being black - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"ACLU lawyers say they were kicked out of California bar for being black https://t.co/W4jRpiy68c","date":"Fri Mar 25 19:55:59 +0000 2016","favs":6,"id":{"$numberLong":"713454402913353730"},"retweets":12},"topic":"all","source":"washtimes","link":"http://bit.ly/1obLs00"}

Ernie Chambers is facing backlash for saying he would mow\ndown his colleagues with a semiautomatic if he “was a white guy.”Mr. Chambers,\nan independent, made the comments Wednesday during a debate on a measure to\nprohibit job discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity,\nThe Lincoln Journal Star reported.Mr. Chambers explained why he had watched\nmuch of the debate from his downstairs office.“If I was up here I’d probably\npick these books up and start throwing them around,” he said. “If I was a\nwhite guy, I’d go get my semiautomatic weapon and come down here and mow\neverybody down.”Speaker of the Legislature Galen Hadley said Thursday that he\nfound Mr. Chambers‘ remarks “appalling used in any context,” the Journal Star\nreported.“We live in a society where men, women, children of all races,\ngenders, ages, religions are being mowed down around the world,” he told\nfellow lawmakers. “It’s time to stop the killing, and start the healing. We\ncan start by everyone using his or her words carefully.”Mr. Chambers\nresponded, “My mere words outrage people on this floor more than those hurtful\nactions that others shall suffer.”“I shall continue to express myself in the\nway that I think is most effective for the point that I am trying to make,” he\nsaid.Last year, Mr. Chambers drew heavy criticism for comparing law\nenforcement in the United States to the Islamic State terrorist group.“My ISIS\nis the police,” the 78-year-old said at the time. “The police are licensed to\nkill us — children, old people.”\n\n","title":"Ernie Chambers, Neb. senator: 'If I was a white guy,' I'd 'mow everybody down' with semiautomatic - Washington Times","twitter":{"body":"Nebraska Sen.
