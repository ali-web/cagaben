Trump wasn't immune; analysts were just\nfailing to look at the whole board.While Trump’s polarizing campaign did not\ndent his standing with core supporters in the Republican primaries, it took a\npunishing toll on how the rest of the electorate views him. Trump’s image,\nwhich was poor even before he ran for president, has plunged to an unequaled\nlow. Among scores of major political figures measured in polls over the last\n30 years, Trump’s numbers are the worst.If Trump were to win the GOP\npresidential nomination with his current public image, he would be the most\nunpopular nominee in the history of U.S. opinion surveys, veteran Democratic\npollster Peter Hart said in an email.“By a lot,” he added.The share of\nAmericans with an unfavorable view of Trump is extraordinary: 68% in the most\nrecent Bloomberg poll, 67% in the CNN/ORC survey, 67% in the ABC/Washington\nPost poll, 65% from Gallup. The 57% unfavorable rating he received in the most\nrecent CBS/New York Times survey looks mild by comparison.Comparable numbers\nare difficult to find, particularly over a sustained period. Even during the\nworst of the Vietnam War, for example, only 38% of Americans in Gallup polls\ngave an unfavorable rating to President Lyndon B. Johnson, although all public\nfigures and institutions received more favorable rankings in that era.More\nrecently, former Vice President Dick Cheney hit a 60% unfavorable rating\nduring the closing years of the George W. Bush administration. President\nClinton’s topped 50% during the crisis over his affair with a White House\nintern. Newt Gingrich's unpopularity exceeded 60% for a short time during his\nunsuccessful run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. President\nGeorge H.W. Bush's unfavorable level also hit 60% when he went down to defeat\nin his reelection effort in 1992.None of them was as broadly unpopular as\nTrump is.**See more of our top stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**One who was?\nRichard Nixon. In 1975, a year after his resignation during the Watergate\nscandal, Gallup found that 71% of Americans gave Nixon an unfavorable rating.\nThe firm did not ask about Nixon’s favorability during the year he\nresigned.Trump, who famously likes to brag about his standing in polls,\nfocuses on surveys that measure him in the GOP race. But only about 4 in 10\nAmericans currently identify as Republicans. As Trump’s standing demonstrates,\na politician can have a solid hold on a large chunk of one party and still be\nterribly unpopular with the rest.That deep aversion to Trump poses an enormous\npotential problem for the GOP, his opponents within the party warn.Already,\nthe share of American voters who identify themselves as Democrats has started\nto tick upward, Gallup reported Friday, hitting 46%, the level measured after\nPresident Obama’s reelection. The share identifying themselves as Republicans\nhas dropped to 40%. As recently as October, the two parties were tied at 42%\neach. Obama’s job approval rating has also risen in numerous surveys.\nPollsters say his rise could reflect voters comparing him with the potential\nRepublican replacements.To win the November election, a Republican nominee\neither will need to carry about 30% of minority voters, almost twice the level\nMitt Romney received in 2012, or get even more white voters than the two-\nthirds President Reagan carried in his reelection landslide in 1984, cautioned\nRepublican pollster Whit Ayres, who advised Florida Sen. Marco Rubio’s\nunsuccessful presidential campaign.“Donald Trump has almost no chance of doing\neither one,” he said. With Trump’s deep unpopularity among black and Latino\nvoters, “he’s going backward” among minorities, Ayres added. As for white\nvoters, Trump would have great difficulty coming anywhere close to Reagan’s\nlevel because of his unpopularity with women, he said.Indeed, it’s negative\nfeelings about Trump among women that account for a large share of his\nunpopularity, numerous polls show.**TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news on the\n2016 presidential campaign \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Women account for Trump’s worsening\nstanding on the question of whether he’s suited to be president. A newly\nreleased survey by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center found that 44% of\nvoters said Trump would make a “terrible” president, an answer cited by more\nwomen since the organization last asked in January. Another 15% of voters said\nhe would be a “poor” president. Of the five current candidates in the\nRepublican and Democratic fields, he was the only one rated “terrible” or\n“poor” by a majority.Gallup found that Republican men tend to view Trump\nfavorably, 61% positive to 36% negative. But among Republican women, the\nverdict is almost even — 49% positive, 46% negative. Democrats of both genders\nview him negatively, as do independents, although with women still slightly\nmore negative than men.Overall, that leads to a very large gender gap. Among\nall women, 70% have a negative view of Trump, while among men, 58% do. On the\nflip side, 23% of women and 36% of men view Trump positively, Gallup found.If\nDonald Trump loses Wisconsin’s GOP presidential primary Tuesday, the\nRepublican dinner here Friday night could help explain why.Local party\nloyalists showed little love and sometimes outright disdain for the New York\nbillionaire as they chowed down on fried fish in the American Serb Hall,\nwhere...If Donald Trump loses Wisconsin’s GOP presidential primary Tuesday,\nthe Republican dinner here Friday night could help explain why.Local party\nloyalists showed little love and sometimes outright disdain for the New York\nbillionaire as they chowed down on fried fish in the American Serb Hall,\nwhere...If Trump wins the GOP nomination, a key question will be whether he\ncan do anything to change those impressions. Trump’s backers argue that as a\nsalesman and deal maker, he can change his approach enough to win over many of\nthose who dislike him.Many examples certainly exist of public figures who have\nsucceeded in improving damaged reputations. Hillary Clinton, the Democrat who\nmost likely would face Trump if he wins his party’s nomination, has seen her\nimage cycle up and down, although even at her low point she has never\napproached Trump’s level of unpopularity.Usually, however, political\ncandidates' images get worse, not better, during a campaign.Democratic\nstrategists are counting on that.In a briefing Friday for reporters,\nDemocratic pollster Stan Greenberg presented new data showing that while Trump\nwould do better than Romney did among blue-collar white men, those gains would\nbe exactly offset by his losses among blue-collar white women. The survey\nshowed Trump doing far worse than Romney did among college-educated white men\nand suburbanites, both constituencies Republicans need to carry to win an\nelection.More broadly, the poll showed that the Republican brand has been\nbadly damaged, Greenberg said. Democratic constituencies have grown more\nengaged in the election, and the share of voters who say they plan to vote for\na Democrat for Congress has jumped upward, the polling indicated.All told,\nGreenberg said, Trump has helped create conditions for an outcome many\nRepublican strategists fear, a Democratic victory that would sweep aside the\nGOP majority in both the House and the Senate. The country, he said, could be\nin for an “earthquake election.”**For more on Campaign 2016, follow\n@DavidLauter****ALSO****Trump endures one of the worst weeks of his\ncampaign****Trump is about to blow up the California primary****John Kasich\nstruggles to avoid being a one-hit wonder****Voters don't see Hillary Clinton\nas having moved to the left****On campuses across the country, students are\nstanding up for Donald Trump**\n\n","title":"Donald Trump is now the least popular American politician in three decades - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Donald Trump is now the least popular American politician in three decades https://t.co/KqpwoOb9pz https://t.co/0439K7An9B","date":"Sun Apr 03 05:00:23 +0000 2016","favs":49,"id":{"$numberLong":"716490506340065280"},"retweets":37},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1UHYq4l"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc520"},"content":"The house in North Hills is on a street with beautiful rosebushes and bad\nsidewalks, one in a row of single-story homes with iron security gates. Like\nhis neighbors, Shehada \"Joe\" Issa had ringed his modest property with a strong\nfence and slapped a sign in the window to warn off trespassers.But in this\nhigh-crime neighborhood, where few speak English and most take pains to guard\nwhat little they have, the violence that destroyed the Issa family didn't come\nfrom outside.New details emerged Saturday about a strange series of events\nlast week that left Shehada Issa in jail and his wife and son dead.\nInformation from law enforcement agencies and interviews with neighbors\nsuggested that a long-brewing mix of drugs, mental illness, homophobia and\nextreme family dysfunction had finally led to a tragic result.The Los Angeles\nCounty district attorney's office announced Friday that Issa, 69, was being\ncharged with first-degree murder in the shooting of his 29-year-old son, Amir\nIssa, who was found dead Tuesday morning outside the family's home on Rayen\nStreet. Found inside the house was Shehada's wife and Amir's mother, Rabihah\nIssa, 68. She had been stabbed, police said, and may have been dead for some\ntime before her body was discovered.Shehada Issa has not been charged in his\nwife's death. Police said he admitted to shooting his son with a shotgun. Amir\nIssa, who had gunshot wounds to the face and abdomen, was pronounced dead at\nthe scene.The district attorney's office alleged in a statement that Issa\nkilled his son because of his \"sexual orientation,\" a move that brought\nnational publicity to the case over the weekend. Issa could face stiffer\npenalties at trial if the shooting is prosecuted as a hate crime.There were a\nnumber of signs that Amir Issa's killing was not a simple story of a father\nacting out of murderous rage that his son was gay.Turmoil appears to have\nreigned behind closed doors at the Issa home since Amir moved back in with his\nparents, which neighbors said occurred within the last two years. LAPD Sgt.\nGreg Bruce said officers had been called to the home to help evict Amir, whose\nparents were attempting to sell the house against their son's wishes. The son\nhad even vandalized the house, according to police.A spokeswoman for the\ndistrict attorney's office declined Saturday to comment on the case.Joel\nMunoz, 38, has lived across the street from the Issas for 15 years. Speaking\nthrough the bars of his driveway gate Saturday, Munoz said he had recently\ndone handiwork for Shehada Issa, who complained to him about what he described\nas his son's problems with drugs and mental illness.\"He was a good guy. The\nson was a bad guy,\" Munoz said. \"I'm so sorry for the old man.\"Neighbor\nAlfredo Mendez, 67, said that Issa tended avidly to his trees — two palms and\na mango — and that the two would sometimes discuss arboriculture. Mendez said\nhe knew nothing of the Issa family's problems.Those problems were evident,\namong other places, on Amir Issa's Facebook page. In his last post, 10 days\nbefore his death, he said he worried that his parents, brother and sister were\n\"literally controlling me in my sleep\" and that \"they tell people to rape and\nmolest me and make it seem like I enjoy that.\"\"If there is a devil or evil\nspirit, I truly believe it manifests itself in my family,\" he wrote.Amir also\nposted a video to his Facebook page in which he interrogates his parents about\nwhether they had performed certain sex acts.\"That's not appropriate for a\nchild to ask his parents,\" Rabihah Issa says to the camera as she sits on the\nsofa, a large crucifix on the wall behind her.Shehada Issa responds more\nangrily to his son, calling him a \"pervert\" and saying, \"None of your\nrelatives want to have anything to do with you.\"According to court records, a\nman with the name Amir Issa whose parents live in Los Angeles was convicted in\nSan Diego of assault with a deadly weapon in 2010. He had slashed his ex-\nboyfriend across the face with a knife, leaving him hospitalized. Issa, who\nfled to Las Vegas during jury deliberations, was sentenced first to treatment\nat a state mental hospital and then to three years' probation with further\nmental health treatment.Police declined to comment on whether the victim in\nlast week's killing was the same Amir Issa convicted in the knife assault.No\none could be found Saturday at the Issas' home, a squat yellow structure with\na cracked driveway and rusted basketball hoop over the garage.Further\ncomplicating Shehada Issa's case is the apparent homicide of his wife. Police\nsaid the condition of Rabihah's body indicated she may have been dead \"for a\nwhile\" before Amir Issa was shot. LAPD Officer Mike Lopez said she was\n\"stabbed numerous times.\" Asked whether Amir Issa might have killed his mother\nbefore being shot by his father, Lopez said, \"That's something that detectives\nwill investigate.\"Francisco Gonzalez Jr., whose parents live next door to\nShehada Issa, said he had been aware for some time that feelings ran high\nbetween Issa and his son. Gonzalez's parents, who do not speak fluent English,\ncould hear the father and son next door shouting at each other but didn't\nunderstand what was being said. Gonzalez said he saw Shehada Issa several\nmonths ago standing out by his fence and asked him what was going on.\"It's\njust my son acting crazy again,\" Issa told him. \"It's the drugs. I called the\ncops, so I'm just waiting for them.\"On Tuesday, Gonzalez said, he was\nbabysitting his niece at his parents' house when he heard shots from next\ndoor. Running outside, he found Shehada Issa in the frontyard with a cellphone\nto his ear. Gonzalez thought he heard the voice of a 911 operator on the\nline.\"Were those bullets?\" Gonzalez asked. \"Are you OK, Joe?\"Gonzalez said\nIssa waved reassuringly, then answered:\"Everything is fine now.\"_peter.jamison\n@latimes.com__cindy.carcamo@latimes.com__matthew.stevens@latimes.com__Times\nstaff writers Matt Hamilton and Rong-Gong Lin II contributed to this\nreport._**ALSO****What it's like to live in a city with a $14 minimum\nwage****Plane slams into car parked on shoulder of freeway; car passenger\nkilled****Police are pushing for a more coordinated crackdown on L.A.'s deadly\nstreet racing scene**\n\n","title":"Homophobia, drugs and mental illness may have led to gay man's killing and father's arrest - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Homophobia, drugs and mental illness may have led father to kill his gay son https://t.co/jEz0rIJn9G https://t.co/HUunZiXq54","date":"Sun Apr 03 03:28:32 +0000 2016","favs":31,"id":{"$numberLong":"716467394139570176"},"retweets":40},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1qf7p00"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc525"},"content":"Security guard Kenneth Lofton was among the workers who benefited last year\nwhen this East Bay city hiked its hourly minimum wage to nearly $15 for\nemployees at large companies.The jump was almost 50% more than what he used to\nmake in nearby Oakland when he was paid $10 an hour. But it's not enough for\nLofton, 62, to move closer to work — he still has to commute nearly 20 miles\nfrom Hayward and back each day.**\\------------****FOR THE RECORD****April 2,\n1:42 p.m.: **An earlier version of this article misstated the percentage of\nKenneth Lofton’s wage increase as almost 70%. It was almost\n50%.**\\------------**\"It's somewhat better, but not much,\" Lofton said Tuesday\nmorning while eating breakfast and manning the security gate at an Emeryville\nparking lot. \"The high cost of living here takes a big bite out of whatever\nmonetary increase you get, so it's like not getting an increase at all.\"But,\nhe said, \"at least they're trying.\"If, as expected, Gov. Jerry Brown on Monday\nsigns legislation raising California's hourly minimum wage gradually to $15,\nthe state will become the largest proving ground in the impassioned debate\nover wage stagnation and wealth inequality.The California Legislature approved\na sweeping plan to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next six\nyears, boosting the future paychecks of millions of the state's workers.The\nCalifornia Legislature approved a sweeping plan to raise the minimum wage to\n$15 an hour over the next six years, boosting the future paychecks of millions\nof the state's workers.However, cities such as Emeryville and Seattle, which\nalso enacted a significant wage increase last year, are one step ahead. They\ncould provide hints as to how things play out when pay is sharply increased\nfor the least-compensated workers.The early takeaway: Many restaurants, which\nare highly dependent on low-wage labor, are reacting by raising\nprices.Otherwise, labor researchers and experts largely agree, it's too soon\nto draw any kind of conclusions about ripple effects such as job cuts or\nhigher spending — despite a vast amount of data generated by those claiming to\nprove otherwise.\"If anyone's telling you there's meaningful causal data\navailable, they're manipulating it or are just premature,\" said Viet Shelton,\naide to Seattle Mayor Ed Murray.After all, Seattle boosted its hourly minimum\nwage only last April, to $11 from $9.47, with gradual increases to $15 over\nthe next few years depending on the size of the business. Currently, the\nhourly minimum is about $13, depending on the size of the business and the\nmedical benefits it offers to employees.And Emeryville just passed its minimum\nwage ordinance last July, bumping the hourly rate to $12.25 for employees of\nbusinesses with fewer than 56 employees and $14.44 for larger firms. That rate\nwill gradually increase until all businesses pay a $16 hourly minimum in 2019.\nThen it will go up each year in accordance with the rising local consumer\nprice index.\"Even if we had an up-to-the-minute picture of what's going on,\nwhat's happening now is not going to show you what $15 is like because $15 is\nnot now,\" said Jacob Vigdor, professor of public policy and governance at the\nUniversity of Washington. \"Basically, the sky has not fallen in\nSeattle.\"Vigdor is the principal investigator of the university's minimum wage\nstudy, which is analyzing the effects of minimum wage ordinances in Seattle,\nChicago and other areas.The researchers plan to release a report this month\nthat will look at Seattle's data from the last year. The team has also\nconducted interviews and surveys of both business owners and workers to hear\nabout their current situations.What emerged were bits and pieces of the larger\npuzzle.\"The message that we've heard is that businesses are making\nadjustments,\" Vigdor said. \"But so far, those adjustments have not involved\nanything on the order of mass layoffs or mass shutdowns. The most common\nresponse is that they're going to increase prices.\"Restaurants have seen the\nmost effect, with price increases of about 7% to 8% since last April, he\nsaid.Seattle restaurateur Tom Douglas' high-end establishments and the popular\nWashington seafood chain Ivar's each voluntarily hiked employee minimum pay to\nthe full $15. Ivar's implemented the hike the day the law took effect,\noffsetting the cost with a menu price increase and telling customers they\ndidn't need to tip.It worked out to as much as a 60% increase for some workers\n— with many customers leaving tips anyway.Ivar's server Rochelle Hann, 25,\nsaid she'd been living almost paycheck to paycheck. But with an annual pay\nbump of about $12,000, she recently went on a weekend trip and it was an \"easy\nexpense.\"In a letter to customers in January, Douglas said his two restaurants\nthat opened last year were \"prospering and have been well reviewed.\" He said\nthe feedback helped him decide to start paying the $15 wage immediately and\nadd a 20% service charge in lieu of tips at three of his restaurants. The\ncharge goes to the house and is then redistributed to the team through wages\nand commissions, and adds to their benefits package.\"For the customer that\npays a 20% tip, nothing is going to change,\" Douglas told a radio interviewer.\n\"If I have to close some restaurants, so be it. If I have to restructure, so\nbe it. I would rather pay a living wage.\"So far, customer reaction has been\n90% favorable, he added.A similar scenario played out in Emeryville, where\nsome restaurants have increased prices to make up for the higher minimum\nwage.On a Tuesday morning, hip cafe Farley's is buzzing with young\nprofessionals from nearby companies. Despite its popularity, the eatery is\nstill subject to the \"razor thin\" profit margins common in the food service\nindustry, said co-owner Chris Hillyard.After Emeryville's wage increase,\nHillyard said he had to increase the price of menu items by 5% to 20%. A\nroasted turkey and avocado sandwich that once cost $9 is now priced at $10. A\nlatte went up 50 cents, to $4.Hillyard also had to eliminate two positions\nfrom the cafe and end the cafe's baking program. Farley's now outsources its\nbaking to a vendor.\"The council had good intentions when it increased the\nminimum wage, but that was one of the unintended consequences,\" Hillyard\nsaid.He said the additional wage hike this July will be difficult, as he's\nstill trying to navigate where his business is now. Farley's has 12\nemployees.\"It's going to be a challenge because we just raised prices,\"\nHillyard said. \"At some point, we won't be able to do that because there's\nonly so much people are willing to spend on a cup of coffee or a sandwich.\"So\nfar, he said, customers haven't minded the higher prices since they're\ncomparable to those in nearby Oakland and Berkeley.Down the street from\nFarley's, prices have also gone up at Los Moles, a popular Mexican\nrestaurant.Chef and owner Lito Saldana said he bumped up the price of every\nmenu item by 10% to offset rising food and labor costs. Prior to the minimum\nwage increase, he said, Los Moles' servers made $9 an hour, while kitchen\nstaff averaged $13.50 to $14 an hour.As costs have risen across the board,\nSaldana said the minimum wage increase hasn't helped his employees.\"Even my\nemployees who live in Oakland are saying it is now too expensive for them,\" he\nsaid.Seattle workers interviewed by the minimum wage study researchers said\nthey were happy to get the higher wages. For some, it made a \"fundamental\ndifference in their quality of life,\" said Vigdor, of the university.At the\nsame time, many workers said they were nervous about whether price increases\nwould eat up their higher paychecks.\"The minimum wage, when it works well, is\nreally a tool for transformational change in people's lives,\" Vigdor said.\n\"And the worry is that it doesn't always work well.\"The effect of a wage hike\ncould also vary by region. Emeryville and Seattle are arguably faster-growing\nand higher-paying areas, and they could be more equipped to handle a pay\nincrease.Some early analysis in July by the California Legislative Analyst's\nOffice predicted that a proposed $15 hourly minimum ballot initiative could\nreduce the number of jobs and increase prices and the cost of living\nstatewide, but also potentially increase sales tax revenue. The report added\nthat the \"nature and magnitude\" of the effects were \"highly uncertain.\"\"The\nlower a region's wages, the larger the effects of this measure likely would\nbe,\" the report said. \"We expect this measure to have proportionally larger\neffects in California's inland regions than its coastal regions.\"What's clear\nis that it will take more time for any municipality to see the implications of\nthe wage hike.\"This is a policy that takes a long time to shake out,\" Vigdor\nsaid. \"The challenge that you face is that ultimately, the things that you do\non the first day the minimum wage goes up don't necessarily tell you what's\ngoing to happen in the long run. It's not an instantaneous\nprocess.\"_tracey.lien@latimes.com__samantha.masunaga@latimes.com__Times staff\nwriter Lien reported from Emeryville and Masunaga from Los Angeles.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc526"},"content":"For years, AMC's \"The Walking Dead\" has roamed the backwoods of rural Georgia\nperforming miracles. The adaptation of a beloved graphic novel took exactly\none episode to prove that art is a feat of execution, not genre. Amid the\nspilled intestines and exploding heads walked a character drama as finely\ndrawn as any that kicked off the great television renaissance of the 21st\ncentury. \"Mad Men,\" with zombies.As the Season 6 finale approaches, it still\nhas the zombies.The finely drawn character drama thing, on the other hand,\nappears to be giving way to the more broad-stroke dimensions of its origins,\nexposing, perhaps, the difference between a story told in panels and pages and\none told on the screen.Working within an _uber_ plot that is, by necessity,\nendlessly repetitive — Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and his fellow survivors find a\nspace where they think they can safely end their wanderings only to find that\nthis is not so — the episodic action has become expositionally manipulative\nand, occasionally, ridiculous.A fictional world can be many things, but it\nmust never appear ridiculous.It began with the cliff-hanging trickery of the\nmid-season's finale's fake death — Glenn (Steven Yeun) did not just fall into\na roiling pit of zombies from which there could be no non-_deus ex machina\n_chance of escaping unbitten. But showrunner Scott Gimple shamelessly removed\nYeun's name from the credits to imply that Glenn was dead and then, ta-da! —\nhe wasn't.Since then, Gimple and his writers have seemed less concerned with\npreserving the integrity of the show's characters and their journeys and more\ninterested in producing the sort of random OMG moments more normally\nassociated with high-wire soaps like \"Scandal,\" in which characters are\ndefined by their anything-could-happen outrageousness.The Alexandria Safe-Zone\nbecomes decidedly unsafe when two experienced fighters strike out on their own\nand search parties scramble to retrieve them on “East,” the Season 6\npenultimate episode of AMC’s “The Walking Dead.”Neo-pacifist Carol Peletier\n(Melissa McBride) sneaks out before dawn, leaving...The Alexandria Safe-Zone\nbecomes decidedly unsafe when two experienced fighters strike out on their own\nand search parties scramble to retrieve them on “East,” the Season 6\npenultimate episode of AMC’s “The Walking Dead.”Neo-pacifist Carol Peletier\n(Melissa McBride) sneaks out before dawn, leaving...But the beauty and success\nof \"The Walking Dead\" stem from an opposite tension — the world may be\noutrageous but the people are very real. Fans came for the zombies and Robert\nKirkman's zig-zagging plot, but they stayed for the characters, who, for all\nthe \"If Daryl Dies We Riot\" T-shirts, are as multidimensional as fictional\ncharacters get. More so considering their horrific circumstances.This season,\nhowever, they became increasingly puppet-like, doing things that made little\nsense except as a preamble to the Don't Blink season finale introduction of\nthe novels' most ghastly and fascinating villain, Negan, played by Jeffrey\nDean Morgan. (Morgan, it must be pointed out even at the risk of belaboring\nthe Shonda Rhimes analogy, caught his big break as \"Grey's Anatomy\" sweetly\ndying Denny, whose ghostly resurrection sparked exactly the sort of pre-\nTwitter frenzy that foreshadowed the current state of Def Con One\ntelevision.)For months, \"Walking Dead\" fans could talk of little else, which\ndimmed even the finer moments of this season and knocked a few chinks in the\nfourth wall, but that's the risk of any adaptation. Success breeds increased\nattention.Much more perilous is the self-inflicted gouging. The show has\nalways prided itself on confounding expectations and rewriting the rules,\nincluding and especially the until-recently time-honored \"Never Kill a Popular\nLead,\" but still it abided by its own internal code, as every alternative\nuniverse story must.Sure, there were some \"developments\" over the years —\nturns out that even those who die of non-zombie related causes will rise\nagain, and Carl's hat apparently has magical powers that allow it to grow with\nhim — but the essential nature of the characters, and their place in the\nstory, remained astonishingly consistent. Those who survived this far have\nchanged, but we've seen them change, understand why they've changed. Their big\nmoments were earned and given the appropriate space to breathe.Until this\nseason.The 18 million or so viewers who tune in to \"The Walking Dead\" each\nweek on AMC know Danai Gurira as Michonne, the dreadlocked fan favorite whose\nskills with a katana have made her indispensable during the zombie\napocalypse.But she's also becoming a breakout star in the New York theater\ncommunity,...The 18 million or so viewers who tune in to \"The Walking Dead\"\neach week on AMC know Danai Gurira as Michonne, the dreadlocked fan favorite\nwhose skills with a katana have made her indispensable during the zombie\napocalypse.But she's also becoming a breakout star in the New York theater\ncommunity,...This is the season when Rick and Michonne (Danai Gurira)\napparently fell in love, not that you'd know it. For many, the alpha coupling\nseemed a tantalizing inevitability, but the writers could not have made the\nhoped-for moment, which occurred a short time after Rick's latest flame was\neaten alive_ in front of him_, more non-romantic and narratively functional if\nthey had simply cut to a middle-school sex ed film. \"When a post-apocalyptic\nDaddy and Mommy-figure like each other very much and everyone else is\ndead…\"After all they've been through, separately and together, Rick and\nMichonne's newly sprung love, which should have been a high point of the\nseries, never mind the season, was simply tossed to fans like so much blog\nfodder. \"So this happened,\" the writers seemed to say. \"Have a field day.\nNegan's coming and we've got other things to do.\"Likewise, the discovery of\nthe (truly nifty) Hilltop community and their power struggle with the Saviors\ncame at us as fast and furious as a three-second credit-scroll attempting to\ndescribe the Wars of the Roses (wait, which one are you? And he did what? To\nyour brother?). Equally flippant was Maggie's (Lauren Cohan) snap decision\nthat she would now be leasing her friends out as assassins. (Of course, she is\npregnant, and that can make a gal pretty testy.)Then things got really crazy.\nCarol (Melissa McBride), a character so breathtakingly sensible that she\nkilled a child who had become a danger to herself and others, suddenly became\nsuper emotional and very distracted. First she got all protective over Maggie,\nkeeping her back from the assassin party only to let them get captured by\nthree very sketchy individuals who, in any other episode, Carol and Maggie\ncould have taken down with a few river rocks and an old sweater.Universal\nStudios Hollywood plans to turn the \"Walking Dead\" haunted maze, which has\nproved wildly popular during the theme park's last four Halloween Horror\nNights, into a year-round attraction.Set to debut this summer, the \"Walking\nDead\" walk-through attraction will be housed in a permanent...Universal\nStudios Hollywood plans to turn the \"Walking Dead\" haunted maze, which has\nproved wildly popular during the theme park's last four Halloween Horror\nNights, into a year-round attraction.Set to debut this summer, the \"Walking\nDead\" walk-through attraction will be housed in a permanent...Which they did,\neventually, but apparently Carol's fugue state was infectious because then the\nwhole gang went back to Alexandria and collectively lost their minds. In the\npenultimate episode, Carol fled Alexandria, leaving a note telling everyone\nnot to follow her (hahahaha). Two seconds later, she ran into a bunch of\nSaviors, who she dispatched with the machine gun with which she has apparently\nreplaced her arm.Daryl (Norman Reedus) also went rogue, determined to find and\nkill Dixon (Austin Amelio), who had just killed Denise (Merritt Wever, sob).\nThe next thing we know, all the warriors except Maggie are piling into\nvehicles in search of one or the other. Leaving Alexandria unprotected (never\na good idea), they tromp through forests filled with Walkers and Saviors and\nGod knows what else, talking at the top of their lungs and not paying\nattention to anything, just as if they hadn't spent the last two years\nsurviving the zombie apocalypse.\"Who are these people?\" my son asked as\nMichonne allowed herself to be snuck up on just as if she didn't have eyes in\nthe back of her head, which of course we know she does. \"What have they done\nwith Michonne?\"What indeed.Creator Kirkman recently told Access Hollywood that\neven those who have been following the show for all six seasons are about to\ndiscover that while they may think they know the rules of the show, they\nreally do not. This is the sort of things television writers and producers now\nsay all the time to whip up fan frenzy and get everyone to live-tweet the\nfinale, but as a critic, I feel professionally obligated to respond.If the\naudience does not know the rules of an alternative universe narrative after\nsix seasons, then the writers have failed. If the writers decide to change the\nrules, or reinvent characters, without bothering to create believable story\nlines to accommodate those shifts, that's not shocking or inventive, it's just\nlazy and coldly calculatedAnd for a show like \"The Walking Dead,\" that year\nafter year showcased the complex reactions of human beings under constant\nduress by creating an apocalypse that is both external and internal, both real\nand metaphorical, it would also be an absolute shame.\n\n","title":"As 'Walking Dead' heads toward a season finale, it's also stumbling off an expectations cliff - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Here's the trouble with #WalkingDead Season 6 and its OMG moments: Has the show broken its own zombie code? https://t.co/jQd9nhoxRq","date":"Sun Apr 03 01:30:09 +0000 2016","favs":26,"id":{"$numberLong":"716437599594921984"},"retweets":23},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/237NP3C"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc527"},"content":"When author Marcelo Rubens Paiva uses the word \"coup,\" many Brazilians\nlisten.His father, politician Rubens Paiva, was among the hundreds tortured\nand murdered by the military dictatorship that seized power here in 1964.The\nwell-known novelist is part of a vocal minority insisting that the current\neffort to impeach President Dilma Rousseff is nothing less than another coup\nd'etat.\"In the history of our fragile democracy, we have repeatedly seen the\nsame conflict between a powerful elite connected with media, industrial forces\nand the U.S. government, against political movements which are ideologically\ncloser to the left,\" said Paiva, who has been attending anti-impeachment\nprotests.Language is often loaded in politics, and in Brazil few words can\nmatch the rhetorical power of coup — or \"_golpe_\" in Portuguese. Between 1930,\nwhen Brazil had its first coup, and 1985, when its second dictatorship\ndisbanded, there were just two decades of democratic rule.\"Memories of coups\nloom large in Brazilian history,\" said David Fleischer, a political scientist\nat the University of Brasilia.He said Rousseff is using the word as part of an\naggressive strategy to keep her job. Her supporters have been chanting, \"There\nwill be no coup!\" in street demonstrations.By the standard definition of coup,\nit's difficult to see how the impeachment attempt would qualify.\"The word\n'coup' usually describes an assault on power, usually in violent form,\" said\nPedro Estevam Serrano, a professor of constitutional law at the Pontifical\nCatholic University of Sao Paulo. \"That's not what this is.\"He prefers another\nterm: \"exceptional measures.\"Whatever you call it, the effort to oust the\npresident is part of a stunning chain of events.Shortly before Rousseff's\nreelection in 2014, federal investigators began uncovering a multibillion-\ndollar kickback scheme at the state-run oil company, Petrobras, and arresting\npoliticians and businessmen.Rousseff has never been directly implicated in the\nscandal. But as the economy crashed amid falling prices for oil and Brazil's\nother commodities, her approval rating crashed too, and legislators who had\nonce been her allies launched the effort to impeach her.It is based on\naccusations — unrelated to the corruption scandal — that Rousseff broke fiscal\nresponsibility laws by shifting state-controlled funds to cover budget\nshortfalls, a practice known in Brazil as \"_pedaladas_.\"The president's\nsupporters and detractors both took to the streets last month after federal\ninvestigators linked Rousseff's predecessor and ally, Luiz Inacio Lula da\nSilva, to the corruption probe and she offered to make him her chief of staff.\nThe Cabinet appointment — which is now frozen in the courts — would move a\ncase against him to the Supreme Court and at least delay prosecution.At\npresent, an impeachment commission made up of legislators in the lower house\nof Congress is analyzing the case against Rousseff.The best argument for\ncalling the impeachment effort a coup goes like this: The Brazilian\nConstitution says that a president can only be impeached if convicted of a\nserious crime. The allegations against Rousseff hardly rise to that level, as\npresidents and governors have long engaged in budget tinkering.\"What is\nimpeachment without a serious crime?\" Rousseff said Wednesday. \"It's a\ncoup.\"Even Serrano allowed that the word could be accurate in the broadest\nsense if Rousseff is impeached based solely on the current case against\nher.\"There's no evidence that what she's accused of in the current case rises\nto the level of a 'crime of responsibility,' as the Constitution requires,\" he\nsaid.The lawmakers behind the impeachment effort aren't the only ones being\naccused of attempting a coup.Brazilian journalists have used social networks\nto deny claims from Rousseff's supporters that they are part of a \"media\ncoup.\"And some impeachment proponents have used the term to blast Rousseff's\ndecision to name Lula to her Cabinet.\"That's a coup,\" said 27-year-old Bruno\nBalestrero, who has been organizing protests against the president. \"She would\nbe practically changing our regime from a presidential system to a\nparliamentary system with him as prime minister of Brazil.\"Thursday marked the\n52nd anniversary of the last coup. The military regime's torture victims\nincluded a young Rousseff.While thousands of her supporters were demonstrating\nagainst the impeachment attempt, a recent poll showed that 68% of Brazilians\nwere in favor of it.\"In 1964 the coup was supported by the majority, too,\"\nPaiva said._Bevins is a special correspondent._**ALSO****Some political\ncandidates in India must prove they use a toilet****Human Rights Watch accuses\nMexico of failing to care for young Central American migrants****South\nAfrica's Zuma expected to repay money spent on home renovations after court\nruling**\n\n","title":"In Brazil's political fracas, 'coup' is a loaded term - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Language is often loaded in politics, and in Brazil few words can match the power of “coup” https://t.co/EWRAWPfJG9 https://t.co/md8wKGNrqw","date":"Sun Apr 03 01:10:08 +0000 2016","favs":18,"id":{"$numberLong":"716432563653492736"},"retweets":21},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/237YUlw"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc529"},"content":"For decades, authorities have struggled to halt a street racing craze that has\nplagued Los Angeles County, sometimes with fatal results.Attempted crackdowns\nwere short-lived. Few officers focused exclusively on the problem. And law\nenforcement agencies often worked alone to deter would-be racers from\nventuring into their jurisdictions — a strategy that critics complain simply\npushed the problem into neighboring cities.Now, some police officials are\ncalling for a more coordinated effort to break the racing scene.After a spate\nof recent deaths linked to street racing, dozens of investigators from\nagencies across the area met last month to discuss the creation of a\ncountywide task force aimed at curbing the speed contests. Another planning\nmeeting is scheduled to take place Monday, officials said.Authorities say a\nDodge Charger was racing a Dodge Challenger on the southbound lanes of the 5\nFreeway on Feb. 27 when the Challenger lost control and slammed into a UPS\ntruck. Three people died at the scene and four others were injured. The\nChallenger driver was arrested on suspicion of vehicular\nmanslaughter.Authorities say a Dodge Charger was racing a Dodge Challenger on\nthe southbound lanes of the 5 Freeway on Feb. 27 when the Challenger lost\ncontrol and slammed into a UPS truck. Three people died at the scene and four\nothers were injured. The Challenger driver was arrested on suspicion of\nvehicular manslaughter.The first meeting, which had been planned for months,\ncame just days after a fiery crash caused by suspected street racers on the 5\nFreeway left three other motorists dead, including the son of a Los Angeles\nCounty sheriff's lieutenant.Earlier this year, a 36-year-old music teacher was\nkilled when a suspected street racer lost control of his vehicle during a race\non a busy Hawthorne thoroughfare. And in January, a driver who killed two\npeople during an illegal street race in Chatsworth last year was sentenced to\n12 years in prison.**See more of our top stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Sgt.\nJeremy Cross, who oversees street racing investigations for the Vernon Police\nDepartment, said pooling intelligence between the region's law enforcement\nagencies would quickly illustrate how pervasive and persistent the problem has\nbecome. Industrial havens such as Vernon are especially attractive to racers\nseeking empty roads and few witnesses at night and on weekends, he\nsaid.**\\------------****FOR THE RECORD****April 2, 2:47 p.m.:** An earlier\nversion of this article misidentifed the Vernon police sergeant who oversees\nstreet racing investigations as Jeffrey Cross. He is Sgt. Jeremy\nCross.**\\------------**\"What I've seen for years is that agencies don't\nnecessarily know they have a street racing problem,\" said Cross, who has\npushed for a regional task force.Cross and others say it is about time\ndepartments adopted a long-term approach. The issue surfaces as a priority\nevery few years only after a series of tragic accidents.\"Nobody really pays\nattention to it until something bad happens,\" said LAPD Sgt. Jesse Garcia, who\nuntil recently ran the department's Street Racing Team.Garcia's unit, one of\nthe few assigned to deal with street racing in the county, was part of a city\npilot project that ended this year. A similar LAPD unit meant to deter racing\nin the San Fernando Valley was mothballed in 2015. Most other agencies in the\ncounty, including the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and California\nHighway Patrol, say they have not assigned resources to deal with street\nracing on a full-time basis.The scope of the problem is difficult to quantify.\nA Los Angeles ordinance passed last year requires the LAPD to begin tracking\nsuch data in the future, but the department and most other agencies in the\ncounty do not keep records on the number of people hurt or killed in street\nraces. Most police agencies do not collect data on the number of races, but\nthe few officers who keep tabs on the county's racing scene say incidents are\non the rise.Garcia said racing contests have become more frequent and more\naggressive in the county in recent years, fueled by the popularity of car\nclubs and racers' ability to coordinate via social media. Meet organizers use\nInstagram and Facebook to draw large numbers of competitors to Los Angeles\nCounty from outside the area.This year, he said, several car clubs from the\nBay Area came down for contests that involved nearly 500 racers in various\nparts of the region, including the South Bay, Compton, Watts and\nunincorporated areas of South L.A.Garcia said police need to end the practice\nof trying to force racers out of their cities and focus instead on tracking\ntheir movements, documenting their activities and sharing that information\nwith other law enforcement agencies to help break up racing events and arrest\ndrivers and spectators.Meets can feature dozens of drivers competing in drag\nraces or trying to pull off other speed stunts while hundreds of people look\non. Larger crowds raise the likelihood that a spectator could get hurt if a\ndriver loses control of a vehicle, said Garcia, who is also behind the push\nfor a county task force.Drivers used to scatter when they noticed lights and\nsirens. Now some at the back of the pack will block off the roadway so the\nmajority of the racers can escape, Garcia said.\"If a police car is going\nthrough, they jump on it, throw stuff at it, they kick it,\" he said.Responding\nto large races is especially daunting for smaller municipal departments. In\nthe city of Bell, the entire force of 26 officers could find themselves\ndrastically outnumbered at races that attract hundreds of people, Capt. Carlos\nIslas says. But devoting one of the department's few officers to a racing task\nforce could harm the department's ability to respond to other crimes, he\nsaid.\"The task force they're trying to put together is a great idea, but it\nstill remains to be seen if committing a body to them full time is going to be\ncost-effective,\" he said.It is unclear when, or if, the countywide task force\nwill be formally launched. Capt. Anne Young, who attended the last meeting and\ncommands the LAPD's Central Traffic Division, said her department and several\nothers are interested in taking part. In the meantime, the LAPD's traffic\nbureaus are trying to coordinate efforts to combat the racing scene in the\ncity.Capt. Chris Marks of the Sheriff's Department's Carson Station, an area\npopular with racers, said the recent deaths from speed contests underscore\nthat more needs to be done to end the problem.\"These unfortunate and horrific\nincidents,\" he said, \"bring attention to it, and cause everyone to stop and\nrethink the strategy and ask, 'Are we doing\nenough?'\"_james.queally@latimes.com__Twitter:\n@JamesQueallyLAT_**ALSO****Father accused of fatally shooting son because he\nwas gay****Critically injured Redlands hostage was wounded by police\ngunfire****Cab driver who was kidnapped by O.C. jail escapees didn't get a\nreward — so he plans to sue**\n\n","title":"Could a regional law enforcement task force put a dent in deadly street racing? - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Too many innocent people are dying as a result of dangerous street racing in L.A.

She\ndecided to stay the night and fell asleep on the couch of her office.She awoke\nshortly after and used the restroom, unknowingly triggering the building's\nburglar alarm, and went back to sleep.Police were called to investigate the\nalarm. Sgt. Bill Nulton and his police dog, Bak, along with two other\nofficers, found the door to Lowry's office suite open and it was mostly dark\ninside.**See more of our top stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Nulton said he\nshouted inside, \"This is the San Diego Police Department! Come out now or I'm\nsending in a police dog! You may be bitten!\" He said he waited up to a minute\nmore and, getting no response, yelled the warning once or twice more. He then\nlet the dog off the leash to investigate and followed closely behind him.With\na flashlight, Nulton said he spotted what looked like a person under a\nblanket. The dog pounced and bit Lowry nearly entirely through her lip. Nulton\nquickly removed the dog. Lowry required three stitches.Shortly after the\nincident, Nulton told Lowry, \"I just can't believe that's the only damage.\nYou're very lucky. She could have ripped your face off,\" according to court\nrecords.San Diego police testified that the officers followed the department's\npolicy on deploying dogs. The department trains its dogs to enter a building,\nfind a person, bite and hold that bite until an officer removes the dog,\naccording to court records.Nulton testified in a deposition that police dogs\nare not trained to differentiate between \"a young child asleep or ... a\nburglar standing in the kitchen with a butcher knife,\" and will typically bite\nthe first person they find. He said it is usually up to the officer to decide\nwhen it is appropriate to allow the dog off its leash.The district court,\napproving the city's request for summary judgment, found that the officers\nreacted \"reasonably and objectively\" to the situation, seeing an office door\najar and not knowing whether there was a burglar, possibly armed, waiting for\nthem in the dark.In a 2-1 decision, the 9th Circuit disagreed, finding that a\nreasonable jury could find the department's \"bite and hold\" policy to be a\nsevere use of force.\"In this case we must not rely on the plaintiff's 'luck'\nthat she only ended up bleeding profusely from a cut lip rather than having\nher whole face 'ripped off' to excuse the conduct that the officer himself\nrecognized could well have resulted in a far more egregious injury,\" judges\nwrote in their ruling.\"When we consider both the type and the amount of force\nused against Lowry and draw all inferences in her favor, we have little\ntrouble concluding that the intrusion on Lowry's 4th Amendment rights was\nsevere,\" the ruling says.The three-judge panel weighed several factors about\nwhether the force was excessive, including whether burglary is considered a\nserious crime, whether Lowry resisted officers and whether the officers had a\nreasonable fear of danger in the situation.In a dissenting opinion, Judge\nRichard Clifton said the ruling could have serious consequences on officer\nsafety.\"Thanks to the majority opinion, officers will be discouraged from\nprotecting themselves and encouraged to risk their lives by exposing\nthemselves to any burglar who might be armed and lying in wait, either because\nthey cannot use a dog at all or must remain so closely tethered to the dog\nthat they necessarily have to expose themselves to the potentially armed\nburglar,\" he wrote.Gerry Braun, spokesman for the city attorney's office, said\nthe office is reviewing the opinion and will determine the next course of\naction.\"We are mindful that this decision could impact the future use of\npolice dogs in the city of San Diego and other communities,\" Braun\nsaid.kristina.davis@sduniontribune.comTwitter: @kristinadavis_Davis writes for\nthe San Diego Union-Tribune._**ALSO****Father accused of fatally shooting son\nbecause he was gay****One of the LAPD's preferred weapons to help officers\navoid shootings often doesn't work****Cab driver who was kidnapped by O.C.\njail escapees didn't get a reward — so he plans to sue**\n\n","title":"A bite by a San Diego police dog could be a severe use of force, appeals court rules - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Woman falls asleep on her office couch and wakes up to a police dog's teeth through her lip https://t.co/WXlmFDpos4 https://t.co/IlRJbsRYBF","date":"Sat Apr 02 23:50:07 +0000 2016","favs":61,"id":{"$numberLong":"716412425726214144"},"retweets":75},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/21ZyqA7"}

And then the money did take off. The market was\nthere.\"General Manager Les Snead declined to provide specifics when asked why\nthe team chose to franchise Johnson rather than Jenkins. But Johnson, 26, now\nappears to be the leader of the secondary. He intercepted seven passes last\nseason.To help offset the loss of Jenkins, the Rams signed free agent Coty\nSensabaugh, 27. He intercepted one pass last season for the Tennessee Titans,\nreturning it for a touchdown.\"Coty is an instinctive, smart, I think,\nproductive player that you can plug in and play either side,\" Fisher said.At\nlast month's NFL owners meeting Titans Coach Mike Mularkey described\nSensabaugh as a \"very smart player. … He can cover, he can tackle.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc52f"},"content":"When last I addressed the extended debacle that pitted Time Warner Cable and\nthe Los Angeles Dodgers against the interests of the Dodgers' fans, it was to\npoint out that this was a teachable event: It reminded the fans that when\nmoney is at stake, \"the teams are businesses that don't give a Tinker-to-\nEvers-to-Chance's damn about them.\"That could help inoculate the public\nagainst \"the virus of gimme that pro sports teams spread in their local\ncommunities,\" I observed. \"The owners and their leagues demand tax abatements,\npublic stadium funding, and all sorts of other handouts because, you know,\nthey truly belong to the people.\"That was in February 2015, when the blackout\nkeeping Dodgers telecasts from millions of homes across the Southland was\nabout to enter its second ridiculous year. At the time, it was unimaginable\nthat the obdurate greed of the team or its broadcast rights holder, Time\nWarner Cable, would continue for another season. It did, and the standoff is\nabout to enter Season 3.As my colleagues Meg James and Ryan Faughnder have\nreported, the cable company recently offered to drop the price of its Dodgers\ncable channel in an effort to win space on Cox Communications' cable system\nand DirecTV's satellite service, the major holdouts. The offer failed, and\nTime Warner now appears to have abandoned the effort.A couple of points about\nall this. First, a quick look at the economics that brought us to this pass.In\n2013, the Dodgers' new owners, led by Guggenheim Partners, reached a deal with\nTime Warner Cable to create a Dodgers cable channel called SportsNet LA to be\ncarried by Time Warner Cable. TWC agreed to pay $8.35 billion over the life of\nthe 25-year deal for TV rights to Dodgers games. This represented some very\nrosy-tinted analysis by TWC, which figured it could get much of that back by\nhawking the channel to the other pay-TV outlets in the region. But Time Warner\ndemanded such a high price for the channel that it received a firm \"no\" from\nevery other pay-TV system, which included Cox, Charter Communications, the\nfiber services Verizon FiOS and AT\u0026amp;T U-verse, and the satellite companies\nDirecTV and Dish. Time Warner Cable served only about 30% of the pay-TV\nhouseholds in the Southland, so Dodger games were effectively blacked out for\nthe other 70%.As I wrote in 2014, \"the magic of the free market was trumped by\nthe black magic of greed. The Dodgers held out for the highest price they\ncould get for the TV rights, figuring the team is such a jewel in the Southern\nCalifornia sports crown that the sky was the limit. Time Warner figured it\ncould squeeze the other pay-TV companies for every last dime because, really,\nwhat TV service would dare not carry the Dodgers, whatever the price? The\nanswer was: all of them.\"(Since then, Charter, which is poised to take over\nTime Warner Cable, has added the Dodger channel to its lineup. AT\u0026amp;T\nacquired DirecTV last year.)Another point is that this showdown has prompted\nsome of the most spectacularly hypocritical corporate pronouncements known to\nhuman history. In 2014, when the Dodgers stretched the National League pennant\nrace into the last week of the season, TWC decided to put the last six games\nof the season on free TV, and then swanked around as though it was the fans'\nsavior.\"We're Dodger fans too,\" a company mouthpiece said. \"Angelenos love\ntheir Dodgers, and we’re happy to give them a way to watch their beloved team\nduring this pennant chase.\"Of course, Time Warner Cable wasn't part of this\ncommunity then and isn't now. It's a New York corporation that sees Los\nAngeles as just another market to be squeezed until it screams for mercy. Time\nWarner Cable's people aren't \"Dodger fans\"; they're executives feeding their\nbottom line, and in this case they found themselves choking on the meal.But\nthat pales next to the more recent statements of Time Warner Cable shills. The\nmost shameless development is their invoking the sainted name of Dodgers\nbroadcaster Vin Scully, 88, who will retire after this season.\"The Dodgers'\nmassive fan base deserves to be able to watch Dodger games regardless of their\nchoice of provider,\" Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said, in\nurging the TV holdouts to accept Time Warner's \"significant economic move.\" He\nadded, \"The situation is particularly acute given that this is Hall of Fame\nbroadcaster Vin Scully's final season.\"Spare us, Commissioner. You want the\nteam's massive fan base to see the games? Spend some of MLB's money to put the\nDodger Channel on DirecTV. If you're not willing to step up to the plate, keep\nyour mouth shut. L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti, who really should know better, also\ngot into the fray, stating that he's \"hopeful that we are close to breaking\nthe deadlock and finally doing the right thing for Dodger fans. If nothing\nelse, let's do it for Vin Scully.\" It's unclear who the \"we\" is in that\nstatement, since this is a dispute among a bunch of corporate behemoths, not a\ncivic project.For what it's worth, Scully said he found being drawn into the\ncorporate bickering \"really kind of embarrassing for me.\" One more black mark\non the Dodgers/Time Warner Cable roster of shame. Scully also said, in a\nconversation with my colleague Bill Shaikin, that if mentioning his name would\n\"serve in any possible way to get the fans to see more games, that is the\nthing I would be rooting for.\"From the standpoint of Time Warner Cable and the\nDodgers, the worst aspect of this fiasco must be that it shows how wildly they\noverestimated the team's value in the Southern California market. TWC\noriginally offered the Dodgers to its pay-TV rivals for $4.90 a month per\nsubscriber home, whether the subscribers wanted the channel or not; a counter-\noffer from DirecTV to make the channel a paid add-on just for households that\nwanted it was spurned by TWC. In March, the increasingly desperate TWC cut its\nasking price by nearly 30%, to $3.50 per home. That's less than some other\nregional sports networks command, including New York's YES Network, which\ncarries Yankee games and costs its cable carriers more than $5 a month per\nsubscriber. TWC's offer, however, was for only one year, after which it would\nbe subject to renegotiation. Unsurprisingly, DirecTV and the other systems\nspurned the offer: They weren't so dumb they didn't recognize that it would\ngive TWC tremendous leverage, since giving subscribers a channel and then\ntaking it away is a lot harder than never offering it in the first place. More\nrecently, James reports, Time Warner Cable proposed a six-year deal for about\n$3.84 a month, about what  DirecTV charges for a regional sports channel it\nowns in Seattle. TWC says that's been rejected, too.What's left? The ball soon\nwill be in Charter's pitching hand. It may have to cut the price of Dodger\ntelecasts even more, and eat whatever losses that means. But the one thing it\nneedn't bother to do is tell the fans, whatever the ultimate deal, that it's\ndoing it because it loves them. They've heard it before.**Keep up to date with\nMichael Hiltzik.

I did not know where to begin, so I did as everyone else was doing and\nsigned up for online dating. After all, this is how people were meeting\npeople.I dated a few good guys, but we went our separate ways. Then an 80\n-year-old family friend, Marty, mentioned that he had a great guy to set me up\nwith. Turns out we were each in our 40s, and Marty said he could see us\ntogether.On one hand I asked myself, \"What would an 80-year-old know about\nwhom I should like/marry?\" But on the other hand, I knew how wise Marty was\nand that he had 80 years' worth of experience in the world with life, love,\nfamily and everything important that matters.****Past L.A. Affairs\ncolumns****I asked Marty to tell me more about this guy, his friend Ken. Marty\nand Ken had known each other for years. They shared many of the same\nperspectives on life and politics and had great respect for each other. Marty\ngave me Ken's phone number and explained to me that Ken was open to meeting\nand that it would be best for me to contact him since he was a very busy\nman._I_ was to call _him_?Boy, have times changed, I thought.I had an\nenjoyable conversation with Ken over the phone and we decided to meet at a\nSpanish restaurant in Los Angeles called La Paella on San Vicente Boulevard.\nThe restaurant was a perfect pick because Ken lived in Barcelona for two years\nand I lived in Madrid for a semester abroad while attending college. We\nimmediately hit it off with our love for Spain and our love for paella and\ntapas.It didn't hurt that Ken also looked like a twin to Laird Hamilton, the\nfamous surfer.Over the next year and a half, Ken and I had many adventuresome\ndates, including taking in a lucha libre wrestling match in downtown Los\nAngeles. I remember thinking, when a dwarf wrestler was being tossed in the\nair by his tag-team partner, \"You don't see that every day!\"We shared our love\nfor art at museums both well-known and obscure. We went to lively pool parties\nat the Standard downtown populated by crowds younger than us, not standing\napart as we took in the sun, ate bar snacks and shared Champagne. We tried new\nwines and sampled cheeses at novel places. One of our favorites spots was the\nSLS Hotel. We checked out the new speak-easies that were popping up in odd\nplaces. And we started introducing each other to our closest friends and\nfamily, all of whom meshed quickly.We enjoyed classic rock concerts like the\nWho, Tom Petty, Rickie Lee Jones and John Fogerty; we explored up-and-coming\nacts like Vampire Weekend and Galactic; and we saw jazz legends like Al Di\nMeola and Chick Corea. We spent time at the parks and canyons walking our\nelderly dogs. We spent time consoling each other when they eventually\npassed.We even did the unthinkable, the unimaginable — Bruin Ken attended USC\nfootball games with me and my friends, and I-the-Trojan attended UCLA football\ngames with him and his friends.We intensified our time together with weekend\nadventures to either the beach or the snow.Throughout this dating period I did\nnot know whether our relationship would be long-term or not. I knew that we\nclicked and enjoyed each other's company.****Are you a veteran of the L.A.\ndating scene? Share your story** **But it wasn't until I saw how fabulous Ken\nwas with my son, Jack, who was 9 at the time, that I knew we could go to the\nnext level.They immediately bonded and looked forward to seeing each other\nwhenever we got together.On our first family \"date,\" we all went to Islands\nrestaurant to stuff our faces, and Ken said casually to Jack, \"I only have one\nrequest — please don't spill anything on my new white jacket.\"Without fail,\nJack managed to accidentally spill his entire milkshake on the jacket.Ken just\nburst out laughing.Over time, Ken and Jack started having their \"favorite TV\nshows\" to watch together and sometimes played father/son basketball at Roxbury\nPark in Beverly Hills against other father/son teams.It wasn't a long thing,\njust a handful of weeks in November and December broken up by his trips back\nEast and those big holidays that cropped up too soon to be spent together.

We made up for it with zip-lining, paragliding and snorkeling,\nwith visiting friends on the island, and of course relaxing with beach and\npool time.With Jack's permission, Ken took me to Yamashiro in Hollywood and\nasked me to marry him so we could all become a family.

He trails\nCruz in polls.“I don’t see Donald Trump going into any Republican venue and\nreally seeking out any Republicans,” said David Karst, chairman of the\nMilwaukee County Republican Party. “If he’s serious, he needs to reach out and\nstart building a coalition.”Many of the hundreds at the dinner view Trump as\nimmature, insufficiently conservative or out of touch with their concerns. The\ndistance between Trump and local Republicans is most evident when it comes to\nScott Walker, Wisconsin’s governor.Walker, who briefly ran for president\nbefore dropping out last fall, has an 80% approval rating among Republicans\nwho plan to vote in Tuesday’s primary, according to a recent Marquette\nUniversity poll.Trump is supported by only 27% of that group, and he further\ndamaged himself by criticizing Walker in radio interviews this week.“It was a\ndisaster,” said Alberta Darling, a Wisconsin state senator who is supporting\nCruz. “Most people know our state is a lot better off now than it was.”Loyalty\nto Walker, who attended Friday’s dinner and endorsed Cruz earlier in the week,\nhas been firm after Republicans rallied around the governor to protect him\nfrom an unsuccessful recall effort in 2012.**TRAIL GUIDE: All the latest news\non the 2016 presidential campaign \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**“We’ve been through blood on this\nstuff,” Darling said.John Schaff, 53, a contractor from Milwaukee, said he was\non the fence about Trump until this week.Trump’s criticism of Walker and\nWalker’s endorsement of Cruz convinced him that the Texas senator was the\nright choice in the primary.“We’re in [Walker’s] corner,” Schaff said. “We’re\nbacking him 100%.”For others, their dislike for Trump goes back further.“I saw\nthat first debate, and that killed it for me,” said Paula Potkonjak, 53, who\nworks in a fragrance store and lives in Milwaukee. “There was no substance to\nthe man. And then he attacks Megyn Kelly [the Fox News anchor].”Dragomir\nMarinkovich, 52, of Hales Corner said he’s been a Cruz supporter since the\nbeginning and views him as the only “true conservative” of the remaining\ncandidates.Trump, he said, is “a Democrat in Republican clothing.” In\nWisconsin, “there’s a strong conservative base.

There are a few packages of seeds, Skittles candy,\nsome sweaters, sneakers and laundry soap — but no lack of customers.The main\ndraw is Luo's computer and the big-screen display perched above him on the\nwall — both provided by the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba. From 7:30 a.m.\nto 11 p.m., breaking only for meals at his parents' house, Luo pecks away at\nhis keyboard, helping his technology-challenged neighbors buy fertilizer, TVs\nand even electric cars on an Alibaba shopping site called Rural Taobao. Luo\narranges the payments, as well as delivery to Jade Peak, and earns a\ncommission from the sellers.\"This is going to change the whole village,\" said\nLuo Laibing, a 56-year-old farmer who stopped by on Tuesday to purchase more\nthan 1,000 pounds of fertilizer. \"It's saving us money and time, and is making\nlife much more convenient.\"Rural Taobao is an ambitious effort by Alibaba to\nturn China’s 600 million rural residents into online shoppers — and sellers —\nat a time when the company’s growth in transactions is slowing and China’s\noverall economic growth has ebbed to a 25-year low.Rural Taobao is an\nambitious effort by Alibaba to turn China’s 600 million rural residents into\nonline shoppers — and sellers — at a time when the company’s growth in\ntransactions is slowing and China’s overall economic growth has ebbed to a\n25-year low.Rural Taobao is an ambitious effort by Alibaba to turn China's 600\nmillion rural residents into online shoppers — and sellers — at a time when\nthe company's growth in transactions is slowing and China's economic growth\nhas ebbed to a 25-year low. In the last year and a half, the company has\nenlisted more than 15,000 village \"partners\" like Luo Rong and hopes to have\nat least 40,000 by this time next year. Alibaba says it plans to invest $1.6\nbillion in the effort through 2019, with the ultimate goal of opening 100,000\nRural Taobao centers.But the company is hardly going it alone. It's getting a\nbig helping hand from the government, which is footing the bill to renovate\nstorefronts like Luo's, sending officials out to talk up e-commerce to\nskeptical farmers, providing gratis space for new logistics centers and\ndeploying propaganda workers to promote Rural Taobao.The ministries of\ncommerce and finance have allocated $300 million to 200 rural counties to\nspend on warehouses, training and anything else that might push the project\nforward.**See more of our top stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**While it's\ninconceivable that Uncle Sam would offer such assistance to, say, EBay or\nAmazon, China's Communist Party leaders see no problem working hand-in-glove\nwith a company like Alibaba when it suits national aims. Government officials\nand Alibaba executives say Rural Taobao jibes neatly with national goals such\nas boosting consumer spending to fuel economic growth, narrowing the income\ngap between urban and rural citizens, promoting entrepreneurship and\nharnessing the power of the Internet to invigorate backward regions.And while\nChina is still expecting an additional 200 million or so people to move from\nthe countryside to its burgeoning cities, the government is aware that it\ncan't urbanize everyone.\"The success of rural e-commerce throughout China is\ndue to the top-to-bottom concern from the government … starting from the\npresident and the premier down to lower-level officials and departments,\" Sun\nLijun, general manager of Rural Taobao, said in an interview at one of\nAlibaba's modern campuses in the city of Hangzhou. \"We have 300 counties\nparticipating so far, and when we send in one Alibaba employee, the government\ndeploys 10 people.\"**The outside world**As the crow flies, Jade Peak is just\n165 miles southwest of Hangzhou, which has a population of 8.8 million, but\nthe big city and its modern conveniences have long been a world away for the\nhamlet's 800 residents. The village is so insular, many inhabitants share the\nsame surname, Luo, and some are illiterate. They get by raising potatoes,\nlotus, medicinal herbs and chickens in the fog-shrouded fields up in the\nmountains of Jiangxi province.Until last year, a trip to buy something as\nbasic as a faucet meant an all-day expedition to the nearest township, given\nthat bus service over a steep dirt track ran just twice day. A voyage to the\nmore distant county seat required three hours each way. Given Jade Peak's\nsmall population and remote location, no package delivery company would serve\nthe village. Many of Jade Peak's youth, like Luo Rong, decamp for urban\ncenters, in search of opportunity and modernity.But the completion of a new\nhighway, a 1.6-mile tunnel and a winding asphalt road up the mountain last\nyear are starting to change life in Jade Peak. Travel times to the nearest\ntownship have been halved, and more sightseers eager for a day trip to the\ncountryside are finding their way to the village. Package delivery firms —\nenticed by subsidies from Alibaba — are now making the trek up on a near-daily\nbasis. Alibaba's logistics arm makes sure the deliveries are optimized for\nmaximum efficiency.Luo Bishui, 60, used to just grow potatoes, but now he's\nopening an eight-room guesthouse for tourists. This week, he popped into the\nRural Taobao center to order two more flat-screen TVs for his rooms. Such\ntransactions generate about $770 per month in commissions for Luo Rong, though\nhe made double that in November, his first month on the job, and gets\nperformance bonuses from Alibaba as well.**NEWSLETTER: Get the day's top\nheadlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Although he earned more in\nShanghai, his money goes much further in Jade Peak.Already, Luo Rong has plans\nto move his storefront into a bigger space, which the government will pay to\nrenovate. Rent will be about $500 a year. He envisions adding more services,\nincluding printing, copying and video-conferencing, so elderly parents in Jade\nPeak can chat with their sons and daughters who have moved to big cities.\"Next\nI want to help sell our local products like potatoes and smoked meat online,\"\nsaid Luo Rong. \"It's long been my dream to contribute to the development of my\nvillage.\"He's got neighbor Luo Laizhang, 45, selling eggs online; now, the two\nare trying to figure out how they can market the farmer's special breed of\nblack chickens. \"We have to figure out the slaughtering, packaging and\ntransport,\" says Yuan Chunjiang, Rural Taobao regional manager for the eastern\npart of Jiangxi province. \"It's a bit complicated.\"Even after half a century,\nYang Fuxi can still remember the pungent smell of his grandfather's bow and\narrow workshop in central Beijing.\"There was the odor of glue and bull horn\nwhen you grind it, almost a burning scent as if you are stewing something and\nrun out of water,\" Yang said.\"Worst...Even after half a century, Yang Fuxi can\nstill remember the pungent smell of his grandfather's bow and arrow workshop\nin central Beijing.\"There was the odor of glue and bull horn when you grind\nit, almost a burning scent as if you are stewing something and run out of\nwater,\" Yang said.\"Worst...But local Commerce Bureau official Zheng Zeyang\nbelieves there's a huge untapped customer base for such products. \"There is\nlots of demand from cities for organic produce, and Rural Taobao can get\nsellers good prices,\" he said, touring Jade Peak with a photographer from the\npropaganda department in tow. \"Online sales offer more opportunity to sell\noutside of the hometown market.\"**Local businesses**About an hour's drive away\nin a village called Baiguo, or 100 Fruits, Qiu Chuan, 28, dons a beekeeper's\nhat and helps his dad lift some honeycomb frames from the family's hives. His\nmother cuts away some of the comb, then places the frame in a spinning\ncontraption that extracts the honey from each little crevice.Two years ago,\nQiu started selling his family's honey online. Although he has only a middle\nschool education, his e-commerce savvy made him ideal for the Rural Taobao\nprogram, said Yuan, and last year Qiu opened a Rural Taobao storefront in\nBaiguo.In addition to helping villagers buy things online, Qiu has started\nselling his neighbors' produce over the Internet. He drives around in his tan\nvan, plastered with Rural Taobao logos, collecting ginger and sweet\npotatoes.If the villagers sell their ginger in the township, Qiu said, they\ncan get about 27 cents for 18 ounces. He pays about 42 cents for that amount,\nand sells the same quantity online for 64 cents.While Rural Taobao is helping\nfarmers sell their produce at higher prices and buy things more cheaply, the\nintroduction of the platform has not been without its effects on local brick-\nand-mortar stores, Yuan acknowledges.Simon Lai has no personal need for\ntampons.

But this year, the resident of southern China’s Guangdong province\nexpects to buy more than half a million dollars worth of the feminine hygiene\nproducts in Los Angeles, ship them across the Pacific, and sell them for a\ngood profit.His business on Alibaba...When Jade Peak's farmers found they\ncould buy fertilizer online for about two-thirds of the price they were paying\nin the nearby township, the local supplier cut his price and renegotiated with\nhis supplier. It is part of Yuan's job to travel around the county and try to\nmanage the frictions that arise. In the case of the local fertilizer dealer,\nhe helped that business start selling online so it could expand its customer\nbase.Luo Rong says he keeps the peace with the small convenience stores in\nJade Peak by focusing his sales on products they don't offer. As for Qiu, he\nsays he's won over local shopkeepers by helping them order products online to\nresell in their stores.There is great room to grow e-commerce in rural areas,\nAlibaba believes. Of the 600 million rural Chinese, only 77 million shopped\nonline in 2014, according to data from the China Internet Network Information\nCenter. In the first quarter of 2015, less than 10% of online purchases made\nthrough Alibaba platforms were shipped to rural areas.Once consumers become\nRural Taobao customers, Alibaba will have the opportunity to offer them a wide\nvariety of services, including loans through its affiliate Ant Financial and\nfinancial services including interest-bearing accounts. At headquarters,\nAlibaba has 600 full-time employees devoted to the program now, and will\nincrease that to 1,000 this year.Sun would not say whether Rural Taobao was\nmaking money yet.\"We are not considering profits now; we are not doing those\ncalculations,\" he said. \"Right now we are just investing a lot in logistics,\nin hardware.\"Sun, who grew up in a small village near Hangzhou called White\nOx, says the ultimate aim is to eliminate the urban-rural gap in\nopportunities, incomes and conveniences.\"Many people will return home to be\npart of this,\" he predicts. \"I see this as a revolution.\"**Twitter:\n@JulieMakLAT**_Nicole Liu in The Times' Beijing bureau contributed to this\nreport._**ALSO****Some political candidates in India must prove they use a\ntoilet****Some prominent Chinese are chafing against censorship.

It wasn’t really something I wanted to happen just because I’m a\npretty private person in general.”Now, Chalifoux has a chance at redemption.\nVillanova has stormed to the Final Four. And on Saturday, Chalifoux will be\nthere to watch.She still isn’t sure why she was the subject of so much\nfascination. She was emotional because she was a senior, and “it was just hard\nknowing all of those memories were over,” she said.She said most of the online\ncomments were positive. The few negative ones she avoided.Her viral fame came\nwith perks. Jimmy Fallon invited her to “The Tonight Show.” She played the\npiccolo with the Roots. Fallon gave her a gift basket.“You’ll get ’em next\nyear,” he told her.The National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum contacted\nher about making a commemorative bobblehead. She turned it into a fundraiser\nfor the Villanova band.The band got $2,000, and “I have my own bobblehead,”\nChalifoux said. Which I never thought would happen.”Then, life went on.“I\nstill went to my classes, I still had to finish my degree, and I had a lot of\nwork to do,” said Chalifoux, who was a biology major and a psychology\nminor.Chalifoux now attends the Pennsylvania College of Optometry, where she\nwatches Villanova games when she has time.

Took a selfie and stuff.”Ochefu\nhopes Villanova will move Chalifoux to tears again, “but hopefully this year\nit will be for a different reason,” he said.But the piccolo, Chalifoux said,\nwon’t make a return.“No instruments,” Chalifoux said. “Nope, I’m\ndone.”**Follow Zach Helfand on Twitter: @zhelfand.****ALSO****Watch Mike Trout\nand Angels teammates prank Garrett Richards****The Dodgers' Corey Seager\ndoesn't act like baseball's top prospect****Rams roll out ticket pricing plan,\nwith packages ranging from $360 to $2,025**\n\n","title":"A year later Villanova's 'Piccolo Girl' has come to terms with her NCAA tournament social media fame - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"A year later Villanova's, “Piccolo Girl” has come to terms with her NCAA tournament social media fame https://t.co/wLxL6uR21C","date":"Sat Apr 02 18:35:05 +0000 2016","favs":11,"id":{"$numberLong":"716333146527154176"},"retweets":13},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/25D2Z3j"}

The\nincident happened about 9:15 a.m. near state Route 76 south of Fallbrook. Two\npeople were reportedly aboard the plane, and four were in the vehicle.The\nairplane was initially described as a small jet by a witness, according to the\nCalifornia Highway Patrol's website. Traffic was jammed in the area, but the\nplane itself was mostly off the freeway, partially in some bushes.California\nHighway Patrol Officer Chris Parent said the driver was stopped on the\nshoulder trying to sync his Bluetooth with his vehicle when the car was struck\nby the plane from behind. A passenger seated in the right rear of the car, a\nwoman in her 20s, was killed, said North County Fire Protection District\nspokesman John Buchanan. Three others in the car — two men and a woman — were\ntaken to a hospital with minor to moderate injuries. It took firefighters\nabout 20 minutes to extricate one of the car's occupants.The pilot suffered\nlife-threatening injuries. It was not known the extent of injuries to the\nplane's passenger.At a news conference, a CHP spokesman said the FAA was\ninvestigating the cause of the crash.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc53d"},"content":"Most of Sen. Bernie Sanders' supporters in California say they expect that\ncome November, Hillary Clinton will be elected president — and, by and large,\nthey're OK with that.While both Democratic camps prepare for a final battle in\nthe state’s June 7 primary, the latest USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times\nstatewide poll found that just over half of Sanders’ supporters said they\nexpected Clinton to be the next president. About a third of Sanders’ backers\nsaid they expected the Vermont senator to emerge the winner, and 12% said they\nthought Donald Trump would prevail.Close to 8 in 10 Sanders supporters said in\nthe survey that they would vote for Clinton in a race against Trump, although\nmany said they would do so reluctantly.Those findings show the reality\nunderlying the still-heated rhetoric of the Democratic primaries: By contrast\nwith the civil war that divides Republicans, Democrats in the country’s\nlargest state have begun to coalesce behind their front-runner.In the primary\nrace, Clinton holds a modest lead over Sanders, 45% to 37%, among all\nDemocrats and independent voters eligible to vote. Her lead is slightly\nlarger, 47% to 36%, among those most likely to vote. Either way, that’s a\nsignificant problem for Sanders.Riding a rebellion fueled by opposition to\nillegal immigration and pessimism about the nation's future, Donald Trump\nleads a scrambling duo of competitors less than three months before\nCalifornia's Republican presidential primary, a new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles\nTimes statewide poll has found.Yet...Riding a rebellion fueled by opposition\nto illegal immigration and pessimism about the nation's future, Donald Trump\nleads a scrambling duo of competitors less than three months before\nCalifornia's Republican presidential primary, a new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles\nTimes statewide poll has found.Yet...The poll was conducted before Sanders’\nsweep of three Western states — Alaska, Hawaii and Washington — on Saturday,\nbut those victories don’t change the electoral math much. Sanders would need\nnot just a win in California, but something close to a landslide to overcome\nClinton’s large lead in delegates before the party’s nominating convention in\nJuly.Something else hasn’t changed: If there’s one blemish in the picture for\nClinton, it’s the persistently high percentage of voters who have an\nunfavorable image of her, 45% in the new poll.Clinton’s image in heavily\nDemocratic California is more positive than it is in more Republican parts of\nthe country; 52% of the state’s surveyed voters see her favorably. She fares\nfar better than Trump, her most likely opponent in November, who is viewed\nnegatively by almost three-fourths of California voters.A Democratic voter at\na Washington state caucus on Saturday. In the California primary race, Hillary\nClinton holds a modest lead over Bernie Sanders, 45% to 37%, among all\nDemocrats and independent voters eligible to vote.A Democratic voter at a\nWashington state caucus on Saturday. In the California primary race, Hillary\nClinton holds a modest lead over Bernie Sanders, 45% to 37%, among all\nDemocrats and independent voters eligible to vote.But her image with the\npublic lags significantly behind other leading Democrats. That includes\nPresident Obama, whose popularity has risen, both statewide and nationally, in\nrecent weeks. He is now seen favorably by 65% of the state’s voters, the\nhighest level since early in his tenure. Gov. Jerry Brown is viewed favorably\nby 57%. Both men are viewed negatively by about one-third of voters.The large\nshare of voters who have a negative view of her does not put Clinton in danger\nof losing California in a general election: She would defeat any of the\nRepublican candidates handily in the state, which has formed the cornerstone\nof Democratic victories nationally ever since her husband’s win in 1992.\nAgainst Trump, in particular, Clinton would win overwhelmingly, the poll\nindicated, carrying the state 59% to 28%.But the negative impressions of so\nmany Californians point toward the deeper problem she faces in the country and\nalso to the likely tone of the fall campaign. A Clinton-Trump race, more than\nany other in recent decades, would feature two candidates who would start the\ncampaign with large parts of the electorate deeply disenchanted with them.\nGiven that, each side is likely to try to focus voters’ attention on the\nother’s flaws.“Clinton’s challenge is not one of persuasion, it’s one of\nmotivation,” said Dan Schnur, director of USC’s Jesse M. Unruh Institute of\nPolitics. “She’s not going to get Sanders supporters to fall in love with\nher,” he added, but “the other way to motivate your base is to frighten them\nabout the alternative. Against Donald Trump, that should be very\ndoable.”That’s certainly the case for Gretta Whalen, a 32-year-old freelance\nwriter and communications consultant from Los Angeles, who leans toward\nSanders. Clinton, she said, “has been around for so long, and we know so much\nabout her, and not all of it is positive.” Sanders, by contrast, seems\nattractive, and his ideas feel new, even if “some of them are very pie in the\nsky and would be very difficult to get the rest of the country on board\nwith.”But, she added, as she paused from feeding her newborn son, the contest\nis different “now that we’re looking at a likely race against Donald Trump.”\nShe and her friends, most of whom back Sanders, “are all so shocked that we’re\nin this place where Donald Trump is a serious contender for president,” she\nsaid. Compared with past elections, this campaign “feels a little more\nsurreal.”“I was much more excited about Bernie” earlier in the campaign\nseason, she added. “We love him as a candidate. We also recognize that he’s\nnot the most realistic winner.”Just under 1 in 4 voters in the state have a\nnegative image of both of the likely contestants. That group would hold its\nnose and side with Clinton over Trump, 38% to 23%, with a significant share of\nthem saying they would not vote at all, the poll found.Sercan Ersoy, a 33\n-year-old substitute teacher in Oakland, has much more negative feelings about\nClinton than does Whalen. A former member of the Green Party who changed his\nregistration in order to vote for Sanders in the primary, Ersoy feels Clinton\nis “too much of a war hawk” in addition to having too many ties to Wall\nStreet. “I don’t want to vote for her,” he said.But “if you ask me in late\nOctober,” he added, “and there’s a real possibility of a President Trump, I\nmight say, ‘OK. I’ll vote for Hillary.’”This USC/L.A. Times poll was conducted\nMarch 16-23 by telephone, both cellphone and landline, among 1,503 registered\nvoters in California, including 832 Democrats and non-party voters eligible to\ntake part in the June primary. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus\n2.8 percentage points for the full sample and 3.7 percentage points for the\nDemocratic primary sample. It was conducted by Greenberg Quinlan Rosner\nResearch, a Democratic polling firm, and the Republican company American\nViewpoint.The poll found the race between Clinton and Sanders dividing along\nlines that have become familiar during nearly two months of primaries: Sanders\noverwhelmingly wins voters younger than 30; Clinton does better with older\nvoters. She leads among women by 11 percentage points, among men by 5\npoints.Clinton leads narrowly among white voters but has a much larger edge\namong blacks and Latinos. In a surprise, given her family’s long-standing\npopularity with Asian voters, Clinton appears to be trailing Sanders with that\ngroup, although his edge, 43% to 35%, is within the poll’s margin of error for\nsuch a subgroup.Clinton’s lead among minority voters is “much more muted” than\nher edge in previous contests in Texas and across the South, said pollster\nAnna Greenberg. That’s largely a result of a generational divide, with Sanders\nleading among younger Latinos, much as he does among young white voters. The\nother minority groups are too small to allow a detailed breakdown by age.The\nother significant division in the primary is by party. California’s Democratic\nprimary is open to registered Democrats as well as voters who decline to state\na party. Clinton leads Sanders by 14 percentage points among registered\nDemocrats; Sanders leads by 9 percentage points among the nonpartisan voters —\nagain a pattern seen repeatedly in other states.Among Sanders voters, 80%\npolled said they would vote for Clinton in November, although the share saying\nthey would do so “reluctantly,” 45%, outnumbers those who would do so\n“enthusiastically,” 35%.About 1 in 8 Democratic primary voters surveyed said\nthey would refuse to vote for Clinton if she is the nominee. That’s half the\nlevel of rejection that Trump faces among Republican primary voters.Among the\nDemocratic primary voters most resistant to backing her in the fall are white\nmen 65 and older, according to the poll. By contrast, only 4% of people who\nidentified themselves as students said they would refuse to vote for Clinton —\nanother indication that Sanders’ core supporters are unlikely to reject her\ncandidacy.By 72% to 21%, Democratic primary voters said in the survey that\nthey are excited about the prospect of voting for the first female\npresident.Sanders has centered his campaign around the belief that the U.S.\neconomy is unfairly rigged by Wall Street and big corporations. Not\nsurprisingly, a large majority of his voters share that view.The poll asked\npeople if they thought that in today’s economy “everyone has a fair chance to\nget ahead in the long run if they work hard” or if “it’s mainly just a few\npeople at the top who have a chance to get ahead.” By more than 2 to 1,\nSanders’ voters said that only those at the top could get ahead.Clinton’s\nsupporters were more evenly divided, with 52% saying that everyone had a fair\nchance and 42% saying that only those at the top could get ahead. That\nreflected, in part, the feelings of Latinos, who are more likely than other\nAmericans to say that hard work still pays off in the long run.Those who\nbacked Clinton were also more likely than Sanders’ backers to say that “when\nit comes to good jobs for American workers, our best years are ahead of us.”\nMore than 6 in 10 of Clinton’s voters agreed with that statement, compared\nwith just under half of Sanders’.Neither group of Democratic voters was as\npessimistic as Trump’s supporters, however. A majority of them said that when\nit comes to good jobs, “America’s best years are behind\nus.\"_david.lauter@latimes.com_For more on Campaign 2016, follow\n@davidlauter_**Sign up for the Essential Politics\nnewsletter**_**ALSO:****Trump leads Republican primary field****California's\nJune primary just became crucial in the race for the White House****Full\ncoverage of the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll******Full poll results and\ndetailed crosstabs******Updates on California politics****Live coverage from\nthe campaign trail**\n\n","title":"As California primary nears, even Sanders supporters are uniting behind Clinton and against a common enemy: Trump - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Even Sanders supporters are uniting behind Clinton and against a common enemy: Trump https://t.co/7BzX9hgUo9 https://t.co/Xx0LtfQ0fG","date":"Sat Apr 02 15:02:04 +0000 2016","favs":137,"id":{"$numberLong":"716279536623726594"},"retweets":98},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1RF4nrF"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc53e"},"content":"Looking to cash in on a booming real estate market, Los Angeles property\nowners are demolishing an increasing number of rent-controlled buildings to\nbuild pricey McMansions, condos and new rentals, leading to hundreds of\nevictions across the city.More than 1,000 rent-controlled apartments were\ntaken off the market last year — a nearly threefold increase since 2013,\naccording to a Times analysis of housing data. Evictions from such units have\ndoubled over the same time.Across L.A., more than 20,000 rent-controlled units\nhave been taken off the market since 2001, city records show. The removals\npeaked during the housing bubble and then bottomed out in the recession, but\nthey have risen significantly since then.The number of lost units is a\nfraction of the roughly 641,000 rent-controlled apartments in the city, but in\na tight market the removals have had an outsized effect, tenant advocates say,\neating away at the supply of affordable housing at a time when L.A. has become\none of the least affordable cities in the country.\"Our housing situation is\nbeyond crisis,\" said Larry Gross, executive director of the Coalition for\nEconomic Survival, a tenant advocacy group. \"It's a catastrophe and it's\ngetting worse.\"Especially hard hit in the transformation are upscale\nneighborhoods such as Beverly Grove, Sawtelle and Pico-Robertson, where demand\nfor high-end housing is strong.Dee Ann Newkirk watched last year as a trio of\napartment buildings on her block in Beverly Grove came toppling down.A\ndeveloper, Wiseman Residential, had purchased the properties and evicted six\nresidents there. The developer plans to replace 12 rent-controlled units with\n30 pricier apartments and three units for lower-income tenants, according to\nbuilding permits.The same company has since acquired Newkirk's fourplex and\nthe building to her north, property records show. She fears she will soon be\nevicted too.\"They are going down the block and I'm the next building,\" said\nNewkirk, who rents a one-bedroom apartment on North Hayworth Avenue with her\nhusband and infant daughter for $1,350.Over the last decade, Wiseman has\nevicted at least 237 tenants from rent-controlled properties in Los Angeles.\nThe company purchased more than a dozen other properties where landlords had\nalready used the state law to clear out apartments, including one of the\nbuildings on Newkirk's block, according to city records.Michael Cohanzad,\nsenior vice president of development and business affairs for Wiseman, said\nhis company has built five times as many new apartments in place of rent-\ncontrolled units it removed, a benefit to a city facing a serious housing\nshortage.\"The story that gets lost in all of this is that the buildings ...\nare past their useful life,\" Cohanzad said. \"Many of these homes are asbestos-\nfilled, termite-infested, and are not compliant with today's retrofit\nregulations. So it's a matter of time that these buildings will be torn\ndown.\"Rent control in L.A. primarily applies to multifamily buildings built\nbefore October 1978. When a new tenant moves in, a landlord can set the rent\nas high as someone is willing to pay, but rent increases in subsequent years\nwould be capped — recently at 3%.Tenants in rent-controlled buildings have\nstrong protections against eviction to ensure landlords can't kick them out to\ncharge higher market rents.But under the Ellis Act, passed in 1985, landlords\nare able to evict tenants if they intend to either take the housing off the\nrental market or demolish the building to put up new apartments.Landlords in\nthe city can set the initial rent for those new rentals, although the\napartments are then subject to rent control. Owners can avoid rent-control\nregulations by reserving some of those new units for low-income residents.Many\nof the recent evictions have been carried out by developers who have purchased\nthe buildings with the intention of demolishing them to construct pricier\nhousing. At least 51% of the L.A. properties removed under the Ellis Act in\n2013 had been purchased within the previous year, according to a Times\nanalysis.The practice has sparked a backlash in Los Angeles and San Francisco.\nEfforts in recent years by state legislators to amend the law failed amid\nopposition from the real estate industry. One proposal would have allowed San\nFrancisco to bar landlords from using the Ellis Act to evict tenants for five\nyears after acquiring a property. Another would have allowed local\njurisdictions to set moratoriums on such evictions.Los Angeles officials are\nalso investigating claims that some landlords are evicting tenants to convert\napartments into illegal short-terms rentals, such as Airbnb.The debate comes\nas city officials have been struggling to boost the supply of affordable\nhousing for low- and middle-income residents.\"Unless there's a marriage\nbetween production and preservation, we are doomed to a failed housing policy\nin this city,\" Gross said.The council's Housing Committee has discussed ways\nto preserve affordable housing. Among the ideas under consideration are\nestablishing an annual cap on demolitions of rent-controlled apartments and\nwithholding demolition permits until other permits for new construction have\nbeen issued. The issue is set to come before council again this spring, a\nhousing spokeswoman said.Jim Clarke of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los\nAngeles said curbing use of the Ellis Act will hamper new construction in a\nlargely built-out city and worsen an already difficult housing market.\"If they\nmessed with it, it just becomes another disincentive to build more housing,\"\nClarke said.Housing department data show that developers have pulled permits\nto build twice as many new units as they removed with the Ellis Act from 2010\nto 2014. It's unclear whether those 4,632 new units are rentals or for-sale\nhousing.Clarke said he doesn't think the Ellis Act is aggravating the city's\nhousing crisis. But tenant advocates say those new homes are often too\nexpensive for evicted renters to afford.Some property owners, though, aren't\nadding new units at all.Apartments that were previously rent-controlled are\nnow showing up on short-term rental sites, where property owners can charge\nsignificantly higher prices. Three evicted tenants in the Fairfax district\nsued their former landlord last year after they noticed their units listed on\nAirbnb weeks after they moved out — at rates totaling $15,000 a month.\"We were\nin total disbelief when we saw that,\" said Nina Giovannitti, an evicted tenant\nwho had paid $1,900 a month for her shared apartment.Landlords who evict\ntenants and later rent the units on a short-term basis would violate rent-\ncontrol laws unless they receive approval from the city to use the property as\na hotel, said Anna Ortega, director of the housing department's rent\nstabilization division.The housing agency is working with the city attorney's\noffice to investigate several similar complaints in Venice, she said.Rob\nWilcox, spokesman for City Atty. Mike Feuer, said he could not discuss ongoing\ninvestigations, but added the office is \"focused on cracking down on property\nowners and tenants who are flouting the law, potentially taking affordable\nhousing units out of circulation and at the same time making a very quick,\neasy and lucrative profit.\"Some landlords use the threat of eviction under the\nEllis Act to persuade renters to take voluntary cash buyouts, known as \"cash\nfor keys.\" The offers may be less than a landlord must pay in relocation fees\nunder the Ellis Act, which start at $7,550.The tactic, unaccounted for in\nhousing data, allows landlords to legally re-rent the units — at a higher\nprice.Ortega said the agency is working on a proposal to track buyouts across\nthe city and require landlords to notify tenants of their right to refuse to\ntake a buyout.J.P. Lavin arrived home last August to find a letter on the door\nof his Los Feliz apartment informing him that the 42-unit building was being\nconverted to condos and that he and other residents would have 90 days to\nleave.Though the owners hadn't filed the required Ellis Act paperwork to evict\ntenants, the letters from the property management company said they would be\n\"vacating/relocating\" the building, called The Cove. Residents would receive\nmoney to help with moving expenses, according to the letter, a copy of which\nwas reviewed by The Times.\"Everyone was freaked out,\" Lavin said.The apartment\nmanager, Jamie Jantzen, later texted Lavin to encourage him to take a buyout\nof up to $14,000, noting that he would only receive $10,200 under the Ellis\nAct.\"Unfortunately, the inevitable is that you will be moving either way. Why\nnot sweeten the deal?\" Jantzen wrote.Steven Taylor, a representative with Ness\nProperty Management, which manages the building, said the conversation took\nplace when his company was considering converting the units to condos and that\nJantzen had the \"best intentions.\" Taylor said there are no plans to do condo\nconversions now and that the vacated units will probably be remodeled and re-\nrented as apartments.Lavin has so far refused to take a buyout offer, which\nhas now risen to more than $30,000. As of early February, nearly half the\nunits were vacated and all tenants received buyouts, Taylor\nsaid._ben.poston@latimes.com__andrew.khouri@latimes.com_**ALSO****What it's\nlike to live in a city with a $14 minimum wage****California sues Morgan\nStanley over crisis-era mortgage bonds****'Our compensation causes a lot of\nheartburn': L.A.

These days, his view includes the backs of dozens of men\nrelieving themselves in a new open-air urinal, the city's latest solution to a\npervasive lack of restrooms.On sunny weekends, Dolores Park becomes a giant\nbeach blanket for thousands of fog-fatigued San Franciscans. They play tennis,\nbasketball and Frisbee. They sunbathe, and picnic, and consume prodigious\nquantities of beer for which their bladders are no match.**See more of our top\nstories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Sullivan was happy that the park, which had not\nbeen improved for more than half a century, got an expensive face lift last\nyear: new irrigation, new playgrounds, new tennis courts and two sorely needed\nnew restrooms.As the renovations wrapped up, he noticed workers pouring a\nconcrete base on the corner, beside a Muni streetcar stop that runs along the\nwestern edge of the park.How cool, he told a friend. They're putting up a\nstatue.\"My friend was listening to the news, and she called me and said, 'You\naren't going to believe this. It's not a statue. It's a urinal!' I was\nshocked.\"The problem with this urinal, which city officials call a _pissoir_\n(one of the few instances where a French word sounds uglier than its English\ncounterpart), is that privacy-wise, it has none.I have never seen anything\nquite like it. The base is a concrete pad with a drain but no spigots. A\ncrescent-shaped fence offers limited privacy. The fence looks as if it's\nsupposed to be covered with vines, but there aren't any, so a small tarp\ncovers the, ah, strike zone.As we sat in his living room, Sullivan showed me\nphotos on his iPhone: The backs of three men using the urinal simultaneously.\nA street car stopping in front of the urinal. Schoolchildren walking past.On\nEaster, as his children and grandchildren joined him for dinner, he said,\ntheir unappetizing view was a dozen men waiting to use the urinal. At least it\nfaces away from his home.\"The most upsetting thing is just seeing people\nurinate in the busiest corner of the park,\" Sullivan said. \"People in the\ntrains can look down and see the person peeing.\"We walked outside to get a\ncloser look. From the side, it offers zero privacy. \"If you were standing here\nwith a kid waiting for a train,\" Sullivan said, \"you can see right\nin!\"**::**On Feb. 4, the Pacific Justice Institute, a conservative legal group\nthat usually defends people who believe their religious liberty is being\ninfringed, sent a stern letter to the general manager of San Francisco's\nRecreation and Parks Department.The urinal, wrote the institute's chief\ncounsel, Kevin Snider, is an assault on decency. It discriminates against\nwomen and the disabled, violates plumbing codes, impairs the public health\n(there is no sink for hand washing) and is a public nuisance.Snider must have\nhad fun writing this letter; he refers to the \"open-air urination hole,\" the\n\"sewer hole\" and the \"open-hole place for urination.\"The institute has\nthreatened to sue the city on behalf of distressed neighbors. In frustration,\nSullivan told me, he signed on to the effort last week. Early on, he\nregistered his distress with his supervisor, Scott Wiener, who is running for\nthe California Senate.Wiener's response did not placate him. \"He wrote back\nand said, 'We realize we're going to have to tweak it.' But they can't do too\nmuch to it, because that would bring other problems.\"**::**To understand the\nurinal, you must first understand the sociology of Dolores Park.In the last\ndecade, as techies have pushed into the Mission, gentrifying everything in\nsight, the park has become crowded. Pretty much everyone knows how the park's\nreal estate is divvied up: kids here, hipsters there, lesbians have a spot.\nGay men have the southwest corner, affectionately dubbed \"the gay beach.\"The\n_pissoir_ is steps from the gay beach.\"Part of the rationale is that there\nwere many more men than women there,\" Wiener told me. \"Men could use it, and\nit would take pressure off the other restrooms.\"He acknowledged the privacy\nproblem and said the city is working to improve screening. \"But you don't want\nit to be too secluded,\" he said, \"because problematic things can happen, like\ndrug use.\"The $40,000 urinal was not a whim. It was the result of many\ncommunity meetings with hundreds of park users who helped develop the park\nrenovation plan, Wiener said. There was unanimous sentiment for more\nrestrooms.The feedback on the urinal, he said, has been almost entirely\npositive. But if it has to come out, he admitted, it can.Wednesday afternoon,\nI bumped into Allen Graves, owner of San Francisco Love Tours. He takes\nvisitors around the city in a psychedelically painted VW van. On this day, he\nhad a family from Dayton, Ohio, in tow.\"So everybody just urinates right\nhere?\" said Jim Caldwell, a retired Air Force vet. \"Well,\" he said with a\nshrug, \"they do that in France.\"Of course, like eating horse meat and snails,\nthat doesn't make it\nright._robin.abcarian@latimes.com_@AbcarianLAT**ALSO****Elon Musk unveils\nTesla Model 3 to huge fanfare****Longtime marijuana use might make you a\nloser****Yamashiro's new landlord seeks to evict longtime restaurant operator,\npossibly to go more upscale**\n\n","title":"Open-air urinal in San Francisco park has no designs on privacy - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Open-air urinal in San Francisco park has no designs on privacy https://t.co/gSxIg4uyyK https://t.co/7iqmCVgIUk","date":"Sat Apr 02 11:45:11 +0000 2016","favs":28,"id":{"$numberLong":"716229990006800384"},"retweets":32},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1RC8u8T"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc543"},"content":"Add immigration enforcement to the list of jobs the U.S. has partially out-\nsourced to Mexico, a move that seems to have made life even tougher for\nunaccompanied minors fleeing violence and gangs in Guatemala, Honduras and El\nSalvador.As the U.S. faced a surge of unaccompanied minors crossing the\nMexican border over the past couple of years, it developed counter-measures\naimed at persuading the Central American kids and their families to stay home\nrather than gamble with the arduous and dangerous overland route to the U.S.\nPart of that response was to get the Mexican government to be more diligent at\nits own southern border and turn back children as they showed up there. That\napparently was effective for a time. The Migration Policy Institute reports\nthat:“While apprehensions at the U.S. border fell, apprehensions in Mexico\nrose significantly, suggesting that outflows from Central America remained\nfairly stable throughout 2015; many migrants were apprehended by Mexican\nauthorities before reaching the U.S. border. Indeed, though the combined\napprehensions of Honduran, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan nationals by the United\nStates and Mexico fell from 341,000 in FY 2014 to 301,000 in FY 2015, Mexico’s\nshare of apprehensions increased from about 30 percent to 55 percent.”So while\npeople were still fleeing the Northern Triangle countries at a slightly slower\nrate (a good backgrounder on why they leave is here), fewer were getting as\nfar as Texas, where most of the U.S. apprehensions occur. But in recent\nmonths, border agents have been apprehending more kids than before. For the\nperiod between October 2015 and January 2016, apprehensions more than doubled\nfrom the prior year and were up 24% over the same period in 2013-2014 (stats\ngoing back to 2010 are here). Whether this signals a new surge is unknown, but\ngiven the stepped-up enforcement at the Mexico-Guatemala border, clearly the\nmigrants and their smugglers have found new routes north.And that tightening\nof Mexico’s southern border has raised serious questions about whether the\nMexican government, acting at the behest of the U.S. and helped with U.S.\nfunding, is respecting international safeguards for people seeking asylum from\nlife-threatening conditions in their home countries, according to a new report\nfrom Human Rights Watch. Immigrant rights advocates have argued that U.S.\npolicies, including fast-track deportations of minors and mothers with\nchildren, are similarly denying them the opportunity to properly made a case\nthat they deserve asylum protections.According to Human Rights Watch, Mexican\nauthorities routinely detain minors seeking asylum in “prison-like conditions”\nfor months before a hearing is held. “Over 35,000 children were held in\nimmigration detention centers in 2015; more than half of that total were\nunaccompanied.” Faced with the prospect of lengthy incarceration, many minors\ngive up and return home (to, presumably, try again to get to the U.S.). As\nseveral similar reports have noted, those seeking better economic\nopportunities don’t qualify for protections. But those facing extreme violence\nand threats of death often do qualify. Yet they are being denied the\nopportunity to make their case.In the U.S., the children often have to\npersuade immigration judges that they qualify for protections. But unless\nthey’re lucky enough to be matched with a pro bono lawyer, they stand alone to\nmake the argument — ignorant of the intricacies of the complicated immigration\nlaws and of what rights and arguments are available to them. The ACLU and\nother civil liberties and immigrant rights advocates have sued the federal\ngovernment, arguing that the minors should be provided with a lawyer for such\nhearings.Meanwhile, despite a pledge of more U.S. dollars to try to stabilize\nneighborhoods in the Northern Triangle countries, little has changed, with\nmurder rates leading the world among countries not at war. Extortion and other\ncrimes are rampant as criminals work with relative impunity.The unaccompanied\nminors’ issue, which dominated news cycles in 2014 and 2015, has all but\ndisappeared from public discussion, drowned out by the absurdities of the\npresidential campaign. But it hasn’t gone away.The U.S. bears responsibility\nfor ensuring that minors who knock at the door and seek protection under both\ninternational and U.S. law are treated properly. And if they are being\ndeprived of those rights at the Guatemala-Mexico border as a result of U.S.\npolicy and funding, the government bears some responsibility for that,\ntoo.**Follow Scott Martelle on Twitter @smartelle.**\n\n","title":"Opinion: Amid Central American violence, refugee rights must be respected - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Opinion: Amid Central American violence, refugee rights must be respected https://t.co/tBY5VTuQww via @latimesopinion","date":"Sat Apr 02 10:35:08 +0000 2016","favs":6,"id":{"$numberLong":"716212361116442626"},"retweets":22},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1pRUHDN"}

Gorbachev said of Genscher in his 1995\nmemoir.Genscher lobbied Western allies to back Poland and Hungary during their\nearly efforts to loosen the shackles binding them to Moscow, including\nHungary's bold decision to tear down its barbed-wire barriers along the\nAustrian border.That first hole punched in the Iron Curtain inspired fed-up\nEast Germans to begin pouring out to seek asylum in the West after summer\nvacations in Czechoslovakia and Hungary in 1989. By autumn, tens of thousands\nthronged West German embassies across Eastern Europe demanding evacuation from\nlives they considered to hold little promise as long as East Germany was ruled\nby Erich Honecker, an inflexible Communist ideologue.Hans-Dietrich Genscher at\nhis home in Wachtberg, Germany, in 2014. Hans-Dietrich Genscher at his home in\nWachtberg, Germany, in 2014. Genscher later described his proudest moment as\nthe brief address he made to East German refugees crowding the squalid grounds\nof Bonn's embassy in Prague to tell them he had just negotiated their release.\nTypically modest and unemotional, Genscher's one-line announcement was drowned\nout by the crowd's thunderous applause and jubilation.It was a moment captured\nby television crews covering the long standoff and replayed repeatedly in\ndocumentaries about the steps that culminated in Germany's Oct. 3, 1990,\nreunification.Born March 21, 1927, in the farming village of Reideburg, near\nHalle, Genscher was the only child of a country lawyer, Kurt Genscher, and his\nwife, Hilde. The future diplomat was only 9 when his father died of blood\npoisoning, leaving him alone to care for his mother as Germany was on the\nmarch toward another world war.Genscher learned English, Latin and French at\nschool and, like millions of other young students, was part of the Hitler\nYouth before being compelled at age 16 to join the Nazi dictator's flagging\nquest for world domination. He was trained in antiaircraft operations and\nserved with a Wehrmacht unit near his home in Halle, enduring the ferocious\nAllied bombardments in the waning months of the war.He was serving on the last\nfront line along the Elbe River between Soviet and U.S. forces when the war\nended and surrendered to U.S. troops. He and other POWs in the region were\nsoon handed over to British forces and put to work on farms to help feed the\noccupying troops and vanquished population, but eventually fell under Soviet\njurisdiction when the Red Army asserted control over what was to become East\nGermany.In late 1989, history took a sharp, unplanned turn.

By most accounts, it happened\nbecause of Guenter Schabowski.Meeting the media after weeks of pro-democracy\nprotests, the spokesman for the repressive East German state was asked about\nrumors of a new travel law. Were the restrictions that had...Little is known\nof Genscher's year as a POW in the hands of the Russians, and his long-awaited\nmemoir published in 1995 shed disappointingly little light on that era. But by\nMay 1946, he had enrolled at Martin Luther University in Wittenberg to study\nlaw and economics.While still a student, Genscher joined the Liberal\nDemocratic Party in 1946, helping shape first the state organization in his\nnative Saxony-Anhalt and later the federal party structure he was to head from\n1974 until his retirement in 1992. He served as honorary chairman for the rest\nof his life.His work with the political party put him in touch with liberals\nacross the inter-German border, and it was during a 1952 visit to Bremen that\nhe decided to resettle in the West German state.Genscher won his first\nparliamentary seat in 1965 and four years later was appointed interior\nminister under the coalition government of Social Democratic Chancellor Willy\nBrandt. In May 1974, after a government shake-up following an espionage\nscandal, Genscher moved into the Foreign Ministry leadership, a position he\nwas to hold for the next 18 years. Dawn light had just begun to wash over the\ngritty outskirts of East Berlin as the overnight train from Warsaw approached\nthe station.The communist-ruled side of the Berlin Wall was mostly a no-man's\nland of barbed wire and booby-trapped \"death strips\" beyond crumbling\napartments and streets usually...Dawn light had just begun to wash over the\ngritty outskirts of East Berlin as the overnight train from Warsaw approached\nthe station.The communist-ruled side of the Berlin Wall was mostly a no-man's\nland of barbed wire and booby-trapped \"death strips\" beyond crumbling\napartments and streets usually...As West Germany's chief diplomat, Genscher\ncarried forward and enhanced Brandt's much-celebrated “Ostpolitik,” the policy\nof easing tense relations with Cold War adversaries in Communist-ruled Eastern\nEurope.

Customers, some of whom own spreads as large as 10 acres, \"wanted to\nknow why they were still being held to drought restrictions.\" So the district\nboard lifted them, replacing a 33% mandatory conservation cutback with a 10%\nvoluntary cut and eliminating a 10% drought surcharge on water rates,\neffective April 1.The abundance of water, says Assistant General Manager Keith\nDurkin, made it \"very difficult to defend a continued 33% reduction in\nuse.\"Across Northern and Central California, brimming reservoirs and a\nrecovering mountain snowpack are prompting water users to pressure Gov. Jerry\nBrown and the State Water Resources Control Board to ratchet back restrictions\nthat have made California a national leader in conservation.The Placer County\nWater Agency on March 18 asked state authorities to rescind emergency drought\nregulations on the grounds that its supply is \"robust enough to meet demand\"\nfrom its customers through 2017. The Nevada Irrigation District, east of\nMarysville, cited \"well above average precipitation, full reservoirs and a\nmountain snowpack\" in rescinding its own drought declaration and calling on\nthe state to ease its restrictions.Districts such as San Juan have taken\nmatters into their own hands by unilaterally removing the most stringent\nregulations on their own customers. San Juan says its customers met their\nconservation obligation by reducing usage by 34% from June through February.\nNot all the protesting districts managed that; the Georgetown Divide Public\nUtility District in El Dorado County, which last month lifted a drought-\ninspired moratorium on new water connections, acknowledges that it was\nupbraided by the state board in January for failing to meet its goal.The Water\nResources Board is looking for ways to ease pressure on water-rich districts\nwithout giving them a free hand. It has scheduled to consider relaxing some\nrestrictions at a meeting in May, following a workshop at which those\ndistricts will be asked to make the case for more flexibility. \"In the eyes of\nPlacer County and San Juan the job is over,\" says George Kostyrko, a spokesman\nfor the board. But water conservation \"isn't a regional or a siloed issue,\" he\nsays. \"It's a statewide issue.\"Policymakers are getting the uneasy feeling\nthat public impressions of newfound abundance could undo much of the progress\nof the last few years. \"Droughts are really a matter of signals,\" Jeanine\nJones, deputy drought manager for the California Department of Water\nResources, told me. \"When it has rained a lot, people get comfortable.\"That\nwould be a mistake. Experts reckon that even if 2016 represents a break from\nthe record dry conditions of the last four years, the damage done by the\ndrought to the state's water supply will be lasting. Long-term reserves in\ngroundwater have been drained to the point that years, even decades, of wet\nweather would be required to replenish them. \"We've depleted our savings\naccount in reserves and groundwater storage,\" Jones says.A more likely\nscenario for the future is a change in climatic conditions requiring a\npermanent change in water usage habits. \"In the water community, people talk\nabout a new normal, with dry conditions becoming more frequent and more\nlasting,\" says Matt Heberger, senior research associate at the Pacific\nInstitute, an environmental think tank in Oakland.These conditions create a\nquandary for policymakers, who must tread a fine line between enforcing\nrestrictions that people may feel are no longer necessary while guiding\nresidents, growers and businesses toward enduring changes in usage patterns.\n\"Messaging is important,\" says Ellen Hanak, a water expert at the Public\nPolicy Institute of California. \"It doesn't make sense to tell people\nconditions are terrible when they're not, but it makes sense to tell them that\nthe precipitation we've gotten hasn't put us in a safe spot.\"The habits born\nin the last few years, if they take root, could produce lasting gains in water\nsufficiency for the future. The emergency atmosphere of the last couple of\nyears has a lot to do with that: In the same sense that $3-a-gallon gas starts\nturning people off gas-guzzling SUVs, the best weapon against water shortages\nin the future is a sensation of crisis today.Since January 2014, when Gov.\nBrown declared a drought emergency, Californians have met the challenge.\nThey've replaced tens of millions of square feet of turf with drought-tolerant\nlandscaping (coaxed by hundreds of millions of dollars in utility rebates) and\ninstalled water-thrifty indoor fixtures. The results are remarkable: Statewide\naverage residential consumption of 61 gallons a day in January was nearly 15%\nbelow the same month a year earlier. Last summer's usage was more than 23%\nlower than a year earlier.Indications abound that the regional drought is far\nfrom over. The water level of Lake Mead, the reservoir behind Hoover Dam that\nstores Southern California's Colorado River supply, stood last week at\n1,081.32 feet above sea level — a recovery of about 6 feet since it reached a\nrecent low point in June. But that's still the lake's lowest level in any\nMarch since 1937, when it was still filling for the first time. Mead is\ncurrently at about 39% of capacity.Although three major Northern California\nreservoirs — Shasta, Lake Oroville and Folsom Lake — are currently above their\naverage historical levels, they're the exceptions, according to the Department\nof Water Resources.Reservoirs in Central and Southern California remain well\nbelow their averages, with Don Pedro Reservoir in the Sierra foothills at 82%\nof its average and 60% of capacity, and Perris Lake in Riverside County at 43%\nof its average and 36% of capacity. While the snowpack is calculated at 87% of\nnormal overall, its depth varies widely across the state — rising over recent\nmonths to roughly 100% of the average in the far north of the state, but\nreaching only about 75% of the average toward the south. The U.S. Drought\nMonitor still shows much of Southern and Central California to be facing long-\nterm \"exceptional drought.\"The problem with giving some parts of the state a\npass on water rules while maintaining them elsewhere is that California's\nwater supply system binds north and south together. The long-term water crisis\ncan only be solved as a statewide effort.The state has begun to make changes\nthat may well be lasting. \"There will be a different-looking outdoor space 10\nor 20 years from now than there was 10 or 20 years ago,\" Hanak says. But the\nmind-set producing those changes could be fragile. The message needs to be\nthat \"the fact that we're easing up doesn't mean we're out of drought\nmode.\"_Michael Hiltzik's column appears every Sunday.

They've done their best to stay in the Rio Grande Valley\nnear the border and avoid the Border Patrol checkpoint here on the highway\nnorth.But when Soto, 48, fell and broke his foot last Dec. 4, a local doctor\nsaid he needed to see a specialist for surgery about 275 miles north in San\nAntonio, beyond the checkpoint.“He told the doctors, ‘I don’t have documents.’\nThey told him he could go. They said nothing would happen to him,” said Blanca\nSoto, 46. “They said, ‘We will not call immigration.’”But the ambulance was\nstopped at the checkpoint, a rural ranching outpost about 75 miles north of\nthe border on Highway 281 leading to San Antonio and Houston. Immigration\nofficials held Soto for questioning before eventually allowing him to proceed,\nbut noted that he would be detained. At the hospital, they stationed a guard\nat his room and did not allow him to speak to his wife or other\nrelatives.Those living in the valley without legal status learn to navigate\nlife while keeping a low profile, but medical problems beyond the capabilities\nof local healthcare providers present a grim choice: forgo treatment or risk\ndeportation.**See more of our top stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Seeking\ntreatment is \"a risk that many people are not willing to take because it means\nseparation from their families,” said Ana Rodriguez DeFrates, director of the\nTexas Latina Advocacy Network. “That’s what they tell us — ‘My children are\ncitizens, I’m not and I don’t want to leave them.’ So they live with the\npain.“We hear from women about why they have gone five years, 10 years without\na Pap smear,” she said. “A lot of people [outside the Rio Grande Valley] don’t\nknow these checkpoints exist so far inland and that they restrict access. It’s\nnot something that’s widely recognized as a problem.”There are only two major\nhighways leading north from the valley, and each has a checkpoint — on Highway\n281 in Falfurrias and on Highway 77 in Kingsville, about 40 miles northeast.Of\nCustoms and Border Protection's 33 immigration checkpoints within 75 miles of\nthe southern border, the Falfurrias outpost is among the busiest. Immigration\nofficials who are expanding the facility say it’s a valuable tool to deter and\ncatch smugglers.Raul Ortiz of the U.S. Border Patrol discusses activity at the\nbusy immigration checkpoint in Falfurrias, Texas.Raul Ortiz of the U.S. Border\nPatrol discusses activity at the busy immigration checkpoint in Falfurrias,\nTexas.Soto hired an attorney, refused to agree to voluntary deportation and\nwas allowed to leave the hospital about a week later without bond. Due to\nimmigration court backlogs, his case is not scheduled to be heard for a few\nyears. Still, his family worries.“He is a responsible man, a family man, he\nnever drinks, he has no criminal record,” his wife said. “We depend on him. We\nare suffering for him.”His attorney, Francisco Steven Tipton, said it was not\nunusual for ambulances to be stopped at the checkpoint and families\nseparated.“We’ve had clients where there’s a child going through in the\nambulance with the mother, and they will take the mother out and say she can’t\ngo with them,” Tipton said.**NEWSLETTER: Get the day's top headlines from\nTimes Editor Davan Maharaj \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Tipton tells clients seeking non-\nemergency medical treatment north of the checkpoints to wait until they file\npetitions for legal status and have the paperwork to show agents at the\ncheckpoint. The tactic works, though “sometimes they will run into an officer\nwho will give them a hard time,” he said.In the weeks after Soto was stopped,\nRaul Ortiz, acting chief patrol agent for the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande\nValley sector, walked around the checkpoint as a dozen agents inspected cars,\nsome with help from drug-sniffing German shepherds. A bank of cameras recorded\nthe proceedings.In Falfurrias there’s usually a steady stream of traffic, but\nnot as much as at checkpoints in California, such as the one on Interstate 5\nin San Clemente, making it easier to stop and screen people, he said. It was\nearly morning, and already the agents had detained a woman and found some\ncocaine.The mother arrived at the hospital last week in need of an emergency\ncaesarean section, saying she had crossed the border to run an errand in town,\nnot so her baby would be born an American citizen.She assured the doctor that\nshe arrived at the hospital just \"because [she] was here.\"Dr. Rolando...The\nmother arrived at the hospital last week in need of an emergency caesarean\nsection, saying she had crossed the border to run an errand in town, not so\nher baby would be born an American citizen.She assured the doctor that she\narrived at the hospital just \"because [she] was here.\"Dr. Rolando...“My\nstrategy is to keep all the activity as close to the border as possible,”\nOrtiz said.“Highway 281 is used by human traffickers, money couriers, drug\ntraffickers — all that activity going north,” he said, calling it, “one of the\nbusiest checkpoints in the country — and one of the most productive.”Chris\nCabrera, a Border Patrol union spokesman based in the Rio Grande Valley, used\nto work by the Falfurrias checkpoint for months at a time and called it “a\nvery useful tool.”“I understand people are afraid to drive through it,” he\nsaid. “Unfortunately, it’s needed. We’re so porous, open, we need a second\nline of defense.”Human smugglers try to evade the checkpoint by dropping off\nmigrants south of Falfurrias, with the promise to pick them up just north. The\nmigrants have to walk through unforgiving ranch land to reach the rendezvous.\nSome have died on the journey; two weeks ago, agents helped sheriff’s deputies\nrecover the remains of a migrant woman found near the Kingsville\ncheckpoint.Eddie Canales, who runs the South Texas Human Rights Center here,\nresponds to calls from relatives of missing migrants and searches for remains\nwith ranchers and local Brooks County sheriff’s deputies. The sheriff’s office\nhandled 23 migrant deaths since October, 390 during the past five years.“It’s\nalways been a suggestion from the ranch community: 'Can you put [the\ncheckpoint] somewhere south' ” of Falfurrias, where the terrain is less\ntreacherous, Canales said. “It certainly would eliminate a lot of people\nmissing and dying trying to circumvent that checkpoint.”Ortiz said agents were\ntrying to do more to catch migrants and prevent more deaths. And he said they\nhave to stop ambulances because “we get cloned vehicles all the time” —\nvehicles made to look like ambulances, UPS trucks, telephone company repair\ntrucks and oil tankers, with people stashed in air vents, freezers and\nlatrines.If someone is being transported for medical treatment, he said,\nhospitals often call ahead to the checkpoint and agents try to facilitate\ntheir passage, but agents still have to stop patients to check their\nimmigration status and potential criminal records.“If you come through the\ncheckpoint, you’re still subject to immigration proceedings. I don’t have the\nauthority to say you’re a good guy, wave you through,” Ortiz said.Construction\nis underway to expand the checkpoint, doubling its size to 16 lanes during the\nnext two years at a cost of $20 million to $25 million.Rodriguez, of the Texas\nLatina Advocacy Network, said that for women in the valley, access to abortion\nand family planning is another problem. A new Texas law being challenged in a\nlawsuit pending before the U.S. Supreme Court has left the valley with one\nabortion clinic, which could close if the high court allows the law to stand.\nThe next-nearest clinic is in San Antonio.She recalled passing the checkpoint\nwith a van of women last year traveling to a New Orleans appeals court hearing\nin the abortion case.“It was hard to fill that van because of the checkpoint,”\nshe said. “The first thing you see is the sign saying how many people have\nbeen seized, how many drugs. Your cellphone reception goes out. We all have\nlegal status, and we were nervous.”She said she would like to see the\ncheckpoints shifted further south.“We’re not so naive to think there’s not\npublic safety threats to be addressed” by checkpoints, she said, but, “it\nfeels like a restriction on our movement that could perhaps be handled better\ncloser to our border.”**For news from the Southwest, follow @mollyhf on\nTwitter._  \n_****ALSO****Protests but no prosecution: 5 lesser-known shootings by\npolice****They're 400,000 strong and the Pentagon sees them as an emerging\nthreat****New Ferguson police chief recalls being singled out by cops as an\nAfrican American youth**\n\n","title":"For some migrants in Texas, obtaining healthcare means getting through immigration checkpoint - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"For some migrants in Texas, getting healthcare means getting through immigration checkpoint https://t.co/oxbfl0mFjW https://t.co/uvVUr3uVpi","date":"Sat Apr 02 08:45:08 +0000 2016","favs":15,"id":{"$numberLong":"716184678710042624"},"retweets":31},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1pSXtsw"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc548"},"content":"It was a small Internet firm with big ambitions.From a storefront in\nInglewood, Manchester Community Technologies Inc. went to work and last year\ndeclared the firm had created corridors of free public Wi-Fi access for\nInternet-starved communities from Long Beach to Pasadena.In a report to the\nCalifornia Public Utilities Commission in March of 2015 documenting what it\ndid with nearly $500,000 in ratepayer fees, the company said it had deployed\nfree Wi-Fi hot spots at eight parks and 16 community Wi-Fi networks, \"enabling\nover 100,000 community based unique end-users the opportunity to connect to\nthe Internet.\"But today, most of those networks and hot spots don't link to\nthe Internet.In an initial survey late last year, The Times checked seven\nparks and 11 network locations, finding no Wi-Fi at any of them. A follow-up\nsurvey in March found network signals at three of the eight parks and 16\ncommunity locations but could not obtain a connection on any of them. The best\nresults were on a section of Crenshaw Boulevard in Leimert Park where several\nbusinesses were broadcasting free Wi-Fi on a community network.In response to\ninquiries from The Times, the Public Utilities Commission visited the sites in\nJanuary and determined that service was available at only two of the locations\nwhere Manchester Community Technologies was paid to provide free Wi-Fi,\ncommission spokeswoman Terrie Prosper said.Revlyn Williams, Manchester\nCommunity Technologies' founder and executive director, said the networks had\nall functioned at one time. Maintaining them has proved difficult, she said,\nbecause businesses that form the backbone of the networks sometimes shut down\ntheir routers at night, lose equipment to theft or don't rely on the Internet\nenough to keep it running.With the three-year grant now expired, her company\nwill persist in its efforts with \"God's help,\" Williams said.Manchester\nCommunity Technologies' struggles to fulfill its promise underscore the\nchallenge of providing universal Internet access in communities where\ncommercial access points such as Starbucks coffee shops are rare and home-\nbased broadband is unaffordable for many families. Free community networks\nrepresent one strategy being explored by government agencies in an effort to\nbreak the so-called digital divide.The Times was tipped off to the Wi-Fi\nproblems by Cal State Long Beach journalism professor Gwen Shaffer, who became\nsuspicious while conducting research on community broadband access, which she\ncharacterizes as a social justice issue.\"No one can argue that Internet access\nis a luxury — not when you need to be online to apply for jobs, to access\nhealthcare, to communicate with elected officials … to complete basic daily\ntasks,\" Shaffer said. \"Anyone without Internet access is incredibly\nmarginalized.\"Shaffer, who teaches communications law and policy, contends\nthat the case exposes poor oversight by the utilities commission, which failed\nto see obvious flaws in the firm's application and made no attempt to verify\nthe claims in the company's 2015 progress report.Shaffer criticized the PUC\nfor not doing a more thorough investigation into whether the sites were\nimproving Wi-Fi service. Instead, regulators \"simply reprint the reports and\ntout accomplishments.\"The PUC said the entire program will be audited this\nyear.Manchester Community Technologies' grant was from the California Advanced\nServices Fund that directs $315 million in ratepayer surcharges to promote\n\"deployment of high-quality advanced communications services to all\nCalifornians.\" Most of the money goes to capital projects to expand Internet\nto areas of the state that don't have it.A small portion of that was given to\nregional groups primarily to promote use of the Internet in areas such as\nSouth Los Angeles. According to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center,\nabout a third of U.S. adults do not subscribe to broadband service at home,\nprimarily because of the cost.Of the funds the PUC set aside for \"underserved\"\nareas in Los Angeles County, the bulk of that money was aimed at education and\noutreach. Manchester Community Technologies was responsible for the portion of\nthe grant for direct services.James E. Prieger, a Pepperdine University\neconomist who specializes in the Internet, questioned the goal of deploying\nfree Wi-Fi where large service providers offer Internet access.It would be\nmore productive, Prieger said, to give subsidies to poor households.\"If you\njust subsidize an area, you are going to be subsidizing a lot of people who\ndon't need it,\" Prieger said.On Thursday, the Federal Communications\nCommission endorsed Prieger's approach, voting to make all low-income families\neligible for subsidies from a ratepayer fund to pay for broadband.But Prosper,\nthe PUC spokeswoman, defended the expenditure on free Wi-Fi, as a\ncomplementary strategy for providing access to those who otherwise couldn't\nafford it.Williams said her firm attempted to create free Wi-Fi networks by\nenlisting business owners and government agencies to share a portion of their\nInternet bandwidth with the public. The signals from individual businesses,\nshe said, were woven together into Wi-Fi zones up to 11/2 miles\nsquare.Williams demonstrated what the firm called its flagship network during\nan interview with The Times at her office on Manchester Boulevard. A laptop\ncomputer connected automatically to a network called \"CommunityWiFi.\"A page\nappeared on the screen with local advertisements and listings, and a \"browse\"\nbutton linked to the Internet.Returning a week later, however, The Times could\nfind no signal for the network outside the company's office.Williams also said\nthe hot spots at eight parks were functioning, but not necessarily reaching\nthe buildings where children used computers.Because the group had not received\napproval from L.A.'s Department of Recreation and Parks to tap into the city's\nInternet feed, the routers were instead set up at nearby buildings and\nbroadcast into the park, Williams said.A spokesman for Mayor Eric Garcetti\nsaid the city supports the deployment of Wi-Fi in parks, but because of\nsecurity concerns does not allow its Internet to be broadcast to the public.At\none of the parks, Fred Roberts Recreation Center in Central Alameda, children\nin after-school programs sit at computers in several rooms. But they have no\nInternet connection.Manchester Community Technologies worked with a nonprofit\ncalled LAURA to deploy a Wi-Fi hot spot there.But Adela Bajaras, LAURA's\nfounder, said she never received approval from the parks department to install\nthe Wi-Fi equipment.Instead, she carries the router in her trunk and brings it\non Thursdays for a youth group meeting she leads.At nearby Ross Snyder\nRecreation Center, director Javier Soto said he would like Internet access for\nthe youths who use the facility, but he doesn't have it.Williams said the park\ndoes have a hot spot. It is provided by the Concerned Citizens of South Los\nAngeles from a nearby building, she said.The Times could find no signal at the\nrecreation center._doug.smith@latimes.com_**ALSO****Death toll rises to 9 in\nsuspected fentanyl overdoses in Northern California****One of the LAPD's\npreferred weapons to help officers avoid shootings often doesn't work****Knife\nlinked to former O.J.

They also pollinate plants, including the saguaro cactus.The\ncurrent value of pest control provided by bats each year is at least $3.7\nbillion nationwide.White-nose syndrome has killed mostly little brown bats,\nwhich have lost more than 20% of their population in the northeastern U.S.\nover the past nine years. Mortality rates among colonies of some species in\neastern states, such as northern long-eared bats, have reached 99%.There was\nno reason to believe that the disease wouldn’t eventually make its way to the\nWest Coast.

Forward Julius Randle said that things had been a\n\"little awkward.\"Coach Byron Scott added that the healing process would be\nslow, \"just like rebuilding a team.\"**See the most-read stories in Sports this\nhour\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Yeah, the big-picture ramifications are not good for the\nLakers.Young has two more years for $11.1 million left on his contract,\nincluding a player option in the second year for $5.7 million. Russell is\nstill on his rookie contract and has one more guaranteed year at $5.3 million,\nfollowed by two one-year team options for $5.6 million and $7 million.The\nLakers tried to trade Young, 30, each of the last two seasons as his\nproduction dropped. There were no takers. They will likely try to find a home\nfor him again this off-season, which won't be easy with a player who didn't\neven get off the bench in eight games last month.To steal Randle's phrase,\nthis will be a little awkward if Young and Russell are teammates next season\ntoo. \"Will they ever be buddy-buddies again? I don't know but they do have to\ncoexist as long as they're both here and I think they can,\" Scott\nsaid.Russell, 20, showed some unexpected fire Friday when told that some\nformer NBA players said a physical confrontation would have taken place in\npast generations in a situation like this.In fact, Scott basically said it\ntoo. \"All I can say is in our era, it probably would have been handled\ndifferently.

I stole\n[school] lunches because I was hungry.\"Today she sells mostly local-farm-\nsourced fruits and vegetables out of a mint-green shipping container at the\nShops at Adams Gateway, the new container village on Adams Boulevard near\nFairfax Avenue. Open nine months now — Günter operated a mobile farm stand for\ntwo years prior to being at Adams Gateway — Daily Organics may be the only\norganic produce shop currently operating in South L.A., an area encompassing\nsome 50 square miles.It's also the latest shape-shifting moment in a varied\nlife and career that began just a few blocks away. Günter, 63, was 6 years old\nwhen her mother died; she never knew her father and was raised by various\nfamily members and friends in Los Angeles until she moved to Europe in her\n20s. Soon after arriving, Günter was spotted on the streets of London, an act\nof serendipity that led to a successful modeling career in France, Italy and\nJapan working for the likes of Balenciaga and Givenchy.In Paris she was a\nmodel in Yves St. Laurent's personal atelier, where the designer draped fabric\nacross her shoulders as his pugs scurried around their feet. At the time,\nGünter was one of just a handful of models of color working in Europe and\nAsia. Among the benefits to her was an exposure to high-quality food,\nsomething that has stayed with her ever since.Produce selection at Daily\nOrganics. Produce selection at Daily Organics. \"I have such a respect for fine\ncuisine based on what I've experienced,\" she says. \"My brother used to put\nsugar in milk just to make it taste different, because that's all we\nhad.\"After nearly a decade in Europe, Günter moved back to L.A., living in\nStudio City and Sherman Oaks, where she raised two children. (Her son is now a\nchef in Laguna Beach.) She continued to work in fashion, this time on the\ndesign side, and also as a landscape designer specializing in native, drought-\nresistant gardens. (Her own garden in West Adams has been certified as a\nwildlife habitat by the state.) But when she moved back to South Los Angeles\nin 2004, she realized something vital was missing there: options for more\nhealthful food.And then came her participation in Cornerstone Theater\nCompany's 2012 production of \"Seed: A Weird Act of Faith,\" a play about inner-\ncity food inequities. Performing in Inglewood, it was an experience that hit\nclose to home — and got Günter thinking.Carrots for sale at Daily Organics in\nSouth Los Angeles. Carrots for sale at Daily Organics in South Los Angeles.\n\"It seemed like malnutrition was in epidemic proportions in my neighborhood,\"\nshe says, \"and who was doing anything about it?

On weekends over\nthe next two years, she sold organic produce from her painstakingly restored\n1962 Corvair Rampside truck, which she parked on a residential street corner\nin West Adams. On her first day in business, Günter gave away bushels of\nfruits and vegetables at no charge to passersby.\"People looked at me like I\nwas crazy.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc54c"},"content":"Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has come one step closer to realizing his\nlong-held dream of bringing affordable, zero-pollution vehicles to the world's\nhighways.After months of secrecy, he unveiled the prototype for his planned\n$35,000 Model 3 battery electric car Thursday night to hundreds of adoring\nfans, a generally enthusiastic automotive press and a massive global presales\nresponse.By 10:30 a.m. Friday, Musk said, Tesla had received more than 198,000\ndeposits of $1,000 each for future deliveries of the sleek and low four-door\nsedan — an unprecedented response for a car that hadn't even been shown in\nphotographs when the deposits were made and that won't be delivered to\ncustomers for at least 18 months.Wall Street liked the new car. Tesla stock\ntraded after-hours at $241, up $12 a share, after closing at $237. But now\nMusk and his production team face an enormous set of challenges. They must\nturn the prototype into a working car, find a way to sell it at the stated\nprice point, get their growing auto plant and new battery factory up to full\ncapacity, and bring the Model 3 to market in time to beat the\ncompetition.**\\-------------****For the record****April 2, 8:34 a.m.:** An\nearlier version of this story quoted Friday's closing price for Tesla stock as\n$241 a share. The stock closed at $237 and rose in after-hours trading. Also,\nthe Tesla Model X was described as seating five. The SUV accommodates seven.\n**\\-------------**Critics of the Fremont, Calif., electric car company don't\nbelieve any of that can be done. Musk has trouble meeting his own deadlines\nand building automobiles sufficiently bug-free for a mass market. Musk seemed\nto realize the monumental task ahead, tweeting Friday: \"Definitely going to\nneed to rethink production planning.\"Some doubt he can produce the Model 3 for\n$35,000 without losing money on every car he sells.\"I don't believe they can\nmake any money selling this car for much less than $50,000,\" said Mark\nSpiegel, CEO of the hedge fund Stanphyl Capital Management. \"Unless something\nchanges, the more Model 3s they sell, the more they will lose.\"Tesla has\nstated it will produce more expensive versions of the 3 first, filling orders\nfor the most heavily option-laden vehicles before building and delivering the\nbase models. Some early recipients of the $81,200 Model X paid as much as\ndouble that price for theirs.\"Tesla has a history of introducing a vehicle\nwith a reasonably low price and then selling versions that are much more\nexpensive,\" said Jack Nerad, market analyst at Kelley Blue Book.But by the\ntime purchases of the Model 3 can actually be made, other inexpensive plug-in\nbattery electrics from more established companies with better production track\nrecords — and a better capacity to sell cars with low profit margins — will\nalready be in showrooms. The $37,500 Chevrolet Bolt is expected to be a strong\nrival. Other plug-in electrics are said to be coming from BMW, Mercedes, Volvo\nand others.Musk himself acknowledged the possibility that the car will not be\navailable in time to meet the promised late-2017 delivery date. At the Tesla\nDesign Studio in Hawthorne, Musk promised delivery of the Model 3 by \"next\nyear,\" then drew indulgent chuckles when he added, \"I do feel fairly confident\nit will be next year.\"Deliveries of Musk's much-admired Model X, an elegant,\nhigh-performance seven-seat SUV, were delayed by more than 18 months after\nTesla experienced production problems with the car's complex falcon-wing\ndoors. The prospect of a delay did nothing to diminish the enthusiasm of the\nassembled faithful. Eliciting rock star adoration from a crowd of 150 auto\njournalists and 650 Tesla owners, Musk took the stage Thursday in Hawthorne\namid flashing lights and booming techno beats.\"To any of you who bought an S\nor an X — thank you for paying for this,\" Musk told the crowd, saying those\nmore expensive, earlier-generation models helped pave the way for the Model\n3.Many of those present already owned one of those, or both, or more. Jerry\nRoby of Newport Beach owns a Roadster, an S and an X. Arriving in a branded\nTesla cap and windbreaker, Roby had already put down deposits for two Model 3s\nat the Tesla store near his home.His friend Paul Norris had also made deposits\nfor two cars — having also previously purchased all three Tesla models.At a\nbank of computer screens at the evening event, other would-be 3 drivers were\nplacing orders. The father-and-son team of David and Adam Metcalf of Florida\nhad paused to switch credit cards after one maxed out. The Metcalfs had\nalready placed orders for 12 Model 3s and needed to order five more. Some were\nfor the research facility at the University of Central Florida, where the\nsenior Metcalf works. As for the others? \"I have a list,\" he said.In the first\n24 hours, Tesla received 180,000 preorders. Estimating that the average\ntransaction price for the vehicle would be about $42,000, Musk estimated his\n24-hour haul at $7.5 billion. \"Future of electric cars looking bright!\" he\ntweeted. In fact, the company's take was closer to $180 million — nothing to\nsneeze at, but only seed money in the capital-intensive auto production\nbusiness.Even after the unveiling, little more was known about the car except\nits stated MSRP, its claimed range of 215 miles per electric charge and its\nability to accelerate from zero to 60 mph in less than six seconds.The Model 3\nwill be built alongside the Ss and Xs in Tesla's huge California factory. The\ncompany has said it could produce as many as 90,000 vehicles annually this\nyear, and by 2020 could be churning them out at the rate of 500,000 a year — a\nnumber Musk said Thursday night he was \"confident\" Tesla could achieve.Meeting\nthat production rate will also require Musk to move aggressively forward with\nhis \"gigafactory,\" the immense northern Nevada facility where, in cooperation\nwith electronics giant Panasonic, Tesla will build the batteries for its\nvehicles. Musk told his audience that the factory is now officially\n\"operational,\" and will begin delivering batteries at the end of next\nyear.Musk acknowledged that selling massive volumes of Model 3s will require\nmore retail outlets and more charging stations. He promised that the current\n215 retail outlets globally would double to more than 440 by the end of next\nyear. He also said the company's global network of 3,600 \"supercharger\"\nstations — where Teslas can be brought to nearly full charge in 30 minutes or\nless — would also double within that time frame.Perhaps Musk's greatest\nchallenge will lie in selling his chic, environmentally friendly vehicles to a\nmass audience. As several analysts pointed out, the customer who spends\n$100,000 or more on a Model S or X probably has two or three other luxury cars\nin the garage, and is not terribly inconvenienced when glitches require\nmaintenance.Tesla has had trouble with reliability. Though the Model S won\nalmost every accolade and award in the motoring press, and received the\nhighest possible safety and performance ratings, Consumer Reports later added\nthe 2012-2013 and 2015 Model S to its \"worst of the worst\" section of \"Used\nCars to Avoid.\"The customer spending $35,000 on a Model 3 probably won't\nembrace a car that isn't close to trouble-free. That heightens the pressure on\nTesla, said award-winning car designer Henrik Fisker, whose futuristic Karma\nheld promise as a stylish electric performance car before financial troubles\nsidelined the firm.\"Tesla's advantage is that, being a new car company with a\nnew brand, they have a cool factor the established carmakers don't have,\"\nFisker said. But \"once you start moving down market, the customer's lifestyle\nis very different. Someone who buys a $35,000 car, this is his only or his\nprimary car. People are still reluctant to have their only car be an electric\ncar.\"_charles.fleming@latimes.com_**ALSO****Elon Musk says Tesla Model 3 pre-\norders hit 180,000****Tesla stock surges on Model 3 unveiling but U.S. stocks\nmostly lower****After Tesla Model 3 unveiling, Elon Musk faces big challenges\nto deliver cars**\n\n","title":"Tesla faces stiff challenges with Model 3 - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Tesla faces stiff challenges with Model 3 https://t.co/wSIilUQ9G7 https://t.co/TKlsySopQu","date":"Sat Apr 02 05:00:15 +0000 2016","favs":41,"id":{"$numberLong":"716128087054950400"},"retweets":37},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1X4VJY4"}

It says schools or businesses can set gender-\nspecific rules about how a person dresses or which bathroom a person must\nuse.The Mississippi House passed the final version of the bill Friday, 69 to\n44, two days after the Senate passed it, 32 to 17. Republicans hold a majority\nin both chambers. Under the margins for final passage, there would not be\nenough votes to override if Bryant vetoes the bill.Some corporations in\nMississippi oppose the bill, including Nissan North America, which has a plant\nnear Jackson; MGM Resorts International, which has casinos in Biloxi and\nTunica; and Huntington Ingalls Industries, which has a shipyard in Pascagoula.\nAll three are among the state's largest private employers.Republican state\nRep.

But new research suggests that, with\nlittle extra cost or effort, a woman's mammogram could also tell whether she\nis being stalked by a far more dangerous killer of women - coronary heart\ndisease.Heart disease kills about 1 in 4 women, and coronary heart disease - a\nbuildup of plaque in the arteries leading to the heart - is its most common\nform. But giving a woman warning that she may have dangerous plaque buildup\nthere might be as easy as asking the radiologist who reads her mammograms what\nhe or she sees in the blood vessels that are clearly visible inside the\nbreast.Physicians meeting this week at an American College of Cardiology\nscientific session in Chicago are expected to hear about a simple way to wring\nmore lifesaving out of the 37 million mammograms performed every year in the\nUnited States. It was published last week in the Journal of the American\nCollege of Cardiology's JACC: Cardiovascular Imaging.Type 2 diabetes, arguably\nthe world's fastest-growing chronic condition, really has it out for women,\nsays a new study. Compared with men with diabetes, diabetic women are 44% more\nlikely to go on to suffer coronary heart disease, which is the leading cause\nof death for men and women alike in the...Type 2 diabetes, arguably the\nworld's fastest-growing chronic condition, really has it out for women, says a\nnew study. Compared with men with diabetes, diabetic women are 44% more likely\nto go on to suffer coronary heart disease, which is the leading cause of death\nfor men and women alike in the...It turns out that radiologists checking\nbreast images for abnormal masses have always been able to see plaque in the\narteries that bring oxygenated blood to the breasts. The question was, was it\nmeaningful? How often do calcifications in those arteries indicate the\npresence of calcifications in the coronary arteries, which can impede blood\nflow to the heart and break lose, causing heart attacks?Today, a woman with no\nsymptoms of clogged arteries, including chest pain and shortness of breath,\ngenerally relies on one of two risk calculators to guide decisions such as\nwhether she should take a statin or other medication aimed at reducing her\nheart attack risk. Toting up her age, family medical history, smoking and\nweight status, blood pressure and cholesterol profile, her physician can\ncalculate her Framingham Risk Score. Many of the same measures are also used\nin the 2013 Cholesterol Guidelines Pooled Cohort Equations.But could the\ninformation already on a mammogram predict just as well whether a woman should\ntake specific steps to avert a heart attack?Radiologists and cardiologists at\nMount Sinai in New York City devised a \"breast arterialization score\" for 325\nwomen who had had, within the same year, both a digital mammogram and a CT\nscan of their chest. The CT scan would show definitively whether the woman had\ncoronary artery calcification, or CAC. So the study's aim was to determine\njust how closely correlated plaque buildup in the breast arteries are to\nCAC.The idea that American women would benefit by having fewer mammograms —\nand having them less frequently — remains controversial. A new study tries to\nhelp women and their doctors understand why less can be more when it comes to\nbreast cancer screening.The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force was...The idea\nthat American women would benefit by having fewer mammograms — and having them\nless frequently — remains controversial. A new study tries to help women and\ntheir doctors understand why less can be more when it comes to breast cancer\nscreening.The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force was...None of the women had\nsymptoms of coronary artery disease. Most, however, were at increased heart\ndisease risk by virtue of their having been referred to get a CT scan to\nscreen for lung cancer or pulmonary disorder. The CT scans showed that almost\n48% had signs of plaque buildup in their coronary arteries.In those women who\nhad coronary artery calcification as shown by CT scan, the breast\narterialization score predicted it 63% of the time. Using BAC to predict\ncoronary artery calcification gave a false positive 24% of the time. As a\npredictor of a woman's coronary arterial calcification, a woman's breast\narterial calcification, or BAC, score was superior to the Framingham Risk\nScore and superior to the 2013 cholesterol guidelines, the study found.The BAC\nscore was best at predicting coronary artery calcification in women older than\n70. But even in women 39 to 59, its authors suggested the BAC score uncovered\nabout half of women at higher risk for heart disease - and at an age when they\nprobably would not have been flagged by other measures.Dr. Larry Altshuler,\ndirector of oncology intake at Cancer Treatment Centers of America, said the\nfindings could be a \"game-changer\" when it comes to women's health.“Many\nwomen, especially younger women, are unaware of their heart health,” Altshuler\nsaid. With earlier warning that plaque could be accumulating in their coronary\narteries, more women could take control of their health and take action to\nprevent heart attacks or strokes, he added.The experts who sparked a\npassionate debate over the value of mammograms as a tool to screen for breast\ncancer are doubling down on the recommendations that earned them the ire of\ncancer groups, women’s groups and a large contingent in Congress.The final\nadvice of a federal task force reiterates...The experts who sparked a\npassionate debate over the value of mammograms as a tool to screen for breast\ncancer are doubling down on the recommendations that earned them the ire of\ncancer groups, women’s groups and a large contingent in Congress.The final\nadvice of a federal task force reiterates...The authors concluded that looking\nat the blood vessels in a women's mammogram for indications of heart disease\nrisk is promising, and should be studied in a larger trial.Even so, wrote Drs.\nKhurram Nasir and John W. McEvoy in an accompanying editorial in JACC, it's\nnot premature to suggest that radiologists who detect breast arterial\ncalcification make note of those findings in reporting to a woman's primary\ncare physician. They wrote that, guided by further research, experts will need\nto determine whether women with elevated BAC scores should be put on statin\ndrugs or referred for CT scans to confirm suspicions.Plumbing mammograms for\nmore detailed information about a woman's health is not entirely new.\nRadiologists were long able to detect breast density in certain women by\nreading their mammograms, but did not until recently report it.But while\nbreast density may affect a woman's risk for breast cancer, looking for\nevidence of heart disease in a mammogram has the potential to prevent many\nmore women's deaths.Women are more than seven times likelier to die of heart\ndisease than of breast cancer in any given year. But because breast cancer\ncampaigns have had such a high profile, women tend to be more scared of\ngetting breast cancer than they are of developing heart disease.While experts\nin recent years have squabbled over how young women should start getting\nmammograms and how often they need them, fear of breast cancer has made\nscreening a regular occurrence for most women. If those mammograms could offer\nearly warning of blocked arteries, lots of women might be saved.**Follow me on\nTwitter @LATMelissaHealy and \"like\" Los Angeles Times Science \u0026amp; Health on\nFacebook.**\n\n","title":"Could mammograms detect clogged arteries as well as breast cancer?

Although there is a recipe in the back — for the author’s favorite pancakes —this is not a cookbook but rather a well-written and, at 200-plus pages, beautifully concise examination of the state of bread in America.Halloran, a food and agriculture writer based in Troy, N.Y., looks at how farmers, millers and bakers, as well as brewers and other craftsmen, have been working to move our Culture of Bread away from a commodity-driven network and back to a community-based food system. Leavened by the author’s experiences as well as those of the committed folks it documents, Halloran’s book expands to fit her project, which involves traveling across the country, adding scientific context, working in the subtexts of politics and economics to her thoroughly engaging story. Agriculture can be fascinating, especially when it gives you the back story of that piece of avocado toast on your plate.If you'd like to meet the author, Halloran will be making pancakes at Grist \u0026amp; Toll in Pasadena on April 1, as part of an event hosted by this year’s International Assn. of Culinary Professionals Conference.**ALSO: ****How to choose fresh fish, plus 7 recipes****Okipoki in downtown isn't just another poke restaurant****Beachwood Brewing to expand production by taking over Beach City Brewing in Huntington Beach**\n\n","title":"Really love bread?

Like\nmost anglers and outdoor enthusiasts who love the Eastern Sierra, I've thought\nof Lee Vining largely as a spot to fill my gas tank or stock up on bait. But\nwhile researching new fishing spots — trout season opens April 30 in Mono\nCounty — I discovered that Lee Vining is a prime launching point for a weekend\nof angling at a nearby ring of secluded and serene lakes. I also learned that\ndespite being named for a prospector who accidentally shot himself to death,\nthe roadside town is well stocked with charm and hospitable people. The tab:\n$280 for two nights at the Tioga Lodge at Mono Lake, $8.95 for breakfast at\nthe Whoa Nellie Deli, $23.50 for a two-day state fishing license, and $83.70\nfor a rental car for three days.**The bed**Lee Vining offers a variety of\nlodging, from rustic and quaint to modern and comfortable. I went with quaint\n— and cheap — by booking a room at the Tioga Lodge at Mono Lake on the north\nend of town [54411 U.S. Highway 395, Lee Vining; (760) 647-6423,\nwww.tiogalodgeatmonolake.com. Reservations for the season will be accepted\nbeginning May 20]. My room was $139 a night, booked in late August. The\nresort, built more than 100 years ago as a toll station, has been restored\nwith 14 rustic cabins, each with a bathroom, mini fridge and access to free\nWi-Fi but no TVs or air conditioning. A creek runs through the resort,\nemptying into a pool of cattails. The rooms are well appointed with big,\ncomfortable beds. Light sleepers may get little rest because of the din of\npassing trucks on Highway 395.**The meal**Barbecue sandwich and sides from\nBodie Mike's Barbeque in Lee Vining.Barbecue sandwich and sides from Bodie\nMike's Barbeque in Lee Vining.Downtown Lee Vining includes several eateries,\nbut I was surprised to hear locals recommend a diner at the Mobil gas station\nat Highway 395 and Route 120.

Still, the humble menu of burgers, tacos, pizza and meatloaf\noffered the ideal down-home energy food I needed before a long day of\ntrailblazing and fishing. I chomped on a trout-sized breakfast burrito — gooey\nwith melted cheese and bacon grease — so huge I could barely finish it.**The\nfind**Two anglers stake their spots on the banks of Saddlebag Lake, the\nbiggest of 20 lakes in the basin.Two anglers stake their spots on the banks of\nSaddlebag Lake, the biggest of 20 lakes in the basin.My search for fishing\nnirvana drove me about 13 miles east of Lee Vining along Route 120 to the\nSaddlebag Lake Resort (www.saddlebaglakeresort.com) and Saddlebag Lake, a\n325-acre body of water at the southeastern edge of a pine-studded basin. An\neight-mile hiking trail, starting at the top of Saddlebag Lake, circles the\nbasin, accessing 20 alpine lakes, including the four-acre Hummingbird Lake and\nthe 25-acre Steelhead Lake. I took my time, hiking first to Wasco Lake, then\ncutting east across the basin to Z Lake, a shimmering turquoise-blue pool\nshaped like the last letter of the alphabet. That is where I hooked my first\ngolden trout. After lunch, I hiked east again to tiny, aqua-green Hummingbird\nLake, where the shores were alive with jumping frogs and blooming wildflowers.\nIt was so quiet, flying beetles sounded like turboprop planes.**The lesson\nlearned**Back at the Saddlebag Lake Resort, I sat down to have a cold drink\nwith one of the owners, Richard Ernst.

He was still a child\ngrowing up in Miami's tough inner-city Overtown neighborhood when a friend was\nkilled by police. Moss soon had his own unwarranted encounters with\nofficers.**See more of our top stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**When Moss was\naround age 14, an officer suddenly pushed him against a wall, frisked him and\nsearched through his belongings before leaving, offering no explanation. About\na year later, another officer pulled up and used a racial slur. He was a\nteenager when rioting broke out in 1980 after white police officers fatally\nbeat a black motorcyclist.Rather than turn against police, Moss decided to try\nto make improvements from within. He was hired as a Miami officer in 1984,\nmotivated, he said, to “give my community the police service I thought we\ndeserved and treat people much better than I had been treated.”“That's what\nfuels my love for law enforcement,” Moss told the Associated Press.He faces a\ndaunting task in Ferguson.A St. Louis County grand jury and the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice declined to indict Wilson, who resigned in November\n2014. But the Justice Department issued a critical report of Ferguson in March\n2015, citing racial bias in Ferguson's criminal justice system. The Ferguson\nCity Council last month agreed to a settlement with the Justice Department\ncalling for police and court reforms.**NEWSLETTER: Get the day's top headlines\nfrom Times Editor Davan Maharaj \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Many black residents told Justice\nDepartment investigators stories of being pulled over for no reason, or being\nvictims of police threats or brutality. About two-thirds of the around 20,000\nFerguson residents are black, but the police force has historically been\nmostly white. Currently, eight of 46 officers are black.Moss rose through the\nranks in Miami working in different departments, including homicide. He was\nnamed public information officer 20 years ago. Former Police Chief Manuel\nOrosa promoted Moss to the position of major in 2011.Orosa said Moss was\ninstrumental in establishing an improved relationship between Miami's African\nAmerican communities and the police department after a series of police\nshootings of unarmed black men and teenagers under the previous chief. Moss\nestablished monthly breakfast meetings with influential black pastors that\nwent from tense encounters initially to friendly and productive get-togethers,\nOrosa said.“He was able to bring our police department closer to certain\nsegments of the community that had been alienated,” Orosa said.Ferguson, as\npart of the agreement with the Justice Department, is embracing a community-\noriented policing model that calls for officers to be involved in neighborhood\ngroups and the community, rather than simply reacting to crime. Ferguson Mayor\nJames Knowles III said Moss will be vital in implementing that model.“What\nreally stands out in Mr. Moss' background is his ability to deal with the\npublic,” Knowles said. “We need somebody at the top with the experience and\nskill to lead our department in doing that.”**ALSO****Chicago teachers hit\npicket lines, shift to rallies at colleges****Protests but no prosecution: 5\nlesser-known shootings by police****They're 400,000 strong and the Pentagon\nsees them as an emerging threat**\n\n","title":"New Ferguson police chief recalls being singled out by cops as an African American youth - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"New Ferguson police chief recalls being singled out by cops as an African American youth https://t.co/2QExD0wjXO https://t.co/VhIRjVurUc","date":"Sat Apr 02 02:40:05 +0000 2016","favs":83,"id":{"$numberLong":"716092813126008832"},"retweets":84},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1RuMqjS"}

Ninety percent of family members, 85%\nof patients and 83% of healthcare workers mentioned it across the various\nstudies.Religiosity and spirituality -- meeting with clergy, having faith, and\nreceiving religious or spiritual comfort -- appeared to be significantly more\nimportant to the definition of a good death by those who were dying than to\nfamily members or healthcare workers. The authors report that this theme was\nbrought up by 65% of patients, but just 59% of healthcare workers and 50% of\nfamily members.Family members were more concerned with the idea of dignity\n--defined here as being respected as an individual and having independence --\nat the end of life than either healthcare workers or patients were. The idea\nthat dignity was an important element of a good death was brought up by 80% of\nfamily members, but just 61% of healthcare workers and 55% of\npatients.Similarly, having a good quality of life --meaning living as usual,\nand believing life is worth living even at the end-- was listed as an\nimportant part of a good death by 70% of family members, but just 35% of\npatients and 22% of healthcare workers.\"For a dying person, the concerns seem\nto be more existential and psychological and less physical,\" Jeste said.  And\nhere the authors see a call to action.\"Although it is important that we attend\nto the patient's physical symptoms... it is crucial that the healthcare\nsystem... more closely address psychological, social and spirituality themes\nin the end-of-life care for both patients and families,\" they write. They also\nsay this work is just the start of a much longer conversation.Jeste hopes that\none day terminally ill patients might receive a checklist that will help them\nthink about and express what they consider a good death so that family members\nand healthcare workers can help them achieve it.\"We are not just interested in\nresearch,\" Jeste said. \"We are interested in improving well being.\"**Do you\nlove science?

And it's about a processed food product.It's\n\"Watch the Stove,\" the shockingly good mixtape released by Hamburger Helper\nfor April Fools' Day. Except it's not a joke.Well, the songs, including \"Feed\nthe Streets\" and \"In Love With the Glove,\" are about the packaged food product\nand include lyrics like \"if you catch me at the stove, I was whippin' up a\nbowl\" and \"hold up I told you I'm servin' that stroganoff.\" But they're …\ngood.

You know him better as DJ Tiiiiiiiiiip, one of the people featured on\nthe opening track of the album, \"Feed the Streets.\"I told him I absolutely\nneeded to know everything about how \"Watch the Stove\" got made. It turns out\nGeneral Mills (which owns Hamburger Helper) had been planning this for a\nwhile. It also turns out the entire collaboration was a local effort.General\nMills is headquartered in Minneapolis, where Madrigal also lives. (He said he\nwent to daycare down the street from the plant where Hamburger Helper products\nare manufactured.) The people at Hamburger Helper were familiar with his work,\nincluding a song called \" ... My Baby Mama.\"Three months ago, GM approached\nhim, he said, wanting to know if Madrigal and producer Bobby Raps wanted to\nwork on a song with them. Liana Miller, the marketing communications planner\nfor Hamburger Helper, said by  email that the team had been kicking around the\nidea, joking with their Twitter followers (from @helper) about making a\nmixtape.\"When we saw the demand, we thought, why not?\" Miller said in an\nemailed statement. For the album itself, \"We chose to feature artists that\nwere representative of our consumers.\" That included local up-and-coming\ntalent like Madrigal.\"That's part of why we wanted to get involved,\" he said.\n\"It's all Minnesota, local culture, local everything.\"The duo received a few\nguidelines: The song had to be family-friendly. Nothing overtly inappropriate.\nNo swear words. Obviously, it had to be about Hamburger Helper. Madrigal and\nRaps took it from there.\"Feed the Streets\" came together over the course of a\nmonth. Hamburger Helper reached out to a local music school and asked students\nto contribute as well. College students are responsible for the tracks\n\"Crazy,\" \"Food for Your Soul\" and \"In Love With the Glove.\" Internet celebrity\nNiles Stewart a.k.a. Retro Spectro contributed the second track, \"Hamburger\nHelper.\"I asked Madrigal point blank: Why is this so good? How?\"We like to\ntake pride in what we do, and we didn't want to give [General Mills] anything\nbad,\" he said. \"We work really hard but don't take ourselves too seriously. We\nhave fun.\" (Proof of that hard work: When we spoke on the phone, he was\ndriving across the border into Canada, where he's DJing a show tonight in\nVancouver. No word yet on when the official Watch the Stove world tour\nbegins.)It's possibly the greatest April Fools' Day prank of all time. Every\nother corporate #brand can just quit now.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc557"},"content":"As the first quarter of 2016 nears an end, violence in Chicago has reached\nlevels unseen in years, putting the city on course to top 500 homicides for\nonly the second time since 2008.As of 6 a.m. Wednesday, homicides totaled 135,\na 71% jump over the 79 killings in the same year-earlier period, official\nPolice Department statistics show. That represented the worst first quarter of\na year since 136 homicides in 1999, according to the data.Shootings have\njumped by comparable numbers as well. As of Wednesday, at least 727 people had\nbeen shot in Chicago this year, a 73% rise from 422 a year earlier, according\nto a Tribune analysis of department data.Worse yet, that jump follows two\nconsecutive years in which shootings rose by double digits, the analysis\nfound. Homicides also rose by about 12.5% last year over 2014.If there was any\nhopeful sign in the numbers, it would be that for most of March, homicides\nrose citywide by a more modest 25% from the same year-earlier period, the\ndepartment said.Crime experts caution about making year-to-year comparisons,\nbut Arthur Lurigio, a professor of criminal justice and psychology at Loyola\nUniversity Chicago, called the escalating violence at the start of the year\n\"alarming.\"\"We have to go back decades to find jumps of this magnitude in\nyear-to-year comparisons,\" he said. \"We're on our way to 500 homicides again.\nWe're going backward.\"After an unrelated news conference Wednesday, new\ninterim police Superintendent Eddie Johnson found an optimistic note in the\nrecent slowing of the percentage increase in homicides.\"If we can build on\nthat momentum, we'll be doing good,\" he said.Johnson said gang conflicts and\nthe proliferation of guns continue to fuel the violence. The department also\ndisclosed that more than half of the homicide victims this year had been\ntargeted as likely gun violence victims or offenders in a novel program in\nwhich commanders try to persuade them to give up the gang life.\"We know who is\ncommitting these crimes. It's a small segment of the population,\" Johnson told\nthe Tribune. \"We have those individuals targeted. One of the things we have to\ndo is ensure we hold those individuals accountable when they commit these\ncrimes.\"The surge in violence comes at a tumultuous time for the police\ndepartment. On Monday, Mayor Rahm Emanuel passed over the three finalists his\nhand-picked police board had chosen for police superintendent and instead\nplucked Johnson from the command staff for the post.In December, Emanuel had\nfired Garry McCarthy after 4 1/2 years in the job amid the public furor after\nthe court-ordered release of a dashboard camera video showing a white Chicago\npolice officer shoot Laquan McDonald 16 times, killing the black teen as he\nwalked away from police with a knife in his hand.In February, the Tribune\nreported a precipitous drop in morale among Chicago police, citing interviews\nwith numerous officers. They told the newspaper the McDonald shooting had made\nthem less aggressive on the street out of fear that doing even basic police\nwork would get them into trouble. Criminals were taking advantage of their\npassive approach, they said.The police department on Jan. 1 also began\nrequiring that cops fill out detailed reports every time they make a street\nstop as part of a new state law and a landmark agreement worked out with the\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union. The change — the result of concerns over\nracial profiling — not only has kept officers busy with paperwork longer than\nbefore, officers said, but also has increased their anxiety about being\nsecond-guessed on whom they've stopped.The result was that officers made 6,818\narrests in January, a 32% drop from nearly 10,000 arrests a year earlier. The\nnumber of street stops also has plummeted, with 9,044 investigatory stop\nreports issued in January, a fraction of the 61,330 \"contact cards\" that\npolice issued during January 2015.While crime experts and the ACLU have\ncontended that no empirical evidence exists that would suggest the low police\nactivity has led to a rise in violence, Loyola's Lurigio expressed concern\nabout officers lying down on the job.\"We'd be remiss in thinking that the\napparent lack of police activity has nothing to do with it,\" he said. \"That\nwould be foolish to think that. How much? We don't know.\"In the brief\ninterview Wednesday, Johnson said that he didn't think morale was so bad, but\nthat officers had been confused by the rollout of the new street stop reports.\nBut that has improved with training, he said.\"We're seeing a steady uptick in\nthe investigatory stops, so we're slowly but surely getting back,\" the interim\nsuperintendent said. \"I don't think we'll ever hit the numbers we had before.\nBut that's the whole point of it. We just have to make sure we stop the right\npeople at the right times for the right reasons.\"It's important to keep in\nmind that the violence is far reduced from the early 1990s when homicides\nsometimes exceeded 900 in a year. But what continues to be troubling is that\nin recent years, Chicago's violence has outpaced New York and Los Angeles even\nthough both are more populous. That gulf appears to have worsened this\nyear.According to the most recent numbers available, 60 people had been slain\nin New York through March 20, down from 75 in the year-earlier period, while\nLos Angeles recorded 67 homicides through March 26, up from 54 last year, the\ndepartments said.Through those same time periods, shooting victims had totaled\n202 in New York and 260 in Los Angeles, far below Chicago levels.While police\nare loathe to mention weather as a factor, temperatures in Chicago over the\nfirst three months have been milder and snowfall below normal, said Ricky\nCastro, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service.As they have\ntraditionally, neighborhoods affected the most by the rise in violence are on\nChicago's south and west sides, which for decades have been stricken by high\nconcentrations of poverty, lack of investment from the city, illegal drug\nactivity and an intractable gang problem.The hardest hit of the Police\nDepartment's 22 districts has been the West Side's Harrison District, which\nincludes the West Garfield Park, East Garfield Park and Humboldt Park\ncommunity areas. Through Sunday, 21 people had been killed, more than triple\nfrom six a year earlier, statistics show. Shooting incidents have risen by\nsimilar numbers, to 111 from 40.The neighboring Austin District on the city's\nFar West Side recorded 10 homicides, up from only three a year earlier,\naccording to the department. Shooting incidents more than doubled to 47 from\n21.Both districts have been plagued for years by violence caused in large part\nby disputes over narcotics sales. The Eisenhower Expressway — which cuts\nthrough the middle of the two districts — has for years been dubbed by law\nenforcement as \"the heroin highway\" because of drug users who travel from the\nsuburbs for their fix.On the South Side, three districts — Englewood, Deering\nand Chicago Lawn — shared the dubious mark of recording the most homicides\nthrough Sunday — 12 each. A year earlier, Englewood and Deering had just five\nslayings each, while Chicago Lawn had seven.On Tuesday night, about 20\nresidents joined several police officers at 71st Street and Jeffery Boulevard\nin the South Side's South Shore community in a show of solidarity in the fight\nagainst crime. The area isn't as prone to gun violence as it once was, but it\nstill has its flare-ups.The event drew mostly residents who appeared to be in\ntheir 40s, 50s or 60s, not the at-risk youths most affected by the\nviolence.\"It's hard trying to pull a young person out of that kind of\nenvironment where this is what they have eaten, slept and drank all their\nlives,\" said Sgt. Maudessie Jointer, who helped oversee the gathering. \"You\nwill get a few, but we don't get them in the volume that we need.\"Over on the\nWest Side, the Rev. Ira Acree, an outspoken pastor in the Austin community,\ntalked about fragmented families, a poor school system and a proliferation of\nguns as being among the causes of the violence.\"It's a crisis here in\nChicago,\" he said about the disturbing level of violence so early in the year.\n\"Unless something radical transpires in our city, there's going to be a\nbloodbath this summer.\"_jgorner@tribpub.com_**Twitter: @JeremyGorner**\n\n","title":"Chicago violence has reached levels not seen in years - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Chicago violence has reached levels not seen in years https://t.co/CQGIFpUyPy https://t.co/Q93Mo7663Q","date":"Sat Apr 02 00:05:08 +0000 2016","favs":43,"id":{"$numberLong":"716053817352175616"},"retweets":81},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1ZNVtya"}

It was initially believed that\nthe woman was shot by her captor, not police. The hostage situation was the\nculmination of a dramatic series of events inside and outside an Office Depot\non Orange Street. That afternoon, 29-year-old Andrew Mike of Downey entered\nthe store, where Kristin Bauer, 28, of Corona worked. Bauer had recently\nbroken up with Mike, Garcia said. **RELATED: Hostage pleaded with Redlands\ngunman, 'You gotta let me go!'**\"Seeking to avoid a scene,\" Bauer followed\nMike to the parking lot and got into his car. He pulled out a handgun, put the\ngun in his mouth and pulled the trigger, but it didn't fire, Garcia said.Mike\nthen drove out of the parking lot, with Bauer in the vehicle. While driving,\nhe fired his gun toward Bauer, striking the passenger door, the police chief\nsaid. He also tried unsuccessfully to inject her with a syringe containing an\nunknown substance, Garcia said. Mike eventually returned to the Office Depot,\nand they went back into the store. Mike \"physically restrained Kristin while\nholding her at gunpoint,\" Garcia said. Another man who tried to help her was\nshot in the hand by Mike, police said. After police arrived on the scene, Mike\nheld Bauer at gunpoint for more than two hours as police negotiators tried to\ntalk to him. He repeatedly told Bauer that he would kill her and told police\nofficers that \"he was ready to die that day,\" Garcia said. A man who held his\nwounded ex-girlfriend hostage Thursday afternoon after an apparent \"domestic\nviolence shooting\" at an Office Depot in Redlands was shot and killed by\npolice, according to authorities.A man who held his wounded ex-girlfriend\nhostage Thursday afternoon after an apparent \"domestic violence shooting\" at\nan Office Depot in Redlands was shot and killed by police, according to\nauthorities.Then, \"Mike made a sudden move, pulling Kristin back as a shield\nand pushing the gun into her back,\" Garcia said. \"Believing the hostage was in\nimminent danger, officers made a split-second decision, firing multiple rounds\nat the suspect in an attempt to save Kristin's life.\"Mike was struck and\nkilled. Bauer was also shot once in the torso. Eleven officers fired 25\nrounds, he said. Nine were officers with the Redlands Police Department, and\ntwo were San Bernardino police officers. Garcia said he spoke to Bauer on\nFriday morning and told her investigators had determined she was shot by an\nofficer, not Mike. \"After meeting with Kristin again this morning, I am\nencouraged by her recovery,\" Garcia said. \"I pray for her continued recovery,\nand the Redlands Police Department and I will continue to do all we can to\nassist her as she heals.\"Bauer remains at Loma Linda University Medical Center\nin serious condition, the San Bernardino Sun reported.\n_hailey.branson@latimes.com_**Follow me at @haileybranson /\nGoogle+****ALSO****Video captures police officer playing hopscotch with\nhomeless girl****Apartment fire in Clovis leaves woman dead, 4 police officers\ninjured****Knife linked to former O.J.

They circled past a breakwater and made their way to Pier 45.With a\nwell-practiced choreography of hoists and chains, bins and forklifts, each\nvessel quickly deposited thousands of pounds of flailing Dungeness crabs. The\nnext morning, they would head back out for more.This was on Thursday\nafternoon, a breezy, cloudless spring day in San Francisco. Two days earlier,\nafter a delay of more than four months, the crabs offshore had been determined\nby state officials to be free of a toxic acid that had raised food safety\nconcerns.**Interested in the stories shaping California?

The skippers were reporting catches that were only a\nthird to half of a typical opening day harvest in November.“Too little, too\nlate,” said Larry Collins, a veteran San Francisco fisherman who runs the Crab\nBoat Owners Assn. Collins said that, while the more veteran boat owners had\nsavings set aside for slow seasons, he knew of others who had run up credit\ncard debts in the tens of thousands of dollars during the winter idle.\nIndustry-wide, the delay is estimated to have cost nearly $50 million. It was\nquiet on Pier 45.

Idled fishing vessels bobbed at their\nberths. One of the few dock workers present made small talk on his cellphone.\nAnother puttered by on an empty forklift.It was just after dawn on a recent\nweekday. Larry Collins, a veteran of...The postponement was the result of a\nrare toxic algae that bloomed last year in Pacific waters warmed by El Niño\nconditions. The algae produce domoic acid, which does not harm crabs but can\nsicken people who consume them.Throughout the delay, Collins and his\ncolleagues stressed that it would be better to wait than to sell a single\ncontaminated crab. And wait they did, through months of measurements by state\nofficials of acid levels in crabs caught for testing purposes.Collins\ndescribes crab as something of a “religion” in and around San Francisco, a\nritualistic component of winter celebrations — Christmas, New Year’s, the\nLunar New Year, and January community “crab feeds” that raise money for\nprivate schools, churches, youth sports teams, firehouses, you name it.Whether\nconsumers will develop a similar passion for spring crabs is a question that\nlooms heavy for all those who operate in the crab industry, from crabbers, to\nwholesalers, to restaurateurs.That said, there was some satisfaction in seeing\nactivity return to Pier 45. In December, in what should have been a frenetic\nseason for the crabbers, there had been a ghostly look and feel to the pier,\none of the last working remnants to what once was a thriving San Francisco\nwaterfront.Now there was the beeping of forklifts as they backed in bins of\ncrabs, to be weighed and washed and submerged in vats of 208-degree water. Now\nthe breezes that created white caps on the bay carried with them the vapor\nfrom the vats and the scent of the cooking crabs.Mike Mitchell, the 68-year-\nold owner of the 44-foot Linda Noelle, stood on the pier and watched his crew\nunloading fresh crab — about half of what typically is caught on opening day.\nIt was, the San Francisco native said, a better-than-nothing moment.“If you\nare hungry and someone puts down a hot dog in front of you,” he said, “you\ndon’t complain. You eat it.”The last four months, Mitchell said, had been\n“tough.” He had been fishing for crab out of San Francisco for 46 years, and\nthe protracted postponement was a first.“Before this, I would have said I’ve\nseen everything there is to be seen – a little error there, I guess.”**See\nmore of our top stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**A block away, tourists who had\nbeen in short supply last December, were moving in throngs, and speaking many\nlanguages, as they lined up for crab bowls and crab sandwiches and crab\nT-shirts.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc55c"},"content":"A day after its glitzy Model 3 unveiling in front of hundreds of fans, Tesla\nMotors Inc. will now have to turn its attention to its most pressing concern:\nhow to deliver these cars to customers on time.It's a problem Tesla has\nstruggled with before.Its most recent vehicle, the \"falcon-wing\" Model X SUV,\nwas delivered to customers in late 2015 after it was expected to arrive in\nearly to mid-2014.**See more of our top stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**The\ntrouble was blamed on design difficulties with the doors, which open straight\naway and up from the vehicle. (Most of the industry refers to these as “gull-\nwing” doors but, hey, that’s Tesla.)“Prior history might be an indicator of\nwhat might happen in the future,” said Jack Nerad, executive editorial\ndirector and market analyst for Kelley Blue Book.Read on to learn more about\nthe challenges Tesla will face with its newest model. **Production\ndelays**Company Chief Executive Elon Musk claims that, compared to past\nvehicle delivery disappointments, the Model 3 will be different.At the car\nunveiling Thursday night, Musk got a big laugh from the audience when he said\nhe felt “fairly confident” that the electric vehicle would be delivered next\nyear.On Friday morning, he tweeted that pre-orders for the Model 3 had reached\n180,000. He followed that tweet up with another, saying he was “definitely\ngoing to need to rethink production planning.”“They’re acutely aware of the\ndelays they’ve had before,” said Eric Lyman, vice president of industry\ninsights at TrueCar.**SIGN UP for the free California Inc. business newsletter\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**“I think when you’re acutely aware of something, especially as a\npublicly traded company, you have a responsibility to be straightforward with\nthe expectations going forward of future products and ultimately things that\nwill impact the bottom line for your business and your shareholders.”To cut\ndown on potential product delays, analysts said the Model 3 would likely have\na more simple design and features.“If they have less bells and whistles, which\nthey probably will, the production should be a bit easier from that\nstandpoint,” said Jessica Caldwell, senior analyst at Edmunds.com. “They're\nproducing a higher number [of vehicles], but the complexity of production\nwould be less.”But the mass market Tesla is targeting with the Model 3 is very\ndifferent from the niche, luxury customers it attracted with the higher-end\nModel S sedan and Model X SUV.“The mass market is not as tolerant of delays in\nproduct,” Lyman said. “Part of the appeal of a luxury good is the exclusivity,\nand if slim production or lack of availability is positively correlated with\nexclusivity ... then a delay in that type of market would not be as\nimpactful.”**Competitors with a quicker time frame**One looming challenger is\nthe Chevy Bolt, which is expected to be on the market by the end of 2016. The\nplug-in electric vehicle will have a price tag of about $37,500 and a 200-mile\nrange.Other automakers, such as Mercedes-Benz and BMW, also are working on new\nelectric vehicles.Nerad of Kelley Blue Book said some antsy buyers could\ndecide to switch to another maker if Tesla takes too long.But conventional\nautomakers with electric vehicles also will be able to compete through the\nsheer number of dealerships and their retail power.“The key ingredient for a\nbroad-line manufacturer is they can sell and probably will sell EVs [electric\nvehicles] at a loss,” he said. “I think Tesla Motors can’t continue to operate\nat a loss forever. This is when they’re really supposed to become much more\nthan a niche player in the industry.”**Disappearing electric vehicle rebates  \n**California recently disallowed electric vehicle rebates for wealthy customers, and some state and federal rebates are set to expire after the manufacturer sells 200,000 individual cars.According to data compiled by the research firm Polk and by the industry publication Inside Evs, Tesla to date has sold about 67,000 vehicles that qualified for rebates. If the company hits its stated sales target of 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles this year, analysts said, those rebates could expire before the first Model 3 leaves the factory floor.“A good number of these individuals are not going to get that tax rebate,” Lyman said. “Just the sheer math won’t allow it. That’s another tricky thing that Tesla’s going to have to negotiate.”_Times staff writer Charles Fleming contributed to this report._**For more business news, follow @smasunaga.****ALSO****On campuses across the country, students are standing up for Donald Trump****Elon Musk says Tesla Model 3 pre-orders hit 180,000, but can he deliver?****One of the LAPD's preferred weapons to help officers avoid shootings often doesn't work**\n\n","title":"After Tesla Model 3 unveiling, Elon Musk faces big challenges to deliver cars - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Selling Tesla Model 3 might have been the easy part.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc55f"},"content":"When the fifth overdose patient rolled into the emergency room at UC Davis\nMedical Center last week, doctors knew they were dealing with something out of\nthe ordinary.They were used to heroin overdoses. But the patients admitted in\nthe wee hours of March 24 showed symptoms of opiate toxicity that were far\nmore pronounced than usual.In about a week, 36 people overdosed, at least nine\nof them fatally, from street drugs in the greater Sacramento region. Doctors\ncompared notes and quickly closed in on the prime suspect: fentanyl, a\npainkiller that is up to 100 times stronger than morphine and lethal even in\nvery small doses.Officials are now frantically searching for the source of the\ndrug, which is being produced in counterfeit tablets that can be bought for as\nlittle as $5 each on the street.A powerful painkiller that can be fatal even\nin small doses is the latest front in a nationwide epidemic of street drug\nabuse, recently becoming the prime suspect in a rash of overdoses that killed\nsix people in less than a week in Sacramento County.Experts say the rise of\nfentanyl is fueled by...A powerful painkiller that can be fatal even in small\ndoses is the latest front in a nationwide epidemic of street drug abuse,\nrecently becoming the prime suspect in a rash of overdoses that killed six\npeople in less than a week in Sacramento County.Experts say the rise of\nfentanyl is fueled by...The federal Drug Enforcement Administration issued a\npublic safety alert Friday warning that fentanyl-related overdoses are\n“occurring at an alarming rate” and urging the public to take only drugs\nprescribed by a physician and from a reputable pharmacy. The Sacramento-area\noverdose victims ranged from 18 to 59 years old and comprised equal numbers of\nmen and women, according to the alert.Authorities fear the rash of cases\nportends the move west of rampant fentanyl abuse that had largely been\ncentered on the East Coast, its spread probably channeled through Mexican  \ndrug cartels, medical and law enforcement officials said.In Los Angeles\nCounty, fatal overdoses related to fentanyl increased to 62 in 2014 — the most\nrecent year for which data is available — from 42 in 2011, according to\ncoroner's data. While not matching East Coast levels, the rise is troubling,\nofficials said.“The prescription drug issue hasn't touched us in the same\nway,” said Dr. Gary Tsai, medical director and science officer for the L.A.\nCounty Department of Public Health's office of Substance Abuse Prevention and\nControl. “Our concern is that it will, that it's only a matter of\ntime.”Directors of West Coast drug treatment programs have been bracing for\nproblems related to fentanyl, which can lower blood pressure, heart rate and\nrespiratory function and lead to seizures, said Rachel Anderson, executive\ndirector of the Sacramento-area needle exchange Safer Alternatives Thru\nNetworking \u0026amp; Education.Prescribed to cancer patients since the 1960s,\nfentanyl is the most powerful painkiller available for medical treatment, and\nis typically administered as a lozenge, patch or injection. But an illegally\nmanufactured version of the drug, often called “China White” or “Apache,” has\nbegun spreading recently.Between 2012 and 2014, the number of seizures of\nillegally used fentanyl nationwide increased more than sevenfold to 4,585,\naccording to federal officials.The painkiller offers an intense, euphoric high\nand the odorless, white powder is sometimes used to cut heroin and cocaine or\npassed off as another drug. Dealers mix it in to give their product an extra\nkick or to cheaply produce more usable heroin, Anderson said.“Is it new? Yes\nand no. We've been aware of what's going on the East Coast and expecting it to\nshow up in one form or another,” Anderson said.Health officials in Sacramento\nCounty say that many of the recent overdoses occurred after people purchased\npills they believed to be Norco, a less potent opiate, but were in fact\nfentanyl. Officials are urging the public to be cautious about intake of any\nstreet drugs.Sgt. Salvador Robles of the Sacramento County sheriff's major\nnarcotics impact division, said investigators have a “strong lead” on a home\nwhere two of the recent overdoses occurred and are hoping to trace the cases\nback to the source of the fentanyl.Robles was unsure if the cases stemmed from\na single bad batch or were indicative of a larger problem.“My only tip is, if\nyou're addicted to Norco or any pills, do not take them right now,” he\nsaid.Experts say the rise of fentanyl is fueled by an increase in doctor-\nprescribed painkillers over the last decade that has left many patients\naddicted to opiates and intensified a heroin epidemic that's ravaging many\ntowns nationwide.In 2014, 28,647 people died of overdose deaths from opioids,\nincluding heroin, the highest toll ever recorded, according to the U.S.\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention. The number of deaths involving\nsynthetic opioids — mostly fentanyl, experts say — nearly doubled between 2013\nand 2014 to 5,500 deaths, the largest increase in opioid deaths.“This is just\nanother face of the opioid epidemic,” said Dr. Caleb Alexander, co-director of\nthe Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness.In Sacramento\nCounty, heroin use has increased within the last decade as use of\nmethamphetamines has dropped, Robles said. Fifteen years ago, seizing a few\nounces of heroin in Sacramento County was rare, he said, but “now we're\nfinding it in [kilos].”Officials across the country report similar trends, but\nfentanyl is a new wrinkle in the drug trade. About 700 people died from\nfentanyl and its analogs nationwide from late 2013 to late 2014, according to\na recent report from the DEA.In California, legislation was introduced in\nFebruary to increase criminal penalties for dealing the drug.Past\ninvestigations have revealed that Mexican cartels are purchasing fentanyl\nproduced in China, then using traditional trafficking routes to bring it to\nthe United States. In 2014, DEA officers seized 26 pounds of fentanyl in a\nstash house in Los Angeles.Alexander, the Johns Hopkins physician, said that\ndemand will remain strong until the prescription drug epidemic is under\ncontrol. He said doctors should limit how often they prescribe opiates to\npatients and expand treatment programs for those who are already addicted.“Do\nwe need to be worried about it? Yes,” Alexander said. “But I don't think ...\nthese deaths can be separated from the surge in overuse of prescription\nopioid. It's part and parcel of the same problem.”President Obama has asked\nfor more than $1 billion in the federal funding to help expand access to\ntreatment programs.Earlier this month, CDC officials released new guidelines\nstrongly discouraging doctors from prescribing opiates, including OxyContin\nand Vicodin, for patients with chronic conditions such as back problems,\nmigraines and arthritis.Shelly Elkington, 49, thinks stricter guidelines could\nhave saved her daughter's life. While in college, Casey Jo was diagnosed with\nCrohn's disease, an incurable bowel disorder that can require repeated\nsurgeries.She was prescribed painkillers, including fentanyl.“I always want to\nsay her doctor meant well,” said Elkington, who lives in Montevideo, Minn.\n“His intentions were always good — to make her feel better.”But Casey Jo\nquickly became addicted to opiates, eventually turning to street drugs. She\ndropped out of school and began smoking fentanyl and buying heroin.“Everyday,\nwe didn't know if we were going to get a call that she was arrested,\nassaulted, raped, everything,” Elkington said. “ We were so afraid for her all\nthe time.”In August last year, Elkington got that fated call: Her daughter was\nfound dead in her apartment. She was 26.“I watched my daughter virtually slip\naway from us,” she said. **For breaking California news, follow\n@JosephSerna.****ALSO****Apartment fire in Clovis leaves woman dead, 4 police\nofficers injured****Nude woman, found in the street, was stabbed about 24\ntimes, police say****Deputies search for hammer-wielding attacker who sent two\npeople to the hospital in East L.A.**\n\n","title":"Death toll rises to 9 in suspected fentanyl overdoses in Northern California - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Death toll rises to 9 in suspected fentanyl overdoses in Northern California https://t.co/Djosyp73ut https://t.co/jqpcwo37Lv","date":"Fri Apr 01 21:30:15 +0000 2016","favs":20,"id":{"$numberLong":"716014838359715841"},"retweets":36},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1qaTMiB"}

Simpson is not\nconnected to the 1994 slayings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald\nGoldman, Los Angeles police confirmed Friday.The Los Angeles Police Department\nperformed a variety of forensic tests on the rusty 5-inch fixed blade knife\nand compared it with the wounds inflicted on the victims before ruling it out\nas the murder weapon, two sources familiar with the investigation said.“That\nis not the knife,” said an LAPD source familiar with the investigation. “There\nis no evidence related to the crime.” The source said there was no blood on\nit.The examination of the knife came more than two decades after the former\nfootball player turned actor and announcer was tried in one of the highest-\nprofile murder cases and acquitted by a jury. A civil trial, however, held\nSimpson liable for the two deaths and ordered him to pay $33 million.The small\nsize of the blade was among many issues undermining its potential as the\nmurder weapon. During the criminal trial, the Los Angeles County coroner\ntestified the weapon that killed the pair had at least a 6 1/2 -inch blade, in\nhis opinion.

When his department showed no\ninterest in the knife, Maycott stored the blade in his toolbox for more than a\ndecade, his attorney Trent Copeland said.Maycott recently came across the\nknife again and told a friend. Eventually, LAPD Robbery Homicide Division\ndetectives learned of the knife and took possession of it Feb. 10. When news\nof the knife broke, it sparked renewed speculation but also deep skepticism in\nsome quarters over whether it was just one more fruitless lead in the case.The\nreports came during a broadcast of the FX TV series “The People v. O.J.\nSimpson: American Crime Story,” also heightening interest.Copeland said the\noutcome is no surprise to his client, who feels some vindication and relief.\nMaycott said he feels as if he was “dragged through the village,” but holds no\ngrudge against the Police Department, Copeland said.After the slayings,\ninvestigators examined and dismissed several knives, including a 15-inch\nretractable blade that O.J. Simpson purchased at a downtown Los Angeles\ncutlery shop and a blood-stained kitchen knife wrapped in a blouse discovered\nnear Simpson's Brentwood estate. Even a broken carving knife found in a waste\ntank at Chicago's O'Hare airport was turned in to investigators.Simpson is\nserving up to 33 years in a Nevada prison for kidnapping and robbing\nmemorabilia dealers in a Las Vegas hotel room.

It’s the cornerstone of the unraveling of the mind of the millionaire\nand the physical representation of the corruption and injustice in Gotham that\nBatman must fight.But sweet bat-pajamas, the Waynes have died more than a\ndozen times on film and television, twice already by director Zack Snyder\n(once in the recent “Batman v Superman” movie, and there was a Wayne death\nhomage in his “Watchman” titles). And sadly they can’t all be Will Arnett's\nblustery Batman song from “The LEGO Movie,\" with the touching lyrics\n\"Darkness! No parents!”The scene plays out (almost) always the same since\ntheir fate was first depicted in a 1939 issue of \"Detective Comics.” Just\ninsert the appropriate symbolic prop (happy family, gun, \"Mark of Zorro\"\nmarquee, Mrs. Wayne's pearls) at the appropriate time and presto, your\nsuperhero is now saddled with emotional baggage. So who did the Wayne family\njustice? Here’s our collection of the Wayne family’s on screen demise, ranked.  \n Bruce Wayne's parents die in \"Batman: Arkham Asylum\" Bruce Wayne's parents\ndie in \"Batman: Arkham Asylum\" **12\\. Batman: Arkham Asylum\n(2009)**Phantasmagoric visions swirl through video game \"Batman: Arkham\nAsylum\" as a drugged Batman stumbles across a CG version of his parents'\ndemise. Some moments are spectacular. Others are not, including the slow\nstroll through Gotham's alleys in which disembodied voices recall Tom and\nMartha's murder. In a nice touch, Martha's dialogue questions the cocksure\nshortcut that ends their life. Forcing players to stare at Batman's back as he\nstaggers toward a barely seen crime is less inspired. Bruce Wayne's parent's\ndie in \"Batman v Superman.\" Jeffrey Dean Morgan is Thomas Wayne,  Lauren Cohan\nis Martha Wayne, and Brandon Spink is Young Bruce Wayne.Bruce Wayne's parent's\ndie in \"Batman v Superman.\" Jeffrey Dean Morgan is Thomas Wayne,  Lauren Cohan\nis Martha Wayne, and Brandon Spink is Young Bruce Wayne.**11\\. Batman v\nSuperman: Dawn of Justice (2016)** Zack Snyder kills the Wayne elders in the\nopening of \"Batman v Superman\" because how would we understand the Dark\nKnight's fear and hatred of criminals without a reminder of his youth? In\nkeeping with the steroid-amped tone of the film, this Thomas Wayne (played by\nJeffrey Dean Morgan, a.k.a. the Comedian in Snyder's \"Watchmen\") aggressively\ntries to stop the mugging -- it doesn't work.The \"gun and pearls\" imagery\nFrank Miller first introduced in the 1986 comic collection \"The Dark Knight\nReturns\" is recycled again. The string of pearls worn by Martha Wayne (played\nby Lauren Cohan of \"The Walking Dead\") snap after being implausibly draped\nacross the gun of the attacking criminal. The falling pearls get more\nscreentime than Martha. Overwrought dramatics, thy name is \"Batman v\nSuperman.\" Bruce Wayne's parents die in \"Batman: The Brave and The Bold\"Bruce\nWayne's parents die in \"Batman: The Brave and The Bold\"**10\\. Batman: The\nBrave and the Bold -- “Chill of the Night,” 2010)**This chilly blue flashback\nis a wobbly stack of basic building blocks. An exaggerated score and Bruce's\ntears do most of the heavy lifting as the Waynes' exit \"The Mark of Zorro\"\n(another Wayne death staple). Voicing Thomas, Adam West sounds like he's\nhopped up in the vocal booth, delivering theatrical line readings with the air\nof a man who has never even heard the word \"danger.\" It was an out-of-place\nmoment for \"Batman: The Brave and the Bold,\" a usually jovial translation of\nthe Bat-verse. Bruce Wayne's parent's die in \"Gotham.\" David Mazouz as Bruce\nWayne. Bruce Wayne's parent's die in \"Gotham.\" David Mazouz as Bruce Wayne.\n**9\\. Gotham (2014)** The \"Gotham\" pilot features a better family dynamic than\nmost filmed versions of the Waynes' final minutes and even a decent staging of\nthe action ... right up to the point where a masked Joe Chill shoots Thomas\nWayne for no reason at all.Alas it misses the mark with amped-up acting,\nBruce's final Darth Vader-worthy shriek, and for setting the encounter under\nthe watchful eye of a young Catwoman hunched in the fire escape. Because\nGotham is tiny. Bruce Wayne's parents die in \"Batman Year One.\" Bruce Wayne's\nparents die in \"Batman Year One.\" **8\\. Batman: Year One (2011)**Despite\nrefining the \"Brave and the Bold\" scene, this black-and-white retelling fails\nto channel the raw elegance of David Mazzuchelli's original \"Year One\" comic-\nbook artwork. The action is static, with Bruce stuck in near-immobility as his\nparents are knocked well off their feet by gunshots. A nice touch: pearls from\nMartha's broken necklace fall like tears before Bruce's face. **7\\. The Super\nPowers Team: Galactic Guardians -- “The Fear,” 1985)**Fun fact, the first\ntelevised version of the Waynes' death actually premiered on a kid's show.\nBruce's parents were first murdered on screen in the final season of a\nSaturday morning cartoon staple formerly called \"Super Friends.\"In a flashback\nsequence, Batman recalls his doomed trip down \"crime alley.\" That surprisingly\nenough wasn't called crime alley until after the Waynes decided to take the\nperilous shortcut. In the G-rated version, the audience never views or hears a\ngun, but the Waynes still meet their awful fate by a man who attacks them\nstating,  \"This is a stickup!\" For a cheaply animated '80s relic, the episode\nworks quite well.**6\\. The Dark Knight Returns (2012)**Essentially a third-\ngeneration remake of the rendition in \"Brave and the Bold\" and \"Year One,\"\nthis is the best-produced and most-effective Miller-inspired animation, its\nimpact derived from a faithful import not only of the writer/artist's designs\nbut through the pacing. Cutting the flashback against televised reports of\ncrime and violence as an aged Bruce seriously freaks out -- as in the first\nissue of \"The Dark Knight Returns\" -- hammers home the fear-based relationship\nbetween the crime and his decision to take up crime-fighting.Bruce Wayne's\nparents die in 'Batman: Gotham Knight.'Bruce Wayne's parents die in 'Batman:\nGotham Knight.'**5\\. Batman: Gotham Knight -- \"Deadshot\"  (2008)**This anime\nanthology views the Wayne family through the barrel of a pistol. Think James\nBond's opening, only instead of setting up a deadly spy, it emotionally scars\na small child forever. Found in the \"Deadshot\" chapter of the anime series,\nthis short is entirely concerned with Batman's relationship to firearms. The\nDark Knight recalls his family's murder in an economical flashback delivered\nin four brief but vivid shots. Writer Alan Burnett (who also wrote \"The Fear\")\nhas unerring aim as he illustrates Batman's understanding and rejection of the\ngun. An important moral touchstone for the character that will later be\nabandoned in \"Batman v Superman\" when the Batmobile is loaded with machine\nguns. Not the scene where Bruce Wayne's parents die from the 1989 \"Batman\" but\nan image of the The Joker (played by Jack Nicholson) who is responsible for\ntheir deaths. Not the scene where Bruce Wayne's parents die from the 1989\n\"Batman\" but an image of the The Joker (played by Jack Nicholson) who is\nresponsible for their deaths. **4\\. Batman (1989)** Tim Burton goes full noir\non Bruce Wayne's formative night. An atmosphere of urban malaise billows\nacross the filthy Gotham streets as two muggers assail the family. Burton (and\nhis writers) shrink Batman's world by setting one thug as Jack Napier, the\nvillain who would eventually become the Joker (played by Jack Nicholson). That\nconcept spawned a screenwriting trend that would narrow many a comic book film\nto a string of strange coincidences. Here, the novelty of the concept is\nenough to allow it to pass. Plus Burton gets points for shoehorning in the\nfantastically cheesy Joker line (that would later be his tell to an older\nMichael Keaton Batman), \"You ever dance with the devil in the pale moonlight?\"\nBruce Wayne's parents die in \"Batman: Arkham Origins.\" Bruce Wayne's parents\ndie in \"Batman: Arkham Origins.\" **3\\. Batman: Arkham Origins (2013)** This is\nthe first time a bat-vehicle gives the audience a little credit and refuses to\noverexplain the Wayne family scene. True, it's a commercial for a video game,\nbut it still worked.A tight shot on Bruce's face keeps the aging billionaire\nfront and center. Starting with an implied gun blast, we can only see little\nBruce in the frame, cut from the shot are the Wayne elders. The closeup of\nBruce's face changes from horrified boy to an increasingly intense and angry\nman, slowly Batman emerges. It lacks nuance but packs an emotional wallop\nthanks to the instincts of designers and animators at Blur Studio, led by\n\"Deadpool\" director Tim Miller.**2\\. Batman: The Animated Series -- “Dreams in\nDarkness,” (1992)** Crime Alley becomes a pop-art expressionist vision in an\noutstanding animated nightmare. Caught in the Scarecrow’s plan to poison\nGotham’s water supply -- a plot that prefigures director Christopher Nolan's\nbeloved, \"Batman Begins\" -- the Caped Crusader snorts a lungful of terror gas.\nConfined to Arkham, Bruce endures a hallucination of Martha and Thomas\nstrolling into a tunnel. That structure becomes the blood-filled barrel of a\npistol that soon fires horror full bore into Batman's face. No other\nvisualization of the memory even comes close.Bruce Wayne's parent's die in\n\"Batman Begins.\" Gus Lewis is Young Bruce Wayne, Lunus Roache is Thomas Wayne\nand Sara Stewart is Martha Wayne.Bruce Wayne's parent's die in \"Batman\nBegins.\" Gus Lewis is Young Bruce Wayne, Lunus Roache is Thomas Wayne and Sara\nStewart is Martha Wayne.**1\\. Batman Begins (2005)**Nolan nails it. In his\nfirst Batman story, the director classes up the scene by swapping opera for\nmovie theater. Nolan and cowriter David Goyer envision Thomas Wayne as an\ninvested parent attentive to his surroundings and brave enough to face danger\nhead-on. Nolan uses young Bruce’s fears, established in prior scenes and\ntriggered by the opera, to motivate the family’s late-night walk.The Waynes\nweren't merely wandering the alleys of Gotham, baby Bruce was scared so they\nleft the theater to avoid a scene and calm their son. Excellent fodder for an\nolder Batman who will blame their deaths on his inability to cope with his\nfear.\n\n","title":"The many deaths of Bruce Wayne's parents, ranked - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"The many deaths of Bruce Wayne's parents, ranked https://t.co/Vk3jaMB7Ci https://t.co/RpfoFEgQ91","date":"Fri Apr 01 20:30:25 +0000 2016","favs":40,"id":{"$numberLong":"715999780720222209"},"retweets":46},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1Y4reBC"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc566"},"content":"Riding a rebellion fueled by opposition to illegal immigration and pessimism\nabout the nation's future, Donald Trump leads a scrambling duo of competitors\nless than three months before California's Republican presidential primary, a\nnew USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times statewide poll has found.Yet the party\nwhose nomination he is seeking has fractured because of his candidacy, with\nominous prospects for Republicans if the New York businessman emerges\nvictorious after the party's summer convention.A quarter of California\nRepublican voters polled said they would refuse to vote for Trump in November\nif he is the party's nominee. Almost one-third of those backing Trump's\nleading competitor, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, said they would not cast a ballot for\nTrump. Voters who back Trump, meanwhile, are critical of Cruz, with only half\nholding a favorable impression of him.That division sets up the potential of\ncascading losses down the ballot for Republicans already fighting the tide in\none of the nation's most Democratic states, including in a number of contested\ncongressional districts.Every day there's a new development in what pollster\nRandall Gutermuth calls this “hold your nose” presidential election. One day\nDonald Trump and Ted Cruz are beating each other up over policies; the next\nday they're exchanging blows over their wives. The Democrats, for once, seem\nmild-mannered...Every day there's a new development in what pollster Randall\nGutermuth calls this “hold your nose” presidential election. One day Donald\nTrump and Ted Cruz are beating each other up over policies; the next day\nthey're exchanging blows over their wives. The Democrats, for once, seem mild-\nmannered...Trump, passionately supported and deeply reviled in different\ncorners of the electorate, has extended his reach among Republicans since the\nlast USC/Los Angeles Times poll was taken in September. He now has the support\nof 37% of GOP voters surveyed, up from 24%.Cruz, who was in single digits in\nthe last poll behind candidates who have since left the race, is now at 30%.\nThe third candidate, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, was invisible last September and\nis now at 12%.But among the voters most likely to turn out, the poll shows the\nrace between Trump and Cruz is nearly tied, with Trump at 36% versus Cruz at\n35%. The difference illustrates how a low turnout in the June 7 primary could\nhurt Trump and boost Cruz.See the results of the most recent USC Dornsife/Los\nAngeles Times statewide public opinion polls about the June 7 presidential\nprimary and how national and state politicians are viewed in California. See\nthe results of the most recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times statewide public\nopinion polls about the June 7 presidential primary and how national and state\npoliticians are viewed in California. How many Californians will turn out\nremains hard to predict because the state has not seen a fully contested June\nRepublican primary since 1964. Also hard to predict is how the overall support\nfor the top candidates will translate into delegates to the Republican\nnominating convention this summer. The state's GOP awards delegates to the\nwinner of each congressional district, so a candidate could lose statewide but\nstill pick up a significant number of delegates.The poll shows Trump leading\nin most areas of the state except the Central Valley, where conservative\nvoters put Cruz ahead. In Los Angeles County, the two are nearly tied.But the\ncontroversial Trump clearly has commanded wide swaths of his party in\nCalifornia. The survey showed him leading among college graduates and those\nwithout college degrees, and among almost all ranges of income. There was no\ndistinction between the level of support from men and women, despite Trump's\nwell-publicized tirades against women like Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly.His\nsupport draws on voters like Teresa Sumter, who lives in the Modesto\nsuburbs.“I don't believe the politicians anymore, and he's not really a\npolitician,” said Sumter, who is 60 and runs a surgical cleaning crew at a\nhospital. “I like what he says.”Sumter said she had never really cared for\nTrump before this campaign, figuring him as simply a “rich man.” That has\nchanged.“He thinks like we do,” she said, listing illegal immigration as one\nof her prime issues.“He tells it like it is,” she added. “I don't think he's\nlying to us.”Trump's views on immigration are one of the pillars of his\ncandidacy, but the subject also accounts for a serious party fissure in\nCalifornia, where fallout from the 1994 fight over an anti-illegal-immigration\nmeasure has contributed greatly to the GOP's shrinking presence.Among those in\nthe poll who said illegal immigration was a “crisis” in California, Trump won\n48% of the vote, to Cruz's 29% and Kasich's 8%. Among voters less concerned\nabout illegal immigration, Trump's level of support fell to the point that he\nwon only 27% of those who didn't consider it a problem.About 3 in 5 Trump\nsupporters polled felt illegal immigration was at crisis levels, and 90%\ndescribed it as either a crisis or a major problem. That sets Trump's backers\napart from California's voters as a whole, of whom only 23% said they saw a\ncrisis. Among California's registered Republicans, 44% said they saw illegal\nimmigration as a crisis.Trump's backers also diverge from the rest of the\nstate on the solutions they seek. Just over half of Trump voters polled said\nthose in the country illegally should be deported, the position their\ncandidate has espoused since he entered the race. An additional 28% of his\nsupporters said those immigrants should have a path to citizenship, and 14%\nfavored a narrower right to work legally in the U.S.Among all Republicans in\nthe poll, only a third backed deportations and 2 in 5 favored a path to\ncitizenship.Californians as a whole rejected deportations decisively, with\nonly 16% backing that course and two-thirds favoring a right to citizenship\nfor those currently living here illegally.Only 3 in 5 Republicans said they\nagreed with Trump's views on immigration, which besides mass deportations\ninclude the construction of a giant wall along the nation's southern border.\nOne in five Republicans said they strongly disagreed with his\npositions.Similarly, among Trump voters, 69% approved of his proposal for a\nban on travel to the U.S. by Muslims. That view was shared by only 44% of\nRepublicans overall, and by only 22% of Californians polled. Even among\nsupporters of Cruz, who has suggested similar restrictions on Muslim travel,\nonly 42% said they backed Trump's plans.A starkly negative assessment of the\neconomy and, more broadly, the future, also marked Trump voters.Among those\nwho think the nation's best years are behind it, Trump carried 40% of\nRepublicans, to 26% for Cruz. Among those more optimistic about the country,\nthe two were tied at 36%.All told, only 13% of Trump voters felt that the\nstate was headed in the right direction, whereas Californians overall were\nsplit. Cruz voters were similarly negative, but Kasich's supporters were more\nupbeat.The impact of those views extended to a hypothetical general election\nmatchup between Trump and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Trump\nreceived support from only 9% of those who thought the state was doing well,\nbut 50% of those who thought it was doing poorly. (Clinton easily defeated\nTrump and Cruz; Kasich did better but still fell to the Democrat by 19\npoints.)The breadth of Trump's success in California so far — he led almost\nall major GOP subgroups except for tea party adherents and those younger than\n50, both of which sided with Cruz — suggests he has captured the electorate's\nfancy not solely because of his policy positions but because of his attitude,\npollster Randall Gutermuth said.“In some ways, it's as much stylistic as it is\ndemographic,” said Gutermuth, of the Republican polling firm American\nViewpoint, which along with Democratic firm Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research\nconducted the poll for the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences\nand the Los Angeles Times.When Republicans were asked what kind of\npresidential candidate they wanted, three categories explained the success of\nthe antagonistic outsider profile that Trump has taken on.One in five voters\nsaid their top priority was a candidate who would represent change; an\nadditional 15% wanted one who would tell it like it is, and 11% wanted someone\nfree of the influence of special interests. In those categories, Trump was far\nand away the leader. Among those who wanted a blunt-talking candidate, for\nexample, Trump carried 64%, compared with 10% for Cruz and 9% for Kasich.But\nTrump's attitude — and his denigration of Mexicans, Muslims, women, the\ndisabled, even prisoners of war — has exacted a price that hurts him in a\ngeneral election and may yet hobble him in the primary.Overall, about three-\nquarters of California voters polled had an unfavorable view of Trump, an eye-\nopening level for a front-runner. Even among Republicans, only 51% had a\nfavorable impression of Trump, while 43% had an unfavorable view.And the\nunfavorable views were expressed with vehemence. Two-thirds of nonpartisan\nvoters, who are essential to any chance of success for a member of the\nRepublican minority in California, had a “very unfavorable” view of Trump.\nSeventy-seven percent of Latinos, 74% of those under age 50, 67% of women, 61%\nof men, and more than 3 in 5 voters of all education and income ranks had a\nvery negative view of him.“He's an egomaniac who does very stupid things,”\nBarry Kolom, a Los Angeles optometrist, said of Trump. “He shoots from the\nhip; he has no filters. I just think he's a loose cannon.”Cruz, Kolom said, is\n“more consistently conservative” and is his default candidate against\nTrump.Here is the methodology statement for the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times\npoll.Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, in conjunction with American\nViewpoint, conducted this survey on behalf of the University of Southern\nCalifornia Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles\nTimes....Here is the methodology statement for the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles\nTimes poll.Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, in conjunction with American\nViewpoint, conducted this survey on behalf of the University of Southern\nCalifornia Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles\nTimes....“Unfortunately,” he said, “a lot of people believe that if you are\nwealthy, you have to be smart, and that's definitely not the case....\nHonestly, I think he's pathetic.”Views like that make Republican leaders\nshudder as they ponder the impact Trump's presence at the top of the ticket\ncould have on down-ballot races. Those fears are real, according to the poll.\nAlmost one-third of voters who described themselves as traditional Republicans\nsaid they would refuse to vote for Trump in November, as did 17% of tea party\nRepublicans.One in 5 Republicans said they would vote for Clinton over Trump\nin a general election matchup. Fewer would cross the aisle if Cruz or Kasich\nwere nominated.The poll contacted 1,503 registered voters in California\nbetween March 16 and March 23. The sampling error for all voters is 2.8 points\nin either direction; the margin of error for Republican voters is 5.5 points\nin either direction._cathleen.decker@latimes.com__**F****ollow me on Twitter:\n****@cathleendecker.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc567"},"content":"With his bravura introduction of the Tesla Motors Model 3 on Thursday, company\nfounder Elon Musk cemented his reputation as the business world's most\noutstanding showman since Steve Jobs.Musk had auto industry experts,\ninvestment analysts and would-be buyers of the ostensibly mass-market $35,000\nelectric vehicle slavering over the car's design and specs — and the company's\nfuture —in part by announcing that as of Friday, at least 180,000 potential\ncustomers already had plunked down deposits of $1,000 each to reserve the\ncar.Tesla shares, which may rank as Musk's most creative product, opened\nFriday at $244.82, up 6.5% from Thursday's close (though it had given up about\nhalf of that gain by midday). Friday's action followed a mind-bending 60% run-\nup dating back to Feb. 10, when Tesla posted a disappointing loss but Musk\nsomehow charmed investors into accepting his promise of profits to come soon\nand his optimism about the coming unveiling of the Model 3.They should all\ntake a deep breath.First of all, the Model 3 doesn't exist yet, neither in a\nfinal production version or actually in production. Nor will it be reaching\nthe road any time soon. During the introductory event Thursday, Musk said he\nfelt \"fairly confident\" that deliveries would start by the end of 2017. But no\nguarantees.If the Model 3 misses its deadline, it wouldn't be the first Tesla\nproduct to do so. As my colleague Charles Fleming has reported, \"Tesla's\nexotic 'falcon wing' Model X had production difficulties that delayed its\ndelivery more than 18 months.\"That was an $80,000 car on a limited production\nschedule; the Model 3 is pitched as a mass-market car helping to fulfill the\ncompany's production goal of 500,000 vehicles per year by 2020.The Model 3\nembodies Tesla's greatest potential, and also a mortal risk. Nevertheless,\nTesla admirers were quick to proclaim the Model 3 a triumph. \"The world will\nnever be the same,\" declared technology blog BGR.com. Even staid Bloomberg\nconcluded that \"Tesla's Model 3 lives up to the hype.\" Perhaps the most wildly\noptimistic judgment came from venture investor David Pakman of Venrock, who\ncalculated in a tweet Friday that based on 200,000 pre-orders, if 70% actually\nbuy the car, Tesla \"sold $4.9B of cars in the last 24 hours.\"Well, no. Those\n$1,000 deposits are refundable at the customer's demand at any time before the\ncars actually go into production. They're not sales by any stretch of the\nimagination, just refundable reservation fees. If anything, they're callable-\non-demand interest-free loans, which is how Tesla books such arrangements in\nits financial reports, under \"liabilities.\"There are lots of other under-\nappreciated issues swirling around Tesla in general and the Model 3 in\nparticular. Here's a rundown of some of the most important. **1\\. Musk's\nclaims about the Model 3's performance and specification may be merely\naspirational.** The entrepreneur says the Model 3 will have an EPA-rated range\nof 215 miles on a charge, will go from 0-60 mph in a snappy less than six\nseconds (\"We don't make slow cars,\" Musk told his invitation-only audience),\nwill come with autopilot and quick-charging capabilities as standard equipment\nand will seat five people comfortably.Many observers accepted these as\nestablished specifications, but of course the car is still in development,\nwhich means they may be goals, not achievements. The production model may fall\nshort or, if Musk insists on the plans being met, get delayed until they can\nbe.  **Join the conversation on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;****2\\. Previous Tesla models\nhave been plagued with quality problems.** Auto aficionados were swept away by\nthe Model 3 prototypes' styling, but there have been gaps — gulfs, even —\nbetween the design and styles of Tesla's previous production cars and their\nability to hold together in the real world. Consumer Reports stated last year\nthat the company's $70,000 Model S was showing \"a worse-than-average overall\nproblem rate,\" and identified the main problem areas as its \"drivetrain, power\nequipment, charging equipment, giant iPad-like center console, and body and\nsunroof squeaks, rattles, and leaks.\" Some features even got worse in the 2015\nmodel compared to 2014, including \"the climate control, steering, and\nsuspension systems.\" The publication noted that \"complaints about the drive\nsystem have also increased as the cars have aged — specifically for the 2013\nmodel, which was the car’s first full model year.\" Complaints about the\nvehicle's drive units have become legion; the Teslarati fan website in\nNovember reported a poll showing that of Model S owners who had their drive\nunits replaced — in many cases because of proactive action by the manufacturer\n— 20% required multiple replacements. Edmunds.com wrapped up its experience\nwith these ailments in a 2014 road report.**3\\. Customers may not be eligible\nfor tax credits.** Among the forces behind the acceptance of electric cars are\ngovernment credits, including an IRS credit of up to $7,500  for Tesla\nvehicles such as the Model 3. The problem is that those credits start to\ndisappear once a manufacturer has delivered 200,000 electric vehicles. That\nmay well happen before the first Model 3's are placed in customers' hands;\ngiven Tesla's production forecasts for its Model X and Model S luxury cars,\nit's almost certain to happen very soon after Model 3 deliveries start. So\ncalculations that the real list price of the new car is a competitive $27,500\nrather than $35,000 may be way off.  That's important because ...**4\\.\nCompeting all-electric vehicles will be reaching the market before the Model\n3. **Musk and his Tesla evangelism deserve some credit for promoting the\nelectric car as a potential set of wheels for mainstream buyers. But this was\nmore relevant years ago, before legacy American carmakers caught the EV bug.\nGM, for instance, is poised to start delivering its all-electric Chevy Bolt by\nthe end of this year, with a rated range of more than 200 miles. The Bolt will\nlist at $30,000 after the tax credit, which makes it look a tad more expensive\nthan the Model 3. But according to GM, it will be on the market at least a\nyear earlier. **5\\. Tesla's financial health is questionable.** The biggest\nsingle question about the Model 3 is whether its manufacturer will last long\nenough to get the car to market? In strictly financial terms, Tesla Motors\noperates on the dollar equivalent of fumes. Its last quarterly report,\nreleased Feb. 10 for the three months ended Dec. 31, marked its eleventh\nstraight quarter of losses, and widening losses at that. Investors had been\nexpecting, finally, a profitable quarter. Nevertheless, they bid up the stock\nthe next day, based largely on Musk's infectious optimism. The extent to which\nTesla's stock price rides on faith in Musk's vision and operational skills\nrather than on profit-and-loss statements can be seen from its extraordinarily\nvolatile stock chart.A hard look at Tesla's underlying financials shows the\ncompany to be an investment only for those with strong stomachs. According to\nits annual report, Tesla roared through its cash last year to the tune of more\nthan $700 million, leaving it with less than $1.2 billion cash on hand when\nMusk was projecting $1.5 billion in capital expenditures on the horizon.As is\nshown by the analysts' face-off above, broadcast by CNBC on March 28, anyone\nexpecting Tesla to survive must place great faith in its ability to ramp up\nproduction of the Model 3 without cannibalizing sales and leases of its more\nexpensive luxury models. Analyst Colin Langan of UBS, a Tesla bear, argues\nthat the run-up in shares since early February encompassed \"a lot of bullish\nexpectations for the Model 3 that I don't know the stock will live up to.\"\n(His price target is $120, a roughly 50% drop from here.)Musk's production\nforecast, he notes, implies a pace that would put Tesla on the same level as\nBMW and Mercedes. \"That's a pretty high bar for them to reach, and meanwhile\nthere's a lot of competition.\"****See the most-read stories this hour\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;****It's plain that Tesla will have to dredge up new financing\nsometime soon. If its shares remain at their current lofty valuation, the\ncompany would have an easier time floating a new stock offering to raise\nmoney. But Tesla is perched on a tightrope. If something goes wrong — whether\na production pothole or a sudden cooling of investor faith in Musk's story\n—the company doesn't have much of a financial cushion.Still, what's clear from\nthe carnival-level excitement generated by the unveiling of the Model 3 this\nweek is that Tesla hype is a potent force. It may not matter that the product\ncausing all the excitement is, at this moment, largely virtual. As Edward\nNiedermeyer of the Daily Beast observes: \"Of course, nobody lines up to buy\nany product they’ve never seen before out of pure reason.\" **Keep up to date\nwith Michael Hiltzik.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc568"},"content":"As two Los Angeles police officers wrestled with a vandalism suspect, one\ngrabbed her Taser and pressed the stun gun against the 38-year-old man's\nbody.The device was supposed to deliver a jolt strong enough to stun him so\nthe officers could take him into custody. But the Taser had no effect, police\nsaid.Instead, the LAPD said, the man snatched the stun gun from the officer\nand shocked her in the leg, leaving her unable to move. Her partner then\nopened fire, fatally shooting the man, Neil Peter White, in the back of the\nneck.**See more of our top stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**White's killing last\nyear illustrates a troubling weakness with a weapon meant to play a key role\nin the LAPD's efforts to reduce the number of police shootings: Tasers often\ndon't work.A Times review of department statements and reports found that\nnearly a quarter of the people shot by on-duty LAPD officers last year — at\nleast eight of 36 — were wounded or killed during encounters in which officers\nsaid they tried to use a Taser without success. Among the incidents:Other\nencounters where officers didn't shoot their guns also showed the limitations\nof the weapon. LAPD officers fired Tasers just over 1,100 times last year,\naccording to a department report published last month. The devices had the\ndesired outcome — causing someone to submit to arrest — only 53% of the\ntime.\"I find that figure very disappointing,\" said Capt. John McMahon, whose\noffice compiled the report.Taser spokesman Steve Tuttle defended the stun gun,\nsaying police are trained to understand that they may need to use a Taser\nmultiple times \"because the first shot may not work.\"Tuttle said it was more\nimportant to look at whether using a Taser ultimately helped officers make an\narrest, regardless of how many times the device was activated.It's not always\nimmediately clear why a Taser wasn't effective.Some people have tugged the\nmetal probes from their bodies, rendering the device useless. Mental illness\nor drug use can also influence how a person reacts to the shock. Sometimes the\nfault lies with officers who don't use them properly. LAPD officials are also\nexploring whether a new Taser model was a factor.McMahon said the department\nis taking a close look at each case in hopes of better understanding what\nhappened.The captain, along with policing experts and the Taser spokesman,\nstressed the devices still provide officers with an important alternative to\nusing their firearms and have helped reduce injuries to civilians and\nofficers. But officers have noticed the problems, and experts warn that the\nongoing concerns could prompt police to go for their guns instead of their\nTasers.The findings come as the LAPD looks to vastly expand the number of\nTasers available to officers, part of a broader push by the department and\nPolice Commission to emphasize so-called de-escalation strategies. In\nSeptember, LAPD brass ordered field officers to carry the devices on their\nholsters unless they weren't available.But stories of Taser problems have\nspread through the LAPD ranks, leaving some officers wondering whether the\nstun guns will do their job when they're needed.Officer J.C. Duarte knows from\nexperience. Duarte, who has spent more than three decades with the LAPD,\nrecalled an encounter some 25 years ago, when he pulled the trigger on an\nolder-model Taser, hoping to prevent a physical fight. The Taser didn't work.\nDuarte grabbed his baton instead.Duarte said he still carries a Taser because\nit can help him avoid a fight. When it works, he said, \"it works\nbeautifully.\"But, he said, the thought of that troublesome Taser decades ago\nstill lingers.\"Whenever I have it, I say, 'I hope that thing works,'\" Duarte\nsaid. \"I've had dreams where I pulled the trigger and nothing happens.\"LAPD\nChief Charlie Beck said he is concerned by the number of shootings where\nofficers struggled with their Tasers, and he said the department would look\nfor ways to improve the overall effectiveness. But, he cautioned, like any\ndevice used by police, Tasers \"don't work in all dynamic instances.\"\"It's a\ngreat tool, but is it a magic device that eliminates the need for all other\napplications of force?\" Beck said. \"No, absolutely not.\"Tasers date to the\n1960s, when a NASA physicist thought police needed a weapon for emergencies\nwhen a gun could be particularly dangerous, like airplane hijackings. Jack\nCover named his stun gun after the hero in a popular science fiction series.\n(TASER stands for \"Thomas A. Swift's electric rifle.\")Tasers can be used in\ntwo ways. Officers can fire two electrified darts from several feet away,\ndelivering a sharp shock that freezes someone's muscles and temporarily\nincapacitates them. They can also use Tasers in \"drive-stun mode,\" where the\ndevice is pressed directly against someone's skin and creates pain to gain\ncompliance.Police agencies across the country have embraced the devices,\nsaying they offer officers more space and time to take someone into custody\nwithout having to use their firearms. Charles \"Sid\" Heal, a retired Los\nAngeles County sheriff's commander and expert on less-lethal weapons, said any\ntime cops can make an arrest using a Taser instead of a gun, it should be\nconsidered a \"save\" — even if it takes several attempts for the Tasers to do\nthe job.\"We know their shortcomings,\" Heal said, \"but it's better than the\nalternative.\"Heal cautioned, however, that if officers have more problems with\ntheir Tasers, they may be less likely to use them and could instead go for\ntheir guns more quickly.\"It's going to create a predisposition that you're\nexpecting a Taser failure,\" Heal said. \"'I'm not going to risk my life for a\n50% success rate.'\"LAPD officers used Tasers in more encounters in 2015 than\nin previous years, according to a sweeping use-of-force analysis the\ndepartment published last month. Officers used Tasers in 519 incidents, up 100\nfrom the year before.The number of activations also jumped. Officers pulled\nthe triggers on their Tasers 1,101 times in 2015, about 280 more times than\nthe year before, the report said. Last year's effectiveness rate of 53% marked\na significant drop compared with recent years, when it ranged from 60% to\n65%.Experts said there are a variety of factors that can influence whether a\nTaser works as desired. Baggy clothing or sudden movement can rip the wires\naway. The drive-stun mode may not have the same effect on some people,\nparticularly those who are under the influence of drugs or who are mentally\nill. The LAPD's report did not specify how often the device was used in drive-\nstun mode.Most of the shootings by LAPD officers last year remain under\ninvestigation. Some of those cases, however, have been completed and reviewed\nby the Police Commission, offering more detail as to why police believe\nofficers had problems using their Tasers.During the skid row encounter,\nMcMahon said, the officer fired the Taser's probes at Charly Keunang, hitting\nthe man known as Africa in the ideal location: his abdomen and torso. But an\nautopsy showed the probes never pierced his skin. Instead, McMahon said,\nKeunang spun and was able to pull the wires from his clothing.\"The spinning\nmotion was able to defeat the objective of the Taser,\" McMahon said.Dan\nStormer, an attorney representing Keunang's family in their wrongful death\nlawsuit, was skeptical that the problems with Tasers are so widespread. He\nsaid he believed officers blame the devices when explaining later why they\nfired their guns.\"I think it is often used as an excuse for police officers\nwho become panicked and go to lethal force rather than wait for the Taser,\" he\nsaid.Earlier in the year, officers went to an Arleta home after a woman called\npolice, warning that her 40-year-old brother, who suffered from schizophrenia,\nwas threatening suicide. The officers found Alvin Pinwatana in a bathroom,\npolice said, covered in blood and holding a butcher knife.As Pinwatana moved\ntoward police, one officer fired his Taser, according to an internal LAPD\nreport. Another shot his gun, wounding Pinwatana in the shoulder.Pinwatana\nfell to the floor, the report said, but began to stand as soon as the Taser\nstopped. The officer pulled the Taser's trigger a second time. Pinwatana stood\nand kept moving toward police.\"It's not working correctly,\" the officer\nrecalled.The officer ultimately activated the Taser four times before police\nwere able to take Pinwatana into custody, the report said.McMahon said it's\nunclear why the Taser didn't work on Pinwatana.In another case, an officer\ntried to fire a Taser at a suicidal man who charged police while holding two\nkitchen knives, but the officer couldn't disengage the safety switch. A second\nofficer then opened fire, fatally shooting the man, according to an LAPD\nreport.That case, McMahon said, was an example of \"operator error.\" The LAPD\ndid not count the incident as an ineffective use of the Taser because the\ndevice was never fired.The family of a Mexican man who died after he was\nshocked with a Taser and hit by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents has\nasked an international panel to consider whether his human rights were\nviolated.The family of Anastasio Hernandez-Rojas, who died of a heart attack\ndays after a confrontation...The family of a Mexican man who died after he was\nshocked with a Taser and hit by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents has\nasked an international panel to consider whether his human rights were\nviolated.The family of Anastasio Hernandez-Rojas, who died of a heart attack\ndays after a confrontation...The drop in overall effectiveness, McMahon said,\nalso coincided with the department's switch to a newer Taser model. The\ndepartment's recent force report does not compare the effectiveness of the two\nmodels. McMahon said LAPD officials were working with the manufacturer,\nArizona-based Taser International, to evaluate the new X26P device and look\nfor any improvements.Tuttle, the Taser spokesman, said, he had no concerns\nabout the new model. He said the LAPD’s numbers were important to have, but\n“disingenuous.”“It’s great to keep track of that … hey, it may take more than\none cycle to get that person under control,” he said in a phone interview,\nwhile zapping a Taser in the background. “But ultimately we would call that\nsuccess because you didn’t have to go to a higher level of force. The Taser\naccomplished its mission.”McMahon wasn’t convinced. “That’s something we would\nrather avoid,” he said. “Ideally, a Taser would be effective the first\ntime.”**Twitter: @katemather****ALSO****Open-air urinal in San Francisco park\nhas no designs on privacy****On campuses across the country, students are\nstanding up for Donald Trump****What's the California Supreme Court thinking?\nOne justice gives us a clue**\n\n","title":"One of the LAPD's preferred weapons to help officers avoid shootings often doesn't work - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"The LAPD uses Tasers to help officers avoid shootings.

Other communities\nand institutions across the country are wrestling with the potential threat\nfrom more than 400,000 private and commercial drones now registered to operate\nin the skies.Under the law, hobbyists and commercial users must keep unmanned\naircraft below 400 feet and avoid flying within five miles of an airport to\navoid endangering manned aircraft. With a maximum weight of 55 pounds, even a\nrecreational drone could disable a jet flying hundreds of miles per hour.The\npilot of a commercial jetliner said his plane nearly collided with a drone\nwhile approaching Los Angeles International Airport on Friday afternoon,\nsparking a search by L.A. police and sheriff's officials for the owner of the\nunmanned aircraft.The near-miss was reported before 2 p.m. about...The pilot\nof a commercial jetliner said his plane nearly collided with a drone while\napproaching Los Angeles International Airport on Friday afternoon, sparking a\nsearch by L.A. police and sheriff's officials for the owner of the unmanned\naircraft.The near-miss was reported before 2 p.m. about...“Introduction of\nunmanned aircraft into America’s airspace must take place incrementally and\nwith the interest of safety first,” said Laura J. Brown, spokeswoman for the\nFederal Aviation Administration.But some drone operators regularly ignore or\nflout the law.Pilots reported 238 sightings of drones in 2014, the first year\nsuch sightings were tracked, according to the FAA. Drone sightings jumped to\n583 – or nearly 100 per month – in the six months between August 2015 and\nJanuary 2016, the FAA’s most recent records show.On Jan. 15, for example,\nCompass Airlines reported a near collision with a black-and-silver drone at\n5,700 feet as the passenger jet came in for a landing at Los Angeles\nInternational Airport.**See more of our top stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**A\nday earlier, a pilot in a single-engine Cessna spotted a blue drone hovering\nat 9,500 feet above Riverside. That same week, a pilot landing at El Cajon\nreported three drones off his right side at about 500 feet in altitude -- one\nwith yellow lights, one with green lights, and one with red lights.The U.S.\nForest Service says drones interfered with firefighting aircraft about 25\ntimes last year, often forcing the planes to be diverted from fast-moving\nwildfires.Law enforcement and national security officials worry that small\ndrones could carry explosives, chemical agents or other potentially hazardous\nmaterial over sensitive facilities.The risk hit the headlines in January 2015\nwhen a 2-foot-by-2-foot quadcopter crashed on the South Lawn of the White\nHouse at about 3 a.m., triggering a Secret Service lockdown of the compound.\nPresident Obama and the first lady were overseas, but their two daughters were\nhome.Four-time defending overall World Cup slalom ski champion Marcel Hirscher\nwas extremely lucky to avoid being hit by a camera drone that crashed just\nbehind him as he was racing on an Alpine course in Italy on Tuesday night.The\ninternational ski federation, known as FIS, took swift action Wednesday\n...Four-time defending overall World Cup slalom ski champion Marcel Hirscher\nwas extremely lucky to avoid being hit by a camera drone that crashed just\nbehind him as he was racing on an Alpine course in Italy on Tuesday night.The\ninternational ski federation, known as FIS, took swift action Wednesday...The\nrecreational drone, called a DJI Phantom, posed no danger. But it had evaded\nradar that is calibrated to detect much bigger threats, like an airplane or a\nmissile.The Justice Department ultimately decided not to charge the drone's\noperator, a federal employee. He had lost control of the device several blocks\naway earlier in the evening and did not intend to fly it near the White House,\nofficials said.Late one night in October, a much smaller quadcopter crashed\nnear the Washington Monument, behind the White House. In that case, U.S. Park\nPolice issued the owner an $85 citation for operating an unmanned aircraft in\na restricted zone.To help identify drones, the FAA requires owners to register\ntheir aircraft in a federal database before they fly it outdoors. Since the\nregistry went live in late December, more than 406,000 people have registered.\nThat compares to about 590,000 pilots licensed by the FAA to fly manned\naircraft.**NEWSLETTER: Get the day's top headlines from Times Editor Davan\nMaharaj \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**People who do not register their drones could face a civil\npenalty of up to $27,500 or criminal penalties of up to $250,000 and three\nyears in prison for noncompliance.Off-the-shelf drones are difficult to detect\nand monitor because they fly low and slow, and don’t carry a radio transponder\nto signal their position. Most drones are made primarily of plastic and are\ntoo small for radar detection.Drones are banned from flying above most\nstadiums hosting concerts or sporting events. The FAA advises against flying\ndrones over what it calls critical infrastructure, including power plants,\nprisons and office buildings, but it is not illegal.A man who flew a drone\nnear an LAPD helicopter during a manhunt in Hollywood has to turn over the\ndrone and promise not to fly another one for at least the next three years,\nthe Los Angeles city attorney’s office announced Wednesday.Martin Sheldon, 57,\npleaded no contest Wednesday to obstructing...A man who flew a drone near an\nLAPD helicopter during a manhunt in Hollywood has to turn over the drone and\npromise not to fly another one for at least the next three years, the Los\nAngeles city attorney’s office announced Wednesday.Martin Sheldon, 57, pleaded\nno contest Wednesday to obstructing...On March 16, the Senate Committee on\nCommerce, Science and Transportation approved a bill that would make the FAA\nthe nation’s sole regulator of drones. If signed into law, the bill would\nsupplant the patchwork of local and state drone laws that have popped up.Last\nyear, 45 states considered 168 bills meant to regulate use of drones,\naccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which documents\nstate laws. So far, 26 states have moved to limit police use of drones, bar\ndrone surveillance over private property, or impose other restrictions.In\nCalifornia, for example, it's illegal to use a drone to photograph or record\nfootage of a person or property without his or her consent. The legislation\nwas mostly meant to limit intrusions by celebrity-seeking photographers.Some\nmunicipalities have imposed their own rules.Poway, for instance, passed an\nordinance in September that prohibits drones within two miles of a wildfire or\nother public emergency – the first such ban in San Diego County – after drones\nhindered firefighting efforts. Violators can be fined $1,000 and face possible\njail time.General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc., which makes the\nPentagon’s MQ-1 Predator and MQ-9 Reaper missile-firing drones, is based in\nPoway.“There’s a great irony that one of the world’s largest drone\nmanufacturers is based here and is our largest employer,” Poway’s mayor, Steve\nVaus, said in a telephone interview. “But we wanted an enforceable ordinance\non the books to protect our first responders in the case of an\nemergency.”Authorities are looking for the pilot of a drone that flew into\npower lines Monday in West Hollywood and knocked out service to hundreds of\nSouthern California Edison customers, officials said.Witnesses reported seeing\na drone buzz into the wires lining Larrabee Street and Sunset Boulevard\nabout...Authorities are looking for the pilot of a drone that flew into power\nlines Monday in West Hollywood and knocked out service to hundreds of Southern\nCalifornia Edison customers, officials said.Witnesses reported seeing a drone\nbuzz into the wires lining Larrabee Street and Sunset Boulevard\nabout...Inevitably, the boom in drone sales has created a market for counter-\nmeasures, including devices intended to disable drones by jamming their\nsignals in midflight.DroneShield, based in Herndon, Va., builds sensors that\nit says can detect the unique audio signature of a drone in flight, and send\nan alert if drones fly near a stadium, prison or other restricted property.\nThe company says it has installed about 200 acoustic detection systems so\nfar.“The chance of drones being used in a way that endangers security and\nprivacy is increasing,” James Walker, chief executive of DroneShield, said in\na telephone interview. He said the company’s devices will be used during the\nBoston Marathon on April 18 to notify police if unauthorized drones fly near\nthe runners or spectators.Some individuals have taken more drastic\nmeasures.William “Willie” Merideth, a truck company owner in Hillview, Ky.,\nwas grilling dinner for his family on a warm Sunday evening in July when he\nsaw a small drone with a camera mounted on it pass near his property three\ntimes in half an hour, he said.He went inside and grabbed his Benelli shotgun\nand a few shells of birdshot. After the third blast, the drone fell into the\nwoods behind Merideth’s house.“We had no idea who owned it, what they were up\nto. Were they looking for stuff to steal? Were they stalking kids? You just\ndon’t know,” Merideth said in a telephone interview. “There was no other\nrecourse for me to stop them from coming over my property.”The drone’s owner\ncalled police, and Merideth was charged with felony wanton endangerment and\ncriminal mischief. In October, Bullitt County District Judge Rebecca S. Ward\ndismissed the charges, saying Merideth “had a right to shoot” the drone.The\nincident has made Merideth a folk hero in corners of the Internet where gun\nenthusiasts and privacy advocates meet.The Kentucky press dubbed him “the\ndrone slayer.” A banner on Merideth’s Facebook page reads: “Not only did I do\nit, but I meant to do it. And I’d do it again.”Merideth isn’t against private\ncitizens flying drones.“I think they’re neat. In fact, I’d like to have one,”\nhe said. “But they need to be used in the proper way.”The Pentagon takes a\nsimilar position. Its headquarters was a terrorist target on Sept. 11, 2001,\nis on the flight path to nearby Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and\nis the obvious focus of foreign surveillance.“We’re going to leverage every\ncapability we can to protect this building,” said Daniel P. Walsh, assistant\ndirector for security integration and technology at the Pentagon Force\nProtection Agency. “This is an emerging threat.”**ALSO****Elon Musk unveils\nTesla Model 3 to huge fanfare****Longtime marijuana use might make you a\nloser****These women in Turkey saw the need for a different kind of news,\ndespite the danger**\n\n","title":"They're 400,000 strong and the Pentagon sees them as an emerging threat - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"They're 400,000 strong and the Pentagon sees them as an emerging threat: https://t.co/x8QhiShZwO https://t.co/FqBZat9Esh","date":"Fri Apr 01 19:11:28 +0000 2016","favs":33,"id":{"$numberLong":"715979915934433280"},"retweets":46},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1RQxqMd"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc56a"},"content":"A growing number of states in India are imposing a new requirement on\ncandidates for local office: They must use a toilet.The western state of\nMaharashtra this week became the latest to pass a law requiring those running\nin municipal and village-level elections to present proof that they have\naccess to a working toilet. A total of five Indian states — with combined\npopulations of nearly 400 million people, or roughly one-third of the country\n— have enacted similar legislation over the past two years.That’s no small\ndemand in a country in which an estimated 40% of people — including more than\nhalf in rural areas — lack access to safe, functioning commodes, according to\nWaterAid, a charity. In much of rural India, most people still defecate in the\nopen due to a lack of toilets and widespread traditional beliefs that it is\nmore wholesome to go outdoors.Open defecation, however, has been linked to\nchronic diarrhea and other diseases that lead to stunted growth in children,\nas well as to violence against women who must leave their homes to relieve\nthemselves.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has launched a “Clean India”\ncampaign that aims to end open defecation and install 110 million toilets\nnationwide by 2019. Four of the five states that have introduced laws\nrequiring local political candidates to use toilets are led by Modi’s\nBharatiya Janata party.Kaliya Devi awakens at 4 a.m., fills a small bucket\nwith water and walks 10 minutes to farmland outside her village in northern\nIndia.

In the serene light of dawn, she finds a quiet, secluded spot\nto relieve herself.While she and her five children do without a basic human\nconvenience, a 10-foot-high...State officials say they want local\nofficeholders to serve as role models in following modern sanitation\npractices.“It is high time to have this basic amenity at home,” said\nMaharashtra’s chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, a Modi ally. “We are also\npromoting the Swachh Bharat [Clean India] campaign. We want to make each and\nevery village and city clean and garbage-free.”The bill Fadnavis initially\nproposed last fall would have required every local candidate to have a working\ntoilet at home. That prompted resistance from some opposition parties, which\nsaid it would disqualify many poor candidates as well as those living in urban\nareas who use shared public toilets.In Mumbai, India’s second-most populous\ncity and the largest in Maharashtra, one-third of municipal officeholders\nbelonging to the powerful Shiv Sena party reside in slums that have shared\ntoilets, said a party official, Anil Parab.The state government relented and\nthe law passed this week would allow people to contest elections if they\nproduced a certificate showing they had access to a functioning toilet.But an\nindependent state lawmaker, Kapil Patil, slammed the law as unconstitutional,\nsaying any Indian adult should be able to run for office without\nconditions.“Is it not insulting to submit such a letter before applying for\nthe candidature?” Patil said in an interview.“Where I go to attend nature’s\ncall cannot be anybody else’s business. The government’s responsibility is to\nprovide toilets to everyone. One cannot hold the candidate responsible for the\nlack of toilets in the state.”Some who support the effort to improve\nsanitation also criticized the law for driving a wedge between rural Indians\nand those living in urban areas, roughly 80% of whom have access to toilets,\naccording to WaterAid.“The bill polarizes the candidates between rich and\npoor,” said Kiran Pawaskar, an opposition state lawmaker. “The intent is good\nbut the law is bad.”Opponents of such legislation in other states have had\nmixed success. In February, the government in the northern state of Bihar,\nwhich is not allied with Modi, withdrew a law requiring candidates in local\nelections to have toilets in their homes, saying the state had fallen short of\nits promises to build more toilets.Last June, a court in the western state of\nGujarat, which is led by Modi’s party, rejected a challenge to a similar\npolicy, ruling that officeholders should serve as “role models” for\ncitizens.“The states have the flexibility to make their own policies and\nrules, and it’s good that they’re trying to work in that spirit,” said Nitya\nJacob, head of policy at WaterAid India. But Jacob said states should work\nharder on implementing the central government’s ambitious sanitation plans.The\nlaws “are more symbolic than anything else. It sends a message that this is\nimportant and you need to have a toilet.”Part of the problem, Jacob and others\nsay, is that while India has become better at building toilets, it has not had\nas much success getting people to use them. Many brand-new toilets lie unused\ndue to drought or a lack of piped water. In some areas, local officials have\nnot carried out adequate education campaigns to increase toilet use.The\ncultural barriers remain significant. In a recent paper, researchers Anurag\nBanerjee, Nilanjan Banik and Ashvika Dalmia used Indian demographic survey\ndata to rank 21 basic consumer goods in the order that Indian households would\nprefer to acquire them. According to their analysis, toilets ranked 12th --\nmeaning a poor family would buy a television, a pressure cooker or a\nmotorcycle before it acquired a toilet._Bengali is a Times staff writer and\nParth M.N. is a special correspondent._**Follow @SBengali on Twitter for more\nnews from South Asia**\n\n","title":"Running for election in India?

His heart had\nstopped beating and resuscitation attempts failed, a hospital spokesman said.\nHe was declared dead at 1:01 p.m.Gaye, considered by popular music critics the\npeer of Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson among male rhythm-and-blues stars,\nwas shot in an argument with the elder Gaye at the home in the 2100 block of\nSouth Gramercy Place.The elder Gaye was taken into custody on the front lawn\nof his home shortly after the shooting, and after several hours of questioning\nwas booked at Parker Center.Police Lt. Bob Martin said the singer became\ninvolved in a verbal dispute with his father Saturday night. The argument\nresumed Sunday morning and about noon there was \"some pushing and shoving\" in\nan upstairs hallway, Martin said.At that point Gaye's mother, Alberta, 69,\ninterceded in an effort to stop the fight, the detective said.Gaye Sr., a\nretried minister of the House of God Church, subsequently armed himself with a\nfive-shot, .38-caliber handgun, came back upstairs and opened fire on his son\nin the younger man's bedroom, Martin said.Martin said police arrived to find\nseveral neighbors gathered in the front yard and inside the house. A revolver\nbelieved to be the weapon used in the shooting was found in the front\nyard.Martin said the interior of the Victorian dwelling was in a somewhat\ndisordered state, and \"it was a little difficult to tell whether or not an\naltercation had occurred in there.\"Martin said interviews with members of the\nfamily and with neighbors indicated there had been considerable dissension\nbetween the two men in the past.\"As best we can tell, there has been some bad\nblood (between the father and the son),\" Martin said.Larkin Arnold, senior\nvice president of CBS Records, which produced Gaye's final recordings,\nexpressed shock at the singer's death.\"We are deeply saddened,\" he said.\n\"Marvin was one of the true musical geniuses of our time,\" Arnold said of the\nsoul singer, whose career, although it had had ups and downs, seemed to be on\nan upswing in recent months.By late afternoon, the crowd in front of the Gaye\nresidence—swelled by fans who had heard of the singer's death in radio news\nbulletins had to be restrained by police.Audrey Addison, who lives about a\nblock away, said she used to go by the house and talk to Gaye's mother on the\nporch.\"They were very nice people,\" she said, \"and good neighbors. I have\nnever heard any commotion there . . . people in the neighborhood just mind\ntheir own business.\"All seemed to agree that the Gaye household was a quiet\none.The singer's parents had lived in the two-story, brick-front home for 12\nyears. Some neighbors said Marvin had moved in with his parents when he\nreturned three years ago from a prolonged stay in Europe, but other family\nfriends said the singer \"just stayed there sometimes.\"In a recent interview,\nGaye said he did not really live anywhere in particular.\"I live nowhere,\" he\nsaid. \"Why should I have a country? Why should I have that boundary? The world\nis my country. I'm a gypsy. I belong everywhere. . . .\"It was a sample of pure\nGaye; he was an ego and he was an artist — and he gloried in both.\"I'm\negotistical,\" he said in a 1982 interview, \"I could lie and pretend that I'm\nvery humble but that's jive. You can't do what I'm doing and not have a big\nego to feed.\"Yet he considered himself a recluse:\"The world,\" he said\nrecently, \"isn't ready for the real Marvin Gaye.\"And he insisted on being\naccepted as an artist.\"I don't really care about money or business,\" he\nexplained. \"I'm an artist, not a commercialist. They want you to make albums\nall the time, but I can only work when I'm move to do it. After I've worked,\nit takes me a long time to replenish the energy I've used up.\"His style earned\nthe imprint of gospel singing, and it was both legitimate and ironic; Gaye's\nfirst solos were sung in the choir of his father's Washington, D.C., church\nwhen he was 3 years old.\"My family was real religious,\" he told an\ninterviewer. \"My daddy was a minister and so when I began to sing it was for\nhim, in church. Gospel? I was born in the middle of all that . . .\"His first\nprofessional experience came with a vocal group called the Moonglows, headed\nby Harvey Fuqua, with whom he traveled the R\u0026amp;B circuit in the late 1950s,\nbut he said it was not \"too satisfying. Like I said — I got a lot of ego.\"So\nafter a year or two, Gaye decided to try his luck as a soloist — and almost\nfrom the first, that luck was good.His travels took him to Detroit where he\nattended a party at which Motown Records founder Berry Gordy Jr. was also a\nguest.Gaye performed informally during the evening, Gordy liked it, asked him\nto \"come around the office\" the following day — and the rest of the story\nbecame almost too well-known to repeat.He worked for a while as a session\ndrummer for Motown, playing for several early hits by Smokey Robinson and the\nMiracles, but his destiny was as a vocalist and in 1962 his first bit hit,\n\"Stubborn Kind of Fellow,\" scored big on the R\u0026amp;B charts.Gaye followed it\nin 1963 with \"Hitch Hike\" and \"Pride and Joy,\" both major hits, the latter\nreaching the No. 1 sport, and kept going with a dozen more Top 40 songs.His\nnext year was even more impressive: solo successes such as \"You Are a\nWonderful One,\" \"Try It, Baby\" and \"Baby, Don't You Do It\" were matched by the\nsuccess of \"Can I Get a Witness.\" \"Once Upon a Time\" and \"What's the Matter\nWith You, Baby?\" in which he was teamed with Motown vocalist Mary Wells.This\nwas followed by such hits as \"How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You),\" \"I'll Be\nDoggone\" (with Smokey Robinson), \"One More Heartache,\" \"Ain't No Mountain High\nEnough,\" \"Ain't That Peculiar,\" \"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\" (the 1968\nhit that many considered his greatest single) and an album.He also showed\nskill as a composer, co-authoring \"Dancing in the Streets,\" and as a writer-\nproducer with the Originals, cutting \"Baby, I'm for Real\" in 1969.By the\nmid-'60s, many of Gaye's songs were beginning to show up on the national\ncharts and he also was fulfilling a strenuous schedule of personal appearances\non many college campuses and at major night spots.He was married for a time to\nAnna Gordy, Berry Gordy's sister, but this ended in divorce in 1976. Anna\nreceived $600,000 in royalties from Gaye who promptly used the incident as\ninspiration for \"Here My Dear,\" a 71-minute musical recounting of the breakup\nwhich generated far more gossip than sales.He said he also once tried to kill\nhimself by ingesting more than an ounce of pure cocaine while in Hawaii after\nthe breakup of a second marriage — to Janie Hunger. But he survived, and later\ntold friends he \"used it all, the bad stuff and the good, in the music.\"In\naddition to teaming with Mary Wells, Gaye also had singing partnerships with\nthree other women: Kim Weston, Diana Ross and Tami Terrell — who collapsed in\nhis arms on stage in 1967 and died three years later after a series of\noperations for a brain tumor.The late 1970s saw a brief decline in his\nfortunes and he declared bankruptcy at one point (just a jump ahead of the\nInternal Revenue Service, which said he owed $2 million in back taxes) and\nspent the end of the decade in self-imposed European exile.Other big hits from\nhis career that became soul standards included \"What's Goin' On\" and \"Mercy,\nMercy Me.\" Gaye won two Grammy Awards in 1983, one for the \"comeback\" hit\n\"Sexual Healing,\" which was the standout cut from the album \"Midnight Love.\"\nHe was nominated for another Grammy this year.\"You have to suffer to be an\nartist,\" he said in an interview with The Times last year. \"You can't write\nabout suffering in love if you haven't done it. And let me tell you — I've\ndone it!\"_Also contributing to this story were Times staff writers Penelope\nMcMillan, Dean Murphy and Marc Igler.__news.obits@latimes.com_ **MORE ARCHIVAL\nOBITUARIES**From the Archives: Beatles' music producer George Martin diesFrom\nthe Archives: David Bowie, transformative musician and multi-dimensional\nartist, dies at 69From the Archives: Sarah Bernhardt diesFrom the Archives:\nElizabeth Montgomery dies of cancerFrom the Archives: Bert Corona; labor\nactivist backed rights for undocumented workers\n\n","title":"From the Archives: Marvin Gaye, Top Soul Recording Artist, Shot - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"His songs like \"Sexual Healing,\" \"What's Goin On\" live on.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc56c"},"content":"Tell your friends you're making paella and they'll envision seafood and/or\nmeat on saffron-colored rice in a huge paella pan. But tell chef María José\nSan Román, a native of Alicante, in the rice-growing region of Valencia in\nsoutheastern Spain, and a different sort of rice dish comes to mind.\"Where I\ncome from, the paella that we make in homes is most often a rice dish made\nwith whatever produce is in season,\" says the co-owner and executive chef of\nthe Alicante-based restaurant group Grupo Gourmet that includes the renowned\nMichelin-starred restaurant Monastrell.San Román was speaking in January to a\ngroup of nutritionists and corporate and executive chefs of volume food-\nservice operations at the Worlds of Healthy Flavors leadership retreat in St.\nHelena, Calif., a conference organized by the Culinary Institute of America\nand the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health to help chefs with more\nhealthful food choices for their customers. To illustrate her point, she\ncooked an aromatic paella made with artichokes and mushrooms, garlic, olive\noil, saffron, mushroom broth and rice. Not a sausage or a piece of chicken, a\nshrimp or a mussel to be found. The chefs were impressed.There's no reason why\na vegetable version of this signature Valencian rice dish, which is named for\nthe wide, flat pan in which it is traditionally cooked, should not impress.\nVegetable paellas aren't the big production numbers that seafood and/or meat\npaellas tend to be, but the aromatic rice makes a great backdrop for produce.\nI let the farmers market inspire me and try to keep the number of different\nvegetables in each paella to a minimum, usually about three.The dish is really\nall about rice, olive oil, usually saffron (but not always) and broth.\nTraditionally, a short- or medium-grain rice is used for paella. It is sautéed\nin abundant olive oil before the addition of broth, which usually includes a\ngenerous pinch of saffron. The rice cooks — undisturbed — until it is dry and\nsticking to the bottom of the pan, where it forms a crispy golden layer that\nshould be scraped up with every serving. It should be chewy and slightly\nsticky. You can find imported Spanish rice for paella in specialty stores such\nas Surfas and gourmet groceries, but Arborio and domestic medium- and short-\ngrain rice work well too.These recipes call for saffron, which if it is true\nSpanish saffron, is an expensive ingredient. You can get away without it in\nthe mushroom and artichoke paella, as the yellow hue does not show through the\nstrong mushroom broth, although the flavor emerges. But you'll want that\nbeautiful color and flavor in the paella with turnips and peas. You will get\nthe most out of saffron if you infuse it in a little warm water before adding\nit to the rice.**Recipe: Paella with turnips, peas and spring onions** Great\nbig paellas made on a grill are fun, but if you're going to make one on the\nstove, you'll want to use a smaller pan no larger than 12 or 13 inches. When\nyou try to use the bigger pans on burners, no matter how often you rotate it\nand change its position, you end up with some rice that is underdone and some\nthat is scorched. Paella pans come in many sizes; I used a 13-inch for one of\nthese recipes and a 12-inch for another. You can also use a 12-inch\nskillet.One of these recipes was inspired by an artichoke and mushroom paella\nthat San Román made. Young artichokes are hitting the market now and are\nperfect for this, though larger artichokes trimmed down to the heart will work\nfine too. I made a strong mushroom broth using dried porcinis, and I used a\nmix of meaty oyster mushrooms and creminis in the paella.**Recipe: Paella with\nartichokes and mushrooms**The turnip paella with peas is inspired by a classic\nbaked rice dish from Valencia made with turnips and duck (_arròz amb anèc i\nnaps_). Sweet peas and baby turnips show up at the same time of year in Los\nAngeles farmers markets. They complement each other beautifully. But baby\nturnips are not essential; regular diced turnips work too. Paella is a\nforgiving dish.These paellas are made in two steps. First, the vegetables are\nprepared and cooked in the paella pan or skillet and removed; then the rice is\ncooked in olive oil before the vegetables are stirred back in and the broth is\nadded. The first step can be done up to a few hours before you proceed with\nthe rice. This makes it a great dish for a dinner party, because the dish can\nbe half finished before your guests arrive, and your kitchen will already\nsmell terrific._Martha Rose Shulman is a cookbook author and food writer based\nin Los Angeles.__food@latimes.com_\n\n","title":"No chicken or chorizo in sight — vegetables are the stars of these aromatic, flavorful and healthful paellas - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"No sausage or shrimp in sight: Veggies star in these impressive, delicious \u0026amp; healthy paellas https://t.co/g1sx5iRttB https://t.co/y8axEJSiNP","date":"Fri Apr 01 18:45:13 +0000 2016","favs":78,"id":{"$numberLong":"715973308605399044"},"retweets":26},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/236xTPp"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc56d"},"content":"After months of dominating the Republican race, Donald Trump has endured one\nof his worst weeks since launching his presidential bid, and while he remains\nthe GOP front-runner, his struggles have underscored his weaknesses and\nincreased the possibility that he might fall short of seizing the\nnomination.The bad news piled up quickly for Trump: his campaign manager\ncharged with misdemeanor battery on suspicion of grabbing a female reporter's\narm, a series of interviews with conservative talk radio hosts who pummeled\nhim, a highly regarded poll showing him trailing badly in advance of\nWisconsin's primary next week, and finally Wednesday's fracas over his stand\non abortion.All of those developments deepened existing doubts about Trump.\nMany Republican strategists worry about his staggering level of unpopularity\nwith female voters, which were highlighted by the battery charge against\ncampaign manager Corey Lewandowski and Trump's comment suggesting women should\nface “some sort of punishment” for getting abortions if the procedure is made\nillegal.Those sorts of stumbles, as well as Trump's calls to talk show hosts\nwhose opposition to him he seemed unaware of, all raised questions about\nwhether he is capable of building and running a campaign operation that can\nwin a general election, experienced political operatives said.“You're seeing a\ncampaign that's making it up as they go along every day. That's deadly,” said\nJohn Brabender, who was chief strategist for former Sen. Rick Santorum's\ncampaign and is now neutral on the race.Donald Trump’s stumble over whether\nwomen seeking abortions should be criminally punished provided a sobering look\nat the vulnerability of a candidate more likely than anyone else to be the\nRepublican nominee.As Trump hastily issued a statement saying, in effect, that\nhe didn’t believe what he...Donald Trump’s stumble over whether women seeking\nabortions should be criminally punished provided a sobering look at the\nvulnerability of a candidate more likely than anyone else to be the Republican\nnominee.As Trump hastily issued a statement saying, in effect, that he didn’t\nbelieve what he...Trump's “renegade campaign” and defiance of political norms\n“served them fine in the early phases,” Brabender said. Now, however, it's\n“hurting Trump a great deal.”The problems come at a contradictory point in the\ncampaign for Trump. He has defeated one rival after another. But he continues\nto draw support from only a minority of Republican voters. That contrasts with\nfront-runners in previous presidential contests who had begun pulling away\nfrom rivals by this point in their campaigns.Of course, Trump has proved\nskeptics wrong time and again, demonstrating a hold on his supporters that has\ndefied conventional political judgment.Part of what may make this rough patch\ndifferent is the Wisconsin polling, which has added something beyond anecdote\nto the forecasting.Based simply on its demographics — with a large number of\nblue-collar Republican voters and an average number of conservative,\nevangelical Christians — Wisconsin would seem a much better fit for Trump than\nfor his chief rival, Ted Cruz. The Texas senator has relied heavily on\nreligious conservatives for his victories so far.Instead, Trump trailed Cruz\nby 10 percentage points, according to the poll, released Wednesday by\nMarquette Law School, which has a strong track record for accurately\nforecasting the state's elections. And that was before Trump began attacking\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who remains very popular with Republicans here,\nin response to Walker's endorsement of Cruz.If the poll forecast holds up, it\ncould be enough for Cruz to sweep the state's 42 delegates under the winner-\ntake-most rules of Wisconsin's GOP primary. That would be a setback for Trump,\nwho is barely on track to win the 1,237 delegates he would need to avoid a\ncontested convention when Republicans meet this summer in Cleveland.The poll\nshowed Trump doing particularly poorly with Republican women, among whom Cruz\nhad a 15-point lead. Thursday, the Cruz campaign sought to reinforce that\nedge, sending Cruz's wife, Heidi, and former candidate Carly Fiorina to\ncampaign through three of Wisconsin's smaller cities. Heidi Cruz was a central\nfigure in last week's Trump drama — an extended series of exchanges between\nTrump and Ted Cruz over which candidate had attacked whose wife first.Julie\nVajda, 45, a physician assistant in Appleton, is the sort of voter Trump's\nrivals are targeting. She plans to vote for Cruz, she said, partly because she\nsees Trump as sexist.“I find him to be disrespectful and derogatory toward\nwomen,” she said. His comments, including remarks he's made about his daughter\nIvanka, are “odd and inappropriate,” she added. “I don't want that\nrepresenting my country.”Democrats, of course, were happy to pile on, seeking\nto keep alive the controversy Trump kicked off with his abortion comments and\nthen his follow-up statement in which he abruptly shifted position, saying\nthat doctors, but not women, would need to be punished for illegal\nabortions.“Donald Trump is showing us exactly who he is, and we should believe\nhim,” Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, said during a rally at a\nstate university campus in a New York suburb. “For many young women today,\nit's almost hard to imagine turning the clock back. But for those of us who\nhave been around a little longer, we know what this means. So we've got to\ndefend our rights.”Clinton also criticized her Democratic rival, Sen. Bernie\nSanders of Vermont, for saying during an interview on MSNBC that Trump's\nremarks were a distraction from “a serious discussion about serious issues\nfacing America.”“To me, this is a serious issue. And it is a serious\ndiscussion,” she said.Trump's other Republican rival, Gov. John Kasich of\nOhio, went after him on a different topic at a news conference in New York,\ncriticizing Trump's recent comments suggesting that Japan and South Korea\nshould consider building their own nuclear weapons.The comments indicated\nTrump was “really not prepared to be president,” Kasich said. That marked an\nescalation of language from Kasich, who has tended to avoid direct criticism\nof Trump.Trump's schedule suggests that he thinks his chances in Wisconsin are\npoor: He spent Thursday in Washington, holding meetings at GOP headquarters,\nand has not announced plans to return to Wisconsin until Saturday.All that\ngives cheer to Trump's adversaries in the GOP.“It seems like the wheels are\ncoming off a little bit,” said Henry Barbour, a prominent Republican\nstrategist who has backed Trump's rivals. “It's not been a good few days, and\nWisconsin seems poised to send a message that Donald Trump is not their kind\nof candidate.”Trump's campaign aides did not respond to requests for comment.\nThe candidate himself has begun to complain that he is being treated\n“unfairly” by Republican rivals. On Tuesday night, he publicly renounced the\npledge he had agreed to in the fall to back the GOP nominee if he loses.The\nnext round of primaries after Wisconsin could be kinder to Trump, particularly\nin his home state, New York. Still, he has yet to win more than 50% of the\nvote in any of the 31 states that have held GOP primaries or caucuses.In a\nnationwide poll released Thursday by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, 41%\nof Republicans and Republican-leaning independents surveyed said they wanted\nto see Trump get the party's nomination; 52% supported someone else.The share\nof voters overall who said Trump would be a terrible president hit 44%, Pew\nfound, up from 38% in January. Among Republicans, at least half of those\nbacking Cruz or Kasich said Trump would be either terrible or poor as\npresident.Only 38% of Republican voters in the poll predicted the party would\nunite solidly behind Trump if he were the nominee. That's a sharp contrast to\nthe Democratic race, in which 64% of the party's voters polled said they\nexpected Democrats would unite behind Clinton if she wins, a number on par\nwith previous nominees in both parties.Numbers like that should send a message\nto Republican convention delegates, say some of Trump's critics in the\nparty.“Any candidate that looks like an almost sure loser in a general\nelection is going to have a hard time getting a party's nomination,” said\nRepublican pollster Whit Ayres, who was a top strategist for Florida Sen.\nMarco Rubio's unsuccessful bid. “The weaker Trump looks as a potential\nnominee, the greater the pressure to open up the nominating process for\nsomeone who might actually win the general election.”_Lauter reported from\nWashington and Finnegan from Green Bay.__ Times staff writers Chris Megerian\nin Appleton, Wis., and Evan Halper in Purchase, N.Y., contributed to this\nreport._**For more on Campaign 2016, follow @DavidLauter and\n@FinneganLAT****ALSO****Trump is about to blow up the California\nprimary****Abortion stumble displays Trump's general election\nweakness****Voters don't see Hillary Clinton as having moved to the left**\n\n","title":"Donald Trump is enduring one of the worst weeks of his campaign.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc56e"},"content":"Buying long-term care insurance isn't an easy decision. It's an increasingly\npricey product that requires you to look way down the road, to the possibility\nof shelling out big bucks for a nursing home or some other form of assisted\nliving.The last thing you want to worry about is having your insurer pull a\nfast one on you after you sign up for coverage. But that's what Prudential has\ndone, making a sneaky change to policyholders' long-term care coverage.At\nissue is what's known as an \"inflation protector,\" which allows policyholders\nto boost the amount they'll be able to pay for future nursing-home care in\nlight of rising costs. This can be an important consideration but will also\nincrease quarterly premiums.**Join the conversation on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**In\nthe past, long-term care policyholders would be asked by Prudential from time\nto time if they wanted to up their insurance ante. If not, they wouldn't have\nto do a thing and their coverage would continue as always.Now, however,\nPrudential is informing customers that the system has changed. Instead of\nbeing asked if they want to increase coverage, the insurer will assume that\nthey do and raise rates automatically.To avoid a rate hike, policyholders will\nhave to notify Prudential in writing that they don't want their coverage to\nchange.\"This seems really over the top,\" said Steven Friscia, who has had\nPrudential long-term care coverage for the last 25 years, ever since his\nfather's diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease nearly bankrupted his family.\"I\nwonder how many other people got the letter from Prudential and didn't read it\nor just threw it away, and now their premium is going to go way up,\" he said.\n\"At least before, your rate would stay unchanged if you didn't do anything.\"In\nFriscia's case, the Rancho Mirage resident was told that the insurer would\nautomatically raise the amount he'd be able to spend on daily nursing-home\ncare to $365 from $315 to accommodate higher costs in his dotage.But that 16%\nincrease in future coverage comes with a 45% rate hike today, to $442 a\nquarter from $305 — a rate hike that doesn't require regulatory approval\nbecause, in theory, policyholders are free to say no.\"That's a big jump,\"\nFriscia, 64, told me. \"I don't want it and wouldn't have had to worry about it\nunder the old system. Now I had to mail them a letter saying I don't want it.\nYou can't call or email.\"Oh, did I mention that Friscia is a senior vice\npresident with a major insurance brokerage? He's also a certified financial\nplanner and has a business law degree.\"I'm in the industry and, fortunately,\nstill have all my faculties,\" Friscia said. \"And I almost didn't catch what\nPrudential has done. I wonder how many other people have missed it.\"Lauren\nDay, a Prudential spokeswoman, declined to offer a detailed explanation of why\nthe company switched from an opt-in for inflation adjustments to an opt-\nout.She said by email only that the \"intent of the opt-out is to make sure we\nknow that clients consciously decided against inflation increases.\"What\nPrudential is saying there, it seems, is that the company feels it can't be\nsure policyholders considered the question of increasing coverage unless it\nsees them take action — in this case, saying no to an automatic rate hike.I\npointed out to Day that clients are still making \"conscious\" decisions when\nthey choose not to opt in for increased coverage. I received no response.Long-\nterm care insurance seemed like a good idea when it was introduced in the\n1980s. But the insurance industry made some significant miscalculations. It\ndidn't do a good job of anticipating rising healthcare costs and the high\nnumber of claims as baby boomers reached their sunset years.Genworth\nFinancial, a leading provider of long-term care insurance, said in a recent\nstudy that a private room in a nursing home currently runs about $91,000 a\nyear; a semi-private room costs about $80,000.In California, the median rate\nfor a private room is $104,025. That's up 4% from five years ago.Then there's\nthe curveball of bargain-basement interest rates. Insurers depend on\ninvestment income for a major chunk of the revenue needed to pay claims, and\nthose low rates knocked their bottom lines for a loop.\"Everything that could\ngo wrong did go wrong,\" said Jesse Slome, executive director of the American\nAssn. for Long-Term Care Insurance, a trade group.As a result of all the\nmissteps, many insurers left the business, he said, leaving only about a dozen\nproviders of stand-alone long-term care coverage. The remaining players have\nstruggled to pay policyholders' claims. Prudential stopped offering new long-\nterm care policies in 2012.About 133,000 people who received long-term care\ninsurance through the California Public Employees' Retirement System have seen\nrates nearly double in the last couple of years. A lawsuit filed by retirees\nin 2013 was granted class-action status.Studies have consistently shown that\nconsumers seldom go to the trouble of opting out of corporate practices. This\nsuggests Prudential's change to an opt-out model will generate significantly\nmore revenue for the company than the previous opt-in approach.Day, the\nspokeswoman, declined to comment.That's not to say all long-term care\ninsurance is a rip-off. As with any insurance product, you're buying peace of\nmind and protecting yourself from possible misfortune.Inflation adjustments\nwill help maintain comprehensive coverage over time. But that may be more than\nmany people need.The reality is that most people probably won't need to keep\nincreasing their insurance to keep up with rising nursing-home costs. In-home\ncare, also covered by long-term care insurance, is a cheaper and, in most\ncases, more desirable alternative.\"Who wants to spend years in a nursing\nhome?\" Slome said. \"You don't need to cover yourself for that. You could\ninstead have someone come to your home a couple of hours each morning and a\ncouple of hours each afternoon.\"He recommends that people consider purchasing\nlong-term care coverage when they reach their mid-50s. That will keep premiums\nrelatively affordable and still allow you to pass the required health\nscreening.Also look into long-term care coverage as part of life insurance. A\ngrowing number of life insurers now offer it as an add-on benefit.I told Slome\nabout Prudential automatically jacking up Friscia's rate unless he opted out.\nHe crunched the numbers and was surprised by what he saw.\"They're saying\nthey'll cover more than $130,000 a year in costs,\" Slome said. \"That seems\nreally high.\"I mentioned the automatic 45% rate hike.\"That seems high too,\"\nSlome said.I can't say this often enough: Read what companies send you. It's\nusually just marketing stuff. But every so often, they're going to try to slip\nsomething important past you.And they're hoping you won't make a conscious\ndecision to protect yourself._David Lazarus' column runs Tuesdays and Fridays.\nHe also can be seen daily in KTLA-TV Channel 5 and followed on Twitter\n@Davidlaz.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc570"},"content":"Late in his first term, President Obama announced a new emphasis on Asia and\nthe Pacific Rim, a way of pivoting from the morass in the Middle East and\nfocusing on a peaceful, booming region that the first Pacific-born president\nsaw as the future.He has visited Asia regularly since then — and will return\nat least twice this year for economic and security summits.But with notable\nexceptions, much of the administration's self-proclaimed \"rebalance\" has been\ndominated by emergency security matters, including North Korea's defiant\nnuclear tests, friction with China in the South China Sea, and the growing\nthreat of cyber-espionage and digital theft.On Thursday, with about 50 world\nleaders in Washington for the Nuclear Security Summit, only the leaders of\nChina, Japan and South Korea received full, formal meetings with Obama, a\nclear sign of his priorities.(The White House belatedly added a shorter\nsession with French President Francois Hollande, a crucial ally in the war\nagainst Islamic State.)\"Trilateral security cooperation is essential to\nmaintain peace and stability in Northeast Asia,\" Obama told reporters as he\nmet with South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister\nShinzo Abe.Later, in a separate meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping,\nObama emphasized their commitment to \"denuclearization of the Korean\npeninsula\" and praised China's new Nuclear Security Center of Excellence,\nwhich seeks to prevent smuggling of nuclear material.\"As the two biggest\neconomies, China and the U.S. have a responsibility to work together,\" Xi\nsaid.The favored treatment for the three Asian powers underscores the\nimportance the White House attaches to boosting trade and security in Asia as\nwell as the urgency of dealing with North Korea's nuclear saber rattling and\nother potential conflicts.\"The rebalance [toward Asia] … the reshuffling of\nU.S. priorities … is one of the most significant strategic initiatives of\nObama's tenure,\" said Elizabeth Economy, director of Asia studies at the\nnonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations.The meetings came against the\nbackdrop of a tumultuous U.S. presidential campaign that potentially could\nupend half a century of U.S. policy in northeast Asia.The Republican front-\nrunner, Donald Trump, has said repeatedly in recent days that South Korea and\nJapan may need to develop their own nuclear weapons to confront regional\nthreats, rather than rely on the U.S. nuclear umbrella that has shielded them\nfor decades.\"You have so many countries right now that have them,\" he said\nTuesday in a CNN town hall. \"Wouldn't you rather ... have Japan have nuclear\nweapons when North Korea has nuclear weapons?\"Whether a whim or a serious\nnotion by Trump, the issue came up in multiple news briefings before the\nnuclear security summit, the fourth in a series launched by Obama in 2009 as\npart of his stated goal of seeing a world without nuclear weapons.Ben Rhodes,\nthe White House deputy national security advisor, said a pillar of U.S.\nforeign policy has been to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons, not to\nencourage it, as Trump suggests.\"That's been the position of bipartisan\nadministrations, everybody who's occupied the Oval Office,\" Rhodes said.\n\"Frankly, it would be catastrophic were the United States to shift its\nposition.\"White House aides say Obama's carefully nurtured relationship with\nXi — their meeting Thursday was their eighth face-to-face session — was\ncrucial in getting Chinese support at the United Nations Security Council\nmeeting on March 2 to impose stiff sanctions on North Korea, Beijing's ally,\nin response to its latest nuclear test.\"It is only because the United States\nand China have been able to effectively work together that the United Nations\nimposed the toughest sanctions that have been imposed on North Korea,\" White\nHouse Press Secretary Josh Earnest said. \"That will pressure the North Korean\nregime and isolate the North Korean regime over their nuclear weapons program\nin a way that has positive benefits for our allies, South Korea and\nJapan.\"North Koreans face a \"steadily growing drumbeat\" for war as Pyongyang\nprepares for its first Workers' Party Congress in 36 years, scheduled for May,\nsaid Victor Cha, a Korea expert at the Center for Strategic and International\nStudies, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington. Annual U.S.-South Korean\nmilitary exercises last month have helped fuel the tension.China has expressed\nits own frustration with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.Beijing was caught\noff guard by Pyongyang's most recent underground nuclear test, on Jan. 6, a\nfew weeks before Chinese New Year. Beijing had specifically told Kim's\ngovernment not to conduct the test, its first since 2013.Tension with China\nalso has been growing in the resource-rich and bitterly contested South China\nSea.In the last two years, China has used dredgers to build up remote reefs\nand rocky outcrops into small islands in the Spratly and Paracel chains. It\nhas constructed airstrips and other potential military installations in areas\nalso claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam and other nations.The Obama\nadministration, which says it is determined to maintain freedom of the seas on\na vital waterway, has responded by dispatching warships and surveillance\naircraft into areas now claimed by China.In September, during his last visit\nto the White House, Xi said China did not intend to \"pursue militarization\" of\nthe islands. But many U.S. officials believe he has gone back on that\nword.\"China is rising, which is fine, but behaving aggressively, which is\nnot,\" Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said last week at the U.S. Military\nAcademy at West Point.That tension has not stopped cooperation on other goals,\nincluding efforts to tackle climate change.The White House announced Thursday\nthat Washington and Beijing on April 22 will sign the so-called Paris\nAgreement, which contains pledges to reduce environment-damaging emissions.\nThe U.S. and China are the world's biggest carbon emitters.Trade may be a\nsideline issue — especially as Asian leaders look beyond Obama and to the next\nU.S. president.Trump and the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, have\nannounced opposition to the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a 12-nation\nfree trade agreement that Obama supports. It's unclear whether Congress will\nvote on the accord before he leaves\noffice._tracy.wilkinson@latimes.com__michael.memoli@latimes.com__Times staff\nwriter W.J.

The lease would encompass\na nearby bar overlooking a 600-year-old pagoda and swimming pool, he said.The\ngroup also was willing to possibly keep some of the current staff and acquire\nthe Yamashiro name and liquor license, Glover said he was told, but he felt\nthe offer was \"lowballing the value\" of those assets.An attorney and a\nrepresentative for JE Group did not respond to calls seeking comment.For now\nthe restaurant plans to stay open until it is forced by court order to leave.\nA hearing to set a trial date in the eviction lawsuit is scheduled for April\n28.Glover said he hopes to at least delay the eviction so a transition to new\noperators is smooth, allowing a chance for some employees to keep their jobs\nand for scheduled events to go on as planned.Glover, 76, is a member of the\nfamily that owned the property off Sycamore Avenue since his father purchased\nit in 1948. The Yamashiro building, a replica of a palace near Kyoto, Japan,\nwas completed in 1914 by two brothers who wanted a mansion to house their\nAsian art collection. After Glover launched the restaurant, it soon became\nknown for its views of the city.The sale to JE was completed March 14 amid a\nwave of high-profile Chinese investments in Southern California. The sale\nincludes a small hotel and some apartment units on the site, but not the\nnearby Magic Castle, a private club for magicians also owned by the family.A\nlease extension was not included as part of the sale, which Glover said he\nresisted but was desired by other members of the family.\"It's been a very\nheartbreaking thing for us. I have been there 50 years, and the property has\nbeen in my family\" even longer, he said. \"It's been a very important part of\npeople's lives. To see that come to an end is really tragic.\"Over the years,\nthe restaurant has hosted celebrities and had a star turn in movies such as\n\"Gone in 60 Seconds\" and \"Memoirs of a Geisha.\"JE owns seven hotels in China\nand is known for refurbishing the historic properties it owns.A day after the\ndeal closed, JE Chairman Kang Jianyi vowed to make few changes, except to\nrenovate the buildings. In an interview through an interpreter, Kang told The\nTimes that JE planned to keep a restaurant in the Yamashiro building and\ncontinue to hold special events there.Kang said his company was negotiating\nwith Yamashiro to stay open but acknowledged a new restaurant could be brought\nin.Still, at the time, John Tronson, a principal with commercial real estate\nbrokerage Avison Young, said the nearly $40-million price tag seemed a bit\nhigh if JE didn't build something else on the property.Tronson said this week\nthat boosting monthly rent to $100,000 would certainly help — if JE can get\nit.\"There are very few restaurants that could pay those kind of numbers,\" he\nsaid. \"It would be the top 1% of all the restaurants in the country in terms\nof high volumes and high margins.\"_andrew.khouri@latimes.com_**ALSO****Elon\nMusk unveils Tesla Model 3 to huge fanfare****Longtime marijuana use might\nmake you a loser****These women in Turkey saw the need for a different kind of\nnews, despite the danger**\n\n","title":"Yamashiro may get booted from its Hollywood Hills building for something more upscale - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"After 50 years, Yamashiro may get booted from its landmark Hollywood Hills building https://t.co/jUgZxC2Mb1 https://t.co/TYY2CUUxIC","date":"Fri Apr 01 17:00:33 +0000 2016","favs":13,"id":{"$numberLong":"715946967751344130"},"retweets":22},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/236rQdx"}

The label's atelier\nhas been located in L.A. since 2012, while the couture atelier remained in\nFrance.

It was the first time Saint Laurent had a full-scale\nfashion show in the L.A. area.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc577"},"content":"San Diego VA hospital staff triggered a veteran’s suicide attempt in 2014 by\nrepeatedly canceling his appointments, according to the findings of an\ninvestigation released this week by the U.S. Department of Veterans\nAffairs.The investigation also found that at least two San Diego VA employees\ninstructed appointment clerks to “zero out” wait times in the scheduling\ndatabase, presenting an unrealistically positive picture of how long patients\nwere waiting for care.The VA’s inspector general issued the report on Thursday\nas part of more than 70 investigations it has released nationally over the\npast few weeks.The investigations of VA facilities in several states followed\na sweeping scandal in 2014 that started over allegations of falsified wait\ntimes at the Phoenix VA hospital.The suicidal San Diego veteran, who was not\nnamed in the report, had three or four mental-health care appointments\ncanceled in a row by the VA leading up to his attempted suicide in 2014.The\ninvestigation found that 13 to 14 percent of his appointments were canceled\nwith less than a day’s notice in 2013 and, in the following fiscal year, that\nnumber rose to between 24 and 27 percent for various clinics.According to the\nreport, “the veteran stated he used the cancellation of his appointments as an\nexcuse to act out and attempted to harm himself. He said he regrets his\nactions and that he received help and now has follow-up appointments.”A\nspokeswoman for the San Diego VA health care system said employees have been\nheld accountable for the scheduling issues, but she declined to identify\nthem.In total, two staff members retired and two resigned, while two others\nfaced “accountability actions,” spokeswoman Cindy Butler said Thursday. One of\nthe people who faced “accountability action” was moved to a job with no\nscheduling responsibility and the other stayed in the position.In a statement\nreleased Thursday, San Diego VA officials said the inspector general only\nexamined data from early 2014 -- before leaders here made an effort to address\nthe issue.“VASDHS has aggressively trained and retrained all of our front-line\npersonnel and supervisors to ensure compliance with scheduling procedures,”\nthe statement said.“Regular scheduling audits are conducted and staff are able\nto clearly articulate scheduling procedures. Where there were allegations and\nfindings were validated, VASDHS took appropriate administrative actions.”Under\nthe 2014 Veterans Choice Act, VA patients facing long wait times can seek care\nin the private sector, at taxpayer expense. More than 6,000 San Diego veterans\nhave received care through the Choice program since October.This is the first\nofficial sign of trouble at the San Diego VA, which has been touted as a model\nby local veteran advocates and even VA Secretary Bob McDonald.The “One VA”\ncommittee concept, an idea started in San Diego, brings leaders from the\nveterans community together with local VA officials on a regular basis to air\nissues. McDonald has called for the idea to be duplicated nationally.The\ninspector general’s investigation was prompted by complaints from two San\nDiego VA employees in May 2014.They alleged that a national team sent earlier\nthat month to audit the San Diego VA -- in light of the national scandal --\nwere presented with employees hand-picked and coached to give a glowing\npicture.Separately, in June 2014, a VA employee alerted the inspector\ngeneral’s office about the veteran’s suicide attempt following canceled\nappointments.However, investigators noted that San Diego VA employees first\nraised concern about manipulated wait times back in 2013, and discrepancies\nwere found in a follow-up inquiry.But, apparently, that early alarm bell went\nunheard.The director of the San Diego VA health care system at the time\nexpressed surprise when faced with the inspector general’s conclusions,\naccording to the report released this week.“He said he was very surprised at\nour findings as he had spoken to (several employees) regarding the initial\nallegations and was told there was no altering of desired dates happening in\nthe mental health department,” the report said.Jeff Gering was the San Diego\ndirector from May 2012 until late December, when he left for a job at another\nSan Diego health care system.The investigation found that an unnamed San Diego\nVA medical administrative officer put pressure on “medical support assistants”\n-- the people who schedule appointments -- to “zero out” the number of days\nthat a veteran was waiting for an appointment.Also, a mental health program\nanalyst played a role.  \nIn emails sent in April 2014, the analyst advised schedulers to call patients\nwith wait times more than 14 days past their desired appointment dates and\noffer them earlier visits.If the veteran declined the earlier appointment\ndate, the scheduler was told to change the veteran’s desired date to the\noriginal appointment date -- making it appear there was no wait time.“The\nemployee stated that, at the time, she thought that she was correct, but had\nnow come to understand it is not the proper way to capture desired dates,” the\nreport said.  \nThe report notes that the VA directive on wait time policy is from 2010.In an\nodd twist, the VA this week also released results of an investigation that did\nnot substantiate an allegation of pressure to “fudge” wait times at the San\nDiego VA.Jen.steele@sduniontribune.comSteele writes for the San Diego Union\nTribune\n\n","title":"VA hospital staff triggered veteran's suicide attempt after repeatedly cancelling appointments, report says - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"VA triggered veteran's suicide attempt after repeatedly cancelling appointments, report says https://t.co/rRVU6BeeEU https://t.co/xtn85wmxPB","date":"Fri Apr 01 16:10:10 +0000 2016","favs":27,"id":{"$numberLong":"715934289293086721"},"retweets":61},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1To6AgL"}

They’re going to make a big push here,” said developer Rick Caruso,\nwho signed on to the Ohio governor’s presidential campaign this week.Caruso,\nthe billionaire behind developments such as the Grove, said he met with the\nall of the Republican candidates but avoided backing anyone early to allow the\nfield to settle. He decided to join Kasich’s campaign because he believes he\nis the sole candidate left in the race who can compete with Democratic front-\nrunner Hillary Clinton and because his resume includes work as a governor, as\na congressman and in the private sector.“He can win, and he’s the best\ncandidate and he’ll make the best president,” Caruso said. “There are two\nboxes – who actually has the experience and could do a really good job, and\ntwo, who can win. The only person who can check those two boxes is John\nKasich.”Caruso predicted no GOP candidate would win the 1,237 delegates needed\nto clinch the nomination by the end of the state contests, and that Kasich\nultimately would be picked as the nominee at the Republican National\nConvention.In the delegate count and the polls, Kasich is a distant third\nbehind front-runner Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. The only state he\nhas won is his home state of Ohio.  \nIn California, Kasich has the support of 12% of GOP voters, trailing Trump and\nCruz by double digits, in a new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll.Caruso\nargued that once the state’s voters got to know Kasich, his message would\nresonate with them.“He’s going to play very well here. First of all, he’s much\nmore moderate on social issues,” Caruso said. “The California Republican base,\nI think for the first time, has someone they can rally behind, and your vote\ndoes matter for the first time in many years. I think there is going to be a\nbig outpouring” of support for Kasich.While stumping for his wife at Lawrence\nUniversity on  Friday, Bill Clinton said too many people haven't shared in the\nprogress made under President Obama. The former president's comments came as\nhe was rattling off the accomplishments that Obama cited in his last State of\nthe Union speech, such as expanded healthcare and reduced unemployment.\nClinton said, “That’s all true. The only problem is, too many people can’t\nfind themselves in that pretty picture he’s painting. That’s what this\nelection is about. How do we put everybody in the picture? How do we all rise\ntogether?”Earlier in his speech, Clinton said government needs to do more to\nhelp coal miners who lose their jobs as the country shifts toward cleaner\nsources of energy. “The coal miners and their families didn’t do anything\nwrong,\" he said. “We, as a country, have done a terrible job of helping people\nin coal country make a transition.”His wife, Democratic front-runner Hillary\nClinton, raised eyebrows last month with her impolitic remark that \"we're\ngoing to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business\" in the\nfight against climate change. Presidential candidate Ted Cruz will address\nCalifornia Republicans at their April convention, party officials announced\nFriday.The Texas senator will speak to hundreds of the party’s leaders and\nmost passionate activists at a luncheon on April 30. “This year we have an\nopportunity to return to the founding principles of our nation -- free\nmarkets, fiscal responsibility and individual liberty,” Cruz said in a\nstatement. “I’m excited to speak to California Republican delegates, activists\nand voters about how we can get our country back on track.”The other two\nRepublican candidates still in the race -- businessman Donald Trump and Ohio\nGov. John Kasich -- have also been invited to the three-day gathering in\nBurlingame.The announcement comes as California’s June 7 primary has grown\nincreasingly important in the presidential race. The late date was expected to\nmake the contest an afterthought in the GOP nomination fight, but the divided\nnature of the electorate means that California will likely be key in\ndetermining whether Trump can win the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the\nnomination before the party’s national convention. A new poll by USC and the\nLos Angeles Times finds that Trump leads Cruz, 37% to 30%, among the state’s\nregistered Republican voters, but that his lead shrinks to one percentage\npoint among likely GOP voters.Among the Republican candidates, Cruz is by far\nthe best organized in California. He started signing up volunteers in the\nstate last summer. He visited the state this week, raising money in Orange\nCounty, rallying potential delegates and appearing on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!”\nRead moreHunkered behind a MacBook decorated with stickers that read \"This\nlaptop was brought to you by capitalism\" and \"TRUMP 2016,\" Jake Lopez bounces\nT-shirt slogans off his friend Ian McIlvoy.\"Trumplicans,\" he says, nodding\nwith satisfaction. \"I think it'll take off.\"Lopez is the California director\nof Students for Trump.

Sanders touts that his donations come mostly from small,\ngrass-roots contributors. \"What this campaign is doing is bringing together\nmillions of people contributing an average of just $27 each to take on a\nbillionaire class which is so used to buying elections,” Sanders said in a\nstatement. Hillary Clinton still leads Sanders in the delegate race heading\ninto Tuesday's primary in Wisconsin.Hillary Clinton has tried ignoring Bernie\nSanders, she has tried embracing him, she has tried co-opting him. And now she\nis returning to wrangling with him as the Vermont senator rattles her campaign\nin New York, a state where a loss for Clinton would create a fresh round of\nproblems for the Democratic presidential front-runner. In the place both\ncandidates can claim as home -- Sanders was born there and Clinton represented\nNew York in the Senate – the underdog is digging in, using his vast resources\nto rally one of the more liberal electorates of the race to make a defiant\nstand for Democratic socialism. On Thursday evening, a diverse crowd of about\n18,500 showed up to cheer for Sanders in the South Bronx, a show of force that\nundermined Clinton’s argument that he lacks appeal among the African American\nand Latino voters crucial to winning in November.Later that night, the Sanders\ncampaign announced that it had a record fundraising month in March, hauling in\nan eye-popping $44 million in a month during which the candidate's electoral\nlosses have put the nomination almost out of his reach. All that money will\ncreate headaches for Clinton leading up to voting on April 19, creating\ncompetition in an expensive media market her campaign had initially not\nexpected to have to work hard to win.Clinton’s strategy came into focus\nThursday as she took the gloves back off and starting swinging. Clinton\ntangled with pro-Sanders protesters from the podium at a suburban college not\nfar from her hometown. She accused Sanders of not showing enough outrage over\nGOP front-runner Donald Trump’s remark, since rescinded, that women who\nreceive abortions should be punished if the procedure is banned.She angrily\nscolded a Greenpeace activist about what she described as lies propagated by\nthe Sanders campaign when the activist confronted her about campaign\ncontributions from people who work in the fossil fuel industry.By Friday,\nClinton was off to Syracuse with plans to highlight her work as a senator in\nhelping revive manufacturing companies upstate – and to take more shots at\nSanders.Unlike Sanders, who has served in Congress longer than she has,\nClinton \"actually has a real history on supporting manufacturing and\nmanufacturers,” Clinton advisor Jake Sullivan said in a call with\nreporters.“Unlike her opponent, she actually has a real strategy for how to\ncreate the good paying jobs of the future and not just re-fight battles from\n20 years ago.”  \nTed Cruz and Rick Astley teamed up on Friday to profess a truth to Donald\nTrump — he’s never gonna give him up.As an April Fools' Day prank, the Texas\nsenator tweeted a video link joking that Trump accepted his invitation to\ndebate anywhere, anytime. It cuts together images of Cruz asking the GOP\npresidential front-runner to go one-on-one and Trump refusing — and then in\ncomes Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up.” Of course, it’s a day of pranks, so,\nno, Trump did not in fact accept Cruz’s invitation. It’s no longer Mr. Nice\nGuy for John Kasich, at least by his relentlessly sunny standard during this\npresidential campaign.Shortly after kicking off one of his typical town hall\nmeetings here, the Ohio governor launched into a criticism of what he called\nDonald Trump’s “absurd” plan to ban Muslim immigration. Then he flew east to\ntee off on the Republican front-runner on Trump’s home turf of Manhattan.“He\nis really not prepared to be president of the United States,” Kasich said\nThursday.In a campaign marred by mudslinging, Kasich’s criticisms were mild,\nbut they nonetheless represent an ongoing shift for a candidate who has\nstruggled to gain traction with Republican voters and whose string of losses\nleave open the question of why he persists in running.“I’m still here,” he\nsaid this week. “Maybe you’ll warm up to me.”Kasich, who’s won nowhere except\nhis home state, appears all but assured to lose Wisconsin’s primary on\nTuesday, and trails in polls in New York and Pennsylvania, which vote in late\nApril.Read more\n\n","title":"Donald Trump is more unpopular than you might think - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Bernie Sanders tops his fundraising record with $44 million in donations in March https://t.co/ccIaGJV0UI","date":"Fri Apr 01 15:35:07 +0000 2016","favs":52,"id":{"$numberLong":"715925468122378242"},"retweets":53},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1VfX5Ah"}

The family sitcom, which reunites him with his \"That '70s Show\"\nfriend and co-star Danny Masterson, stars Kutcher as Colt Bennett, a\nthirtysomething semi-pro football player who returns to the family cattle\nranch in Colorado, which has fallen on hard times, and attempts to run the\nbusiness with his brother (Masterson). Sam Elliott and Debra Winger also\nstar.The 20-episode first season is being released in two installments — the\nsecond batch of 10 episodes will roll out later this year. Ultimately, Kutcher\ndecided he's an all-in kind of binge-watcher who would kick back with the\nfirst set over one weekend. But that was only the start of what this new\nNetflix endeavor had him thinking about.Ashton Kutcher and Danny Masterson\nstar in Netflix's \"The Ranch.\"Ashton Kutcher and Danny Masterson star in\nNetflix's \"The Ranch.\"**You were coming off \"Two and a Half Men\" when the idea\nfor \"The Ranch\" started forming ...**Danny and I wanted to do a show together\nfor probably the last 10 years — since we finished \"That '70s Show.\" I was not\nsure I wanted to do another sitcom. But I thought, \"If we can come up with\nsomething great, it would be awesome.\" I really enjoyed working with\n[executive producers] Jim Patterson and Don Reo when we were working on \"Two\nand a Half Men.\" So we started kicking around ideas — could it be a \"Two and a\nHalf Men\" spin-off? We didn't really want to do that. We really ended up\nbearing down on the question of \"How can you be funny today in a very PC world\nin a way that isn't super meta, that's available to a lot of people, but that\ndoesn't offend everyone?\" What we realized was that nobody had really made a\nshow about blue-collar, conservative, Middle America, small-town family values\nin a long time that wasn't making fun of these types of people. I mean,\nthere's a reason why \"Duck Dynasty\" has an audience on television.**Is Colt\nsomeone you identify with, ****given your background?**The _show_ is like\npretty deep in my bones. I grew up in a town of 100 in Iowa. I understand what\nthis blue-collar life is. I know these characters and the places and the\nfeeling of living in that part of the world and the discontent with it. And I\nalso understand the feeling of wanting to get out of it. Because when I was\n19, I wanted to go. And I know the feeling after I've left of the fear of\nhaving to go home and say I didn't make it. And so I have deep connection to\nthis character from that perspective. And what I realized, and I think what\nDon and Jim realized, is there is a generation right now of kids that go off\nto college with these giant aspirations of what they're going to do in the\nworld and then they get into the workforce and they go, \"Wait, there is not a\njob for that degree I just spent four years and $200,000 getting.\"**\"The\nRanch\" isn't your traditional multi-camera comedy. You can be looser with the\nlanguage, the lighting is different.

And we keep working in this format because we love this format. There's\nan extraordinary energy when you get to shoot in front of a live audience.\nWhat we realized when we set out to do this is we didn't want to do it just\nthe same way everything else is. If you look at the history of the sitcom,\ngoing back to Lucille Ball's show, not much has changed. And when you get to\nthings like lighting and music, you go, \"Why is every sitcom set lit up like\nit's a play?\" And we wanted to challenge that convention.**Was that an easier\nendeavor to get away with, given that you guys always intended to take this to\nNetflix?**Ashton Kutcher and Danny Masterson, who co-starred in \"That '70s\nShow\" in the Clinton and Bush (2) administrations, have wrangled themselves a\nnew situation comedy.

But at the same time,\ntheir job is to deliver to advertisers a show that they're willing to\nbuy.**You're someone ****in the know about technology that aims **** to make\nlife easier for people or solve a problem.

Was doing business with Netflix\nthe next logical step?**Any time somebody gives you an opportunity and\nplatform where you can do what you want to do and make money as an artist,\nthat's where you're going to go. I look at Airbnb — it's really a platform\nthat allows more people to travel and probably have a better experience at a\ncheaper rate and allows people who want some extra income and turn an asset\ninto a value center for them. I think that's just win-win. Twitter provides a\nvoice for anyone that has the capacity to build an audience. I think everybody\nwins with that. Netflix is the same thing, in a sense where if you're an actor\nor producer, you want to be able to make content, but you want to be able to\nmake a living, you want to be able to make it authentic and true, and for the\nconsumers and not for advertisers.Sam Elliott, Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson\nin \"The Ranch\" on Netflix.Sam Elliott, Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson in \"The\nRanch\" on Netflix.**You know the other aspect of this partnership that you\nshould consider — the reboot, reunion part. ****You know everyone is wondering\nwhen we'll get a \"That '70s Show\" return**.As far as a \"'70s Show\"\nreboot...**You're going to deny us.**Well, most likely.

It\nwas kind of post the protest. And \"That '70s Show\" was post-Vietnam. It was\npost the protests. It was these kids in the basement that didn't have anything\nto protest.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc57c"},"content":"California’s traditionally ho-hum primary election is about to get whipsawed\nby the frenzy surrounding the 2016 presidential campaign. Because California\nmay decide Donald Trump’s fate as the possible Republican nominee, the high-\nstakes contest is expected deliver a surge in voter turnout that could shake\nup races up and down the ballot.“I think if Donald Trump is on the ballot, all\nthe rules are out the window,” said Bay Area Democratic consultant Katie\nMerrill. “It’s a mad-as-hell-and-we’re-not-going-to-take-it-anymore\nelectorate.”Here are a few possible twists and turns to keep an eye on in the\nJune 7 primary.Depends on which primary you're talking about. Because the GOP\nholds a closed primary, anyone who wants to cast a ballot for one of the\nparty's three remaining presidential candidates must be a registered\nRepublican. That means no Libertarians, disaffected Democrats or decline-to-\nstate voters frequently referred to as independents can participate — unless\nthey re-register as Republicans.Democrats allow decline-to-state voters to\nparticipate in their primary, but no one else. Green Party members and others\nwould need to change party registration to get a chance to choose between\nHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. With unaffiliated voters allowed to show\nup, that could help Sanders. The USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll released\nthis week found that decline to state voters preferred Sanders over Clinton,\n44% to 35%.The rest of the ballot will be a jungle primary for state Assembly\nand Senate races, congressional contests and the election to replace retiring\nU.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer.California has a “top two” primary system. The two\ncandidates who receive the most votes in the primary, regardless of party,\nface-off in the November general election.For example, voters in the strongly\nDemocratic 44th Congressional District in Los Angeles have 11 candidates to\nchoose from on June 7. Because the best known contenders — state Sen. Isadore\nHall (D-Compton) and former Hermosa Beach City Councilwoman Nanette Barragan —\nand all but three of the candidates on the ballot are Democrats, that means\nit's likely the top two Democrats would advance to the Nov. 8 ballot.But if\nenough Republicans who show up to vote in the presidential race choose someone\nfrom their own party in the congressional primary, a Republican could\nconceivably come in second. That person would face a Democrat in the general\nand face a nearly impossible task given the lopsided nature of the district,\nwhich backed President Obama over Mitt Romney 85% to 14% in 2012. The same\ndynamic could take hold in the 46th Congressional District in Orange County,\nwhere the two front-runners are former Democratic state senators Lou Correa\nand Joe Dunn.In the 24th Congressional District, for example, there is a cast\nof nine characters from both parties seeking to make it to the November ballot\nto replace retiring Democratic Rep. Lois Capps. And it's anyone's guess who\nmight advance given the scarcity of polling and the relatively fluid nature of\na crowded, open-seat contest. So if the roughly 115,000 registered Republicans\nthere show up in big numbers to vote in the presidential primary, that could\ngive a boost to the top two GOP candidates running, Assemblyman Katcho\nAchadjian and Justin Fareed. There are several Democrats in the race who want\nto topple the front-runner, county supervisor Salud Carbajal. Santa Barbara\nMayor Helene Schneider and farmer Bill Ostrander, who is running as a liberal\nin the model of Sanders. If one Democrat and one Republican advance to\nNovember, the Santa Barbara coastline just might be home to the most\ncompetitive race in the state. Obama won the district with 54% in 2012, but\nCapps only won by four points in 2014 and statewide contests have been much\nmore closely divided.The turnout question marks could also force Democrats\nrunning in tight races to reach out to moderate Republican voters, even in\ndistricts that lean heavily to the left.Voting analyst Paul Mitchell said he\nwouldn’t be surprised to see that happening in the hotly contested Silicon\nValley congressional battle between Democratic Rep. Mike Honda and his\nDemocratic challenger Ro Khanna.**SIGN UP for our free Essential Politics\nnewsletter \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**There's an argument that if Latinos show up in big\nnumbers to send a message they don't like Trump, that could benefit Latino\ncandidates on the ballot. Nowhere is the question more pressing than in the\nSenate race, where Rep. Loretta Sanchez is attempting to make it to the\ngeneral election to face Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris, who leads in the polls and\nhas both national support and a massive fundraising operation. If one of the\nRepublican hopefuls — Tom Del Beccaro, George “Duf” Sundheim and Ron Unz —\nmanages to make it past Sanchez in June, Harris would be a near lock to win\nthe seat in November given the state's Democratic leanings.“It’s much more\nlikely that one of the Republicans will get in,” Mitchell said.If Latinos turn\nout and choose Sanchez, who has made her heritage a central point of her\ncampaign, the general election could be a long and ugly slog that ends up with\na Democratic senator either way.Republican political consultant Mike Madrid\nsees having Trump on the ballot and campaigning in California triggering a\nvoter backlash among Latinos to Sanchez's benefit. “I think Trump helps her,”\nhe said.A Trump-fueled increase in voter turnout could help Republican Los\nAngeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich glide into the November election\nfor the 25th state Senate district, even though voter registration in the\ndistrict is 41% Democratic and 30% Republican.The race has a crowded field of\nDemocrats, including former Democratic Assemblyman Anthony Portantino and\nformer Pasadena Police Lt. Phlunte' Riddle.Here's another wildcard: the impact\nof local ballot measures – especially when it comes to taxes and school bonds.\nThe wave of new voters attracted by Trump tend to relish the candidate’s\nhostility toward government and its spending ways, and that certainly is on\nthe minds of city officials in Glendale.The city is opposing a local ballot\nmeasure supported by local tea party activists to rescind the Glendale utility\nusers tax, which delivers more than 15% of the city’s general fund revenue to\npay for police, fire protection and other services.“Yes, we are concerned,”\nsaid Tom Lorenz, spokesman for the city. “We’ve been paying attention to\nwhat’s been going on across the country.” Santa Monica pollster John Fairbank,\nwho has been studiously trying to measure the potential “Trump and Bernie\neffect” on local ballot measures, finds Republicans are less supportive than\nDemocrats and unaffiliated voters.Former state Assemblyman Tim Donnelly, a Tea\nParty favorite who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2014, jumped in at the\nlast minute to challenge fellow Republican Rep. Paul Cook of Yucca\nValley.Donnelly, a talk radio show host who lives in the San Bernardino\nMountains, said the successes of Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican\npresidential campaign show this election favors “insurgent candidates” more\nthan any time in recent history and he thinks that will favor his\ncongressional bid.If the race is still undecided at the time of California’s\nprimary, Republican voter turnout could increase anywhere from 20 to 40\npercent, based on what has occurred in other states, political analysts\nsay.Among Democrats, voter turnout is expected, at best, to be on par with\nprevious presidential primaries. Turnout could be lower, however, because\nClinton has such a wide delegate lead. The California electorate in the\nNovember general election will be far different than the makeup of voters who\ncast ballots in June. Obama won in 2012 with 59.3% of the vote.If Trump\nbecomes the Republican presidential nominee, political analysts expect a\nsubstantial anti-Trump movement in California during the general election, the\nfirst opportunity for non-Republicans to vote against him. Voter turnout among\nLatinos also would rise substantially, Madrid predicted.“California has huge\nSpanish-language media markets … so you’re going to have much more reaction\nfrom the community,” Madrid said.Democratic leaders in the Legislature say a\nbacklash like that could help them regain the supermajority they enjoyed two\nyears ago.“To the extent presidential politics creates California coattails,\n2016 is shaping up to be a banner year for Democrats,” said Senate President\nPro Tem Kevin De León (D-Los Angeles). “In America’s most diverse state, I\nfully expect every demographic group he has systematically alienated over the\ncourse of this campaign to turn out in droves to vote against him and for\nDemocrats up and down the ballot.\"In the Senate 26 of the 40 members are\nDemocrats, so that party only needs to pick up one seat to return to a\nsupermajority. They need three more seats in the Assembly to reclaim\none.Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Paramount) said he is not concerned\nTrump turnout would hurt in the Golden State.“I do think Trump alienates a lot\nof voters; Republicans, independents and Democrats alike and I do think that\nwill be good for Democrats in general,” Rendon said. “California is a\ndifferent ballgame. I definitely think our independent voters tend to be more\nprogressive than they are conservative and that’s going to help\nus.”California's ballot measures could scramble any normal general election\npresidential race math.The state may have two, highly contentious initiatives\non the ballot to stir up voters: A proposal to require background checks on\ngun owners buying ammunition and legalizing the recreational use of\nmarijuana.Neither proposal has qualified yet for the November ballot, but both\nhave a more than legitimate shot.The gun initiative is being championed by Lt.\nGov. Gavin Newsom, who already has hopped into the 2018 gubernatorial race,\nand is fiercely opposed by gun-rights groups who plan to keep their campaign\nup through the fall.The marijuana initiative is being backed by former\nFacebook president and Napster co-founder Sean Parker, who has donated $1\nmillion of the $2.25 million raised by the campaign, and would make California\nthe fifth state in the nation to legalize recreational\nuse._**phil.willon@latimes.com; **__**patrick.mcgreevy@latimes.com;\n**__**christina.bellantoni@latimes.com**__**Follow @philwillon @mcgreevy99\n@cbellantoni on Twitter for the latest news on California politics and\n**_**sign up for the Essential Politics newsletter**___This story was\ncorrected to include Achadjian is a member of the Assembly, not the Senate and\nto reflect that Mike Gatto is no longer running._**ALSO:****Trump leads\nRepublican primary field****Even Sanders supporters are united against common\nenemy: Trump****California's June primary just became crucial in the race for\nthe White House****Full coverage of the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times\npoll****Your voices: What do you think of Donald Trump****Updates on\nCalifornia politics****Live coverage from the campaign trail**\n\n","title":"Donald Trump is about to blow up the California primary.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc57d"},"content":"Don’t ask Dianne Feinstein just yet whether she plans to run for a fifth full\nterm in the U.S. Senate, a seat that will be on the ballot in 2018.“I’ve got\ntwo years and nine months — ask me that in about a year,” Feinstein said with\na grin Thursday during a meeting with Los Angeles Times editors and reporters.\n“I’ll give you the answer then.”Feinstein’s plans have been a hot topic among\nCalifornia politicians for years; she and Sen. Barbara Boxer ran and won seats\nin 1992, and Boxer will retire after her replacement is elected in\nNovember.Behind the two senators, a generation or two of Democratic\npoliticians have gathered, frustrated by their lack of upward movement. But\nthe Democrat and former mayor of San Francisco said she would decide whether\nto run again based not on that but on whether she can continue to be\neffective.“My health is good,” said Feinstein, who is 82. “I can work hard and\ncontinue it. Being effective is the key for me.”The state's senior senator has\nnot endorsed a candidate in the race to replace Boxer, and said she will not\ndo so until after the June primary.Sen.

For a school board, run for the\ncity council....But she has very definitive views about the kind of senator\nCalifornia needs.“I think you have to have a willingness to do your\napprenticeship and to really do the work,” she said.“I see people who go back\nthere, who get a few puff pieces, who run for president — I don’t think that\nmakes a lot of sense to me,” she said. “I don’t think that’s the kind of\nsenator this state needs. I think you need somebody who is really going to do\nthe job and hopefully work with me closely.”Feinstein does have a pick in the\npresidential contest: Hillary Clinton, whom she worked with when Clinton\nserved as New York’s senator. After Clinton lost her first presidential bid in\n2008, it was Feinstein who brought her and Barack Obama together for a unity\nmeeting.“I know her very well,” Feinstein said. “And if you think experience\nmatters — and I do — if you think knowing the world matters — and I do — she’s\nthe only one.”She said she had not worked much with Clinton’s opponent,\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, because the two had served on different\ncommittees in Washington during the nine years they have overlapped in the\nSenate.“He, with me at least, has always lived in his own world,” she said.\nShe noted that she’d developed relationships with Republican senators from\nworking alongside them, but not with Sanders. “He’s not as easy to be friendly\nwith.”Feinstein’s current focus is a water bill she is trying to push through\nthe Senate. It’s on its 26th draft, she said. The bill, meant to expand a\nwater system that was developed in the 1960s, has been tied up in wrangling\nwith the Republican-led House.Democratic constituencies, like\nenvironmentalists, also have balked at Feinstein’s plan.She said Thursday that\nthere were more important things to consider than their opposition, including\nvast job losses in the Central Valley due to lack of water and the scores of\ncommunities suffering because water wells have dried up or become tainted as a\nresult of the drought.“I represent all of the state. Environmentalists are one\npart of it and I think I’ve done my share with environmental legislation and\nshown my stuff that way,” she said. “But this is different. This impacts\neverybody.”“Do I just sit here and let water kill the economy of this state?”\nshe asked. “Because it’s going to happen that\nway.”cathleen.decker@latimes.com**Follow me on Twitter: @cathleendecker.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc580"},"content":"It’s no longer Mr. Nice Guy for John Kasich, at least by his relentlessly\nsunny standard during this campaign.Shortly after kicking off one of his\ntypical town hall meetings here, the Ohio governor launched into a criticism\nof what he called Donald Trump’s “absurd” plan to ban Muslim immigration. Then\nhe flew east to tee off on the Republican front-runner on Trump’s home turf of\nManhattan.“He is really not prepared to be president of the United States,”\nKasich said Thursday.In a campaign marred by mudslinging, Kasich’s criticisms\nwere mild, but they nonetheless represent an ongoing shift for a candidate who\nhas struggled to gain traction with Republican voters and whose string of\nlosses leave open the question of why he persists in running.“I’m still here,”\nhe said this week. “Maybe you’ll warm up to me.”**Election 2016 | Live\ncoverage on Trail Guide | Track the delegate race | Sign up for the newsletter\n**Kasich, who’s won nowhere except his home state, appears all but assured to\nlose Wisconsin’s primary on Tuesday and trails in polls in New York and\nPennsylvania, which vote in late April.He may have survived longer than 14\nother Republican candidates, but in a year where the electorate has cried out\nwith anger, his prescription of warmth and moderation hasn’t caught on.“He has\nan image of being somewhat more moderate, and the type of campaign he’s run\nhas reinforced that image,” said Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University\npolitical science professor. “I don’t think there’s enough of these moderate\nRepublican voters left.”Here in Wisconsin, like much of the rest of the\ncountry, voters have become increasingly polarized after years of open\npolitical warfare between Republican Gov. Scott Walker and public-sector\nunions.“They kind of like the fact that there was a fight,” said Rick Wilson,\na Republican consultant. “They’re much more inflected with the current\nsensibility of a combat-orientated Republican party.”Kasich is more likely to\ntalk about the need to comfort the lonely than rail against political\nopponents, either within his party or among Democrats. He speaks often about\ntrying to bridge gaps at a time when Republican primary voters seem less\ninterested in reconciliation than venting their frustrations.“Kasich is\nrunning in the space that’s traditionally been the successful one in American\npolitics -- the repairers of the breach,” said Steve Schmidt, a Republican\nstrategist who worked for John McCain’s presidential campaign in 2008. “But\nthat’s not playing out in this election cycle.”John Macy, chairman of the\nRepublican Party in Waukesha County, suggested a simple explanation for why\nKasich hadn’t gained more support.“Everybody likes a winner, and he hasn’t won\na state” besides Ohio, he said.Kasich has won even fewer delegates than Marco\nRubio, the Florida senator who dropped out of the race after losing his home\nstate March 15. The latest survey from the highly regarded Marquette Law\nSchool poll shows Kasich on track to finish last of the three remaining\nRepublican candidates in Wisconsin.Despite poor polling, Kasich has insisted\nthat he will perform better in late-April primaries in the Northeast and mid-\nAtlantic regions, where more moderate voters may be skeptical of Cruz’s hard-\nline ideology and Trump’s unpredictability.But he’s already fallen short in\npotentially favorable places like Michigan and Massachusetts, and at this\npoint, it’s mathematically impossible for Kasich to secure the Republican\nnomination during the primaries. He’s staked his chances on the hope that no\nother candidate will secure a majority of delegates before the convention in\nJuly.During a contested convention, which Republicans haven’t seen for more\nthan six decades, delegates are bound by the voting results from their states\nonly on the first ballot. After that, they are freer to choose which candidate\nto support.At that point, Kasich told reporters, “People are going to actually\nwant to ask, ‘Who do you think can beat Hillary Clinton?’”He bests Clinton,\nthe Democratic front-runner, in polls of hypothetical general election\nmatchups, while Trump and Cruz fall short, although such surveys at this stage\nin a race have almost no predictive power.Kasich says he’s not just fighting\nfor his own candidacy, but for his party’s chances in November. Without him at\nthe top of the ticket, he said, Republicans could face steep losses in lower-\nlevel races.“I find myself in the strange position in some ways of being the\nstalwart of the Republican Party, to make sure we don’t lose the Senate and\n[suffer] major losses in the House,” he said.For Republican voters who have\nlatched onto Kasich as the only reasonable candidate left in the race, his\nfailures have been frustrating and confusing.“I don’t understand it,” said Ted\nSetum, a 58-year-old attorney from Vernon, a small town on the outskirts of\nthe Milwaukee area. “The American people say they don’t like negative\ncampaigning, but that’s all they’ve gotten.”“I hit my mute button four times\"\nduring one of the televised debates, he said. \"I just couldn’t stand it\nanymore.”Kasich’s supporters have been turned off by Trump’s rhetoric while\nbemoaning his constant media attention.“Trump is too controversial,” said Ed\nCooper, 82. “He’s got to think before he talks. Maybe because he talks before\nhe thinks is why he’s in the paper all the time.”Even as Kasich has ramped up\nhis criticisms of Trump, he’s still campaigning with the type of humor that\nmakes young children roll their eyes at the parents. On Wednesday he declined\nfrozen custard during a campaign stop in a Milwaukee suburb because, he said,\n“I have a young, beautiful, smart wife. I have to stay fit.”He bantered with a\ncustomer about golf swings, demonstrating how players should roll their\nwrists. A woman praised his stance on immigrants who are in the country\nillegally -- Kasich wants a path to legalization instead of deportations -- by\nsaying he’s treating them “like human beings.”Kasich responded, “How should we\ntreat them, like widgets?”His campaign had emailed supporters to let them know\nKasich would be stopping at the restaurant, and several showed up to thank him\nfor running a more positive campaign than his opponents.Bennett Whitnell, 29,\nsaid Kasich should stick it out until the convention.“Until somebody wins the\nnomination, you haven’t lost the nomination,” he said.Whitnell added, “I’m\nwith him until the wheels fall off.”**Twitter: @chrismegerian****ALSO:****What\ndo you think of Donald Trump?****Trump is enduring one of the worst weeks of\nhis campaign.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc581"},"content":"After years of sitting on the sidelines, hundreds of thousands of workers who\nlost their jobs in the 2007-08 financial crash are finally getting back into\nthe game.Friday's jobs report shows that since September, droves of laid-off\nAmericans who had been conspicuously absent from the recovery began returning\nto the job market, some finding opportunities and others actively seeking\nthem.The nation's labor force — people with jobs and those unemployed but\nlooking for work — grew by about 2.4 million over the past six months, about\nas much as the prior three years combined.**See the most-read stories this\nhour \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Just last September, the labor participation rate — the share\nof the working-age population with jobs and looking for work — dropped to a\n39-year low of 62.4%. But since then, the labor force has risen sharply to\n63%, still way below the 66% in the months before the recession, but\nnonetheless a two-year high.“It's a really good sign,” said Dean Baker, co-\ndirector of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. “It\nmeans people are feeling optimistic about job prospects, and people who had\ndropped out are coming back in.”The surge in the labor force surprised some\nanalysts who wondered whether many of the laid-off workers would ever return\nand worried about a permanent, huge loss of productive human resources.Most of\nthe improvement in participation is coming from prime-age workers, those who\nare re-entrants, said Sophia Koropeckyj, a labor economist at Moody's\nAnalytics. The inflow of younger workers, those who are new entrants or have\nbeen students, accounts for less than one-quarter of the increase in the labor\nforce, she said.“People who gave up see the unemployment rate dropping,” said\nElise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, offering one\nreason for their return. She noted that other government data show job\nopenings are up. “Maybe they're seeing more ads in the newspaper,” she said.\n“Maybe it's just word of mouth.”In March, the labor force expanded by nearly\n400,000 people. The number was so large it pushed up the nation's unemployment\nrate to 5%, from 4.9% in the prior two months, even though there was a healthy\ngain in employment.The big question now is, will hiring remain strong enough\nto bring them into employment rolls and keep them there?The Labor Department\njobs report for March was encouraging. It showed that employers added a solid\n215,000 net new jobs last month, after gains of 245,000 in February and\n168,000 in January.That's an average monthly job growth of 209,000 in the\nfirst quarter, down slightly from last year but still more than enough to\nabsorb new entrants in the labor market, such as fresh graduates, as well as\nmany re-entrants.But the hiring outlook remains highly uncertain. The U.S.\neconomy, which is nearing the end of its seventh year of recovery in June, has\nbeen growing at a lackluster rate in the past six months. Corporate profits\nare declining; business investments, partly because of low energy prices, have\nbeen weak; and there's been a falloff in American trade and industrial\nactivity, thanks to the global slowdown. U.S. manufacturers last month shed\n29,000 jobs and have not added any net new jobs over the past year.Consumer\nspending has been the primary engine of economic growth, fueled by job and\nincome gains, low household debts and super-low interest rates. Retailers,\nhealth-care services and leisure businesses such as restaurants continued to\nshow brisk hiring last month.Amazon.com Inc. plans to open a second\nfulfillment center in San Bernardino, a move it said will create more than\n1,000 full-time jobs.The e-commerce giant said Wednesday that San Bernardino\nhas \"proven to be an important part of Amazon's growth in California.\"\nAmazon's first California fulfillment...Amazon.com Inc. plans to open a second\nfulfillment center in San Bernardino, a move it said will create more than\n1,000 full-time jobs.The e-commerce giant said Wednesday that San Bernardino\nhas \"proven to be an important part of Amazon's growth in California.\"\nAmazon's first California fulfillment...The uncertainty also can been seen in\nthe Federal Reserve's interest rate stance. The central bank lifted its\nbenchmark interest rate from near zero last December, but Fed Chairwoman Janet\nL. Yellen this week reinforced market expectations for gradual increases in\nthe near term, given the risks and what she viewed as the precarious nature of\nthe global financial and economic condition.Recent wage gains also may be\nluring some workers back. Since the second half of last year, average earnings\nfor all private-sector workers have risen at a slightly faster pace than\nprevious recent years when wage increases were stuck at 2% a year. In March,\nthe average hourly pay went up 7 cents from the prior month, to $25.43, or\n2.3% higher than a year earlier.Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital\nEconomics, said the pickup in labor participation has been particularly strong\namong the lowest skilled, or those without a high school diploma.“Maybe they\nneeded a rise in wages to convince them it was worth doing,” he said, noting\nthe broad increase in pay by large retailers such as Wal-Mart and\nTarget.Neither Ashworth nor other economists expect the recent flood of new\nworkers to continue for long. But right now, he added, “jobs are so plentiful\nthat people who weren't thinking about it are now looking for\nwork.”_don.lee@latimes.com_**Follow me on Twitter @dleelatimes****MORE FROM\nBUSINESS****Why American workers aren't changing jobs, and what it means for\nthe economy****April Fools' Day: Trader Joe's, Adobe, Lexus and\nmore****SeaWorld CEO defends decision to halt breeding of killer whales**\n\n","title":"Laid-off Americans are finally returning to the labor market: Will they find jobs? - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"U.S. economy creates a solid 215,000 jobs in March https://t.co/pj9sJ8EUMM","date":"Fri Apr 01 12:40:47 +0000 2016","favs":29,"id":{"$numberLong":"715881597111779329"},"retweets":32},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1UHuTb7"}

The\nneighborhoods with the highest number of Airbnb operators were Venice, West\nHollywood, Hollywood and the areas around Silver Lake and Echo Park, the study\nfound.If all Airbnb operators were to pay the same room tax, tourism fees and\nassessment charges that are levied on hotels, Airbnb would owe the city of Los\nAngeles $41 million a year, the study concluded.Under existing rules, renting\nout homes or apartments for fewer than 30 days at a time is illegal in big\nswaths of Los Angeles, according to the planning department.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc583"},"content":"Over the course of his creative life, David Bowie wheeled nimbly between\nstyles, tones and identities as if they were all just different parts of the\nsame cosmic roller rink.So it was fitting that a Carnegie Hall concert\nThursday night -- the first major tribute to the rocker since his death on\nJan. 10 -- featured a sprawling collection of performers and genres, even if\nit sometimes lacked the artistic consistency of the man it aimed to\nhonor.\"Whether or not he's here in this room, he's almost certainly here in\nthis room,\" Michael Stipe said of Bowie before his number. Then he proceeded,\nwith the help of ethereal songstress Karen Elson and a beard worthy of Andrew\nWeil, to perform one of the more polarizing of the show's numbers -- a dirge-\nlike rendition of Bowie's addiction-minded New Wave hit \"Ashes to Ashes\" that\nmeandered dolefully along the treetops, then concluded with  a slow-motion\ninterpretative dance. Then again, Bowie was always the one telling us to put\non our red shoes and dance. And he'd be the last person to try to mandate the\nchoreography.It's just been a day since Michael Stipe's lovely rendition of\n\"The Man Who Sold the World\" suggested that the upcoming David Bowie tribute\nshows would be truly special occasions. But trouble is now stirring behind the\nscenes at the same shows.The Roots, the hip-hop mainstays and Jimmy\nFallon's...It's just been a day since Michael Stipe's lovely rendition of \"The\nMan Who Sold the World\" suggested that the upcoming David Bowie tribute shows\nwould be truly special occasions. But trouble is now stirring behind the\nscenes at the same shows.The Roots, the hip-hop mainstays and Jimmy\nFallon's...About two dozen performers offered their takes on Bowie songs to\nthe enthusiastic packed house -- stylists as varied as the Flaming Lips, Robyn\nHitchcock, Ann Wilson, Pixies and Rickie Lee Jones, many with the backing of\nHoLY HoLY, the house band led by frequent Bowie collaborator Tony Visconti. (A\nsimilar show has been added for Radio City Music Hall on Friday night.) The\nmusicians put together a set list of either uncertain flow or charmingly grab-\nbag appeal, depending on your point of view -- \"high-end karaoke,\" as\nHitchcock said in an interview after the show.The Bowie tribute had been\nconceived, when the artist was still alive, by the famed New York promoter\nMichael Dorf as the 13th installment of an annual series. In the past, a feted\nmusician -- including the likes of Bruce Springsteen -- would often show up to\nperform at night's end. Bowie (whom Dorf had spent years wooing) may have\nintended on doing the same.But the event took on a different meaning when the\nman who gave us Ziggy Stardust died just hours before tickets were scheduled\nto go on sale.The singer's death might have cast a melancholy mood over the\nevening. But in a welcome unsentimental turn befitting Bowie, few performers\nwent for the heartstrings. Instead, most just offered a \"Thank you Dave\" or\n\"God bless David Bowie\" and got on with their number. (Cat Power, doing a\nstripped-down version of the 1972 doomsday anthem \"Five Years,\" pointed\nskyward several times.)There were several clear miscalculations. Lee Jones'\nunplugged rendition of \"All The Young Dudes\" wobbled and shook, unable to hit\nthe requisite high notes. (Ian Hunter, a regular Dorf collaborator whose voice\nof course popularized the song, had been asked to attend but was\nunavailable.)Los Angeles Times fashion writer Adam Tschorn wrote about David\nBowie's undeniable connection between music and fashion as the 55th Grammy\nAwards were held in 2013.

Bowie died Sunday at the age of 69.Here's the\noriginal fashion profile published on February 10, 2013:As the high-profile\nworlds...Pixies' \"Cactus\" -- essentially their cover of Bowie covering them --\nwas a wail that began then quickly ended, squandering an opportunity for the\nalt-rock forerunners.And a rendition of \"The Man Who Sold The World\" by the\njourneyman indie-rocker Joseph Arthur would have been a misfire even if Stipe\nhad not just haunted \"The Tonight Show\" with his own version; even if Kurt\nCobain had not rendered all other covers of the song irrelevant two decades\nago; and even if Arthur had not gratuitously ended his performance by\nunfurling a U.S. flag with a four-letter message to Donald Trump.But the set\nlist, like Bowie’s grand career, frequently offered something to satisfy one\nconstituency or another. If the show's rhythm ebbed and flowed with all the\nsmoothness of a blood-moon tide -- on-your-feet-dancealongs moved to laid-back\nsnoozers and back -- one didn't have to wait very long for an interesting take\nto come along.Cyndi Lauper burst on stage, pink of hair and black of robe, for\n\"Suffragette City,\" making up with energy what she lacked in, um, lyrical\nfluency.Gogol Bordello provided a rendition of the art-rock toe-tapper\n\"Breaking Glass,\" lending it a kind of  Slavic mania. Bowie never had a Flying\nKaramazov Brothers period, but if he did, it might have looked like this.In\nseparate numbers, Ann Wilson and Debbie Harry each showed what's possible when\nBowie's feminine energy is channeled through lady rockers. Wilson embarked on\nan unexpected \"Crazy On You\"-style vocal riff in \"Let's Dance\" that proved one\nof the evening’s highlights. Harry, in a silvery rain poncho that Major Tom\nmight have worn during a particularly intense meteor shower, brought the\naudience to its feet with a spirited \"Starman\" singalong.David Bowie, the\nbarrier-breaking British rock musician and actor, has died at the age of 69,\njust days after releasing a critically acclaimed album on his birthday.Bill\nZysblat, his business manager of 34 years, confirmed to The Times that Bowie\ndied Sunday after an 18-month battle with cancer.David Bowie, the barrier-\nbreaking British rock musician and actor, has died at the age of 69, just days\nafter releasing a critically acclaimed album on his birthday.Bill Zysblat, his\nbusiness manager of 34 years, confirmed to The Times that Bowie died Sunday\nafter an 18-month battle with cancer.Jakob Dylan supplied the most up-the-\nmiddle moment by reprising the Wallflowers’ 1998 cover of \"Heroes\" --\neminently listenable, even if its arena-rock polish wiped away the song's\npolitical grit.And Perry Farrell took the \"Bowie tribute\" part of the\nassignment the most literally -- the Jane's Addiction pioneer slinked through\n\"Rebel Rebel\" with the tailored-suit comportment of The Thin White Duke, while\nsporting a hat seemingly borrowed from a production of \"Wicked\" down the\nstreet.The show’s shapeshifting properties suited its protean subject.“When\nyou’re looking at someone like, say, Bruce Springsteen, he has a certain\nconsistent style,” Dorf, who founded the seminal Knitting Factory as well as\nthe current downtown venue City Winery, said in an interview after the show.\n“But an artist like Bowie was trying so many styles, he  lends himself to a\ntribute with many different voices.”Performers clearly felt that too,\nsometimes disassembling songs and rebuilding them anew. The R\u0026amp;B\ntrailblazer Bettye LaVette remade the ’70s-rock production of Bowie’s version\nof \"It Ain't Easy\" into a soul-blues sweetness, while John Darnielle of the\nMountain Goats gave a piano-pop bounce to the spiritual desperation of \"Word\non a Wing.\" As he belted out the lyrics -- \"Lord, I kneel and offer you/My\nword on a wing/And I'm trying hard to fit among/Your scheme of things\" -- it\njust as easily could have been a cry for Elton John as for the divine. (Yes, I\nknow, same difference, to some.)And J Mascis and Sean Lennon brought out the\nhistory-laden \"Quicksand\" with a whole new look. Mascis’ Dinosaur Jr. had\nactually covered the orchestral-flavored song 25 years ago, turning it into an\nalt-rock ballad.  His version this time stripped down the song even further,\nto country, as Mascis and Lennon played the song with only two twangy\nguitars.One act not present Thursday night: the Roots. Questlove announced on\nInstagram earlier this week that the band was pulling out of the Bowie tribute\nThursday as well as the Radio City gig. The reason was an apparent dispute\nduring rehearsal with HoLY HoLY over whether the Roots could use their drum\nkit.\"I've never been so insecure or petty as to deny a fellow musician use of\nANY of my equipment,\" Questlove wrote in the post. \"[I]t angers me when that\nsame courtesy is not reciprocated.\"Asked about the absence, Dorf sought to\nstrike a conciliatory note. “I feel it’s a real shame,” he said. “This was a\nmiscommunication during rehearsal. Egos got in the way.”He added, “Questlove\nput so much work into these tributes and came up with some of the most\nbrilliant renditions. The Roots have been extraordinary at past shows. I\nwished they’d come. But what can you do?”The set ended with a choral rendition\nof \"Space Oddity\" as the audience joined in with the New York City Children’s\nChorus. The sound of a Bowie classic reverberated off Carnegie's hallowed\nwalls, furnishing one of the night's more goosebumpy moments. “People weren’t\njust singing ‘ground control to Major Tom’ — with David Bowie gone, they were\nsaying goodbye to a whole part of their lives,” Hitchcock said.“Because the\nevent had a different aura tonight, I felt a responsibility with ‘Space\nOddity’ that people connect,” Dorf added.But Bowie was rarely about unadorned\nraw emotion in life, and the posthumous show mainly honored that spirit. More\nclosely in keeping with Bowie's aesthetic Thursday was not “Space Oddity” but\nthe astral number that preceded it: the Flaming Lips’ rendition of “Life on\nMars.”\"Now she walks through her sunken dream/To the seat with the clearest\nview,\" sang the band's flamboyant frontman, Wayne Coyne. \"And she's hooked to\nthe silver screen/But the film is a saddening bore/ For she's lived it ten\ntimes or more.\" The character was reaching higher, wishing for the stars, just\nas its writer often would. But the most Bowie-ish touch of all wasn’t the\nlyrics: it was the presentation. Coyne brilliantly performed the song with\nmaximum fashion and pop-cultural elan. He wore flowing neon-lit robes, and\neven sat piggyback atop a fellow band member dressed to head-to toe as\nChewbacca.

It’s that toking a lot\nof weed over several years turns someone into a loser. It’s not really a\nchicken or egg thing.The UC Davis-led research, published last week, is\nespecially relevant now. Voter signatures are being collected to place a\nmarijuana legalization measure on the November ballot.**See the most-read\nstories this hour \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Social use of marijuana — I hate the misleading\nadjective “recreational” — already is legal in four states: Alaska, Colorado,\nOregon and Washington. The verdict’s still out.Medical use is allowed in 19\nother states, including California. In this state, the well-intentioned system\nhas been a sham for years — fake an ache and toke up — but Gov.

Jeff Stone remembers vividly where he\nwas when he heard that pop singer Nat King Cole had died.He was on the Santa\nAna Freeway in the back seat of his mother’s car, headed from Anaheim to Los\nAngeles to visit his grandparents. It was Feb. 15, 1965, and he was 9.“I was\nalarmed that...The report on persistent pot use — the product of research at\nseveral universities — took no position on the ballot proposal. “Our research\ndoes not support arguments for or against cannabis legalization,” a UC Davis\nnews release quoted study leader Magdalena Cerda, an associate professor of\nemergency medicine who helps head a violence prevention program.“But,” she\nadded, “it does show that cannabis was not safe for long-term users….“Our\nstudy found that regular cannabis users experienced downward social mobility\nand more financial problems — such as troubles with debt and cash flow — than\nthose who did not” puff persistently.“Regular long-term users,” Cerda\ncontinued, “also had more antisocial behaviors at work, such as stealing money\nor lying to get a job, and experienced more relationship problems, such as\nintimate partner violence and controlling abuse.”Why wouldn’t those red flags\nbe an argument against legalizing the drug and making it easier and more\ntempting — because of advertising — to consume? “There may be other reasons to\nlegalize,” she told me in an interview. “Think about criminal convictions and\nlack of regulation.”OK, about the myth of criminal convictions: Marijuana was\nbasically decriminalized in California 40 years ago when Brown was governor\nthe first time.That’s when possession of one ounce of marijuana — the same\namount that would be legalized under the initiative — was made a low\nmisdemeanor. Six years ago, the penalty was reduced even further to an\ninfraction, equivalent to a traffic ticket.Last time I checked, only three-\ntenths of 1% of the total state prison population was incarcerated for any\nkind of marijuana offense.But there’s no question that pot pushing on the\nstreet is unregulated. The initiative would regulate and tax weed, raising\nmoney to prevent and treat abuse. It would try to restrict non-medical sales\nto people 21 and older. Like with booze. But, of course, that never has\nstopped kids from drinking themselves silly.“Alcohol is still a bigger problem\nthan cannabis because alcohol use is more prevalent than cannabis use,” Cerda\nsaid in the report. “But as the legalization of cannabis increases … the\neconomic and social burden posed by regular cannabis use could increase as\nwell.”“There is a common perception that cannabis is safer than alcohol,”\nCerda added in an interview. “But this study shows that … cannabis is just as\nbad as alcohol. And in terms of financial problems, cannabis is worse.”Why?\n“We don’t know. It’s something we want to look at.”The study didn’t look into\npot health risks — only at cannabis-caused economic and social problems.While\nUC Davis led the project, other universities also participated. They included\nDuke, Arizona State, Kings College London and the University of Otago in New\nZealand.It was a group of roughly 1,000 New Zealanders who were studied over\nfour decades — their families tracked when they were children and their\ncannabis habits monitored between ages 21 and 38.How relevant are New\nZealanders to Americans? “The findings were consistent with similar studies in\nEurope, Australia and the United States,” Cerda said.Devout cannabis advocates\nand social justice reformers believe this may finally be the year that\nCalifornia voters legalize all marijuana, and that optimism has led to a\nmashup of proposed statewide ballot measures -- more than 20 filed so far.They\nvary from a one-sentence constitutional amendment...Devout cannabis advocates\nand social justice reformers believe this may finally be the year that\nCalifornia voters legalize all marijuana, and that optimism has led to a\nmashup of proposed statewide ballot measures -- more than 20 filed so far.They\nvary from a one-sentence constitutional amendment...Yes. After all, we are the\nsame species.“We kept cutting the data many ways,” she said, “and we kept\nseeing the same results over and over again.”One especially noteworthy passage\nfrom the report: “On average, persistent cannabis users from middle-class\norigins attained lower adult socioeconomic status than did their parents —\neven after we controlled for sex, ethnicity, family substance-dependence\nhistory, childhood self-control, childhood IQ, history of psychopathology,\nachievement orientation and adult family structure.”Summed up: The finger\npoints at pot.The report is loaded with statistics. Here’s one set: 52% of\nmiddle-class frequent marijuana users “experienced downward mobility” compared\nto only 14% of non-users. Conversely: 33% of non-users moved up the\nsocioeconomic ladder, but just 7% of habitual users did.What’s frequent? At\nleast four times a week.“We can all agree that abuse is a bad thing,” says\nJason Kinney, spokesman for the legalization proposal. “The best way to curb\nabuse — prohibition is not working — is to regulate the product and educate\nthe people.”There was good news in the report for occasional pot smokers.\nResearchers didn’t find any adverse socioeconomic effects.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc587"},"content":"If you've walked through the streets of Jerusalem, as some of us have, holding\nwarm_ laffa_ bread wrapped around shawarma — the entire sandwich laced with\nchile sauce — then one meal at the Holy Grill in Los Angeles can bring you\nstraight back to Israel.The Holy Grill is a certified glatt kosher food truck\nlocated in a parking lot on 15th Street, in the middle of the downtown L.A.\ngarment district, just north of the 10 Freeway. It's relatively easy to find a\nkosher food truck in Los Angeles, but a glatt kosher truck, which involves\nstricter requirements for meat, not so much.The truck specializes in common\ndishes found in Israel, including _shakshuka_, a traditional Israeli breakfast\ndish made with spicy, garlicky tomato sauce and two eggs — cracked right into\nthe sauce — cooked until just past over easy. During the lunch rush on a\nrecent Friday, men in suits with their sleeves rolled up, ties thrown over a\nshoulder, used their hands and strips of pita bread to eat the\n_shakshuka_.\"Some of the recipes are from my parents, amazing cooks who\nspecialize in Israeli-Moroccan cuisine,\" said co-owner Adiel Nahmias, who\nmoved from Israel to the U.S. in 2008. \"Most of the recipes are mine. It is a\nplace where I can experiment and let my creativity grow and it was a great\nopportunity to feel the energy from back home.\"Nahmias, who bought the truck\n(the name Holy Grill was inherited) in 2013 with his partner, Dvir Botach,\ntries to keep the dishes as close to what you'll find at a restaurant or stand\nin Israel as possible. Some of the spices are imported from Israel, along with\nthe pita bread — which happens to have a nice chew and be thicker and fluffier\nthan most. The truck's_ laffa_ bread, not the thick bubbly kind you may find\nat the Israeli restaurant Hummus Bar and Grill in Tarzana, is more of a lavash\nand comes from a bakery in the San Fernando Valley called Super Pita.There's\nshawarma, pieces of chicken heavily spiced with cumin and garlic, served with\ngrilled onions; round beef and lamb kebab patties studded with cilantro\n(similar to a Lebanese _kafta_); and _pargiot_, a marinated chicken dish made\nwith green onion, paprika, cilantro and a few of Nahmias' other secret\nspices.The hummus, which comes with almost everything on the truck, is\ncreamier and more subtle than some of the grainier versions served at Lebanese\nrestaurants. And you can eat it straight, with a spoon.You can also order\n_bourikas_, pastries filled variously with apples, meat and potatoes, or\nNahmias can make you a _bourikas_ sandwich: The thin, flaky dough is cut in\nhalf lengthwise, then stuffed with slices of hard-boiled egg and tomato.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc588"},"content":"Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, speaking to an adoring crowd of Tesla fans,\npronounced the Model 3 a success upon its birth Thursday night in Hawthorne.\nAnd by the reaction in person and online, Tesla fans overwhelmingly agreed.\nPulling the covers off the fourth vehicle in the company's short history, Musk\ndeclared that more than 115,000 vehicles had been pre-ordered in the first 24\nhours. By Friday morning, Musk tweeted an update that the number had climbed\nto 180,000 orders in 24 hours.He said the selling price with an average option\nmix was probably about $42,000, which came out to a total of about $7.5\nbilllion in a day. \"Future of electric cars looking bright,\" Musk\ntweeted.Shares of Tesla stock surged Friday morning, gaining $10.43, or 4.5%,\nto $240.20.Analysts said the number of pre-orders for the Model 3 exceeded\ntheir expectations.“Typically, you don’t see pre-sales like that at all,” said\nJack Nerad, executive editorial director and market analyst for Kelley Blue\nBook. “There’s a magic around Tesla. There’s a magic around Elon Musk that has\nenthralled a lot of people.”In a Friday note, Evercore ISI said investors\nsurveyed Thursday predicted that Model 3 orders would total 55,000 in 72\nhours. By the end of the year, they expected orders to hit 117,000 cars.\nEvercore analysts said in the report they had thought the survey results were\n“overly optimistic.”“How wrong could we have been?” the report said.\nTraditionally, mass market auto customers have wanted to see vehicles for\nthemselves, take a test drive and read reviews before putting down a deposit –\nnone of which happened Thursday with Tesla, according to the report.“It seems\nthat Tesla’s brand equity has enabled it to break all convention with\nconsumers happy to place a ‘blind’ order,” the report said. Tesla’s previous\nmodels have been plagued by delivery delays, and this history could be an\nindicator of what is to come, Nerad said.But it might not necessarily dissuade\nthe scores of people who put down deposits since many are already familiar\nwith Tesla’s history and are prepared to wait until 2018 to get the car, said\nJessica Caldwell, senior analyst at Edmunds.com.Despite the number of “rabid”\nTesla fans, Nerad said conventional automakers with electric vehicles will\nstill be able to compete through the sheer number of dealerships and their\nretail power.“The key ingredient for a broad line manufacturer is they can\nsell and probably will sell EVs [electric vehicles] at a loss,” he said. “I\nthink Tesla Motors can’t continue to operate at a loss forever. This is when\nthey’re really supposed to become much more than a niche player in the\nindustry.”The lower, sleeker Tesla -- at least 20% smaller in stature than its\nbigger brother, the Model S -- will be able to go from 0 to 60 mph in less\nthan six seconds in its most affordable configuration. \"The Model S and X made\nthe Model 3 possible,\" Musk said. \"So to all of you who bought an S or an X,\nthanks for paying for this.\"He noted that with any new technology \"it takes\nmultiple iterations ... and economies of scale before you can make it\naffordable.\"The Model 3 will be fitted with Tesla's \"autopilot\" features,\nwhich have helped the car be among the safest on highways.Standing before a\ncollection of new Model 3s, Musk reminded the audience that the car\nrepresented the culmination of a long-held dream to bring affordable, zero-\npollution vehicles to the world's highways. Musk began his pitch by pointing\nout that CO2 levels and global temperatures were at record highs, and said the\nModel 3 would be a solution to that problem. Earlier in the day, Tesla\nshowrooms around the world were flooded with eager customers who happily\nplunked down $1,000 deposits to reserve their cars.**See more of our top\nstories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**They didn’t know what the car looked like, how\nit would perform or even the exact price, but that didn't matter to the most\nardent of fans, some of whom camped out for hours overnight to be among the\nfirst in line for the car. The car won't become available until late 2017 at\nthe earliest.Analysts said the event more closely resembled the premiere of a\nblockbuster film or the latest food fad than the release of a new car.“Other\ncarmakers launch new models all the time and I don’t remember ever seeing this\nlevel of excitement,” said Max Zanan, co-founder and chief executive of IDDS\nGroup, an automotive consulting firm in New York. Tesla “has been able to\ncarve out their own customer base and that base is willing to delay purchasing\nother cars and wait for a Tesla.”Even with Thursday's excitement, critics say\nthe Model 3 may arrive too late to beat other equally affordable long-range\nplug-ins coming from major manufacturers, and it will be competing for a\nstubbornly small share of the car-buying public interested in plug-in electric\ntechnology.And there are doubts that the company can even get the car on the\nroad in a timely fashion.The industry publication Green Car Reports has said\nthe success or failure of the Model 3 \"will almost certainly make or break\nTesla as a car company.\"_Staff writer Shan Li contributed to this\nreport._**Twitter: @misterfleming ****MORE BUSINESS NEWS****Amazon plans fifth\nfulfillment center in the Inland Empire****Lazarus: Prudential pulls a fast\none on long-term care insurance policyholders****Yamashiro's new landlord\nseeks to evict longtime restaurant operator, possibly to go more upscale**\n\n","title":"Elon Musk says Tesla Model 3 pre-orders hit 180,000, but can he deliver? - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Elon Musk wows with the newly unveiled Tesla Model 3, nets 133,000 pre-orders https://t.co/M4qIQoqZ28 https://t.co/WS0dijDB4b","date":"Fri Apr 01 10:02:16 +0000 2016","favs":59,"id":{"$numberLong":"715841703517806595"},"retweets":50},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1M5Ad52"}

A handful zing,\nlike the sly poster that puts black bars across the eyes of male and female\nheadshots, indicating the old-fashioned pornography of the dominant male gaze\nthat fuels the problem. (Participating artists are listed at the entry but not\nassigned to individual posters.) I wish there were more like that.The show's\nstrength is in its data.In an interview two years ago, Hebron said the average\ngallery ratio of men to women is 70-30. Nothing at LACE suggests any change --\neven though a small number of galleries rate 50-50 or better.The question is\nwhy? What drives the stubborn sexist disparity?The short answer is: the\nmarket. Galleries are businesses, not social service agencies, and the market\nplainly feels more secure investing in the cultural production of men.Without\nclassic 1960s Pop art, especially Andy Warhol's, there would be no Robert\nMapplethorpe photographs as we know them from the 1970s and 1980s.That's the\nbig takeaway from a visit to \"Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Medium,\" a\nnewly opened, impressive two-museum exhibition.You won't see...Without classic\n1960s Pop art, especially Andy Warhol's, there would be no Robert Mapplethorpe\nphotographs as we know them from the 1970s and 1980s.That's the big takeaway\nfrom a visit to \"Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Medium,\" a newly opened,\nimpressive two-museum exhibition.You won't see...The reasons for that are\ncomplex, reverberating from the resale rooms and auction houses to established\nmuseums, where historical collections are inevitably dominated by men’s art.\nYet, the market itself is merely a reflection of larger social forces. In the\nU.S., at least, and probably elsewhere, I think another major factor is at\nwork.The over-representation of male artists is powerful psychic compensation\nfor the arts being socially and culturally gendered as feminine. Theater,\nmusic, dance, visual art -- those are activities largely assigned to girls,\nnot boys, as they grow up in America. Later, the adult human urge to regard\nthem seriously and with intensity butts up against fearful, deeply ingrained\ngender stereotypes.Over-valuing art by men at the expense of women puts a\nbeard on the issue.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc58b"},"content":"Donald Trump has backed off his suggestion that there “has to be some form of\npunishment\" for women who had abortions if the procedure were made illegal.\nThe original comment, in an interview with Chris Matthews on MSNBC, brought\ncondemnations down on Trump from abortion-rights supporters — including\nHillary Clinton — but also from anti-abortion spokespeople.As my colleague\nCarla Hall noted on this blog:“While antiabortion advocates have made it as\ndifficult as possible in various states for women to get an abortion, often\nuse language that equates abortion with murder, and hope for a day when Roe\nvs. Wade is overturned, rarely do they suggest criminalizing a woman seeking\nan abortion in that world. That’s, at least, in part because, politically,\neven they know what Trump apparently didn’t: No one would stand for that.”But\nthat is precisely why Trump’s original comment was so disruptive. It exposed a\ncontradiction in a lot of anti-abortion rhetoric that those activists cannot\nexplain away, hard as they try.If abortion is murder — or the moral equivalent\nthereof — it’s absurd to suggest that only the doctor who performs an abortion\nshould be  criminally responsible.There's something almost sweet about the way\nDemocrats and establishment Republicans are coming together over their shared\ndisgust with Donald Trump. Unable to find common ground on even the most basic\nissues (for instance, the constitutionality of nominating a Supreme Court\njustice during an election...There's something almost sweet about the way\nDemocrats and establishment Republicans are coming together over their shared\ndisgust with Donald Trump. Unable to find common ground on even the most basic\nissues (for instance, the constitutionality of nominating a Supreme Court\njustice during an election...That’s Trump’s new position:  \"The doctor or any\nother person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally\nresponsible, not the woman. The woman is a victim in this case as is the life\nin her womb.\"Put aside the paternalism of this explanation. (Women are pawns\nof presumably male doctors with no control over their own actions.) It defies\nlogic to suggest that a person who initiates criminal act ought to be immune\nto punishment for it. At the minimum, the woman who seeks an abortion is an\naccessory to murder — if you believe abortion is murder.Certainly many\nabortion foes regard having an abortion as a sin. Pope Francis, for example,\nhas empowered all priests to offer women absolution for the “sin of abortion”\nas part of the church’s “Year of Mercy.”   But a papal spokesman made clear\nthat forgiveness would be available only to “women who have had an abortion\nand have repented.” You don't have to repent if you weren't at fault.The\nsecular parallel to a sin is a crime. Murder is both a violation of the 10\nCommandments and an offense against the civil law. Committing murder incurs\npenalties both spiritual and penal: prison in this life, hellfire or Purgatory\nin the next. Why should it be any different for abortion — if abortion is\nmurder?Trump was on solid logical ground in his first answer if you accept the\n“abortion is murder” premise. And many abortion foes cling to that premise\nbecause it provides moral clarity to their crusade. If they were admit that\nabortion, while the taking of a life, was something less than murder, that\nclarity would disappear and their message would be muddled.But, as a matter of\nlogic, they can’t have it both ways any more than Trump can.**Follow Michael\nMcGough on Twitter @MichaelMcGough3**\n\n","title":"Trump's abortion 'gaffe' exposed an anti-abortion contradiction - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Trump's abortion 'gaffe' exposed an anti-abortion contradiction https://t.co/oh8V7leari via @latimesopinion https://t.co/8yLYeYeIeb","date":"Fri Apr 01 08:50:08 +0000 2016","favs":21,"id":{"$numberLong":"715823551983591424"},"retweets":30},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1RPNSiH"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc58e"},"content":"As Amazon Inc. moves to shrink delivery times from days to hours, it's\nspreading its enormous inventory across a growing network of warehouses on the\noutskirts of the nation's biggest cities.Within this strategy, San Bernardino\nhas emerged as a key player thanks to its abundance of affordable land,\nproximity to ports and access to one of the nation's biggest consumer\nmarkets.Amazon this week doubled down on the city 60 miles east of Los Angeles\nby announcing plans for its second facility there, a cavernous 1.1-million-\nsquare-foot space that will briefly warehouse items such as books, electronics\nand toys while adding 1,000 new full-time jobs.\"San Bernardino has proven to\nbe an important part of Amazon's growth in California, and we are proud to\ncontinue creating jobs and helping support the economy here in the Inland\nEmpire,\" Akash Chauhan, Amazon's vice president of North American operations,\nsaid in a prepared statement.The new facility will be Amazon's fifth\nfulfillment center — the company's term for warehouse — in the Inland Empire\nand seventh in California. It maintains similar facilities in Moreno Valley,\nRedlands, Rialto, Patterson and Tracy. Its first in the Golden State opened in\n2012 in San Bernardino, a facility that now has 1,500 employees.Analysts\nestimate the company has about 120 fulfillment centers worldwide, about 100 of\nthem in the U.S.Their rapid expansion began in earnest several years ago,\naided by Amazon's move to pay local sales taxes in several states such as\nCalifornia. In the past, the company avoided having a physical presence in\nsome states to skirt taxes.Beyond that, the $282-billion company is growing at\nabout 20% a year, well above the 12% clip for e-commerce as a whole, analysts\nsaid. More fulfillment centers are needed to sustain that expansion — all\nwhile Amazon keeps adding new businesses such as AmazonFresh, its grocery\ndelivery service, and Amazon Dash, a button that, when pressed, automatically\norders hundreds of different home goods such as paper towels and\ndetergent.\"They're also rapidly trying to establish a more localized presence\naround all the major metropolitan areas so they can provide faster, and in\nsome cases, cheaper delivery,\" said Colin Sebastian, an analyst at Robert W.\nBaird \u0026amp; Co. \"Ultimately, Amazon wants to deliver anything to anybody, all\nwithin a couple hours.\"Driving that goal is the rising popularity of Amazon\nPrime, the subscription service offered by the e-commerce giant that includes\nfree-two-day shipping for orders.Membership for Amazon Prime grew 35% last\nyear to 54 million, according to Consumer Intelligence Research\nPartners.That's significant because Prime members spend on average $1,100 a\nyear on Amazon compared with $600 for non-members.Amazon encourages merchants\nselling on its platform to warehouse their products in its giant fulfillment\ncenters for a fee. For merchants, that's the only way to get their wares on\nPrime — and it can be cheaper than having their own warehouses. For Amazon,\nit's additional revenue and a way to help ensure items are delivered on\ntime.It's another example of how Amazon wants to not only dominate the sale\nand delivery of goods, but also form its own logistics empire.**SIGN UP for\nthe free California Inc. business newsletter \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**In early March, the\nSeattle company announced it is leasing 20 Boeing 767 jets to inch into the\nair freight business. A month earlier, internal documents leaked to Bloomberg\noutlined Amazon's plans to replace FedEx, UPS and DHL along parts of its\nsupply chain. It has already purchased thousands of trucks and trailers — and\nflirted with the idea of delivery drones.\"They see the areas of shipping and\ntransportation logistics and believe they can do it more efficiently and\ncheaper than someone else,\" Sebastian said.Those ambitions start at home with\nfulfillment centers in little known bedroom communities like such as Avenel,\nN.J., Chester, Va., and Coppell, Texas.The Inland Empire — with its proximity\nto the nation's largest port complex and vast stretches of open land — has\nmorphed into a warehouse hub for trucks arriving daily from ports and rail\nyards.Local politicians have encouraged the expansion of the logistics\nindustry, which includes truck drivers, inventory managers and warehouse\nworkers who take part in the global movement of goods.In 2015, warehousing and\nstorage jobs alone accounted for 12% of job growth in Riverside and San\nBernardino counties — a key sector in a region that was battered by the last\ndecade's recession and housing collapse.\"Why here?\" said Chris Thornberg,\nfounding partner of Beacon Economics. \"Try and get eight acres to put up a\ngiant, modern warehouse in Orange County and L.A. Not going to happen.\"The\nrapid expansion hasn't been without controversy, having raised concerns over\nair pollution and the quality of jobs created.Wages vary widely from sales\nrepresentatives making more than $35 an hour to entry-level warehouse laborers\nwho typically take in less than $12 an hour.A 2013 UC Riverside survey of\nwarehouse workers found that about 60% of those employed at Southern\nCalifornia facilities worked for temp agencies, often with no health benefits\nand no guarantees of hours.But Thornberg said the benefit of the logistics\nindustry is that it's providing jobs to those with no more than a high school\neducation while offering the possibility for advancement.\"It's an important\nsector for growth in the region,\" he said.Amazon said the new facility will\noffer employees \"competitive hourly wages and a comprehensive benefits\npackage, including healthcare.\"The new jobs will be welcomed in a city mired\nin bankruptcy and struggling with crime and high unemployment. Last year, the\nunemployment rate averaged 11.5%, compared with 6.2% statewide.\"We are excited\nAmazon continues to view San Bernardino as a great place to do business, and\nwe're proud to be part of Amazon's history and future,\" San Bernardino Mayor\nR. Carey Davis said in a statement.How safe those local jobs are in the future\nis open to debate. Amazon bought robot maker Kiva Systems for $775 million in\n2012.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc590"},"content":"Is there really zero media coverage when terrorist attacks happen in countries\noutside Europe and the U.S., as many have alleged on social media?Of course\nnot: Many outlets cover the Middle East and Africa, and recent attacks in both\nhave garnered headlines worldwide. Still, some social media users insist\nentire portions of the globe are ignored. Why?The answer is complicated. The\ntruth is, these stories are covered by the media, though certainly less\nthoroughly when a bomb goes off in Baghdad as opposed to Brussels. The\nperception of what gets covered, and what doesn't, reflects how people view\nand relate to the world and to their location, according to terrorism and\nmedia experts.Professor Robert Pape of the University of Chicago heads the\nChicago Project on Security \u0026amp; Terrorism, which studies and tracks suicide\nbombings around the globe. He said that when people learn about a terrorist\nattack, it evokes more fear when it happens in a place they've visited or\nthought of visiting, or if they know someone who lives or has traveled\nthere.It boils down to empathy and how easily we can visualize ourselves in\nthe proverbial shoes of the victims. Professor Alexa Tullett teaches\npsychology at the University of Alabama and studies empathy and how people\nunderstand and relate to major events. Her work supports the idea that people\njust have trouble empathizing with people who live entirely different lives.\nBasically, when attacks happen in Paris or Brussels, many people in the\ndeveloped world can easily imagine themselves becoming a victim -- can see\nthemselves watching a concert in France or boarding a train in Belgium. Movies\nand TV shows are regularly filmed in Western Europe. And although news\norganizations often have bureaus or reporters in major European countries,\nthey rarely have dedicated correspondents in places like West\nAfrica.\"Terrorism is a personal issue,\" Pape explained. And proximity is part\nof that: Attacks in Europe are much closer to us, geographically, than attacks\nin Nigeria or Iraq.It's also a matter of empathy fatigue: We lack the\nemotional capacity to feel bad for every single person every time something\nbad happens. \"It's not pleasant to experience these negative emotions when you\nhear about the suffering of other people, so naturally we feel selective about\nwho we have that empathy for,\" Tullett said. Race is a part of it, but not all\nof it, she said: \"If there are a lot of barriers to picturing ourselves in\nthose situations, it's just harder for us to go through. It takes a lot of\neffort and it doesn't come naturally.\"This all creates something of a vicious\ncycle for news outlets. News is by definition the unusual and unexpected, so\nthe rare attack in Brussels will generate more page views and clicks and\nshares than, say, a suicide bombing in Baghdad. And because there's obvious\ninterest, more follow-up stories are written.As a result, those same news\nconsumers might see less coverage from a portion of the world less familiar to\nthem -- and so have fewer opportunities to empathize with the victims. And so\non.In addition to the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels, here are some\nof the attacks that have taken place around the world in the last six\nmonths.**Lahore, Pakistan:** At least 70 people died on Easter Sunday when a\nsuicide bomb went off at a public park. Most victims were women and children.\nFacebook activated its Safety Check feature, which invites people near a\ndisaster or terrorist attack to quickly notify Facebook friends that they are\nsafe. The company didn't get the geolocation quite right, however, and the\nfeature alarmed and confused people worldwide.**Iskandariya, Iraq: **Two days\nbefore the Easter attack on Lahore and just a few days after the attack in\nBrussels, a suicide bombing at a stadium 30 miles outside of Baghdad killed 41\npeople.**Ankara, Turkey: **The Turkish capital suffered bombings that killed\n34 people this month and 28 in February. An attack at a peace rally in October\nclaimed nearly 100 lives.**Istanbul, Turkey: **A suicide bomber killed four\npeople and injured 61 in March.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc594"},"content":"Almost two-thirds of California voters believe that illegal immigration is a\nmajor problem in the state, but by even larger majorities they reject the idea\nof mass deportations and favor allowing those currently living in the country\nwithout authorization to stay and apply for citizenship.The latest USC\nDornsife/Los Angeles Times statewide poll found that 62% of voters said they\nbelieved illegal immigration in California is at least a major problem, with\n23% calling it a crisis. By contrast, 36% said the issue was a small problem\nor not a problem at all.But the state’s voters reject the sorts of measures\nproposed by Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, who has called\nfor a deportation force to expel the estimated 11 million immigrants living in\nthe country illegally.More than three-fourths of voters said they believed\nimmigrants who are already here should be allowed to stay. Sixty-five percent\nsaid such immigrants should be allowed to apply for U.S. citizenship, while\n14% said they should be allowed to stay and work legally in the country but\nnot apply for citizenship. Only 16% said that they should be required to leave\nthe country.By more than 2 to 1, voters said they opposed building a wall\nalong the southern U.S. border to prevent immigrants from entering illegally,\nanother hallmark of Trump’s campaign.“A lot of what has been talked about\ndoesn’t seem viable to most voters,” said pollster Randall Gutermuth of the\nRepublican polling firm American Viewpoint, part of the bipartisan team that\nconducted the survey for The Times and USC.Just 36% of Republican voters\nlikely to participate in the state’s primary in June said immigrants already\nhere should be required to leave, he noted. Only 8% of likely voters in the\nDemocratic primary took that position.“It is definitely not accurate to say\nthat this mass-deportation language is the majority opinion, including of the\nRepublican Party” in California, Gutermuth said.Republicans, however, are far\nmore likely to see illegal immigration as a serious problem, with half of\nlikely primary voters viewing it as a crisis and another 42% calling it a\nmajor problem.The poll showed that opinions on illegal immigration vary widely\ndepending on age. The significant generational divide suggests immigration\ncould be among the issues that are separating the GOP from younger voters in\nCalifornia.Older Californians are much more likely than their younger\ncounterparts to view illegal immigration as a crisis, the poll found. While\nmore than a third of voters 65 and older think illegal immigration is a\ncrisis, just 8% of voters age 18 to 29 think that. One in five voters 65 and\nolder favor requiring immigrants in the country illegally to leave, compared\nwith 1 in 10 of those 18 to 29.That can partly be explained by the fact that\nyounger voters in the state are more likely to be minorities. But even among\nwhite voters, there is a big age gap.Just 10% of whites aged 18 to 29 said\nthey felt there was an immigration crisis, according to the poll, compared\nwith 76% of whites over the age of 64.Manuel Pastor, director of USC’s Center\nfor the Study of Immigrant Integration, said younger voters are more likely to\nbe open-minded toward immigration in part because of how and where they grew\nup.“People of color have been the majority in the state of California since\n1999,” Pastor said. “Really the debate about immigrants is a debate about\nidentity. And younger people are much more likely than older generations to\nhave experienced some diversity in their schools and their own life.”That is\nthe case for Jonathan Danielson, 28, a poll respondent who grew up in Palo\nAlto alongside immigrants and the children of immigrants from Asia and the\nMiddle East. Now an Army officer stationed in Alaska, Danielson serves\nalongside a diverse group of soldiers who have helped shape his views on\nimmigration, he said.He believes immigrants who entered the country illegally\nor overstayed visas should be allowed to stay and apply for citizenship.“If\nthey’re here, and they’re contributing, they deserve a shot,” he said. “I was\njust born here; that doesn’t make me any better than somebody who risked their\nlives and traveled thousands of miles to come here.”For Danielson, even\nillegal immigration is a positive sign for the country.“The fact that the U.S.\nis a draw for people looking to improve their situation seems like a good sign\nfor us,” he said. “Having different perspectives gives you better solutions.”A\nDemocrat, Danielson said he and some of his peers are turned off from the\nRepublican Party in part because leaders like Trump have demonized\nimmigrants.California Republicans are about to experience an event many of\nthem have never seen — a primary that could determine a presidential\nnomination.Because Donald Trump lost Ohio’s primary on Tuesday night, ceding\nthe state’s 66 delegates to its governor, John Kasich, the race to claim the\n1,237 delegates...California Republicans are about to experience an event many\nof them have never seen — a primary that could determine a presidential\nnomination.Because Donald Trump lost Ohio’s primary on Tuesday night, ceding\nthe state’s 66 delegates to its governor, John Kasich, the race to claim the\n1,237 delegates...“It’s definitely a part of it,” Danielson said. “These guys\nare still spouting this rhetoric about nameless, faceless immigrants, and\nwe’re going, ‘These people are our friends, we grew up with them,’.” he\nsaid.That is starkly different than the views embraced by John Leary, 71, a\nretired aerospace engineer who lives outside San Jose and who also responded\nto the poll.“These people are criminals. They don’t respect the country,”\nLeary said of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. “I want them to be put in jail\nor thrown out of the country. I don’t want to be a person who is supporting\ncriminal activity.”Leary, who grew up in what he described as a racially\ninsular neighborhood in Philadelphia and moved to California as a young man,\nsaid he has been dismayed as the state has grown more Latino.“It’s rapidly\nbecoming Hispanic because we have huge numbers of criminal Hispanics in the\ncountry” as a result of illegal immigration, he said.Leary said he believes\nyounger voters don’t care as much about illegal immigration because they\naren’t shouldering the costs.“The older voters are paying the taxes,” he said.\n“The younger generation doesn’t have the responsibilities.”Here is the\nmethodology statement for the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll.Greenberg\nQuinlan Rosner Research, in conjunction with American Viewpoint, conducted\nthis survey on behalf of the University of Southern California Dornsife\nCollege of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles Times....Here is the\nmethodology statement for the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll.Greenberg\nQuinlan Rosner Research, in conjunction with American Viewpoint, conducted\nthis survey on behalf of the University of Southern California Dornsife\nCollege of Letters, Arts and Sciences and the Los Angeles Times....The\nCalifornia poll findings echoed those of a recent national poll that showed\nthat a generational split on immigration is present among Republican voters\nacross the country.That poll, published this week by the Public Religion\nResearch Institute, found that younger Republicans are much more likely to\nhave favorable views of immigration and to support a path to citizenship for\nimmigrants in the United States illegally than are older Republican voters. A\nsimilar generational divide has shown up among Republicans on issues such as\nsame-sex marriage, polls have shown.Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M. Unruh\nInstitute of Politics at USC, said the USC/Times poll’s findings on\nimmigration could present some opportunities for Republicans.While the poll\nfound that a majority of voters don’t support mass deportation or a border\nwall, it highlighted voter concerns about state resources going to immigrants\nin the country illegally.The poll found 50% of voters opposed allowing\nimmigrants in the country illegally to qualify for student loans at state\nuniversities, compared with 46% who support that. It found that by 52% to 43%,\nvoters opposed extending Medi-Cal, the state healthcare program for low-income\nfamilies, to all immigrants living here illegally, rather than only children,\nas is now the law.Forty-seven percent of voters supported a ban on “sanctuary\ncities,” which refuse to hand immigrants suspected of being in the U.S.\nwithout permission over to federal immigration authorities for deportation\nafter they have been arrested for crimes.

By 10 p.m., roughly\n133,000 pre-orders had been placed. 115,000 pre-orders was so one hour ago.At\nthe Tesla event in Hawthorne, a massive screen in the main hall continued to\ntabulate the number of Model 3 pre-orders taken worldwide. More than 115,000\nwhen Musk began his presentation, it had hit 132,000 around 10 p.m. and was\nstill climbing.The Model 3 won't be delivered until late 2017 at the earliest,\nbut a select few people got to take a ride in the new electric vehicle\nThursday night.In groups of three, the auto press and special guests were\nchauffeured along a half-mile track. By general agreement, the car is sleek,\nsilent and smart-looking. A comfortable five-seater, it was roomy enough to\nfit a 6'3\" driver and leave leg room for the 6' passenger behind him. The use\nof a single piece of glass to cover the rear seating area increased the roomy\nfeeling. The ride included a short straightaway section long enough to allow\none burst of electric acceleration for which Teslas are deservedly famous.At\n10 p.m., after this reporter had taken his spin, there were still dozens of\nothers eager to ride.Tesla raked it in Thursday, accepting 115,000 pre-orders\nof the Model 3 before the car was even unveiled to the public.With the car\nboasting a starting price tag of $35,000, numbers-savvy people online were\nquick to point out that that's a cool $4 billion for Tesla. But not quite -\npeople put down deposits of $1,000 with the option to cancel anytime. Still,\nthat's a lot of dough.Tesla has had trouble delivering its cars on time in the\npast, but Musk says things will be different with the Model 3. The\nentrepreneur got a big laugh from the audience when he said the electric\nvehicle would be delivered next year and \"I do feel fairly confident it will\nbe next year.\"At $35,000, Musk promised \"you will not be able to buy a better\ncar, any better car, for less than that.\"The Model S and X made the Model 3\npossible. So to all of you who bought an S or an X, thanks for paying for\nthis.All Model 3s are expected to come standard with\nsupercharging.Supercharger stations, located throughout the U.S., are billed\nas a way to let Tesla owners charge their cars within minutes.  \nBy 2017, Musk hopes to double the number of superchargers and quadruple the\nnumber of destination chargers available to Tesla owners. That's about 7,200\nsuperchargers and 15,000 destination chargers.A lot about having a car is\nabout freedom -- going where you want to go. The supercharger is critical to\nthat.Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, speaking to an adoring crowd of Tesla\nfans, pronounced the Model 3 a great success upon its birth tonight in\nHawthorne. Pulling the covers off the fourth vehicle in the company's short\nhistory, Musk declared that more than 115,000 vehicles had been pre-ordered in\nthe last 24 hours.The lower, sleeker Tesla – at least 20% smaller in stature\nthan its bigger brother, the Model S  – will be able to go from 0 to 60 in\nless than six seconds in its most affordable configuration. That version also\nwill be fitted with Tesla's \"autopilot\" features, which have helped the car be\namong the safest on highways.Standing before a collection of new Model 3s,\nMusk reminded the audience that this car represents the culmination of a long-\nheld dream to bring affordable, zero-pollution vehicles to the world's\nhighways. **Price: **$35,000**Safety: **5-star safety rating in every\ncategory**Speed: **Base model will go from 0 to 60 mph in less than six\nseconds, with some models that go faster.**Range: **EPA rating of at least 215\nmiles per charge**Other features:** autopilot hardware, fits five adults\ncomfortably, front and rear cargo trunks\n\n","title":"Tesla Model 3: Elon Musk unveils the Model 3 to huge fanfare - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Tesla Model 3 Live Updates: Musk seems confident in 2017 delivery date https://t.co/BItufFDzWe","date":"Fri Apr 01 04:56:32 +0000 2016","favs":45,"id":{"$numberLong":"715764761326186496"},"retweets":28},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1X1z3be"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc596"},"content":"I'm old enough to remember when the situational prohibition of legal tobacco\nproducts was seen as an unusual but necessary intervention to protect the\nhealth of serially exposed nonusers. It was a more innocent time, really.When\nCalifornia first banned smoking in almost all bars and restaurants in 1998, we\nlonely objectors were seen as property rights fanatics and/or civil\nlibertarian dead-enders, clinging to “slippery slope” arguments about the\npersonal activities that emboldened lawmakers might prohibit next.In its zeal\nto stand up to the tobacco industry, the California Legislature has gone too\nfar with a new package of proposed laws that would trample on the rights of\nadults — yes, even smokers have rights! — and prematurely treat electronic\ncigarettes the same as their dangerous smoke-based brethren.In its zeal to\nstand up to the tobacco industry, the California Legislature has gone too far\nwith a new package of proposed laws that would trample on the rights of adults\n— yes, even smokers have rights! — and prematurely treat electronic cigarettes\nthe same as their dangerous smoke-based brethren.Well, that slope done\nslipped. Today, the Dodgers will play their first-ever home game without\nchewing tobacco, not because they finally realized it's disgusting, but\nbecause it's now, absurdly, illegal. Local politicians have served final\nnotice that they recognize no restraints on their power to protect you from\nyourself.The L.A. City Council, which approved the ordinance by a 14-0 vote in\nJanuary, said in a statement upon passage that the ban was necessary, in part,\nto protect “the health of the players.”Chewing tobacco smells bad, stains your\nteeth and will eat away at your lip and gums if you do it too much. It is also\n— importantly! — legal for adults, less harmful than cigarettes and even less\ncompatible with daily life than smoking has become. (I suspect I wasn't the\nonly teenage ballplayer whose dipping days came to an abrupt and happy ending\nthe moment it became remotely conceivable to kiss girls.)For more than a\ncentury and a half, baseball players have used the leaf for its pleasant\nlittle buzz, and its diversion from the sport's long stretches of pastoral\nboredom. Lawmakers are trying to break that culture by force, and the result\nis farcical.If Clayton Kershaw, who deserves every dollar of his $1 million\nper start (at least during the regular season), were sighted in Chavez Ravine\nwith some chaw in his cheek, the 28-year-old All-Star could be charged with an\ninfraction and fined — the same punishment as someone found defecating in\npublic.The City Council says it wants “to set the right example for America's\nyouth.” I guess the lesson is: Don't get too famous, or else your otherwise\nlegal personal habits will become subject to the whims of attention-seeking\npoliticians.As Councilman David Ryu explained: “Our kids shouldn't be forced\nto watch the sports heroes they trust using tobacco. It's important we hold\nprofessional athletes accountable when it comes to protecting our children and\nneighborhoods.”But to paraphrase Bryce Harper, that's a clown justification,\nbro. “Professional athletes” are to “protecting neighborhoods” what opera\nsingers are to garbage collection.And it apparently needs to be said that\nnobody on this earth is forcing little Johnny Shortstop to watch baseball on\nTV, let alone derive any positive life lessons from people who can handle\n90-mph sliders. (Hey Johnny: Please don't Google Lenny Dykstra.)What makes the\nnew ordinance even more nauseating than swallowing a gulp of Red Man runoff is\nthe fact that the council members' sanctimonious sense of public health\nextends only as far as their own bottom lines.Consider this: Smoking in city\nparks has been illegal since 2007, because of concerns over secondhand smoke\nand brush fires, with the exception of dedicated areas at the Greek Theatre,\nthe Los Angeles Zoo, the Autry National Center and a handful of municipal golf\ncourses. Why did city-owned turf receive a get-out-of-smoking-ban-free\ncard?“There is a tradition of golfers oftentimes smoking in specific areas of\na golf course,” Recreation and Parks Department official Kevin Regan explained\npersuasively to the City Council at the time, “and we don't want to have any\neffects on our revenue.”Imagine how the City Council would treat a private\nbusiness owner who made the same argument.Hypocrisy aside, let's remember what\nwe have already sacrificed. Not only did the slippery slope of restrictive\npaternalism slide effortlessly into prohibitions against everything from fast\nfood joints in South L.A. to bacon-dog carts downtown, but smoking ban\nproponents have gone to lengths unimaginable as recently as the 1990s. Santa\nMonica came within a whisker of banning smoking in apartments. The federal\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development is considering a smoking ban in\nall nationwide public housing units, a number that nears 1 million.We are\ntreating tobacco users like lepers, even when their activities pose no risk to\nbystanders. In the process, we are forgetting the difference between what the\ngovernment can and should do. As the great Cubs Manager Joe Maddon, a former\ntobacco chewer, told reporters this month after Chicago followed L.A.'s lead\n(yet again!), “I'm not into over-legislating the human race.”Maybe baseball\nprofessionals can teach us something after all._Matt Welch is editor in chief\nof Reason and a contributing writer to Opinion._**Follow the Opinion section\non Twitter ****@latimesopinion**** and ****Facebook**\n\n","title":"Chewing tobacco at ballparks is disgusting, but it shouldn't be illegal - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Chewing tobacco at ballparks is disgusting, but it shouldn't be illegal https://t.co/RjKo776QMY via @latimesopinion https://t.co/3k37z049Pi","date":"Fri Apr 01 04:40:09 +0000 2016","favs":48,"id":{"$numberLong":"715760641869524992"},"retweets":35},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1WZY1aZ"}

He published\nhis first book, \"The Thomas Berryman Number,\" in 1976 when he was working at\nthe advertising firm J. Walter Thompson. He couldn't quite kick the ad habit —\nhe stayed and rose to the top of the agency — but, he jokes, \"I've been clean\nfor 23 years now.\"Patterson could have stuck to his winning model of writing\nthrillers for adults, but concern for his son Jack, when he was 8, prompted\nPatterson to think about kids and books.\"He wasn't a big reader,\" Patterson\nsaid during a phone call from his house in Palm Beach, Fla. \"So we got him a\ndozen books — all the books we thought he was going to like, ranging from\n'Percy Jackson' to 'A Wrinkle in Time' — and made him read every day for an\nentire summer.\"It worked — from that summer on his son became an avid\nreader.Patterson began writing books for children, and by 2015 he had decided\nto start his own children's line of middle-grade and YA books called Jimmy\nPatterson — the list includes the reprint of \"Middle School: The Worst Years\nof My Life,\" written with Chris Tebbetts and which has been adapted to a movie\nto be released in October.Author James Patterson makes a cameo in the upcoming\nfilm \"Middle School,\" based on his book. Author James Patterson makes a cameo\nin the upcoming film \"Middle School,\" based on his book. He started a website\ncalled ReadKiddoRead, which helps teachers and librarians and features book\nreviews, author contributions and book giveaways.Yet he hasn't forgotten about\nhis adult readers. In March, Patterson announced a publishing venture called\nBookShots — short books of no more than 150 pages.\"Look around you, the world\nis going fast,\" Patterson explained. \"A lot of people don't want to read books\nthat are long. These books are inspired by the novella.\"------------**FOR THE\nRECORD****March 31, 5:40 p.m.:** An earlier version of this article quoted\nJames Patterson as saying, \"People don't want to read books that are long.\" It\nhas been corrected with his complete quote. The article also stated that \"By\n2012, he had added to his body of work six young-adult novels.\" He had begun\nwork on those books. The article also stated that Patterson would write \"about\nhalf the BookShots.\" He will write or co-write all the BookShots, except the\nromances. The post also stated: \"The next round of funds for school libraries\nwill be announced late this year.\" The announcement was made March 30.**April\n1, 9:30 a.m.:** An earlier version of this article stated, \"Patterson set up a\nfund of $1.75 million with Scholastic Books and disbursed the money to public\nlibraries across the country.\" The fund is for school libraries.------------\nBookShots will be available in print and as e-books, priced at $4.99 for print\nand $3.99 as an e-book. The first BookShots title will be released June 7; one\nis timed to the presidential elections: \"Trump v. Clinton.\"Elmore Leonard was\nonce asked at what point did he start becoming successful, Patterson recalls.\nLeonard responded, \"When I left out the parts that people skimmed.\" These\nbooks follow that philosophy.Patterson will write or co-write all the\nBookShots, save the romances. His strategy is to \"get people reading who do\nnot read as much.\"It's the drive to get people — adults and kids — to read\nthat inspired Patterson's many efforts to bolster the literary world.In 2014,\nhe gave $1 million to independent bookstores nationwide. \"For the individual\nstores,\" Patterson explained, \"the money is beneficial in terms of morale and\nto shine a light on the stores for publicity. It draws attention to the\nproblem that you actually have to stop in the store — not just that your town\nhas one.\"The following year, he distributed $250,000 in holiday bonuses to\nbookstore employees. Each was nominated by peers or customers.Also in 2015,\nPatterson set up a fund of $1.75 million with Scholastic Books and disbursed\nthe money to school libraries across the country. It too had a nominating\nprocess for libraries in need.\"Within the first 10 days of the program we got\n28,000 pleas for help from libraries,\" Patterson said. He realized that effort\nwasn't enough. \"We're doing it again this year. We will help a couple thousand\nlibraries — and in the process help draw attention to them from local\ngovernments.\"The next round of funds for school libraries was announced March\n30 (the deadline for applications to nominate a school is May 31;\nwww.scholastic.com/pattersonpartnership).He has also set up a program that\nawards scholarships to college students studying to be teachers at more than\n20 colleges and universities, including those he and his wife had attended —\nManhattan College, Vanderbilt and University of Wisconsin — with strict\nguidelines: \"If you lose a kid in the program, you lose the scholarship,\"\nPatterson said.For Patterson, the desire to support literacy came from his\nupbringing in Newburgh, N.Y., in the 1950s. \"It's the way my family was,\" he\nsaid. \"It was the way of small-town America. So I decided to focus on an area\nthat I understood — let's get our kids reading.\"_Rotella is the author of\n\"Stolen Figs\" and \"Amore: The Story of Italian American Song.\"__Patterson will\nreceive the Los Angeles Times Book Prize's Innovator's Award on __April 9._\n\n","title":"James Patterson, the world's bestselling author, on his many efforts to support reading.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc59c"},"content":"On a Thursday night 50 years ago, at the height of the table grape harvest in\nCalifornia's Central Valley, hundreds of Mexican American farmworkers crowded\nexpectantly into a Delano church hall. Most had worked their usual shifts in\nthe vineyards, and many had stopped off after work at celebrations to mark\nMexican Independence Day. The overflow crowd spilled into the church yard,\nexcited and scared, angry and brave.They were tired of being treated like\ndisposable farm tools. Tired of being cheated out of even their meager wages.\nTired of watching their mothers and sisters humiliated and harassed. Tired of\nbeing stripped of dignity. Tired of being invisible.Many had never met the man\nwho rose to speak, who would throw the spark that ignited fires that would\nturn la causa into front-page news. He, too, was still largely invisible.\nShort, dark-skinned, not physically prepossessing or particularly well spoken.\nHe looked like one of them. That was part of his power.Cesar Chavez knew even\nthen that he was making history Sept. 16, 1965, as he called on members of the\nNational Farm Workers Assn. to take a strike vote. He saved his notes. Later\nhe would save much more, even tape recordings to preserve history verbatim.\nThe notes for his talk at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church are a road map to the\nuprising that followed, laying out the moral code he would use to lead a\nmovement: unity, religion, revolution, patience and sacrifice.Chavez did not\nstart the 1965 grape strike. On Sept. 8, Filipino members of a different\nunion, the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee, had walked out of the\nvineyards, demanding an increase in pay to $1.40 an hour from $1.25. Filipinos\nwere the packers and Mexicans were the pickers. Growers, who had long pitted\none ethnic group against another, began to replace the striking Filipinos with\nMexicans — despite qualms they might not be skilled enough to pack\ngrapes.Unless Mexicans honored the AWOC picket lines, the strike would\ncollapse. Chavez knew he had no choice. “We must take risks if we are going to\nmove forward,” he had written to a colleague in the early days of building his\nunion. He selected the date and place of the strike-vote meeting with care.\nWhen David takes on Goliath, every little advantage helps. Mexican\nIndependence Day celebrations emboldened workers, and Chavez capitalized on\nthe symbolism, comparing farmworkers' struggles to that of the Mexicans who\nrevolted against Spanish rulers.Father Hidalgo launched the Mexican Revolution\non Sept. 16, 1810, Chavez reminded the workers, a holy crusade. The priest\nattached a portrait of Our Lady of Guadalupe to his lance as he headed into\nbattle, just as Chavez would lead marches behind the banner of the patron\nsaint of Mexicans. Hidalgo was martyred for the cause, Chavez recounted. But\nthe cause lived on. We will conquer the growers just as the Mexicans conquered\nthose who enslaved them, he told the workers. It was fitting to begin “our\ncrusade” in a church.As more cities adopt higher minimum wages, California is\nbecoming a confusing patchwork of pay scales and wage regulations. This poses\nmultiple challenges for businesses: compliance headaches for those whose\nterritories cross municipal boundaries, competitive challenges for those in\nhigher-wage...As more cities adopt higher minimum wages, California is\nbecoming a confusing patchwork of pay scales and wage regulations. This poses\nmultiple challenges for businesses: compliance headaches for those whose\nterritories cross municipal boundaries, competitive challenges for those in\nhigher-wage...Chavez understood the struggle would be long and hard, not only\nagainst the growers. He had spent the last three years going town to town in\nthe San Joaquin Valley, talking to workers, trying to persuade them to join\nhis organization, trying to build a union strong enough to strike. He thinned\nbeets when dues didn't pay the rent, watched his kids suffer malnutrition and\nsometimes fought off his own “gut tearing fear.” His challenge was to instill\nhope in workers who believed they had no power — enough hope to overcome\nfear.“I start out by telling them this is a movement (un movimiento) and that\nwe are trying to find the solution to the problem,” he wrote to his mentor,\ndescribing how he organized in small groups. “I tell them I'm looking for the\ntrue workers who depend 100% on farm work to make a living.... I say that this\nworker is not recognized because he is white, brown or black but is recognized\nbecause his back aches with the torture of farm work and his shoulders are\nstooped with the weight of injustice.”The idea of uniting workers of different\nraces was in itself revolutionary, and the leaders of both unions recognized\nits importance. Mexicans and Filipinos would have to overcome the distrust\nthat had been deliberately sowed for years.Above all, Chavez valued sacrifice.\nHe told the workers they would need to sacrifice, and they did. They gave up\njobs, homes, cars. They faced brothers and cousins across picket lines. They\nate at communal kitchens, took care of one another's kids, set up a makeshift\nclinic.They did things they had never dreamed they could do. They walked 300\nmiles along Highway 99 on a pilgrimage to Sacramento. Blocked buses that tried\nto bring scabs into the fields. Moved to cities across the country where they\nknew no one to stand in parking lots asking consumers to boycott grapes.The\ntwo unions formed the United Farm Workers of America, and the strike that grew\nfrom the vote in that Delano church lasted five years. Thousands were swept up\nby the crusade, and their lives were never the same. Chavez went from\nanonymity to the cover of Time magazine in a scant four years. The UFW\nnegotiated dozens of contracts and gained tens of thousands of members — and\nthen stopped organizing and lost nearly all of them. (In the fields today, the\nonly Cesar Chavez most workers know is a famous Mexican boxer.)The lessons the\nfarmworkers learned about their own power lasted a lot longer than the\ncontracts, but not nearly long enough._Miriam Pawel is the author of \"The\nCrusades of Cesar Chavez: A Biography,\" winner of the 2015 Robert F.

The\nofficer, Jason Lai, has been charged with misdemeanor counts of unlawful\naccess and use of criminal and motor vehicle databases.Martin Halloran,\npresident of the San Francisco Police Officers Assn., issued a statement\ncondemning “the appalling racist behavior committed by a handful of\nofficers.”“They have disgraced the uniform and their profession,” Halloran\nsaid. “This conduct will not be tolerated in the SFPD nor in the POA. Chief\nSuhr has the full support of the POA to take appropriate disciplinary action\nthat protects the due process rights of the officers.”Gascon said the newly\ndiscovered texts show the scandal last year was not as isolated as some\nbelieved.“It is horrifying from a purely operational point: Here we go again,\nhaving to spend a lot of time trying to figure out how many cases were\nimpacted,” Gascon said. “On a moral level, it is also horrifying because it\nshows that racial and homophobic bias is impacting the quality of the\nadministration of justice.”He said the texts “used the N-word profusely and\nwere also derogatory toward members of the LGBT community.”The previous\nscandal led to the dismissal of 13 pending criminal cases.

The army\nspoke out against the act. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said it did not\n“represent the values of the Israeli Defense Forces.” Palestinian officials\nand many ordinary Israelis joined the chorus of revulsion over what appeared\nto many to be a gratuitous act of vengeance.------------**FOR THE\nRECORD****April 1, 2:23 p.m.:** Israeli soldier: An article in the April 1 A\nsection described a Palestinian who was killed by an Israeli soldier as a\nprotester.

On Thursday, the\nmurder charge was downgraded to manslaughter.Netanyahu also changed his tone,\nmeeting with the father of the accused soldier and issuing a statement that\nexpressed sympathy, if not full support.The Israeli soldier captured on camera\nfatally shooting a suspected Palestinian assailant in the head after he was\nalready disarmed and lying on the ground will face murder charges, an Israeli\nmilitary court ruled Friday.The three-minute cellphone video shot in Hebron by\na Palestinian man had...The Israeli soldier captured on camera fatally\nshooting a suspected Palestinian assailant in the head after he was already\ndisarmed and lying on the ground will face murder charges, an Israeli military\ncourt ruled Friday.The three-minute cellphone video shot in Hebron by a\nPalestinian man had...“In recent months our soldiers have bravely and\nresolutely stood up in the face of terrorist attacks and murderers who set out\nto kill them,” the prime minister said. “The soldiers are forced to make\ndecisions in the field, in real time, under stress and conditions of\nuncertainty. This is not a simple reality and I'm sure that the investigation\nis taking the entirety of these circumstances into account. I am convinced\nthat the investigation will be professional and fair towards your son.”The\ninitial video of the incident was captured by a local Palestinian activist and\nsupplied to Israeli human rights group B’Tselem.It showed the aftermath of an\nattack March 24 in which two Palestinian men stabbed and wounded an Israeli\nsoldier at the Gilbert checkpoint inside the occupied West Bank city of\nHebron. Another soldier shot them both, killing one and wounding 21-year-old\nFatah Sharif.When the situation had calmed, and Sharif had been incapacitated,\nthe video shows him lying on the ground, alive but offering no resistance. A\nvan blocks the view momentarily, but a gunshot can be heard. When the van\nmoves on, it becomes apparent that an Israeli soldier has fatally shot Sharif\nin the head.Days later, however, Israel's Army Radio published a separate\nvideo on its website that suggested the soldiers may have feared the\nPalestinian had a bomb.According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, someone\nslightly out of the frame can be heard saying, “He apparently has an explosive\non him, pay attention! Nobody touches him until bomb disposal arrives.” Four\nseconds later, one of the paramedics carrying the soldier—a man who, 20\nseconds earlier, had said, “That terrorist is still alive, the dog. Don't let\nhim get up!”—then cries in panic, “He's alive. Somebody do something!”An image\ngrab taken from a video released on March 24, 2016, by B'Tselem, an Israeli\nnon-governmental rights organisation, shows an Israeli soldier aiming his\nweapon before allegedly shooting in the head and killing a wounded Palestinian\nassailant.An image grab taken from a video released on March 24, 2016, by\nB'Tselem, an Israeli non-governmental rights organisation, shows an Israeli\nsoldier aiming his weapon before allegedly shooting in the head and killing a\nwounded Palestinian assailant.Another clip shows a soldier, apparently the\nsuspect, shaking hands and exchanging smiles with a prominent Hebron settler,\nmoments after the shooting.The soldier has not been officially identified, and\na gag order prevents the use of his name in all news accounts, including those\nby foreign news organizations accredited in Israel. However, he has been\nwidely identified on social media and Israelis have scrutinized his personal\nFacebook page, on which he expresses support for right-wing causes.Lawyers\nrepresenting the soldier said he acted to save his colleagues because he\nbelieved that Sharif, who was still moving, could have been wearing\nexplosives.However, the soldier did not warn other soldiers standing nearby,\nand there has been debate about whether his shot could have detonated any\nexplosives.**NEWSLETTER: Get the day's top headlines from Times Editor Davan\nMaharaj \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**According to a poll conducted by Israel’s Channel 2, 64% of\nJewish Israelis surveyed said that the soldier acted “responsibly” and\n“naturally” under the pressure of the situation. The poll also found that 68%\nbelieved that Netanyahu and Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon had been wrong in\ncriticizing and arresting the soldier.Solidarity rallies for the soldier have\nbeen held in at least two cities.“I clearly prefer that we have a soldier who\nmakes a mistake in his assessment of a situation than one who hesitates, and\nis God forbid killed by a terrorist—cases which we have seen in the past,”\nsaid Israeli politician and former cabinet minister Avigdor Lieberman, who was\namong the protesters.Some 55,000 Jewish Israelis signed a petition addressed\nto Netanyahu, Ya’alon and military Chief of Staff Gadi Eisenkot calling for\nthe soldier to be awarded a badge of honor for his actions.Eisenkot said the\nIsraeli army would not hesitate to fully implement the law against soldiers\nand commanders if they deviate from operational and moral standards.In\nFebruary, Eisenkot spoke out about the death of a 14-year-old Palestinian girl\nwho attempted to stab a man with a pair of scissors. He said soldiers should\ndemonstrate restraint rather than exercising a “shoot to kill” policy.After\nsix months of Palestinian shooting, stabbing and vehicular attacks against\nIsraelis, a searing debate has erupted over what is an appropriate use of\nforce by the military.In that time, 30 Israelis, two Americans and an Eritrean\nbystander have been killed by Palestinians. Israeli forces have shot dead over\n180 Palestinians, most of whom they say were carrying out, or about to carry\nout, attacks.The mood in Israel is stark contrast to that of the West Bank,\nwhere Palestinian leaders have condemned the shooting and called for a United\nNations investigation into extrajudicial executions.**See more of our top\nstories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**“These executions are not isolated events and\nIsraeli must be held accountable for committing these crimes,” said the\nPalestinian Liberation Organization’s secretary general, Saeb Erekat.Diana\nButtu, former legal advisor to PLO Chairman Mahmoud Abbas, said the\ninvestigation into the soldier’s actions was “farcical.”“Israel has granted\nits soldiers complete impunity to kill Palestinians,” she said. “The only\nreason that charges are being brought in the first place is because it was\ncaught on tape. Otherwise, he would not face any charges.”_Shuttleworth is a\nspecial correspondent._**ALSO****Iran's supreme leader pushes talks and\nmissiles, not one or the other****Why you probably didn't hear everyone\ntalking about these major terror attacks****Some prominent Chinese are chafing\nagainst censorship.

He was\namong 70-plus staff members who were being let go from the editorial,\ncirculation, advertising and marketing departments, according to sources who\nspoke on condition of anonymity when discussing the Register.Reflecting on\nwhat he called the joys of working at a newspaper, Curley said: “I like the\nfact that we … can be a strong reflection of our community. The Register has\nalways been known for taking these big chances visually. It's caring. It's\nthorough.”The paper’s news operations now will be overseen by the newly formed\nSouthern California News Group.“We have long admired our new colleagues’ work\nand are looking forward to working alongside them as part of our expanded\nteam,” said Ron Hasse, president of the publishing group and a 25-year veteran\nof Southern California newspapers.“Our talent, scale and deeply invested news\nteams will be a benefit for readers, who will receive more of the news they\nneed to stay informed about issues in their own backyards,” he said.Digital\nFirst bought Freedom for $49.8 million after a week that saw a higher bid in\nbankruptcy court from Tribune Publishing — parent company of the Los Angeles\nTimes — derailed by Justice Department intervention on antitrust grounds.“We\nare extremely excited to usher in a new era of stability, profitability and\nquality for these renowned papers,” Sharon Ryan, executive vice president of\nDigital First’s western region, said in a news release. “The Register and the\nPress-Enterprise have been longtime leaders in their regions, and as part of\nthe DFM team, they will continue to outshine the competition.”Throughout the\nday Thursday at the Register headquarters near downtown Santa Ana, Curley\nstrolled around, shaking hands and saying goodbye, sources there said. He\njoined Freedom in 2012 and, before becoming editor, served as deputy editor of\nlocal news, leading a relaunch of the Register's 22 community publications.“I\nlove so much about the Register. The people. The camaraderie and chemistry. …\nBut I really love how it all comes together when a big story happens,” Curley\nsaid.“When the big jailbreak happened a few months ago, we … didn't [have to]\ntell anyone to come in on that Saturday,” he said. “You looked up from your\ndesk and realized all of the top editors have come in, and the newsroom is the\nmost packed you've ever seen it on a weekend.“The sense of mission and\ndedication was so inspiring to me.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5a4"},"content":"In a move that puts California at the forefront of efforts to raise wages for\nlow-income workers across the country, the Legislature approved a sweeping\nplan Thursday to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next six\nyears, boosting the future paychecks of millions of the state's workers.The\nSenate voted 26 to 12 — with loud cheers of “Si se puede” from the gallery\nabove — to give final approval and send the measure to Gov. Jerry Brown's desk\nless than one week after a legislative compromise. Brown will sign the wage\nhike into law in Los Angeles on Monday.“At its core, this proposal is about\nfairness,” Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León (D-Los Angeles) said just\nbefore the vote.“This is historic, and today I am proud to be a\nCalifornian.”Under the plan, the state's hourly minimum wage would increase\nfrom the current $10 to $10.50 on Jan. 1, 2017, then to $11 the following\nyear, and increase by $1 annually until 2022. Businesses with fewer than 26\nemployees would get an additional year to comply, and Brown and his successors\ncould delay the increases by one year in the case of an economic downturn.\nAssuming no pauses, the minimum wage would increase each year based on\ninflation starting in 2024.All but two Democrats — Assembly members Tom Daly\nof Anaheim and Adam Gray of Merced — voted for the increase, and not a single\nRepublican in either chamber voted for the measure. Both raised concerns about\nthe automatic cost-of-living increases that would raise the wage higher than\n$15 an hour as soon as 2024.The plan passed the state Assembly earlier\nThursday, 48 to 26, after opponents complained it was rushed and did not\ninclude a wide group at the negotiating table during what at times was an\nemotional debate in both houses of the Legislature.Democratic lawmakers\nexhorted their colleagues to think of the difficulties of working families in\na state with large income inequality and high housing costs. “This is an\nargument about economic justice,” Assemblyman Sebastian Ridley-Thomas (D-Los\nAngeles) said during floor debate. “Justice is not something that can be\nnegotiated or compromised.”Republicans countered that a too-high minimum wage\nwould limit opportunity particularly for those just entering the workforce.\n“Our job in this building is to help people climb the economic ladder, not cut\noff the bottom rungs,” said Sen. Ted Gaines (R-Rocklin), calling it a “death\nsentence” for struggling businesses in his district. “That is exactly what\nwill happen if we shove this unprecedented cost increase on\nbusinesses.”Economists have estimated the measure would increase the pay of\n5.6 million workers across the state — nearly 1 in 3. No state has a minimum\nwage higher than California's $10 an hour, and this deal will put California\non a path to remain the highest in the country. California's restaurants and\nretail stores would be ground zero for the impact of the proposed statewide\n$15 minimum wage.The retail and food industries alone employ nearly a third of\nall workers who will get a raise if Gov. Jerry Brown’s proposal passes the\nLegislature, according to an analysis...California's restaurants and retail\nstores would be ground zero for the impact of the proposed statewide $15\nminimum wage.The retail and food industries alone employ nearly a third of all\nworkers who will get a raise if Gov. Jerry Brown’s proposal passes the\nLegislature, according to an analysis...Republicans and business groups,\nincluding the California Chamber of Commerce, California Restaurant Assn.,\nwarned that the pay hike was too much too fast and that it didn't take into\naccount the broad differences between California's rich and poor regions.The\ndecision, they said, would cause layoffs and quicker automation of low-wage\njobs.Gray said in an interview after the vote that the effect on the state\nbudget and automatic cost-of-living increases were deal-breakers for him.He\nsaid his Central Valley district was very different from the wealthier coastal\nareas of California.“We have systemic, decades-long double-digit\nunemployment,” Gray said. “While $15 an hour probably isn't even high enough\nfor areas like San Francisco and parts of Los Angeles and our other urban\ncenters, it's too high for some small businesses and some\ncommunities.”Thursday's action came after a whirlwind week in the Capitol,\nwith Brown formally outlining the plan on Monday. The package is less\naggressive than two labor-sponsored ballot measures that would have increased\nthe minimum wage to $15 an hour more quickly. The leverage created by the\nballot measures spurred Brown, who previously had been hostile to raising the\nwage beyond its current levels, to make a deal. Brown's decision, followed by\nswift legislative approval, marks the biggest success yet for a national\nmovement backed by labor unions to increase minimum wages to $15 an\nhour.Though major cities, including Los Angeles, have increased their minimum\nwage to that level, no state had done the same until Thursday, though New York\nis considering a similar measure.Earlier in the week, both Democratic\npresidential candidates, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen.\nBernie Sanders of Vermont, expressed their support for California's\ndecision.During debate, Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) told his colleagues\nthat his bill would lift many hard-working Californians out of\npoverty.“Workers are struggling,” Leno said. “Two point two million\nCalifornians are currently earning minimum wage, and they are struggling in\npoverty because it is a sub-poverty wage.”But Republican Sen. Jim Nielsen said\nincreasing the minimum wage will hurt new workers and lead to mechanization of\njobs, saying: “You will go to the hamburger store, and you won't have a young\nperson or elderly person to wait on you.”Hundreds of supporters of the measure\nrallied outside the Capitol on Thursday and packed the Assembly before the\nvote. California’s minimum-wage increase to $15 an hour over the next six\nyears passed its most critical legislative test Thursday morning, with the\nstate Assembly approving the deal.California’s minimum-wage increase to $15 an\nhour over the next six years passed its most critical legislative test\nThursday morning, with the state Assembly approving the deal.Once the decision\nwas official, cheers came down from the gallery and Assembly Speaker Anthony\nRendon (D-Paramount) and de León shared a long hug on the Assembly\nfloor.Guadalupe Salazar, 40, a fast-food worker from Oakland who attended the\nCapitol rally, said the vote Thursday was the culmination of a years-long\neffort to boost the wage and improve the quality of a life for her family,\nincluding her daughter, who makes minimum wage as a thrift store clerk in\nOrange County.“They finally opened their ears to what we need,” Salazar\nsaid.Aside from affecting low-wage workers, the deal will have broad\nconsequences on all sectors of the economy and the state budget. The state\nDepartment of Finance has estimated that the wage increase would cost the\nstate $3.6 billion annually by 2023, primarily from a pay boost for in-home\nhealthcare workers in the public sector.Beyond that, the wage hike also will\nincrease the pay of workers whose salaries are tied to the minimum wage. For\ninstance, teachers and other workers who are exempt from state overtime rules\nmust be paid at least double the minimum wage or receive overtime.\n_liam.dillon@latimes.com___patrick.mcgreevy@latimes.com___Twitter: @dillonliam\n@mcgreevy99_**ALSO:****Minimum wage measure passes Appropriations Committee,\nheads to Legislature****Gov.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5a5"},"content":"_Today marks the 21th anniversary of the death of beloved Tejano music artist,\nSelena Quintanilla-Perez. The singer was only 23 when she was gunned down in\nher hometown of Corpus Christi, Texas, by the founder of her fan club. Yolanda\nSaldivar was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison in 1995.\nAlthough it's been over two decades since her death, Selena remains a pop\nculture icon for many fans who remember her belly-baring outfits and catchy\ntunes like “Bidi Bidi Bom Bom” and “Baila Esta Cumbia.” The Times writer Steve\nBennett talked with those closest to the late singer in this article which\noriginally ran on July 18, 1995. _Things seem normal at Q Productions, a\nformer body shop turned recording facility near the airport of this South\nTexas coastal city. Big semis loaded with musical equipment churn up dust in\nthe chalky parking lot. Over the roar of the engines, men yell at each other\nin Spanish. A _tejano _band is in the studio, putting final touches on an\nalbum of the accordion-based music that dominates the region._  \n_In the front office, the phone rings constantly. Suzette Quintanilla Arriaga\nswivels in her chair and opens a filing cabinet drawer behind her. \"Look at\nthis,\" she says, pointing to a pile of brown mailers inside. \"And that's only\na few days' worth. They're coming from all over, and then a lot of people have\nbeen stopping by and leaving tapes. They think we're trying to replace her!\nIt's too weird.\"Two things become clear: Things aren't quite normal here and\nthere's no replacing Suzette's sister, Selena Quintanilla Perez.Since the\nshooting death of the _tejano _music star on March 31, the big question in\nSouth Texas has been: \"Why?\"Jennifer Lopez is still inspired by Selena\nQuntanilla Perez two decades after her death.The \"American Idol\" judge, who\nnotably played the late Tejano singer in the 1997 biopic \"Selena,\" reflected\non the \"tragedy\" of the young star's passing and \"why she left such an\nimprint\" during a Q\u0026amp;A with ...Jennifer Lopez is still inspired by Selena\nQuntanilla Perez two decades after her death.The \"American Idol\" judge, who\nnotably played the late Tejano singer in the 1997 biopic \"Selena,\" reflected\non the \"tragedy\" of the young star's passing and \"why she left such an\nimprint\" during a Q\u0026amp;A with ...Why did she go to the motel where she met\nher death? Why was she shot? Why couldn't the doctors save her? Why did she\nhave to die so young? Those questions probably won't be answered until the\ntrial of her accused killer, Yolanda Saldivar, is concluded later this year\n... if then.Now, fans and newcomers to the Selena phenomenon can ask\nthemselves another question: \"How far would she have gone?\"When she was\nkilled, Selena was at work on her first English-language album, which was\nexpected to break her out of the _tejano _market and make her a multicultural\nhousehold name. With her tragic death having accomplished that, the posthumous\nalbum, \"Dreaming of You,\" which combines four tracks from those English\nsessions with Spanish material, is being released jointly today by EMI Latin\nand EMI Records and is eagerly anticipated within the industry.Would Selena\nhave become the next Gloria Estefan? The next Latin artist, after Jon Secada,\nto conquer the pop charts?

Quintanilla, who played bass in her band and handled production\nand songwriting duties as well. \"I mean, she was my sister, she was kooky. But\nshe just had this force about her.\"We will never know if Selena, just 23 years\nold when she was shot down -- two days shy of her third wedding anniversary --\nwould have become the \"Mexican Madonna,\" as she was sometimes called. But\nbased on the legacy she left, she certainly had a chance at superstar\nstatus.\"Dreaming of You\" offers many new reasons to grieve and to celebrate.\nOne thing the album makes crystal-clear is that Selena was unique, clearly\nmore than a regional talent.\"What struck me on first listen was her complete\ncomfort in this environment,\" says Davitt Siggerson, president of EMI Records\nGroup. \"She made a record that felt totally natural in English.\" And while\nfans can enjoy such songs as the tender ballad \"I Could Fall in Love With You\"\nor the sinewy \"Captive Heart,\" that nagging thought remains: \"Whatif . . .\n?\"\"Selena never thought of herself as a star. She wasn't about that,\" says\nSuzette Arriaga, former drummer and now manager of the two boutiques, in\nCorpus Christi and San Antonio, that Selena had opened to sell her line of\nclothing. In a nearby room, the late singer's flamboyant designs hang like\nghosts, as her personal seamstress stitches together another creation.\"It was\nher dream to have an English-language album out, and it will be out,\" Arriaga\ncontinues. \"And that's the main thing. It's not about sales or stardom. It was\nher dream. Two or three days after she passed away, someone asked whether we\nwere going to put the English-language album out. It wasn't even a question\nwith us. We were like, 'It's done.' \"Two decades after she was killed, Tejano\nmusic star Selena Quintanilla might be more popular than ever.Jennifer Lopez\nperformed a tribute to her at Billboard's Latin Music Awards, a San Diego\ncompany is creating a digital embodiment of her and Mac Cosmetics just\nannounced plans for a Selena makeup...Two decades after she was killed, Tejano\nmusic star Selena Quintanilla might be more popular than ever.Jennifer Lopez\nperformed a tribute to her at Billboard's Latin Music Awards, a San Diego\ncompany is creating a digital embodiment of her and Mac Cosmetics just\nannounced plans for a Selena makeup...\"Dreaming of You\" is just a fragment of\nwhat could have been a major crossover hit. A 13-song collection, it contains\nfour English-language songs, combined with a remixed track previously recorded\nwith Full Force, two English/Spanish duets (one with David Byrne and one with\nthe Barrio Boyzz), two new Spanish-language tracks recorded for the film \"Don\nJuan DeMarco\" (in which Selena has a minor part as a mariachi singer) and\nseveral of her best-known _tejano _hits, including the infectious \"Bidi Bidi\nBom Bom\" and her final No. 1, \"Amor Prohibido.\"\"We created a retrospective\nthat will allow people who are buying a Selena record for the first time,\nbecause of the English-language songs, to hear the hits that got her where she\nwas,\" EMI's Behar says.The English-language tracks were designed to achieve\nthe crossover dream. Working in Los Angeles and Nashville with such\nheavyweight producers as Keith Thomas (Vanessa Williams, Amy Grant, Whitney\nHouston), Guy Roche (Celine Dion, Michael Bolton, Expose, Cher) and Rhett\nLawrence (Paula Abdul, Mariah Carey), Selena shows a wide range of vocal\ntextures and emotions. And the producers have created musical environments\nthat are as sophisticated as anything you'd hear on, say, a Whitney Houston\nalbum.\"I remember we were in L.A. working on [\"I Could Fall in Love\"], and she\ngot to bring a demo back to the hotel with her,\" says Chris Perez, her husband\nand the band's guitarist. \"She sat there with the tape in her Walkman\nlistening to it, analyzing it, over and over for hours, until like 2 in the\nmorning. She was just happy to be doing it. She couldn't believe everything\nthat was going on. It was a dream come true. For me just to have that, to know\nhow happy it was going to make her, makes it all worthwhile. Yet, at the same\ntime, she's not here to see it and enjoy it, so it's not the same.\"Although\nEMI's Behar says that he signed Selena to the label in 1989 with eventual\ncrossover to the pop charts in mind -- \"She was that needle in the haystack\"\n-- the singer appears to have been born to the spotlight.\"That was the goal\nfrom Day 1,\" says father Abraham Quintanilla. \"That's what I had in mind when\nshe was 6 years old. I had been an artist in the Tex-Mex market in the '60s,\nand so I knew the limitations. I'm telling you this not from a father's point\nof view, but from a musician's viewpoint, that she had it. With Selena, I\nalways felt she had it. She was just a well-rounded package, with the voice,\nthe looks, the moves, the instincts. I knew she could do it. Unfortunately,\nher life was cut short. . . . \"Quintanilla is clearly still grieving for his\ndaughter, and the family is unsure of its next step. There is some talk of a\ntribute tour, but nobody seems too jazzed by the idea. Selena's brother A.B.\nsays he wants to start a \"weekend band that plays Bee Gees and old retro music\nI grew up on.\"Chris still can't leave the house because people come up to\nconsole him, and, he says, \"I end up consoling them.\" With the new album about\nto hit stores, \"it's starting again,\" he says, referring to the tremendous\noutpouring of grief and support the family received in the weeks after\nSelena's death.Here at the studio, a steady stream of visitors comes through\nthe door. One, a grandmotherly type, pushes a young girl up to Suzette's desk.\n\"Have you listened to the tape I sent you?\" the woman asks. Suzette is polite,\nyet there is a glint in her eye. \"No,\" she says, pointing to the drawer full\nof tapes. \"We have received so many that we haven't had a chance to go through\nthem all.\" The grandmother hands her another cassette. \"This one is much\nbetter,\" she says.After the pair leave, Suzette sighs and says, \"It's hard.\nIt's really hard. We know that people mean well, but we really haven't had\ntime to mourn. It's just been crazy here.\"\n\n","title":"Selena was on brink of major crossover, 'up there with the Janets and the Madonnas' - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Remembering #SelenaQuintanilla: She was \"up there with the Janets and the Madonnas\" https://t.co/K7Ta5tl4Tt https://t.co/FSjBz8LsAR","date":"Thu Mar 31 21:50:18 +0000 2016","favs":161,"id":{"$numberLong":"715657496464125952"},"retweets":144},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1X0j4tX"}

One person was evaluated at the\nscene and refused treatment.Fire officials say the injuries were heat-related\ndespite temperatures being in the mid-60s, and may have been caused by the\ntightly packed crowds gathered on the Capitol grounds.Debate in the state\nSenate, which is considering the minimum wage bill that passed the Assembly\nearlier Thursday, continued uninterrupted.Earlier in the day, Sacramento\npolice removed a suspicious package found in a parking structure across the\nstreet from the Capitol, KCRA-TV reported. No evacuations or street closures\nwere in effect.State Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) told his colleagues\nduring the lengthy floor debate that his bill would lift many hard-working\nCalifornians out of poverty.\"Workers are struggling.” Leno said. \"Two point\ntwo million Californians are currently earning minimum wage, and they are\nstruggling in poverty because it is a sub-poverty wage.\"Sen. Hannah-Beth\nJackson (D-Santa Barbara) added, \"Everybody should have a crack at the brass\nring, the American dream.\"But Republican Sen. Ted Gaines of Rocklin said the\nbill is a \"death sentence\" for struggling businesses in his district. \"Our job\nin this building is to help people climb the economic ladder, not cut off the\nbottom rungs,\" Gaines said on the floor. \"That is exactly what will happen if\nwe shove this unprecedented cost increase on businesses.\"Republican Sen. Jim\nNielsen said increasing the minimum wage will hurt new workers and lead to\nmechanization of jobs. \"You will go to the hamburger store and you won't have\na young person or elderly person to wait on you,\" he said.Read moreA final\nprintout of the vote tally:It is well-intentioned, but it's not the way we\nshould be pulling people out of poverty.\n\n","title":"Essential Politics March 21-31 archive: Minimum wage bill passes - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"California Senate passes minimum wage bill https://t.co/jyHSy90mIu","date":"Thu Mar 31 21:37:18 +0000 2016","favs":60,"id":{"$numberLong":"715654224755965952"},"retweets":69},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1SCxj6N"}

The Internet service could be wired or wireless and\nthe FCC anticipates the new option will be available Dec. 1.**See the most-\nread stories this hour \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**\"There remains a digital divide that keeps a\nsignificant number of Americans from participating\" in the many benefits of\nthe Internet, said FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler, a Democrat who proposed the new\nregulations.A lack of high-speed Internet access at home can significantly\nhinder the search for a job in a labor market in which online resources are\nbecoming more important, according to the Pew Research Center.New poll results\nfound that 52% of Americans said that people without broadband service are\nat...A lack of high-speed Internet access at home can significantly hinder the\nsearch for a job in a labor market in which online resources are becoming more\nimportant, according to the Pew Research Center.New poll results found that\n52% of Americans said that people without broadband service are at...In\nanother broadband-related action, the FCC voted along party lines to start a\nformal rule-making process for new restrictions on how Internet service\nproviders could use the personal information of their customers.High-speed\nInternet is available in 95% of households with annual incomes of more than\n$150,000, the FCC said. But nearly half of households with incomes of less\nthan $25,000 a year do not have a high-speed connection.Lifeline is a program\nthat has been \"stuck in an analog time warp\" and needed to be modernized for\nthe needs of low-income Americans who need access to high-speed Internet to\ncompete in the 21st century economy, said FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a\nDemocrat and supporter of the overhaul.The lack of broadband is a particularly\nproblem for students who usually need Internet access to do homework, said FCC\nCommissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, another member of the Democratic\nmajority.She cited a Pew Research Center study that found 5 million households\nout of the 29 million with school-aged children lack high-speed Internet\naccess. \"There was a time when broadband access was a luxury.  No more,\" she\nsaid. \"And nothing demonstrates this as clearly as with education.\"The program\nis funded by a small monthly fee on consumers' phone bills, and spent about\n$1.5 billion last year to provide services to 13 million Americans. Recipients\nget the monthly subsidy, which is paid to their telecom provider, and can use\nit to offset the cost of one land-line or wireless phone line.Households would\nbe limited to one subsidy.Lifeline has been the subject of controversy as it\nhas grown dramatically in recent years.The program's spending ballooned from\n$809 million in 2005 to a peak of $2.2 billion in 2012, causing Republican\ncritics to criticize it as \"Obamaphone\" because much of the growth occurred\nduring President Obama's administration.In a partisan vote, the Federal\nCommunications Commission approved a major increase in funding — $1.5 billion\n— to help give schools and libraries high-speed Internet access.Democrats and\nRepublicans agreed on the need to expand broadband access.

The FCC on Thursday set a $2.25-billion annual budget,\nindexed to inflation.Republican Commissioners Ajit Pai and Mike O'Rielly, who\nvoted against the proposal, said the budget is not a hard cap that limits\nspending. Wheeler admitted that it was possible for the FCC to approve\nspending above the budget level.The FCC also took steps to eliminate waste,\nfraud and abuse of the program, including taking eligibility determinations\naway from the companies and giving it to an independent third-party\nadministrator.The changes build on reforms enacted by the FCC in 2012, such as\ncreating a database to prevent multiple phone companies from receiving\nsubsidies for the same subscriber.Lifeline spending has decreased the last few\nyears, and public interest and civil rights groups have pushed for Lifeline\nsubsides to be used for broadband service.More than 15,000 people signed a\npetition organized by Demand Progress to expand Lifeline \"to help narrow the\ndigital divide.\"On Thursday, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie\nSanders (I-Vt.) tweeted, \"Broadband access is a necessity, not a luxury. I\nurge the FCC to expand Lifeline and help millions of working families get\nonline.\"The vote came after Wheeler blocked a bipartisan compromise reached by\nPai, O'Rielly and Clyburn that would have capped the program's spending at $2\nbillion a year, among other changes, Pai said.The meeting's start was delayed\nas Wheeler worked to undermine the deal, Pai said.\"This agency in this\nproceeding represented the worst of government,\" he saidWheeler said the delay\nwas because \"the deliberative process was in full swing.\"Maxwell C.

For that reason, Internet\nservice providers oppose the proposed rules.\"Our digital footprints are hardly\nin sand; they are effectively in wet cement,\" Rosenworcel said.\"The market\nincentives to keep our data and slice and dice it to inform economic activity\nare enormous,\" she said. \"They are only going to grow.\"Pai and O'Rielly voted\nagainst launching the rule-making process, saying broadband providers should\nnot be regulated more strictly than search engines and other companies that\ncollect consumer data on the Internet.-----------**For the record****2:44\np.m.:** In a previous version of this article, Pai and O'Rielly were reported\nto have said that broadband providers should be regulated more strictly than\nsearch engines and other companies that collect consumer data on the Internet.\nThey said that broadband providers should not be regulated more\nstrictly.------------\"When it comes to privacy, the principle of parity makes\nsense,\" Pai said. \"There is no good reason to single out ISPs -- new entrants\nin the online advertising space -- for disparate  \ntreatment.\"**Follow @JimPuzzanghera on Twitter.  \n****MORE FROM BUSINESS****With Model 3, it's make or break for Tesla****Amazon to open a new fulfillment center in San Bernardino****LA is losing out on $41 million in taxes from AirBnB, study says**\n\n","title":"FCC votes to make low-income Americans eligible for subsidy for high-speed Internet service - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"FCC votes to make low-income Americans eligible for subsidy to get high-speed Internet https://t.co/WRZVq7K6is https://t.co/sV1Wl7TyCJ","date":"Thu Mar 31 21:15:08 +0000 2016","favs":45,"id":{"$numberLong":"715648648042950656"},"retweets":51},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1MEMIo1"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5a8"},"content":"Cesar Chavez, who organized the United Farm Workers union, staged a massive\ngrape boycott in the late 1960s to dramatize the plight of America's poor\nfarmhands, and later became a Gandhi-like leader to urban Mexican-Americans,\nwas found dead Friday in San Luis, Ariz., police said. He was 66.Authorities\nin San Luis, a small farming town on the Mexican border about 25 miles south\nof Chavez's native Yuma, said the legendary farm workers' leader apparently\ndied in his sleep at the home of a family friend.\"He was our Gandhi,\" said\nDemocratic state Sen. Art Torres, a prominent Chicano politician from Los\nAngeles' Eastside, upon hearing news of Chavez's death. \"He was our Dr. Martin\nLuther King.\"It's hard to find people like him who epitomized the spiritual\nand political goals of a people.\"President Clinton said in Washington, \"The\nlabor movement and all Americans have lost a great leader with the death of\nCesar Chavez. An inspiring fighter for the cause to which he dedicated his\nlife, Cesar Chavez was an authentic hero to millions of people throughout the\nworld.\"On a Thursday night 50 years ago, at the height of the table grape\nharvest in California's Central Valley, hundreds of Mexican American\nfarmworkers crowded expectantly into a Delano church hall. Most had worked\ntheir usual shifts in the vineyards, and many had stopped off after work at\ncelebrations...On a Thursday night 50 years ago, at the height of the table\ngrape harvest in California's Central Valley, hundreds of Mexican American\nfarmworkers crowded expectantly into a Delano church hall. Most had worked\ntheir usual shifts in the vineyards, and many had stopped off after work at\ncelebrations...Indeed, to many, America's quest for equality for its ethnic\nand racial minorities had largely been framed in terms of black and white.\nMexican-Americans, and Latinos in general, were largely ignored by politicians\nexcept at election time.That changed when Chavez, the son of migrant farm\nworkers, became the head of the UFW in 1965.A dedicated advocate of\nnonviolence, Chavez galvanized public support on behalf of farm workers, many\nof them illegal immigrants who averaged as little as $1,350 a year in the farm\nindustry that at the time grossed $4 billion annually. Workers lived in\nsubstandard housing.The early struggles in the San Joaquin Valley were marked\nby bitter and sometimes brutal incidents involving picketing farm workers who\nscreamed \" Huelga! \" -- \"Strike!\"--and growers who vowed never to give in to\nChavez and his followers.Chavez's greatest achievement was the 1968 boycott of\nCalifornia grapes. Beginning in the spring, more than 200 union supporters,\nmany of them earning $5 a week for their help, fanned out across the United\nStates and Canada to urge consumers not to buy grapes.The mayors of New York,\nBoston, Detroit and St. Louis directed their purchasing agents not to buy non-\nunion grapes. In Cleveland, Mayor Carl B. Stokes encouraged major grocery\nstores to prominently display the UFW symbol, the black Aztec eagle, to\nencourage shoppers to observe the boycott. A 300-mile march from Delano to the\nCapitol in Sacramento was an emotional high point for the cause.By August,\nCalifornia growers estimated that the boycott had cost them about 20% of their\nrevenue.At times, the struggle looked especially bleak to Chavez when he had\nto beg for food for his wife and eight children from the very farm workers he\nsought to help.\"It turned out to be about the best thing I could have done,\"\nhe would say later, \"although it's hard on your pride. Some of our best\nmembers came in that way. If people give you their food, they'll give you\ntheir hearts.\"He caught the attention of national figures, including U.S. Sen.\nRobert F. Kennedy, who sought the Democratic Party nomination for President\nbefore his assassination in 1968. The New York senator called the soft-spoken\nChicano \"one of the heroic figures of our times.\"In addition to the boycotts\nhe mounted, Chavez also used a series of fasts to rally support, including a\n36-day, water-only fast in 1988 that severely affected his health.At its peak\nin the 1970s, the UFW said that about 70,000 workers in California's fields\nwere covered by its collective bargaining agreements.In focusing attention on\nmigrant workers, Chavez also helped millions of urban Mexican-Americans who\nwere chafing for more educational opportunities, better housing and more\npolitical power.El Movimiento, the Chicano civil rights campaign of the late\n1960s, was characterized in many barrios such as East Los Angeles by marches\nopposing the Vietnam War and supporting the UFW.By the 1980s, however, the\nunion lost the earlier gains and Chavez found less and less public enthusiasm\nand support for boycotts. Union membership dipped to below 10,000. Many of the\ndetractors in recent years called him an irrelevant force in today's labor and\npolitical situations.Nevertheless, he was remembered Friday as a giant in the\ncivil rights movement of the United States.U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)\nsaid that Chavez \"was one of the great pioneers for civil rights and human\nrights of our century.\"\"His tireless commitment to improve the plight of farm\nworkers profoundly touched the conscience of America and inspired millions of\nothers to work for justice in their own communities,\" Kennedy said in a\nstatement released by his Washington office.Lane Kirkland, president of the\nAFL-CIO, said Chavez was instrumental in organized labor's efforts to improve\nthe lot of the rank and file.\"Always, Cesar conveyed hope and determination,\nespecially to minority workers, in the daily struggle against injustice and\nhardship,\" Kirkland said in a statement. \"The improved lives of millions of\nfarm workers and their families will endure as a testimonial to Cesar and his\nlife's work.\"Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina called Chavez a \"man\nof dignity, a man of honor.\"But, perhaps, the most touching tribute came from\nan Orange County political activist.\"We just lost Cantinflas, now Chavez. This\nis truly a sad day for Latinos,\" said Rueben Martinez, who lives in Santa Ana.\n\"Cesar was a very humble person.\"Growers who opposed Chavez's efforts were\ndownplaying his role in California's burgeoning agribusiness industry.\"I think\nhis legacy is very little,\" said grower John Giumarra of the San Joaquin\nValley community area of Arvin. \"He built this organization which failed\nultimately because it wasn't a union. It wasn't oriented toward the needs of\nfarm workers.\"Chavez had returned to the southwest corner of Arizona, where he\ngrew up, to visit with friends and fight a lawsuit filed against the union,\nsaid San Luis Mayor Tony Reyes.He had been staying in the home of a family\nfriend, Dona Maria Hau , for the past week. He was found dead shortly after 9\na.m. Friday. Hau and a UFW official said Chavez had been fasting during his\nstay there, but they persuaded him to eat a vegetarian meal Thursday night out\nof concern for his health.As word of his death spread, farm workers throughout\nCalifornia expressed shock and disbelief.Lettuce cutters and vegetable pickers\nfrom throughout the Salinas Valley began arriving at the UFW office in Salinas\nupon hearing the news. Workers, wearing their work boots still muddy from the\nfields, burst into tears when they arrived at the office. Others simply prayed\nbeneath a large picture of the Virgin Mary, with a smaller picture of Chavez\nunderneath.\"The workers have been coming in by the dozens, all day long,\" said\nMartin Vasquez, grievance coordinator for the UFW. \"They all feel that even\nthough he is gone, his ideas live on.\"Dolores Huerta, the longtime UFW vice\npresident, had to sit down when she was told the news of Chavez's death.\"We're\nin a state of shock,\" she said. \"His mother was 99 when she died. His father\nwas 101. All of his family has longevity. So no one ever anticipated Cesar\nhaving an early death. We all thought he'd live into his 90s.\"Former Gov.\nEdmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. first met Cesar Chavez in 1966 and stayed in touch\nwith him until his death.\"I remember the first time I saw him. He walked into\nmy father's house in Hancock Park and he was dressed the same way as when I\nsaw him a month ago. He never lost his modesty and simplicity.\"Cesar wasn't\nafraid of anybody. He was a real fighter. The farmers were scared to death of\nhim. Politicians in the (San Joaquin) Valley wouldn't stand next to\nhim.\"Cardinal Roger Mahony, archbishop of Los Angeles, said he was \"deeply\nsaddened to learn of the death of Cesar Chavez, a tireless champion in the\nstruggle for the recognition of and respect for the human rights and dignity\nof agricultural workers here in California as well as throughout the United\nStates.\"His commitment, deeply rooted in his Catholic faith and inspired by\nthe Gospel and the church's social teachings, drew untold thousands to the\ncause of justice he espoused.\"Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari also\npaid tribute to Chavez, calling him a \"dedicated man who worked very hard for\nMexican-American farm workers and Mexican migrants.\"One of five children,\nChavez was born on March 31, 1927, on a small farm near Yuma. The Depression\nshattered his father's finances when young Chavez was 10, and the family took\nto the roads as migrant laborers.He never graduated from high school, and once\nsaid he went to as many as 65 elementary schools because of the family's\nconstant search for work in the fields. He said his mother taught him to be\nhumane while living in often inhumane conditions.\"She sent us to invite hobos\nto share our tortillas and beans,\" he told one interviewer.At an early age,\nChavez heard talk of union organizing.\"About 1939,\" Chavez recalled in an\ninterview, \"we were living in San Jose. One of the old CIO unions began\norganizing workers in the dried-fruit industry, so my father and uncle became\nmembers. Sometimes the men would meet at our house and I remember seeing their\npicket signs and hearing them talk.\"They had a strike, and my father and uncle\npicketed all night. It made a deep impression on me.\"The strike ultimately\nfailed but Chavez had become an ardent unionist.During World War II, in 1944\nand 1945, Chavez served in the Navy. After the war, he returned to organizing\nefforts and met his wife, Helen, while working in the field in Delano, in the\nrich, flat plains of Kern County.In 1952, Chavez lived in San Jose's Mexican-\nAmerican barrio of Salsipuedes—which means \"'Get out if you can\"—when he met\nFred Ross, a community organizer who wanted to set up self-help groups in\nminority areas.Ross had heard of Chavez and sought him out. \"He looked to me\nlike potentially the best grass-roots leader I'd ever run into,\" Ross recalled\nlater.In 10 years with the group, Chavez led a successful voter registration\ndrive in San Jose. He took up the cases of hundreds of Mexican-Americans and\nMexican immigrants who complained of mistreatment by police, immigration\nauthorities and welfare officials.In 1962, he left to establish the National\nFarm Workers Assn., which later would become the UFW, an affiliate of the AFL-\nCIO.In the late 1970s, the UFW was at its peak.Chavez, using marches,\nboycotts, strikes and civil disobedience by followers, had the power to force\ngrowers in California's agricultural valleys to the bargaining table. The UFW\nwon tremendous wage increases and extensive benefits for workers and defeated\nthe powerful Teamsters Union in several battles for contracts.Even non-union\nworkers were being paid above minimum wage because of the UFW's influence. For\nthe first time, many California farm workers were covered by medical\ninsurance, no longer labored over back-breaking, short-handled hoes and had\nfringe benefits on a par with workers in other industries.\"He was the first\nperson to organize farm labor on a large scale . . . in that sense he was the\nmost important labor leader since World War II,\" Jerry Brown said.\"He really\nrepresented the basic division between the power structure and the people at\nthe bottom who speak a different language and have a different skin\ncolor.\"Chavez's accomplishments, using nonviolence, were comparable to what\nMartin Luther King Jr. accomplished during the civil rights movement, said\nJerry Cohen, general counsel for the UFW from 1967 to 1981.\"Those were great\nyears,\" Cohen said. \"Cesar accomplished more with fewer people than anyone I\nknow of. . . . He was like water running downhill at that time. Nothing could\nstop us.\"The UFW's influence began to wane in the early 1980s, and many of the\ngains have vanished. The pay of workers has dropped, fewer workers belong to\nunions and the housing for many workers has turned abysmal.The Salinas Valley,\nonce a union stronghold, is an example of how far the union has fallen. The\nunion only has one contract left among vegetable growers in the area, where it\nonce had about 35.During the decline, the union suffered considerable internal\nstrife, and growers became more sophisticated in their battles with the union.\nThe oversupply of workers during the 1980s, labor experts say, also hurt\nrecruiting.Chavez determined that the union could not organize workers and\nhold elections in such a politically hostile environment. So he switched\ntactics, turning to boycotts instead of focusing the union on organizing\nworkers. The decision was widely criticized and caused a split among UFW\nmembers.Despite his position with the union, Chavez maintained an austere\nlifestyle. As recently as the late 1980s, he did not own a house or a car and\nestimated his total income at $900 a month—the same as other union\norganizers.Chavez is survived by his wife and eight children, three of whom\nwork for the UFW.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5a9"},"content":"Across the country, the rights of transgender Americans are under attack.Last\nweek, North Carolina passed a bill that repealed local nondiscrimination\nordinances in the state. The legislation, House Bill 2, was pushed through in\nan “emergency session.” HB 2 was signed by North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory the\nvery same day. In a statement, McCrory argued that the bill was necessary in\npreventing “government overreach” from local municipalities. He was more than\nlikely referring to the Charlotte City Council’s 7-4 vote in February to\nextend its existing nondiscrimination statutes to include its transgender\nresidents. The measure provided equal access to all public accommodations,\nincluding public bathrooms, museums and restaurants.North Carolina’s decision\nto repeal the Charlotte law makes it effectively illegal for transgender\npeople to use the restroom that corresponds most closely with their gender\nidentity. The Tar Heel state is far from the only one to consider restricting\nthe rights of transgender folks. Eight other states are mulling bathroom bills\nstrikingly similar to the one North Carolina just passed. These include\nIllinois, Missouri, Kansas and Kentucky. Just 18 states (and Washington, D.C.)\nhave laws on the books that grant transgender people the legal right to\naffirming bathroom access.The LGBT movement secured a surprise victory Tuesday\nwhen South Dakota’s Republican governor, Dennis Daugaard, declined to sign\ninto law a bill that would have restricted bathroom access for the state’s\ntransgender student population.Known as HB 1008, the legislation would have\nforced all students...The LGBT movement secured a surprise victory Tuesday\nwhen South Dakota’s Republican governor, Dennis Daugaard, declined to sign\ninto law a bill that would have restricted bathroom access for the state’s\ntransgender student population.Known as HB 1008, the legislation would have\nforced all students...That needs to change. And a bill introduced to Congress\nlast year could offer exactly the kind of protections the LGBT community needs\nright now. The Equality Act of 2015 would amend the Civil Rights Act to\ninclude protections on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation. In\nits current form, the 1964 Civil Rights Act only forbids employment\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, gender, religious affiliation and country\nof origin. The Equality Act would expand those protections to the LGBT\ncommunity, in addition to covering housing, public education, federal funding\nand public accommodation. President Obama endorsed the bill last year.It’s\ntime for legislators in Congress to follow the president’s lead.Federal\nprotections for the LGBT community are widely popular with the American\npublic: A 2015 poll from UCLA’s Williams Institute showed that an overwhelming\nmajority of respondents (78%) supported nondiscrimination laws for LGBT\npeople. In fact, many American assume such protections already exist: A 2014\nsurvey from the Huffington Post and YouGov showed that 62% of likely voters\nthought that it was “currently illegal under federal law to fire someone for\nbeing gay or lesbian.”That is far from the case: Last year, the Western\nDistrict Missouri Court of Appeals sided with Cook Paper Recycling Corp in a\ndispute with James Pittman, a former employee who detailed an “objectively\nhostile and abusive environment.” Pittman’s co-workers repeatedly bashed him\nwith crude slurs asked him if he had AIDS. When he spoke up to management\nabout these issues, he was ultimately dismissed by the company. Similar\nincidents have occurred in Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Massachusetts,\nMinnesota, Ohio and New York.  Sadly, this bill appears to be dead in the\nwater under the current Republican-controlled Congress. The conservative\nHeritage Foundation has already spoken out about the Equality Act, saying it\namounts to “special privileges” for LGBT people. In January, the GOP drafted a\nresolution to back anti-transgender bathroom legislation across the U.S.,\narguing that these bills protect individual privacy. The statement was\nendorsed by Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National\nConvention.Despite Republican obstructionism in Congress, some red states have\nrecently voted down efforts to restrict the rights of LGBT people. After\ncompanies such as Disney, Marvel and Apple threatened to boycott Georgia, Gov.\nNathan Deal vetoed a “religious freedom” bill passed by his state's House and\nSenate. It was nearly identical to the one Indiana repealed last year.These\nsuccesses are heartening, but the humanity of LGBT people shouldn’t be left up\nto the whims of Republican state officials. Since the passage of North\nCarolina’s law, Mississippi looks poised to be the next state to pass anti-\nLGBT legislation, as a “religious freedom bill” awaits a signature from the\nstate’s conservative governor, Phil Bryant. In an interview last week, Bryant\nsuggested that he was inclined to approve the legislation, which will make it\nlegal for businesses to fire someone or deny them service for their sexual\norientation or gender identity. Without comprehensive action, this pattern of\nhate will keep repeating itself.The American public already has already shown\nthat it is against these bills and that it supports the rights of LGBT\nindividuals. It’s time for our federal government to do the same in pushing\nfor the Equality Act. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has already\nendorsed the bill, calling its passage her “highest priority” should she be\nvoted in this November. Despite her stated support, LGBT protections have\nlargely remained a nonissue this campaign season. If the Equality Act faces a\ntough battle in Congress, Democratic candidates must start fighting for its\nadoption now.With each new piece of anti-LGBT legislation that’s introduced, a\nsweeping solution at the national level is increasingly necessary to stop the\nfurther erosion of basic civil rights across the country._Nico Lang is the\nEast Coast reporter for the Advocate.

Their identities have not been\npublicly released, but naval air officials said they were not affiliated with\nthe military.“Regardless of procedures we have in place, something went wrong,\nand we had a tragic accident,” said Navy Capt. Monty Ashliman, the\ninstallation’s commanding officer.“We had some ... damage to an aircraft, and\nwe had two tragic losses of life, so we got to figure out a way to prevent\nthat from happening in the future,” Ashliman told reporters at a news\nconference Thursday.The pursuit began late Wednesday when California Highway\nPatrol officers approached a Jeep that was parked on the side of the road in\nKings County, in order to check on the welfare of those inside, CHP Lt. Dave\nKnoff said.The driver of the Jeep drove away at a high speed, and patrol units\nquickly followed. The Jeep began weaving and refused to stop, Knoff said.CHP\nofficers called off the pursuit when the driver began traveling in the wrong\ndirection on California State Route 198 in Lemoore, but the chase resumed\nagain in Fresno County.The Jeep drove through the air station’s front gate\nbefore security had time to deploy bollards, Lt. Jr. Grade Madison McSweeney\nsaid.Security forces at the installation responded, while a CHP helicopter\nflew over the area and monitored the pursuit.As the Jeep drove along an\nairstrip, it crashed into the parked fighter jet’s horizontal stabilizer, at\nthe rear of the aircraft.  A full assessment on damage to the twin-engine jet\nis still being conducted. An investigation will be conducted to determine how\nthe Jeep was able to bypass security checkpoints.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5ac"},"content":"The editor-in-chief of China’s Global Times, a tabloid closely tied to the\nCommunist Party and known for its often-rabid nationalism, isn’t exactly the\nkind of guy you’d expect to be calling publicly for more freedom of speech and\nless censorship.But that’s precisely what Hu Xijin has been doing lately — and\nhe’s not alone. A number of high-profile media figures in China, a prominent\nbusinessman, and even a delegate to the national legislature have been\ncomplaining that the administration of President Xi Jinping is going too far\nto snuff out criticism.This week, Hu took to Weibo, China’s oft-censored\nTwitter equivalent, to say that authorities were relying too much on the\n“Great Firewall” that blocks Chinese users from seeing thousands of websites.\nThe post was later deleted.Last month, he went on Weibo to declare that China\nshould “open up more channels for criticism and suggestions and encourage\nconstructive criticism.”The Bejing office of Sina Weibo, China’s oft-censored\nTwitter equivalent.The Bejing office of Sina Weibo, China’s oft-censored\nTwitter equivalent.The stakes are high. Xi has shown a growing impatience for\ndissent. Under his leadership, hundreds of bloggers, activists, lawyers,\njournalists and academics have been detained or harassed for refusing to toe\nthe party line.The party has not been shy about its goals: Last fall,\nauthorities introduced a new policy forbidding members to engage in “improper\ndiscussion” of central party policies. After Xi demanded that officials close\nranks around him, China’s state-run media ramped up references to Xi as the\n“core” — a leader on par with Deng Xiaoping, who led China’s opening following\nthe death of Mao Tse-tung.Last month, Xi made a high-profile tour of the\nPeople’s Daily, the Xinhua News Agency and CCTV — China’s three major state-\nrun media outlets — ordering editors and reporters to pledge loyalty to the\nparty.“They must love the party, protect the party and closely align\nthemselves with the party leadership in thought, politics and action,” he\nsaid.While such diktats don’t sit well with many Chinese, speaking out against\nthem is risky. But in early March, a prominent Shanghai academic who is a\nmember of a national-level political advisory body did just that.On the eve of\nhis organization’s annual gathering in Beijing, Jiang Hong argued that\nadvisors such as himself should “be free to give Communist Party and\ngovernment agencies suggestions on economic, political, cultural and societal\nissues.” He had the audacity to suggest that if authorities feel that an\nordinary citizen has made an “illegal” remark, they should say what law they\nbelieve the person has violated.Jiang was interviewed about his proposals by\nCaixin, a prominent current affairs magazine. After the interview was\npublished, though, it quickly was taken offline.Hu Shuli, managing editor of\nthe current affairs magazine Caixin, poses in her Beijing office in 2002. The\nmagazine recently ran an article about an online post it said China’s Internet\nwatchdog had ordered removed.Hu Shuli, managing editor of the current affairs\nmagazine Caixin, poses in her Beijing office in 2002. The magazine recently\nran an article about an online post it said China’s Internet watchdog had\nordered removed.But Caixin, run by a well-regarded journalist, Hu Shuli, then\ntook the unusual step of posting a story on its English-language platform\nabout the post's removal. Under the headline “Story about advisor’s free\nspeech comments removed from Caixin website,” the publication said the\nCyberspace Administration of China — the nation’s Internet watchdog — had\nordered the removal.An illustration accompanying the piece depicted a mouth\ncovered with masking tape. That article, too, was soon deleted.To many people\noverseas, China’s debate over the limits of free speech may seem like a\nnonstarter — after all, the country is a one-party state where the government\nroutinely censors the Internet; blocks foreign news websites as well as\nGoogle, Twitter and Facebook; exerts strong control over media outlets;\nforbids demonstrations; and detains and jails critics.But over the last\ndecade, the expansion of the Internet and China’s increasing efforts to join\nthe international community — such as hosting the 2008 Summer Olympics and the\n2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum — have contributed to a gradual\nopening of space for critical debate on topics ranging from the environment to\nthe economy. Some online commentators developed large followings online,\nearning them the moniker “Big Vs” or Big Voices.Among them was Ren Zhiqiang, a\nCommunist Party member and real estate mogul nicknamed “the Cannon” for his\noutspoken commentaries. After Xi’s tour to the state-run media outlets, he\nwent online to gripe: “When did the ‘People’s Government’ turn into the\n‘Party’s Government’? Does it run on party dues?”The previous month, Ren had\nraised eyebrows when he expressed concern over Xi’s ideological policies and\nwrote: “The winds of the Cultural Revolution are once again blowing.” (During\nMao's Cultural Revolution, a political movement from 1966 to 1976, millions of\npeople were persecuted in the name of Communist ideology).Ren’s Weibo account\n— with some 37 million followers — was deleted by authorities last month. In a\nrare comment on an individual case, Cyberspace Administration spokesman Jiang\nJun said: “Cyberspace is not outside of the law, and no person is allowed to\nuse the Internet to spread illegal information.”Although some continue to\nspeak up — on March 7, Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Fang published an open\nletter chastising Beijing for suppression of free speech — the tightening\ncontrols are prompting some influential figures to throw in the towel. On\nTuesday, a senior editor at the Guangzhou-based Southern Metropolis Daily, one\nof China’s top newspapers, resigned.“I’m getting old; after bowing for so\nlong, I can’t stand it anymore,” Yu Shaolei wrote on his Sina Weibo\nmicroblog.Whether frustration over Xi’s policies extends high into party ranks\nis unclear. In early March, an anonymous letter briefly circulated online,\nblaming Xi for creating “unprecedented problems and crises” by adopting a\nhardline authoritarian leadership style. It was signed “loyal Communist Party\nmembers.”As news of that letter spread, authorities detained scores of people\nin an attempt to identify its source. Two exiled Chinese bloggers who wrote\nabout the document — one living in New York, the other in Germany — said that\npolice targeted their family members in China.Chang Ping, the Germany-based\nwriter, said police detained his two brothers and pressured them to persuade\nChang to stop publishing articles criticizing the Chinese government.Both\nbloggers say their family members have since been released.“In recent years,\nthis kind of thing wouldn’t happen in China. But China is getting stricter and\nstricter. It’s like, it doesn’t matter what country you live in — I can hurt\nyou,” Chang said. “This kind of thing is a strike against media\nfreedom.”_Special correspondent Violet Law in Chicago and Nicole Liu of The\nTimes Beijing bureau contributed to this report._**Follow @JulieMakLAT and\n**@JRKaiman** for news from China**\n\n","title":"More Chinese chafing against censorship.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5ae"},"content":"Z_aha Hadid was a celebrated Iraqi-born British architect whose designs can be\nfound around the world, including a 8,450-square-foot visitors' center for the\n1999 State Garden Show in Germany.__ Hadid died Thursday. Here's our 1999\nreview of the visitors' center:_Zaha Hadid has long been a fixture of\narchitecture's fashionable avant-garde. Her talent is undeniable. Her\npaintings--enormous compositions of fragmented forms shooting off into space--\nare among the most inspiring by a living architect. A year ago, she won her\nfirst major commission in the United States, for Cincinnati's Contemporary\nArts Center, and last February she was selected to design an $84-million\ncontemporary art center in Rome.Even by starchitect standards, Zaha Hadid was\na force of nature with an outsized personality.The celebrated Iraqi-born\nBritish architect — the first woman to win the Pritzker Prize, architecture’s\nhighest honor — cut short a BBC radio interview last year when the line of\nquestioning turned toward...Even by starchitect standards, Zaha Hadid was a\nforce of nature with an outsized personality.The celebrated Iraqi-born British\narchitect — the first woman to win the Pritzker Prize, architecture’s highest\nhonor — cut short a BBC radio interview last year when the line of questioning\nturned toward...But to see Hadid's built work, you have to travel to Weil am\nRhein, Germany, a quiet, unremarkable industrial town nestled along the Swiss\nborder. London-based Hadid, who was born in 1950 in Iraq, built her first\nbuilding here five years ago--a fire station for a local furniture-\nmanufacturing company. And last month, she completed the 8,450-square-foot\nvisitors' center for the 1999 State Garden Show, the centerpiece of a\nsprawling outdoor display of various themed gardens on the site of a former\ngravel quarry. The center will house an exhibition hall and restaurant, as\nwell as offices for the garden show's employees.Together, the two projects\ndispel the myth that Hadid is more compelling as a creator of radical images\nthan as a builder. Built on a budget of $1.85 million and dubbed Land\nFormation One, the visitors' center is conceived as a collection of fluid,\nintertwining paths that weave through the landscape. Visitors will glide over\nthe rooftop on an elegantly curved ramp or slip through the building along\ngently stepped paths. The idea is to create a structure embedded in its\nnatural context. It is a remarkably sensual experience, and few buildings have\nachieved such a fluid sense of movement.Shaped like an enormous boomerang, the\nbuilding's low, horizontal concrete form embraces the landscape like an\nenveloping arm, with the two-story exhibit hall and the lower form of the\nrestaurant arranged as parallel bands. The design's most dramatic gesture,\nhowever, is an enormous ramp that wraps around the back of the hall, rising\nover the restaurant's roof before stepping down at the building's other end\nwith a series of shallow steps. Seen from below, the concrete ramp echoes the\ndynamic form of a freeway off-ramp. In fact, the building is a fragment of\nurban infrastructure, reduced to a pedestrian scale.But the ramp also\nfunctions as part of a subtle historical narrative. Most visitors will arrive\nfrom the direction of the garden show's agricultural zone, a re-creation of a\ntypical contemporary farm marked by a quaint timber-frame farmhouse. From\nthere, as they climb the ramp to the center's roof, the jutting form of the\nexhibition hall will gradually block out the view back to the farmhouse,\nturning their gazes toward a part of the show dedicated to gardens of the\nfuture. Visitors can continue along the exterior walkway, or they can cross a\ndramatic concrete bridge and descend into the building. Inside, paths lead out\nto the restaurant terrace or back up to the roof in a fluid pedestrian loop.In\n2004, Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid became the first woman to win the\nPritzker Prize. Hadid died March 31, 2016. Here's our story from March 22,\n2004, when she accepted architecture's top honor:Zaha Hadid, whose dynamic\ndesigns often seem to defy laws of gravity, has won the Pritzker Prize,...In\n2004, Iraqi-British architect Zaha Hadid became the first woman to win the\nPritzker Prize.

Here's our story from March 22,\n2004, when she accepted architecture's top honor:Zaha Hadid, whose dynamic\ndesigns often seem to defy laws of gravity, has won the Pritzker\nPrize,...Hadid has long been fascinated with the scale of urban\ninfrastructure, and the visitors' center owes much to her earlier fire station\ndesign. There too, Hadid placed her building at a bend in the road. The\nstation's main interior space is a garage enclosed behind enormous steel\ndoors. When the doors are opened, the structure seems to dissolve into a\ncluster of floating beams, one end anchored in the site like a bunker.But\nwhat's most striking about the current project is its restraint. There are no\ngimmicks here, no empty gestures. Instead the design reveals a remarkable\nsensitivity to the rhythms and pace of human movement. By gently altering the\nflow of movement through the site--with a mixture of long shallow ramps, steep\nstairways and other subtle changes in elevation--Hadid makes you profoundly\naware of your own body.*During the 20th century, architecture's avant-garde\nbecame obsessed with reinventing the modern metropolis. New York, Moscow,\nShanghai--all represent the kinds of urban friction and cultural congestion\nthat symbolize the world of the future--a shimmering, electrically charged\nworld of the machine and, later, of the Information Age. Few dared challenge\nthat vision. In the '20s, Soviet \"Disurbanists\" proclaimed the death of the\ncity, devising schemes that dispersed the population over the countryside in\nfuturistic villages linked through a vast electrical grid. Frank Lloyd Wright,\nanother notorious city-hater, suggested its inhabitants drive out to the\ndesert and never look back. But these visionaries were part of an eccentric\nminority.Pritzker Architecture Prize-winning architect Zaha Hadid died\nThursday at age 65.

She leaves behind a rich legacy of designs, including the\nstriking Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center, which opened in 2003. The Times'\narchitecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff profiled the work-in-progress in\n1998.Zaha...Like most cutting-edge architects, Hadid has focused much of her\nenergy on re-imagining urban centers. Many of her early drawings depict a\nmassive, chaotic metropolis in a state of perpetual motion. In more recent\nyears, however, Hadid has begun to explore more earthbound forms. Her 1997\ndesign for a philharmonic hall on a hillside in Luxembourg resembles a\ncontinuous undulating landscape whose enormous shifting plates seem to erupt\nout of the top of the hill. That same year, Hadid designed a museum of Islamic\nart in Doha, Qatar, in which layers of overlapping terraces are punctured by\ninterior courtyards. Neither project was built.The visitors' center is an\nextension of those experiments. Its sweeping pedestrian routes suggest a\nprovocative alternative to the culture of urban congestion. This is not the\nfamiliar model of suburban isolation and anonymity. Nor does it suggest a\nnostalgic desire to return to some infantile Eden. Instead of a landscape of\nsuburban paranoia, Hadid seeks to create an architecture of connections.As\nurban centers increasingly become cultural playgrounds, their economies\ndependent on tourism, and the Computer Age allows middle-class, white-collar\nworkers to flee to the suburbs in ever greater numbers, such visions become\nincreasingly relevant. In the future the sprawling megalopolis, not the dense\ninner city, will most likely become the center of radical experimentation in\narchitecture. Hadid's design may very well be a lens into that future.\n\n","title":"Review: Zaha Hadid's garden spot in Germany has city smarts - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"From the Archives: Zaha Hadid's garden spot in Germany has city smarts https://t.co/eaHIWGLVRF","date":"Thu Mar 31 19:45:10 +0000 2016","favs":20,"id":{"$numberLong":"715626007869460480"},"retweets":19},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/235AiKa"}

But like many\nmigrants at the shelter in Ixtepec, an unfamiliar ailment and a hypothetical\nbirth defect do not rate high on her list of concerns.Here in the purgatory\nbetween her home and the one she hopes to make in the United States, Gomez\nDiaz has other things on her mind.Such as taking care of her 4-year-old\ndaughter in a shelter so crowded with hundreds of other migrants that at night\nthe sidewalks are packed with dozens of sleeping bodies.Or getting beyond the\nguilt of leaving her other daughter, who is 8, behind with the child's\ngrandmother, and agonizing over how she will send enough money back when she\narrives in the U.S. to make their separation worthwhile.The cinder block homes\nlining the hillsides on the edge of this metropolis are connected to the\nmunicipal network of water pipes.But the water doesn't arrive that way. It\ncomes on tanker trucks.Black exhaust and the groans of diesel engines fill the\nair as an aging fleet makes its deliveries.The cinder block homes lining the\nhillsides on the edge of this metropolis are connected to the municipal\nnetwork of water pipes.But the water doesn't arrive that way. It comes on\ntanker trucks.Black exhaust and the groans of diesel engines fill the air as\nan aging fleet makes its deliveries.Or forgetting the gang that threatened to\nkill her when she wouldn't date a member of its ranks.Or making it safely to\nthe U.S. border without being kidnapped, raped or tortured.Elsewhere in the\nAmericas, Zika is prompting concern and fear. Scientists are studying whether\nthe virus, which is transmitted by the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, is\nresponsible for children being born with small, misshapen heads, a condition\nknown as microcephaly, which can lead to blindness, hearing loss and early\ndeath.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has said it will test pregnant\nwomen in its immigration detention centers and provide them with prenatal\ncare. Most carriers of the virus are asymptomatic, and there's no simple exam\nthat can be conducted at ports of entry to confirm the presence of the\nillness. Because microcephaly can't be detected before the end of the second\ntrimester, pregnant women who have been exposed must wonder and wait.At the\nHermanos en el Camino shelter in Ixtepec, Gomez Diaz was one of four pregnant\nwomen in early March seeking respite before continuing a longer journey.The\nshelter, founded by Father Alejandro Solalinde Guerra in 2007, each year\nhouses as many as 15,000 migrants. Here migrants pass the time talking,\nplaying dominoes, resting on mattresses or avoiding members of rival gangs\nfrom their home countries, as they wait for humanitarian visas or simply find\nfood and shelter before continuing north.The train tracks in the center of\nIxtepec are littered with discarded supplies, the detritus of tens of\nthousands of journeys through one of the poorest regions of Mexico. Most\nmigrants, fearing extortion and kidnapping, stick close to the shelter, never\nventuring far beyond the dusty road in front.Carmen Elena Martinez Miranda,\n20, from El Salvador, is almost five months pregnant.

She and her siblings tried to calm the\nchild, and Caballero learned to fear losing control of her emotions.\"I always\nbelieve that God has given me the strength not to cry too much, because if I\ncry too much, I'm going to die of crying,\" she said.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5b0"},"content":"When Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) took over as House speaker, it was supposed to\nsignal a new era for Republicans — the arrival of a younger, more conservative\nvisionary, who scrubbed the cigarette smoke stains from outgoing Speaker John\nA. Boehner’s Capitol office, and promised a fresh start.Republicans craved the\nupbeat, button-down image Ryan offered. And his team served up the Ryan brand\nwith marketing flourish — lofty speeches, a TV blitz and videos galore,\nincluding a cheeky snow-cam from the speaker’s balcony showing the winter\nblizzard over the National Mall.But five months in, Ryan finds himself with a\nfamiliar problem. As Congress is careening toward another budget crisis and\nthe Republican Party is ripping itself apart over Donald Trump’s rise, the man\nbest known as the architect of the GOP’s austere spending blueprint is likely\nto miss an April 15 deadline to approve a new funding plan for 2017.**SIGN UP\nfor the free Essential Politics newsletter \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**He’s been unable to\novercome the same resistance from the conservative House Freedom Caucus that\ndoomed his predecessor, and is so far similarly unwilling to use the power of\nthe speaker’s office to force stragglers to fall into line.On the top issue of\nthe day, the turbulent presidential race, Ryan has refused to wade into the\nmuck, fearful of alienating House Republicans who back Donald Trump, but also\nworried about tarnishing his own image in case the party needs his help at a\nbrokered convention in July.He has a new job, speaker of the House, but Rep.\nPaul D. Ryan has stuck with a longtime routine, sequestering himself on a\nhunting stand in Wisconsin, picking off deer that he will turn into jerky,\nbrats and links to sustain him through the year.Making sausage, literally, is\na hobby of the new...He has a new job, speaker of the House, but Rep. Paul D.\nRyan has stuck with a longtime routine, sequestering himself on a hunting\nstand in Wisconsin, picking off deer that he will turn into jerky, brats and\nlinks to sustain him through the year.Making sausage, literally, is a hobby of\nthe new...To some, Ryan’s repeated calls for Republicans to “raise our gaze”\nand his frequent attempts to position himself as the GOP’s deep thinker are\nstarting to give off an air of ivory tower insignificance. Conservatives\nwonder if he's still a \"young gun\" trying to shake up the party.At a Trump\nrally in Ryan’s Wisconsin hometown of Janesville last week, the crowd booed\nthe mention of his name.“Now we understand why he didn’t want the job:\nCongress is broken and it’s hard for anybody to fix it,” said John Feehery, a\nformer Republican aide and now a GOP strategist. “Jumping on the back of this\ntiger has not been easy.”Allies see Ryan, who declined to be interviewed for\nthis story, as a leader who is slowly and deliberately piecing back together a\nRepublican Party that appears to have imploded during President Obama’s years\nin the White House.In many ways, the speaker’s problems are of his own making,\nthe result of a leadership strategy he helped forge to recruit the most\nconservative candidates to run for office and then, after Republicans won the\nHouse majority in the 2010 midterm election, reject almost all of Obama’s\ninitiatives.“It’s led to all this anger,” said Norman J. Ornstein, a scholar\nat the American Enterprise Institute. “They tried to make this entire process\nlook ugly and illegitimate. It worked. In the process of winning these short-\nterm victories in the midterms, they laid the groundwork for Trump.”Now, some\nof the same Freedom Caucus lawmakers who forced Boehner’s early retirement are\nbearing down on Ryan.Many are scoffing at the higher government funding levels\nBoehner had accepted as part of a compromise with Democrats last year. That\ndeal was supposed to “clear the barn” for Ryan by reversing some of the\nautomatic “sequester” cuts that factions of both parties said were too severe.\nBut many Republicans who didn’t like the deal then don’t like it any better\nnow, and Ryan doesn’t have enough votes to pass the budget without\nthem.Without an approved budget, it will be harder for Congress to pass the\nannual appropriation bills needed to fund government services. Ryan can’t rely\non Democrats, as Boehner did, because the proposed budget contains Republican\npriorities, like a Medicare overhaul with a new voucher program, that\nDemocrats oppose.Ryan initially escaped blame from conservatives for the deal\nBoehner made, but the honeymoon is now over and Congress risks a government\nshutdown if new money is not approved by Oct. 1.“Victory would be not shutting\ndown the government,” said Ron Bonjean, a former House Republican leadership\naide who is now a strategist.Some in the Freedom Caucus appreciate Ryan's\nwillingness to work with them, but see little change in the outcome. “Paul was\npart of the Boehner entourage,” said Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), a Freedom\nCaucus member.Ryan is falling back on what he has always done best: talking\nabout ideas.This is how Ryan rose in Congress, as a skilled communicator of a\nconservative vision. Now, rather than using the biggest House majority in\ngenerations as a legislative factory that churns out bills, Ryan is turning it\ninto a think tank to produce ideological position papers on taxes, national\nsecurity, poverty and other issues to inform the eventual Republican\npresidential nominee at the party’s convention in July.“What he’s trying to do\nis provide an alternative to a presidential campaign that many Republicans are\nlooking on with horror,” Ornstein said. “He’s trying to say, 'Look at me, I’m\na different kind of Republican.'”Ryan has said flatly that he would not be the\nparty’s nominee. But his name is often mentioned as a last-minute alternative\nto Trump or Sen. Ted Cruz, similar to the way he was drafted to take over as\nspeaker.Ryan is also working to ease the party in-fighting by rebuilding\ntrust, little by little, giving detractors a seat at the table and throwing\nopen decision-making to the troops, even if that means House Republicans\ncannot agree on a strategy that will pass a budget by the April deadline.So\nfar, the outcome has been a decidedly improved mood on Capitol Hill. Where\npreviously the party’s testy private sessions ended with Republicans lining up\nat microphones to fume at leadership, they now wait their turn to offer\nsolutions in a more cooperative atmosphere.**Join the conversation on Facebook\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Several bills have been signed into law under Ryan’s tenure,\nincluding a multiyear highway funding measure and an overhaul of the No Child\nLeft Behind education law. The ones that Obama vetoed — including a repeal of\nthe Affordable Care Act — have become a badge of honor for Republicans who\npride themselves on forcing a showdown with the White House.But the stalemate\non the budget is a particularly frustrating setback for lawmakers who just a\nfew years ago promoted a policy of no-budget-no-pay — blocking congressional\npaychecks until a budget was approved.Detractors see Ryan squandering the\nHouse majority by failing to dig in and lead. Democrats roll their eyes at his\ninability to muscle his troops. And even rank-and-file Republicans say it’s\ntough trying to convince voters back home that the party deserves the White\nHouse when Congress is idling.“When push comes to shove, you have to be a\nleader,” said Rep. Mark Amodei (R-Nev.), adding that congressional inaction is\nfueling Trump’s rise. “Putting it in neutral is dumber than standing water. It\nisn’t selling.”**Twitter: @lisamascaro****ALSO****Donald Trump is about to\nblow up the California primary.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5b2"},"content":"Donald Trump’s stumble over whether women seeking abortions should be\ncriminally punished provided a sobering look at the vulnerability of a\ncandidate more likely than anyone else to be the Republican nominee.As Trump\nhastily issued a statement saying, in effect, that he didn’t believe what he\nhad just said, his Republican challengers seized on his comments as proof that\nhe lacked both the knowledge and conservative commitment to serve as\npresident. Democrats cited his remarks as evidence that he and the rest of the\nRepublican field have skittered too far to the right on an issue on which\nAmericans are decidedly centrist.Candidate Trump’s stock in trade has been\nblustery confidence. The dust-up over abortion offered a bracing reminder of\nwhat can happen when that attitude mixes with Trump’s lack of experience —\nincluding on issues of huge importance to the Republican base. And it came at\na time when Trump was trying to steady his campaign after controversies over\nhis criticism of Ted Cruz’s wife and his campaign manager’s legal\nproblems.**Election 2016 | Live coverage on Trail Guide | Track the delegate\nrace | Sign up for the newsletter  **That all of the issues dealt in some way\nwith women made the developments more perilous politically and, perhaps, more\nrevealing of an element of Trump’s character.In presidential campaigns,\nabortion is often an issue of extreme importance to each party’s most reliable\nvoters, but not to the bulk of those voting. That has meant that candidates\nfollow party ideology to win the nomination, but the issue takes a distant\nback seat in the general election to more widely shared concerns, like the\neconomy or national security.That may not be the case this year. The\npercentage of people who see abortion rights as a threshold issue for\ndetermining their presidential pick has risen, polls suggest. Battles are\nbeing waged in many states where Republican legislatures have passed measures\nthat severely limit the availability of abortion despite its constitutional\nstanding.Riding a rebellion fueled by opposition to illegal immigration and\npessimism about the nation's future, Donald Trump leads a scrambling duo of\ncompetitors less than three months before California's Republican presidential\nprimary, a new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times statewide poll has\nfound.Yet...Riding a rebellion fueled by opposition to illegal immigration and\npessimism about the nation's future, Donald Trump leads a scrambling duo of\ncompetitors less than three months before California's Republican presidential\nprimary, a new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times statewide poll has\nfound.Yet...Most recently, the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin\nScalia—and the possibility that the next president will determine the balance\nof the court—has put abortion rights squarely into the campaign mix.Barely an\nevent occurs without Republican and Democratic candidates citing the court\nopening as a prime reason to vote and abortion as one of the key reasons\nwhy.That has left Republican candidates in an uncomfortable place: They and\ntheir party advocate a conservative position demanded by antiabortion\nactivists but opposed by the broader group of voters candidates need to\nattract to win a general election.Trump’s most recent difficulties began\nduring a town hall Wednesday evening, when MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews asked\nthe New York businessman about abortion. Trump repeated his current, fairly\nrecently acquired, position--that he opposes abortion with the traditional\nexceptions for victims of rape or incest or in cases when the life of the\nmother is endangered.Matthews pressed further, asking whether a woman should\nbe “punished” for having an abortion if, as Trump desires, it becomes illegal.\nAfter a back and forth, Trump said that “the answer is that there has to be\nsome form of punishment.”“For the woman?” Matthews asked.“Yes, there has to be\nsome form,” Trump replied, adding that he did not know what the punishment\nshould be.For Trump the logic may have been obvious: If abortion is made a\ncrime, there should be criminal penalties. But his answer upended what has\nbeen a near-unanimous posture by abortion opponents that a woman should not be\nheld criminally responsible.Trump may not have known that, since he has not\nbeen steeped in the abortion wars like the politicians he’s running against.\nWhen he considered a run for president in 2000, he described himself in a\ntelevision interview as “very pro-choice.” The clip was included this year in\nan ad by Cruz, the Texas senator who is one of the two remaining Trump\nchallengers. Trump says he now opposes abortion, but has never said when he\nchanged his mind.Trump didn’t help himself with two other comments on MSNBC:\nHe absolved fathers from any criminal punishment, even if a party to abortion.\nAnd he casually referred to what he saw as the outcome of his desired\nban:There's something almost sweet about the way Democrats and establishment\nRepublicans are coming together over their shared disgust with Donald Trump.\nUnable to find common ground on even the most basic issues (for instance, the\nconstitutionality of nominating a Supreme Court justice during an\nelection...There's something almost sweet about the way Democrats and\nestablishment Republicans are coming together over their shared disgust with\nDonald Trump. Unable to find common ground on even the most basic issues (for\ninstance, the constitutionality of nominating a Supreme Court justice during\nan election...“You know, you will go back to a position like they had, where\npeople will perhaps go to illegal places.”The immediate impact on Trump’s\nsupporters is likely nil; their support for him has outlasted controversies\nthat would have doomed any other political figure. His impolitic statements\nare taken by Trump loyalists—and even by some Republicans who have doubts\nabout him—as evidence of genuineness, candor and a welcome refusal to abide\npolitical correctness.But the Republican race is now in a fraught period:\nWithout consistent victories in the remaining states, Trump risks heading to\nthe July national convention without the 1,237 delegates needed to ensure his\nnomination.To defeat Trump, his opponents, Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich,\naren’t counting on his voters to abandon him. Instead, they hope waffling\nRepublicans in upcoming primary states—and, later, convention delegates—will\ndecide they cannot stomach the former reality television star as the party’s\nnominee.Their pile of ammunition has grown in the last week, with the feud\nover Trump’s and Cruz’s wives and the Trump campaign manager’s misdemeanor\ncharges for allegedly grabbing the arm of a female reporter. That may have\naccounted for the speed with which Trump offered a rare and hasty reversal on\nhis abortion comments.Soon after the remarks aired, he issued a statement that\neffectively changed his position without mentioning his previous remarks.“The\ndoctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be\nheld legally responsible, not the woman,” the new statement said, in setting\nout Trump’s view of what should happen. “The woman is a victim in this case as\nis the life in her womb. My position has not changed -- like Ronald Reagan, I\nam pro-life with exceptions.”Kasich impugned Trump’s abortion stance and Cruz\nwent further, calling attention to Trump’s unfamiliarity with many\nissues.“Once again Donald Trump has demonstrated that he hasn't seriously\nthought through the issues, and he'll say anything just to get attention,”\nCruz said.While Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders called Trump’s comments\n“shameful,” the party front runner Hillary Clinton used the issue more\nbroadly: setting up a general election contrast by reminding voters that the\nentire GOP field has moved to the right.“Now they aren't quite as open about\nit as Donald Trump was earlier today, but they all have the same position,”\nClinton said of the Republicans in a CNN interview. “If you make abortion a\ncrime -- you make it illegal -- then you make women and doctors\ncriminals.”Views among Americans on abortion have been remarkably stable,\nalthough highly partisan. A September 2015 Pew survey found 51% of Americans\nbacked abortion rights, to 43% opposed. But among older and more conservative\nvoters, target groups for the three GOP candidates, opposition to abortion has\nrisen.What has changed most is the emphasis voters give the issue. A Gallup\nsurvey last year found a record percentage of Americans would only vote for a\ncandidate with similar views on abortion rights—and abortion-rights supporters\nin that group now equaled those opposing abortion.Of all of the GOP\ncandidates, Trump, at least until Wednesday, may have had the most moderate\nposition on abortion. Cruz has opposed abortion even in cases of rape or\nincest and sought to shut down the government over money for Planned\nParenthood. Kasich favors exceptions in the case of rape, incest or the life\nof the mother, but has worked as governor to close down abortion providers and\nsigned a measure de-funding Planned Parenthood in Ohio.Trump has brought up\nthe subject of abortion mostly when asked about it. He has repeatedly praised\nPlanned Parenthood for its work on women’s health—fighting words to many\nRepublicans.More than anything, Trump has given the sense that the issue\ndoesn’t rise high on his list of concerns. His campaign thrusts are jobs,\ntrade and illegal immigration; when he feels the need to protect his right\nflank, he most often does it by citing his opposition to gun control.But\nthere’s a difference between putting an issue low on a list and not thinking\nthrough a position enough to weather questioning. By failing to do that, Trump\nnot only illuminated his lack of reflection on abortion. Just as dangerously,\nhe may have amplified questions from many voters about whether he lacks\nsomething else: the seriousness to claim the job he\nwants.cathleen.decker@latimes.com**Follow me on Twitter: @cathleendecker.

She suffered a heart attack Thursday morning while being\ntreated for bronchitis in a Miami hospital, according to her London-based\nfirm.Hadid made her mark with buildings such as London Aquatics Centre, which\nserved as a venue for the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, as well as the MAXXI\nmuseum for contemporary art in Rome and the innovative Bridge Pavilion in\nZaragoza, Spain.In the U.S. she designed the Lois \u0026amp; Richard Rosenthal\nCenter for Contemporary Art in Cincinnati and the Eli and Edythe Broad Art\nMuseum at Michigan State University, a modestly sized but architecturally\ndaring building of unconventional angles that opened in 2012.“She is without\nquestion one of the great architects of our time,” Eli Broad said in a\nstatement. “We will miss our friend, and the world will miss the many\ninnovative and cutting-edge projects she had yet to imagine.”Like many\narchitecture critics, I have spent a good chunk of the last two decades, or\nthe bulk of my career, grappling with the force, the flaws and the\ncomplexities of Zaha Hadid's work.

Hers was the shadow none of us could\nescape, and whose contours we puzzled over and tried, often in vain, to...When\nHadid received the Pritzker in 2004, the jury cited her “commitment to\nmodernism,” as well as her skill in “creating an architectural idiom like no\nother.”Her designs often made powerful visual statements, fusing the modern\nwith the avant-garde. She was dubbed the “Queen of the Curve” for buildings\nthat eschewed hard angles and corners.Her international cachet was\nstratospheric, but her career was not without controversy. One of her most\nsignificant projects in recent years was the Al Wakrah Stadium in Qatar, a\nsports center that will serve as a venue for the 2022 World Cup.In 2014, Hadid\nsued the New York Review of Books over an article that alleged deaths of\nconstruction workers on the project. Hadid vehemently denied the allegations,\nand the publication later issued a correction and apology, but the architect\nstill faced criticism for saying it wasn’t her job to worry about working\nconditions. The stadium design also was mocked by some for resembling female\ngenitalia.“It’s really embarrassing that they come up with nonsense like\nthis,” she told Time magazine in 2013.Hadid spoke her mind and didn’t filter\nher displeasure, sometimes to the detriment of her public image. The media\noften portrayed her as an abrasive, jet-set diva, but in person Hadid was\ndifferent, said Anissa Helou, the Lebanese-born chef and author who knew the\narchitect since their youth.Zaha Hadid in 2009 outside her Riverside Museum in\nGlasgow, Scotland.

Hadid, the first woman to win the\nPritzker Prize, architecture's highest honor, has died at age 65.“She never\nforgot her old friends,” Helou said. “Her success never spoiled her. She has a\nreputation for being difficult, but she was very loyal and true.”With her\ntempestuous spirit came a healthy dose of self-awareness.“I can be my own\nworst enemy,” she told the Guardian. “As a woman, I’m expected to want\neverything to be nice, and to be nice myself.”Born in Baghdad in 1950 to a\nwell-to-do family — her father was a leader of Iraq’s National Democratic\nParty and advocated for democratic reforms — Hadid attended school abroad and\nstudied mathematics at the American University of Beirut. She began her formal\npursuit of architecture in 1972 at the Architectural Assn. in London, where\nshe was a student of Rem Koolhaas.She began her own practice in London in the\nlate 1970s and gained attention for her theoretical work.Some of her earliest\nconcepts were never realized, partly because of their avant-garde nature. They\nincluded the Peak, a private club in Hong Kong that integrated new structures\non the hills of Kowloon, and a design for the Cardiff Bay Opera House in Wales\nthat faced resistance from some local politicians.Her later successes included\nthe Guangzhou Opera House in China, which opened in 2010, and the Heydar\nAliyev Center in Azerbaijan in 2013.The architect didn’t focus solely on\nprestige buildings.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5b8"},"content":"Elizabeth Vallejo was having a heart attack.It was Leap Day, and Vallejo, who\nprepares food for students, had finished her cafeteria shift at Hesby Oaks\nLeadership Charter. Around 1:30 p.m., she walked over to her manager's office\nto sign out, turned around to leave the room and fell to the ground.Lucky for\nVallejo, the school’s principal, Movses Tarakhchyan, used to be a lifeguard.\nOn top of that, he required that the whole school receive CPR training over\nthe summer, one of his first moves as the new principal.Tarakhchyan got a\nradio call from his staff: There was an injury, and they needed him.He ran to\nthe cafeteria, he recalled, thinking it could be a student hurt in a nearby PE\nclass.Instead, he found Vallejo on her back in the manager’s office, and it\nlooked like her mouth was slightly foaming. He thought she might be having a\nseizure, so he turned her on her side. Then he checked for a pulse but found\nnone. The school gets a nurse only twice a week, and Feb. 29 was not one of\nthose days. So one employee called 911 while another ran to retrieve the\nautomatic electronic defibrillator machine from the nurse’s office while\nTarakhchyan began performing manual CPR, pushing Vallejo’s chest and checking\nfor her pulse.“It’s not like in the movies where after two, three pumps\nsomebody wakes up,” he said. He thinks he performed CPR for a full five\nminutes, but it’s hard to say because it felt like time stopped, he said.It’s\nthe defibrillator that Tarakhchyan credits with saving Vallejo’s life. There\nare 411 such machines distributed to over 780 schools in the Los Angeles\nUnified district. All schools built after 2014 have one, L.A. Unified\nspokesman Samuel Gilstrap said. The district does not have an estimate of how\nmany schools have received CPR training. When schools request training,\nthough, the districts helps.When Tarakhchyan used the machine from Hesby Oaks,\nit couldn’t find a pulse, instead speaking out loud and telling him to shock\nVallejo. He did, but three minutes later, the machine repeated, “No pulse\nfound. Shock advised.” Tarakhchyan shocked her again.Throughout the process,\nthe principal says he flashed back to the last time he tried to save a life.\nAbout four years ago, Tarakhchyan’s father died of a heart attack in the\nbackyard. Tarakhchyan had tried CPR then, but it didn’t work. His family later\nfound out the heart attack was so bad, the principal’s father likely died\nbefore he hit the ground.------------**FOR THE RECORD****March 31, 10:26\na.m.:** An earlier version of this article stated that Movses Tarakhchyan’s\nfather died of a heart attack about four months ago. He died about four years\nago.------------Tarakhchyan didn’t think this time would be any different.\nThree minutes passed. The machine spoke again.“Pulse found.”Finally, the\nambulance arrived.The emergency medical technicians disconnected the machine\nand congratulated Tarakhchyan for keeping his employee alive.Manuel Vallejo\nwalked out of his storeroom shift at 3 p.m. expecting to see his wife, who\nusually picks him up. Instead he saw his 19-year-old son. He had no cellphone\nservice at work, so the school had called his older son in Northern\nCalifornia. All that was known was that Elizabeth Vallejo was in the hospital,\nthat she'd had a heart attack.Father and son rushed to Providence Tarzana\nMedical Center, where Elizabeth was undergoing angioplasty, a surgery to\nunblock her arteries.While the two waited, Elizabeth’s manager told Manuel\nVallejo what had happened. It felt like a punch in the gut, he said, as he\nwondered what would have happened if the heart attack had happened a few\nminutes later, while she was in the car, or when the principal wasn’t there,\nor didn’t know how to perform CPR. The doctor told Manuel that his wife was\nlucky to be alive. The cardiologist who treated Elizabeth, Dr. Daniel Manavi,\nconfirmed that Tarakhchyan’s CPR saved Elizabeth.Manuel met his wife in the\nPhilippines, and the two moved to California in the 1980s. Here, they raised\ntwo sons, one of whom wants to be a nurse. For the two days when her health\nstatus was unclear, he slept for only about 45 minutes.Elizabeth Vallejo\ndoesn’t remember anything about the heart attack, other than waking up in the\nhospital. But talking about it weeks later, she cries. “This is my second\nlife,” she said over the phone, in between tears. “The principal, he didn’t\ngive up.”** Sonali Kohli at Sonali.Kohli@latimes.com or on Twitter\n@Sonali_Kohli.**\n\n","title":"Is your school CPR trained?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5ba"},"content":"The California Supreme Court will not hear an appeal from a Santa Clarita\nfamily to return their longtime foster daughter, who is part Native American,\nafter the girl was removed from their home last week in a tribal custody case.\nThe court rejected attorney Lori Alvino-McGill's request without comment\nWednesday, and her clients, Rusty and Summer Page, said they are willing to\ntake it to the U.S. Supreme Court if they must. The 6-year-old girl was\nremoved from the Pages’ home on March 21 and placed with extended family\nmembers in Utah, who include a half sister. Because the girl is one-sixty-\nfourth Choctaw, the federal Indian Child Welfare Act, intended to limit the\nbreakup of Native American families through adoption or foster care placement,\napplies to her case.The Page family said that the case would remain with the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal and that they were prepared to take it to the\nnation’s highest court. Rusty and Summer Page, speaking to reporters outside\nthe 2nd District Court of Appeal in downtown Los Angeles on Thursday, said\nthey had not been allowed to have any contact with the girl since the court-\nordered removal. The girl had lived with the Pages and their three children\nfor more than four years, and the Pages tried unsuccessfully to adopt her.“She\nhas never gone this long without speaking to us or seeing us, her mommy and\ndaddy,” Rusty Page said. Armand Montiel, a spokesman for the Los Angeles\nCounty Department of Children and Family Services, said Thursday that the girl\nwas in Utah, with her relatives.Kevin Lapp, an associate professor at Loyola\nLaw School whose focus is juvenile law, said the U.S. Supreme Court's\nwillingness in 2013 to take up the \"Baby Veronica\" case — returning a Cherokee\ngirl to her adoptive parents after a long legal battle — suggests a high-court\nbattle isn't out of the question.\"It suggests that the court isn't\ndisinterested in dealing with these complicated child welfare cases,\" Lapp\nsaid.News cameras and hundreds of supporters were on hand at the family’s\nSanta Clarita home last week when county workers came to take the child away.\nIn the days since, the Pages and their supporters have flooded social media\nwith calls to bring the girl back, and more than 116,000 people have signed a\npetition on Change.org.On Thursday, Rusty Page defended their decision to\nfight the case in public.“I don’t know a single parent who wouldn’t scream\nfrom the mountaintops or run to the ends of the Earth for their child, and\nthat’s what we’ve done,” he said.Speaking directly to the girl, he said,\n“Since no one has allowed you to contact us, I will remind you what you told\nme just before they came to take you away: You told me I was your Superman,\nand that’s exactly what I’m going to be for as long as it takes.”Page said the\ncounty had taken a “politically correct stand for the tribe” and was not\nacting in the girl’s best interest.The girl had regular visits with her out-\nof-state relatives before being placed with them, said Leslie Starr Heimov,\nexecutive director of the Children’s Law Center of California, the court-\nappointed law firm that represents foster youths.An L.A. Superior Court judge\npreviously ruled that the girl should be placed with her Utah relatives, and\nthe girl remained with the Pages as appeals dragged on and the California\nappeals court identified mistakes by the lower courts.An appellate court stay\npreventing the removal of the girl from California was lifted earlier this\nmonth when the 2nd District Court of Appeal denied a writ petition filed by\nthe Pages, Heimov said.“There are two families that love her,” Heimov said.\n“The court has made a decision. We need to follow the law, and we need to\nenforce the court orders.”The Oklahoma-based Choctaw Nation has said that\n“from the beginning of this case, the Choctaw Nation advocated for [the\ngirl’s] placement with her family” and that many steps had been taken to\nensure the best placement for her.An independent clinical psychologist was\nbrought in to gauge her ability to transition from her foster family to her\nrelatives, and a California court appointed a marriage and family therapist to\nperform a child custody evaluation “to assess the mental health and parenting\npractices of both parties,” the tribe said in a statement.While it is fairly\ncommon for the Indian Child Welfare Act to apply in the placement of foster\nchildren, it is rare for such cases to become as contentious as the Pages’\nbecause the issue usually comes up early in the foster care process, Lapp\nsaid. The longer a child stays with a family, he said, the greater the bonds\nformed and the more difficult removal becomes.“The delays make it difficult,”\nhe said. “This one is four years into a foster placement, so the removal from\nthe foster home seems more traumatic because of the timing.”Still, even if the\ngirl had no Native American ties, he said, most dependency courts aim to place\nsiblings together, as will be the case with the girl in Utah. **MORE: Get our\nbest stories in your Facebook feed \u0026gt;\u0026gt;****For breaking California news,\nfollow @haileybranson and @JosephSerna.****ALSO****San Bernardino terrorist\nattack victims hear how donations will be distributed****Family of engineer\nkilled in Oxnard crash sues Metrolink****Painkiller fentanyl linked to six\ndeaths and numerous overdoses in Sacramento area**\n\n","title":"State Supreme Court will not hear Santa Clarita family's appeal in tribal custody case - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"The California Supreme Court will not hear the Santa Clarita family's tribal custody appeal https://t.co/k8TOM18C5K https://t.co/Bn88W74PAA","date":"Thu Mar 31 15:14:26 +0000 2016","favs":22,"id":{"$numberLong":"715557876471898112"},"retweets":26},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/22RWL0s"}

But little is\nknown about why the court rejects certain appeals.The justices vote on which\ncases to accept in a closed meeting held around a large, imposing table in the\nchief justice's corner chambers in San Francisco. Their decisions are\nannounced in brief orders, often no more than a paragraph. The orders give the\ncase name and number, without any description, and do not reveal the court's\nreasoning.**See the most-read stories this hour \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**For decades the\nprocess has been largely veiled in secrecy — until Gov. Jerry Brown appointed\nJustice Goodwin Liu to the seven-member court.During the last several months,\nLiu, a former law professor, has written two lengthy dissents from the\nmajority's refusal to hear cases. The first, in October, protested the court's\nvote against hearing a case in which a 10-year-old was deemed capable of\nwaiving his right to remain silent.The second came Friday. Liu protested that\nthe court should have considered an appeal from two marijuana growers\nsentenced to life for a killing a jury found they did not personally\ncommit.\"Because this case would enable us to provide useful guidance to the\ntrial courts, and because defendants present a strong argument that they were\nconvicted of second degree murder on a theory unsupported by sufficient\nevidence, I would grant review,\" Liu wrote.Lengthy dissents from orders\ndenying review, while rare on the California Supreme Court, are not uncommon\non the U.S. Supreme Court. Some U.S. Supreme Court dissents from such orders\nhave become famous.Justice Harry A. Blackmun's 1994 condemnation of capital\npunishment — \"From this day forward, I no longer shall tinker with the\nmachinery of death\" — came in a dissent from the court's refusal to hear an\nappeal of a Texas inmate.Liu and Brown's other appointees have spent most of\ntheir careers enmeshed in federal, not state, law.\"Perhaps Justice Liu thinks\nthat is a good practice to incorporate into the California Supreme Court,\"\nsaid David S. Ettinger, an appellate lawyer who writes about the state court\non his law firm's blog, At the Lectern.Dissents from such orders are not\nbinding, and California law remains unclear about whether they can be cited in\ndifferent cases, Ettinger said.Goodwin Liu, President Obama's polarizing\nchoice for the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, has\nwithdrawn from consideration after last week's filibuster of his nomination in\nthe Senate.\"With no possibility of an up-or-down vote on the horizon, my\nfamily and I have decided that...Goodwin Liu, President Obama's polarizing\nchoice for the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, has\nwithdrawn from consideration after last week's filibuster of his nomination in\nthe Senate.\"With no possibility of an up-or-down vote on the horizon, my\nfamily and I have decided that...Liu's October dissent on whether youngsters\nwere capable of waiving their rights reads like a brief imploring the U.S.\nSupreme Court to take up the question, Ettinger said. In fact, lawyers for the\njuvenile cited Liu's dissent in a petition to the high court to review the\ncase, Ettinger said. That petition is still pending.Santa Clara University law\nprofessor Gerald Uelmen views Liu's dissents as evidence of \"a power struggle\"\non the California court between Brown's appointees and the Republican\nappointees.Liu chose to write his dissent last week in a case that examined\n\"the natural and probable consequences doctrine.\" The legal theory says that\nsomeone can be convicted of a crime they did not personally commit or even\nforesee if a reasonable person should have known the crime was the likely\nresult of his conduct.The appeal was filed by Sidonio Cruz-Santos and Augustin\nZepeda-Onofre, who worked on an illegal marijuana-growing operation in\nNorthern California. They hosted a party one night for an employee and others.\nTwo of the partygoers later argued, and one was shot and killed.The\nprosecution argued that because the defendants armed themselves and others to\nprotect the illegal crop, they bore responsibility for the killing.Liu argued\nthat the marijuana-growing operation had nothing to do with the killing.\nWorkers were given guns to protect against wild animals and thieves, \"not\nirritating guests,\" Liu wrote.The argument that apparently sparked the\nshooting dealt with whether the victim had told the other man's wife that he\nhad used cocaine. It had nothing to do with marijuana, Liu contended.\"Although\nit may be reasonably foreseeable that a grow operation worker who carries a\ngun will use it to protect the operation, it is not reasonably foreseeable\nthat the worker will use the gun against a person who simply irritates the\nworker but poses no apparent threat to the operation,\" Liu wrote.The Brown\nappointee said the evidence failed to establish that the killing had anything\nto do with the grow operation, \"much less that it was a reasonably foreseeable\nconsequence\" of the marijuana cultivation.Brown's other appointees, Justice\nMariano-Florentino Cuellar and Leondra R. Kruger, did not sign Liu's dissent.\nKruger, who gave birth to a daughter on March 1, was absent. The order did not\nstate how Cuellar voted on the case.Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye, joined\nby three other justices, defended the majority's decision, noting that that\n\"reasonable minds may differ.\" She stressed that a court decision to reject an\nappeal does not mean the justices supported the result in the case.There's a\nnew report out on longtime marijuana use. And it's bad news for habitual\nstoners.In summary: The more pot you smoke, the more apt you are to be a\nloser.And it’s not so much that losers toke weed.

It’s that toking a lot of\nweed over several years turns someone into a loser. It’s not...The court hears\nand decides only a fraction of the appeals it receives each year. The justices\nmay disagree with a lower court ruling but decide the underlying legal issue\nshould be resolved in a future case framed by a more compelling set of\nfacts.Or the justices may reject a case because they want the core legal issue\nto percolate further in the lower courts.Or the court may disagree with the\nresult but decide the legal issue at stake lacks statewide importance.The\ncourt also can decertify lower court rulings, preventing them from being cited\nas precedent, without actually reviewing and overturning them. The appeals\ncourt that decided the marijuana growers' case, though, had not certified its\nruling. Decertification was not an option for the California Supreme\nCourt.Whatever Liu's reasons, his dissent last week had a purpose. It was a\nsign to other lawyers that at least one justice was troubled by the\napplication of \"the natural and probable consequences doctrine.\" It may also\nhave been an invitation for defense lawyers to bring similar cases before the\ncourt.And it provided notice to the public that the state's highest court let\nstand two life sentences in a difficult case for reasons the justices did not\nhave to explain._Twitter: _@mauradolan**ALSO****Plaschke: This is a big rookie\nmistake for D'Angelo Russell****Pregnant woman's death spurs a safety debate\nabout China's street fences****Apple wants the FBI to reveal how it hacked the\nSan Bernardino killer's iPhone**\n\n","title":"What's the California Supreme Court thinking?

And the agency has shown no...Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik,\ncarried out the deadly attacks at the Inland Regional Center on Dec. 2,\nleaving 14 dead and many more wounded. Federal prosecutors went to court to\nforce Apple to help them unlock Farook's phone, but the historic court battle\nwas staved off earlier this week when a third party helped the FBI gain access\nto the device.\"The iPod had just come into our possession a couple of weeks\nago,\" Hiland said Wednesday. \"Obviously when we heard that [the FBI] had been\nable to crack that phone we wanted to at least ask and see if they wanted to\nhelp.\"Hiland did not know what operating system the phone, which belonged to\nDrexler, was running.The phone at the heart of the Arkansas case is a later\nmodel than the one used by Farook, but it would present some of the same\naccess problems, said Andrew Crocker, a staff attorney with the Electronic\nFrontier Foundation, a digital rights group in San Francisco.An iPhone 6 would\nbe running iOS8 or a later operating system that encrypts all data on the\nphone, when locked, Crocker said. Apple has said it lacks the capability to\nbypass that level of encryption.The device would also trigger a delay after\neach successive incorrect passcode entry, meaning even FBI software that can\ninput an endless string of password combinations would encounter longer and\nlonger wait times between attempts.On Tuesday, an FBI official told the Los\nAngeles Times that the successful hack of Farook's phone was unlikely to help\npolice win broader access to encrypted data. Police officials have long\ncomplained that encryption acts as a roadblock to routine criminal\ninvestigations, rendering useless thousands of smartphones sitting in police\nevidence lockers around the country. The process used to gain access to\nFarook's phone might not work on other devices, according to the official, who\nwas not authorized to discuss the case and spoke on the condition of\nanonymity. The official said it was also unlikely that the FBI would use the\nnew tool in cases that would result in criminal prosecutions because the\nmethod would then become subject to discovery at trial.Crocker said he was\nskeptical that the Arkansas case would be analagous to the situation involving\nFarook's phone.“In a criminal case, if the FBI uses a technique, there’s going\nto be questions about divulging that technique or chain of custody to the\ndefense,\" he said. \"So my instinct is this might be something\ndifferent.”Hiland said he's not concerned with setting a precedent. He simply\nwants access to all the available evidence at trial.“Our focus is on the\ncase,\" he said. \"Our job is to seek justice.\"Though the FBI might want to use\nthe new tool to help solve other criminal cases, doing so would also make the\nprocess subject to discovery during criminal trials and place the information\nin the public domain, according to the official, who was not authorized to\ndiscuss the case and spoke on the condition of anonymity.Any application of\nthe method used to access Farook's phone would probably be limited to\ninvestigations that are unlikely to result in criminal cases, the official\nsaid.**Follow @JamesQueallyLAT \u0026amp; @lacrimes for crime and police news in\nSouthern California.****MORE ON APPLE VS.

Jerry Brown would gradually lift the statewide minimum wage\nfrom its current $10 to $15 an hour by 2023. About 800,000 workers were\nalready promised raises to $15 in several cities that passed their own minimum\nwage hikes, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Santa Monica.More than a\nthird of the state's workers would benefit from those moves, UC Berkeley\nestimates.\"California's proposal would be the highest minimum wage we have\nseen in the United States, and because of California's sheer size, it would\ncover the largest number of workers,\" said Ken Jacobs, chairman of the UC\nBerkeley center. \"This is a very big deal for low-wage workers in California,\nfor their families and for their children.\"Nearly half, or 48%, of workers who\nstand to get a raise have a household income that is twice the federal poverty\nthreshold or below, UC Berkeley estimates.An individual at that level takes\nhome $24,662 a year or less, while a family of four makes $48,894 or less. The\nmedian household in California earns $61,489.Ninety-six percent of employees\nwho would be affected are at least 20 years old, and more than a third have\nchildren. Seventy-two percent are Latino, black or Asian.The average worker\nwho would get a pay bump under Brown's proposal provides slightly more than\nhalf of his or her family's income.The UC Berkeley estimate also includes some\nwho earn slightly more than the lowest wage and stand to benefit from a ripple\neffect as businesses dole out raises to try to maintain a pay scale based on\nexperience, Jacobs said.If Brown's plan passes, 5.6 million low-wage workers\nwould earn $20 billion more in wages by 2023, according to the UC Berkeley\nanalysis. It assumed no net jobs would be lost as businesses look to trim\ncosts.For Roberto Aparicio, 25, the raise would come at an opportune moment.\nAparicio, a forklift worker who lives in Highland Park, already has one child\nand is expecting another baby.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5be"},"content":"A powerful painkiller that can be fatal even in small doses is the latest\nfront in a nationwide epidemic of street drug abuse, recently becoming the\nprime suspect in a rash of overdoses that killed six people in less than a\nweek in Sacramento County.Experts say the rise of fentanyl is fueled by\nwidespread prescription drug abuse that claims thousands of lives each year.\nSince 1999, more than 165,000 people in the U.S. have died of causes related\nto painkiller use.Once centered on the East Coast, use of the drug now seems\nto be spreading west, probably through Mexican drug cartels, medical and law\nenforcement officials said.“This is just another face of the opioid epidemic,”\nsaid Dr. Caleb Alexander, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug\nSafety and Effectiveness.During a seven-day period ending Tuesday, health\nworkers in Sacramento reported 28 overdoses, six of them fatal, from pills\nthat appeared to contain fentanyl. The painkiller offers an intense, euphoric\nhigh and is sometimes used to cut heroin and cocaine or passed off as another\ndrug.The pills resembled Norco, a prescription painkiller similar to Vicodin\nand Percocet. But lab tests didn’t find Norco’s active ingredients and the\ntablets were likely fentanyl pills manufactured to resemble Norco, Sacramento\nCounty Division of Public Health spokeswoman Laura McCasland said\nWednesday.One official said the street price of the pills was no more than\n$5.A few grains of the odorless, white powder, often called “China White” or\n“Apache,” can be enough to kill.Prescribed to cancer patients for decades,\nfentanyl is the most powerful painkiller available for medical treatment, up\nto 100 times stronger than morphine. It’s typically administered as a lozenge,\npatch or injection to patients with severe pain.In recent years, an illegally\nmanufactured version of the drug has begun spreading, with cases concentrated\nin the eastern half of the United States.Between 2012 and 2014, the number of\nseizures of illegally used fentanyl nationwide increased more than seven-fold\nto 4,585, according to federal officials.Sgt. Salvador Robles of the\nSacramento County Sheriff’s major narcotics impact division said investigators\nhave a “strong lead” on a Sacramento County home where two of the overdoses\noccurred and are hoping to trace the cases back to the source of the\nfentanyl.Robles said he didn’t know whether this was a single bad batch, or a\nlarger problem.“My only tip is, if you’re addicted to Norco or any pills, do\nnot take them right now,” he said.An increase in doctor-prescribed painkillers\nover the last decade has left many patients addicted to opiates, intensifying\na heroin epidemic that is ravaging many towns nationwide, experts\nsaid.**Interested in the stories shaping California? Sign up for the free\nEssential California newsletter \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**In 2014, 28,647 people died of\noverdose deaths from opioids, including heroin, the highest toll ever\nrecorded, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In\nSacramento County, heroin use has increased within the last decade as use of\nmethamphetamines have dropped, Robles said. Fifteen years ago, seizing a few\nounces of heroin in Sacramento County was rare, he said, but “now we’re\nfinding it in (kilos).”There’s no typical customer for the drug, he said.\n“We’ve seen individuals meeting street-level dealers that are homeless,” and\nthen those same dealers “meet people who are driving in Mercedes and BMWs,” he\nsaid.John Martin, special agent for the U.S. Drug and Enforcement\nAdministration’s San Francisco division, said the agency is taking the\nSacramento incidents “very seriously,” but couldn’t comment on the\nspecifics.The cases appear to be the latest wave of the heroin epidemic\nsweeping across the country, he said.“Obviously it’s been big on the East\nCoast and Midwest, it’s possible that it could be coming this way,” Martin\nsaid.Fentanyl is a new wrinkle in the drug trade, he said. Approximately 700\npeople died from fentanyl and its analogs nationwide between late 2013 and\nlate 2014, according to a recent report from the DEA.Past investigations have\nrevealed that Mexican cartels are purchasing fentanyl produced in China then\nusing traditional trafficking routes to bring it into the United States. In\n2014, DEA officers seized 26 pounds of fentanyl in a stash house in Los\nAngeles.Alexander, the Johns Hopkins physician, said that demand will remain\nstrong until the prescription drug epidemic is under control. He said doctors\nshould limit how often they prescribe opiates to patients and expand treatment\nprograms for those who are already addicted.“Do we need to be worried about\nit? Yes,” Alexander said. “But I don’t think ... these deaths can be separated\nfrom the surge in overuse of prescription opioid. It’s part and parcel of the\nsame problem.”In remarks Tuesday at a conference on drug abuse, President\nObama said more Americans now die each year from opioid overdose than in\ntraffic accidents. He has asked for more than $1 billion in the federal\nfunding to help expand access to treatment programs.Earlier this month,\nofficials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released\nnew guidelines strongly discouraging doctors from prescribing opiates,\nincluding OxyContin and Vicodin, for patients with chronic conditions such as\nback problems, migraines and arthritis.“We know of no other medication\nroutinely used for a nonfatal condition that kills patients so frequently,”\nwrote CDC director Dr. Tom Frieden and a colleague in the New England Journal\nof Medicine.Shelly Elkington, 49, thinks stricter guidelines could have saved\nher daughter’s life. While in college, Casey Jo was diagnosed with Crohn’s\ndisease, an incurable bowel disorder  that can require repeated surgeries.She\nwas prescribed painkillers, including fentanyl. “I always want to say her\ndoctor meant well,” said Elkington, who lives in Montevideo, Minn. “His\nintentions were always good – to make her feel better.”But Casey Jo quickly\nbecame addicted to opiates, eventually turning to street drugs when doctors\ntried to wean her off of them.She had dropped out of school and couldn’t\novercome her addiction, her mother remembers. Casey Jo began smoking fentanyl\nand buying heroin.“It brought her into a world she was not prepared for,” she\nsaid. “Everyday, we didn’t know if we were going to get a call that she was\narrested, assaulted, raped, everything. We were so afraid for her all the\ntime.”One day in August last year, Elkington got that fated call: Her daughter\nhad been found dead in her apartment. She was 26.“I watched my daughter\nvirtually slip away from us,” she said.**See more of our top stories on\nFacebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;****ALSO****Former USC chief Steven Sample is remembered for\nhis deep faith****FBI agrees to help Arkansas prosecutors open iPhone after\nhack of San Bernardino device****State to begin using children's blood tests\nto focus cleanup of Vernon battery recycling plant**\n\n","title":"Painkiller fentanyl linked to contaminated street drugs is prime suspect in deaths, overdoses - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Painkiller fentanyl linked to six deaths and numerous overdoses in Sacramento area https://t.co/tURJ9EpvrT https://t.co/y1aMc6Jbqp","date":"Thu Mar 31 14:01:00 +0000 2016","favs":13,"id":{"$numberLong":"715539394489421824"},"retweets":25},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1Rs1KxK"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5bf"},"content":"Five members of the World Cup champion U.S. women’s soccer team filed a wage-\ndiscrimination action against U.S. Soccer on Thursday, claiming women players\nwere paid nearly four times less than their male counterparts despite bringing\nin substantially more money.Using figures from U.S. Soccer’s 2015 financial\nreport, the filing with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission charges\nthat while the women’s team generated millions more in revenue than the men’s\nteam last year, women continue to be paid less for everything from appearances\nand wins to per diems and sponsorship appearances.“The numbers speak for\nthemselves,” said goalkeeper Hope Solo, who has played 15 years with the U.S.\nnational team. “We are the best in the world, have three World Cup\nchampionships, four Olympic championships and the [men] get paid more to show\nup than we get paid to win major championships.”Joining Solo in the filing\nwere Carli Lloyd, the FIFA world player of the year, co-captain Becky\nSauerbrunn, midfielder Megan Rapinoe and forward Alex Morgan. While only five\nplayers signed the complaint, they said they were acting on behalf of the\nentire U.S. women’s team.Thursday’s action is not expected to affect their\nparticipation in this summer’s Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, with some\nplayers saying privately they intend to play no matter what happens with the\ncomplaint.The EEOC is expected to take up to six months to investigate the\nchargers. said Eva Cole, a partner at the New York law firm Winston \u0026amp;\nStrawn, which is representing the women. Among the remedies available to the\nEEOC are urging a conciliation agreement, or suing U.S. Soccer on behalf of\nthe players, Cole said.The filing is the second major dispute between the\nfederation and the players. In February U.S. Soccer sued the players’ union\nafter a lawyer for the group claimed the women were no longer bound by terms\nof a collective bargaining agreement that expired in 2012. Since March 2013,\nthe federation and the union have been operating under “a memorandum of\nunderstanding” that U.S. Soccer insists was ratified by the players and is\nstill in effect.According to figures contained in Thursday’s filing, members\nof the women’s national team were paid $3,600 a game last year while men could\nmake as much as $17,625 a game, depending on the opponent. With bonuses based\non performance, the maximum a woman could make for playing 20 games would be\n$99,000, some 21/2 times less than what a male player could make.Yet it was\nrevenue generated by the women’s team that was responsible for most of U.S.\nSoccer’s profit last year, with its post-World Cup victory tour turning a\nprojected $429,000 loss for the fiscal year that ended Thursday into a\n$17.7-million profit.“The reality is that this team is more valuable to [U.S.\nSoccer] than the men’s team has been. That’s what the facts show,” said\nJeffrey Kessler, co-chairman of Winston \u0026amp; Strawn.Some of those numbers\nmight be misleading, though, because they largely come from a one-year\nsnapshot that included the women’s triumphant World Cup campaign and the start\nof preparations for the 2016 Olympics. According to a U.S. Soccer spokesman,\nover the last four years — a period that includes the last men’s World Cup —\nthe men’s team brought in nearly twice as much revenue as the women’s team,\nalthough the federation refused to provide specific numbers.As evidence of its\nsupport for women’s soccer, the federation touted the $10 million it spent to\nlaunch the National Women’s Soccer League, which will enter its fourth season\nthis year.“I have no doubt that we’ll get a deal done and that we’ll get back\nto focusing on the game,” said U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati. “We’ll get\na deal done that’s fair to the players.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5c0"},"content":"On Thursday night, at an invitation-only, Hollywood-style premiere on his\nSpaceX campus in Hawthorne, Elon Musk and his Tesla team will unveil their\nlatest creation: the Model 3, Musk's long-awaited electric car for the\nmasses.Few details have been revealed so far, but the car is essentially a\nscaled-down, half-priced version of Tesla's $70,000 Model S. The newest\nproduct from Musk's Fremont, Calif., car factory represents Musk's dream of\nbringing affordable, pollution-free transportation to a world he sees choking\nto death on its own fumes.Tesla has said the car will travel up to 200 miles\non a single, plug-in electric charge, and will retail from as low as $35,000.\nQualified buyers could receive up to $10,000 in federal and state sales\nincentives, rebates or tax breaks.The car, which has not been shown to the\npublic nor reviewed by the automotive media, is not yet in production. Early\nadopters who plunk down cash to reserve the first models won't receive them\nuntil at least December 2017 — and it could be a lot longer than that. Tesla's\nexotic \"falcon wing\" Model X had production difficulties that delayed its\ndelivery more than 18 months. Several analysts are expecting the same to\nhappen with the Model 3.But customers eager to be the first on their blocks to\nown the new vehicles declared their intention to form lines outside Tesla\nshowrooms hours before the first orders were to be taken Thursday morning,\nlike teenagers queuing for a rock concert or technophiles waiting for a new\niPhone.Tesla has indicated it expects to get tens of thousands of pre-orders.\nSome estimates have suggested the company could receive 100,000 orders in the\nfirst 24 hours.Despite that, critics say, the Model 3 may arrive too late to\nbeat other equally affordable long-range plug-ins coming from major\nmanufacturers, and it will be competing for a stubbornly small share of the\ncar-buying public interested in plug-in electric technology.And there are\ndoubts that the company can even get the car on the road in a timely\nfashion.Teaser images released by Tesla hint at a vehicle that is shorter and\nslimmer than the Model S and considerably less bulky than Tesla's SUV-like\nModel X. Automotive experts assume the car will be sold in single-motor, rear-\nwheel-drive and dual-motor, all-wheel-drive versions, as is the Model S. The 3\nwould probably be outfitted with a 44-kilowatt-hour battery with a range of\nabout 200 miles, or a larger 66-kilowatt-hour battery capable of more than 300\nmiles.It would be, like the S and X, priced accordingly — with base models\nstarting at $35,000 and luxury, performance models costing twice as much.The\nindustry publication Green Car Reports has said the success or failure of the\nModel 3 \"will almost certainly make or break Tesla as a car company.\"Analysts\nbullish on Tesla believe the mass-market car could be a massive success.\"If\nthey can do it at that price point, and with that range, they have the\npotential to pull in a lot of people,\" said Kelley Blue Book senior analyst\nRebecca Lindland. \"They already have captured some of the wealthiest car\nbuyers [with the Models S and X]. This could be the car they bring to the\nmasses.\"Tesla faces one great challenge in doing that: the Chevy Bolt. General\nMotors last year announced its intention to have a 200-mile-range plug-in\nelectric car on the market at about $37,500 by the end of 2016. Though the\ncompany now will say only that the car will be in production this year, it is\ngenerally assumed that the Bolt (from a company that has already had success\nwith its hybrid plug-in electric Volt) will be on the market before Tesla's\nModel 3.And other plug-in electric cars with longer ranges are said to be in\nthe works at Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, Volvo and other companies.David\nReichmuth, senior clean vehicles engineer for the Union of Concerned\nScientists, gives Musk and Tesla credit for making electric cars cool and\nforcing mainstream manufacturers to pay attention to a technology that, so\nfar, they've had trouble selling to the general public. Electric vehicle sales\nrepresent less than 3% of all new car sales in most markets.\"Tesla has been\ngreat at selling electric cars, highlighting their quick acceleration and\ntheir quiet ride,\" Reichmuth said. \"That is pushing other companies\nalong.\"Tesla faces other challenges as well.Consumer Reports recently added\ncertain model year Model S's to its \"Worst of the Worst\" section on its list\nof \"Used Cars to Avoid,\" as Tesla has struggled with reliability and\ndependability issues.The company's stock price has been on a roller-coaster\nthe last year. After hitting a high of $280 in July 2015, shares sunk to $143\nin February after unexpectedly large fourth-quarter losses.Though the stock\nclosed down $3.24, or 1.4%, to 226.89 on Wednesday, Tesla critics believed\nthat bubble must soon burst.\"Model S sales have flattened, and Model X is\nturning into a disappointment, and now nothing is going to happen until the\nModel 3 comes out — probably not until mid- to late-2018,\" said hedge fund\nmanager Mark Spiegel of Stanphyl Capital Management.Given the fourth-quarter\nlosses, Spiegel said, the success of the Model 3 may not even help Tesla's\nbottom line. The company sold more cars than ever but experienced greater\nlosses than ever.\"The Model 3 will not save the company,\" Spiegel said. \"The\nModel 3 is going to speed up the end of the company.\"When it comes to\nbatteries, homeowners apparently don’t need as much energy storage as Tesla\nMotors thought they did.Tesla Motors says it will concentrate only on\ndeveloping its 7-kilowatt-hour Daily Powerwall battery, which is intended for\neveryday use but also has backup power capabilities.When it comes to\nbatteries, homeowners apparently don’t need as much energy storage as Tesla\nMotors thought they did.Tesla Motors says it will concentrate only on\ndeveloping its 7-kilowatt-hour Daily Powerwall battery, which is intended for\neveryday use but also has backup power capabilities.A further complication is\nthe likely end of some electric-vehicle rebates. California is already\ndebating whether to disallow such tax breaks for wealthy consumers. And some\nstate and federal rebates will expire after the manufacturer has sold 200,000\nindividual cars.According to data compiled by the research firm Polk and by\nthe industry publication Inside Evs, Tesla to date has sold about 67,000\nvehicles that qualified for rebates. If the company hits its stated sales\ntarget of 80,000 to 90,000 vehicles this year, analysts said, those rebates\ncould expire before the first Model 3 leaves the factory floor.Such naysaying\nmeans nothing to true Tesla believers. Some said they intended to be first in\nline when Tesla's retail showrooms begin taking first-come, first-served\ndeposits for the new car.Online deposits will start Thursday night, Tesla\nsaid, and \"existing customers will get priority.\" (Tesla has said that\ndeposits are \"fully refundable\" and can be applied to the purchase of a Model\nS or X at any time, if buyers are concerned about the long wait for a\n3.)Motivated buyers will be asked to deposit $1,000 to reserve a Model 3 —\ndown from the $5,000 buy-in Tesla requested for the Model X.Paul Scott, 63, of\nSanta Monica is one such fan. An early electric car adopter who once worked as\na Nissan Leaf salesman, Scott said the Model S and X — and even Tesla's first\nvehicle, the now-discontinued Roadster — were too expensive. But the Model 3\nappeals to him.\"I am going to order a fully loaded one, since I understand\nthose are the models they will build first,\" Scott said. \"And I'm fully\nprepared to buy it even without the tax credit.\"Scott, who says he'd go as\nhigh as $50,000 for the option-laden car, has owned a plug-in Toyota Rav-4 and\ntwo Leafs in the past, but now relies only on his Zero S electric motorcycle\nto get around.He has a unique plan for his Model 3. He's going to buy it, then\nfind an Uber or Lyft driver to lease it from him. The driver will have to\ninsure the car and find a place to park it. The driver will also have to be\nScott's personal chauffeur.\"This will pay for the car, and I'll have it\nwhenever I need it,\" Scott said. \"It's kind of like a free\ncar.\"_charles.fleming@latimes.com_**ALSO****Plaschke: This is a big rookie\nmistake for D'Angelo Russell****Pregnant woman's death spurs a safety debate\nabout China's street fences****Apple wants the FBI to reveal how it hacked the\nSan Bernardino killer's iPhone**\n\n","title":"With Model 3, it's make or break for Tesla - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Telsa will unveil its long-awaited electric car for the masses tonight: Model 3 https://t.co/QRNnSy6CTx https://t.co/TyMCB26cgA","date":"Thu Mar 31 13:40:10 +0000 2016","favs":84,"id":{"$numberLong":"715534152771174400"},"retweets":100},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1TktKEP"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5c1"},"content":"Donald Trump was merciless Wednesday in his portrayal of how poorly Wisconsin\nhas fared under its Republican governor, Scott Walker.China and Mexico have\nsiphoned jobs away, the state’s fiscal condition has deteriorated amid soaring\ndebt, and immigrants in the country illegally are burdening Wisconsin\ntaxpayers, Trump glumly informed a St. Norbert College audience outside Green\nBay.“Wisconsin’s not doing well,” he said.It was an unlikely approach for\nTrump to take just as Marquette Law School was releasing a poll that found 80%\nof likely voters in Wisconsin’s Republican presidential primary on Tuesday\napprove of Walker’s job performance.“Seems an odd strategy,” Marquette\npollster Charles Franklin said.Trump’s unconventional effort, including some\nwell-worn Democratic attack lines on Walker, underscored the uphill battle he\nfaces to win Wisconsin in his drive to get the 1,237 delegates he needs to\ncapture the Republican presidential nomination without a brutal fight in July\nat the party’s national convention in Cleveland.**Election 2016 | Live\ncoverage on Trail Guide | Track the delegate race | Sign up for the newsletter\n**Arrayed against him here is the formidable Republican machine that Walker\nused to win two terms as governor and to beat back a 2012 recall attempt by\norganized labor after he enacted measures that curbed unions’ collective\nbargaining powers in Wisconsin.This week, Walker endorsed Trump’s chief rival,\nTexas Sen. Ted Cruz, hence Trump’s renewal of the scathing attacks he first\nunleashed when the Wisconsin governor was also competing for the GOP\npresidential nomination last year.“I wouldn’t do this, except that he endorsed\nthis guy Cruz, and Cruz would be a terrible president,” Trump told the crowd\nin a theater at St. Norbert College.For good measure, Trump hurled a few\npersonal insults Walker’s way, poking fun at his motorcycle jackets and rides\non a Harley-Davidson.“The bikers love Trump,” he said. “I’m not a huge biker,\nI have to be honest with you, OK? I always liked the limo better.”Trump\nrecalled Walker visiting him at his Manhattan office and giving him a plaque\nto show gratitude for giving him at least $50,000 in campaign\ncontributions.“We’re trying to find it; it’s on the bottom of a pile of\nplaques,” he said dismissively.The Marquette survey found Cruz winning the\nsupport of 40% of likely Wisconsin GOP primary voters, followed by Trump at\n30%, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich at 21%. Trump’s weakest region was the\nMilwaukee area; the city’s suburbs are Walker’s biggest stronghold.When Walker\nannounced his Cruz endorsement in an interview with influential conservative\nradio host Charlie Sykes this week, he declined to talk about Trump. But the\nmessage was clear simply by Walker’s choice of announcement venue: Sykes has\nused his platform to criticize Trump, most notably during an interview with\nthe New York real estate mogul on Monday during which it became clear Trump\nwas unaware that Sykes was a part of the efforts to keep the nomination from\nhis grasp.Walker representatives did not respond to requests for comment.Cruz\nhas run as a conservative purist willing to take on his party’s establishment,\nan image Trump has sought to shatter by citing Walker’s support of the Texas\nsenator.Cruz has also cast himself as a more consistent conservative on social\nissues. Our Principles PAC, an anti-Trump group funded by major GOP donors, is\nechoing that pitch in television and radio advertising in Wisconsin that casts\nTrump as liberal on abortion, guns and other issues.In that context, Trump\ntried to reassure conservatives during an MSNBC interview Wednesday that he\nwas “pro-life.” Asked by anchor Chris Matthews how he would ban abortion,\nTrump said he would “go back to a position like they had where people will\nperhaps go to illegal places.”He went on to say “there has to be some form of\npunishment” for women who would have abortions under such a ban. But after an\nuproar from all sides -- not only abortion rights advocates but also\nantiabortion groups, as well as Kasich and Cruz -- Trump, who used to describe\nhimself as pro-choice, -- backtracked. In a statement, he said only doctors\nand others who perform abortions should be held legally responsible, not women\nwho undergo the procedure.Further complicating Trump’s campaigning in\nWisconsin is the battery charge that Florida police filed Tuesday against his\ncampaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. He’s accused of grabbing a reporter’s arm\nand bruising her as she tried to interview Trump after a March 8 news\nconference at one of his golf resorts.Lewandowski had denied touching the\nreporter, Michelle Fields, but video released by Jupiter, Fla., police shows\nhim yanking her away from Trump. He is contesting the battery charge.At each\nof his Wisconsin campaign stops, Trump has defended Lewandowski and touted his\nongoing support of his campaign manager as a sign of his own loyalty. While\nrivals suggested they would have fired Lewandowski, Trump has instead attacked\nthe credibility of Fields. At St. Norbert, he asked the crowd, “Did anybody\nthink it was horrible thing, what happened?”“No,” several people called out.“I\ndon’t get it,” Trump said. “We have people whose heads are being chopped off\nbecause they’re Christian, and for other reasons, in Syria … and then you have\nTed Cruz [saying], ‘He should be fired.’ I say, ‘Why?’ I don’t do that. I’m\nloyal. He did a good job.”**Twitter: @finneganLAT****ALSO:****What do you\nthink of Donald Trump?****Trump stands by campaign manager charged with\nbattery against reporter****Sanders talks more like a New Yorker, but\nDemocrats there consider Clinton one of them**\n\n","title":"Donald Trump seizes on an old target in Wisconsin: Scott Walker - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Donald Trump seizes on an old target in Wisconsin: Scott Walker https://t.co/NNbdJDdaOw https://t.co/XLLGgHmDyp","date":"Thu Mar 31 13:25:07 +0000 2016","favs":26,"id":{"$numberLong":"715530365989949441"},"retweets":29},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1PHtVmH"}

P.\nChakraborty said. But more people were still feared trapped. It was not clear\nhow many are missing.Smashed yellow taxis, a crushed truck, destroyed\nrickshaws and the bloody legs of trapped people jutted from the fallen girders\nand concrete. Building and other construction collapses are common in India,\nwhere regulations are poorly enforced and companies often use substandard\nmaterials.The partially constructed overpass spanned nearly the width of the\nstreet and was designed to ease traffic through the densely crowded Bara\nBazaar neighborhood in the capital of the east Indian state of West Bengal.\nThe steel girders had already been fixed, and on Thursday the concrete was\npoured into the framework.Within hours, as the concrete was drying, about 300\nfeet of the overpass fell, while other sections remained standing.“I heard an\nexplosion, a solid one,” said resident Rabindra Kumar Gupta, who had been home\neating lunch when the overpass crashed down around 12:30 p.m. Thursday. “My\napartment shook. The whole building shook. When I looked outside, there was a\nlot of smoke.”Another resident, Yogesh Sharma, described a “huge crashing\nsound” when the overpass came down as he was been sitting at a roadside tea\nstand with friends.“I left my cup of tea and ran,” said Sharma. “I was crying\nat the spot.”Crowds waited anxiously near the rescue area to see if neighbors\nand friends had survived. The intersection had been a place where street\nvendors and service workers regularly plied their trades.“There used to be a\ntailor who sat here on this corner. We wonder about him. A cigarettes and\ntobacco vendor — we knew everyone who used to stay around this crossing,”\nresident Pankaj Jhunjhunwala said. “Until this rubbish is removed, we can't\nsay for sure where they are or how this happened.”Police said 39 of the more\nthan 80 people taken to hospitals were still being treated Friday morning. At\nleast 23 people were killed.With army troops and personnel from the National\nDisaster Response Force joining the effort, police said they expected the\nrescue and cleanup to be completed Friday.Workers in yellow hard-hats operated\nhuge cranes, bulldozers and other equipment through the night to clear the\nrubble and pry apart the concrete slabs. They also used cutting torches to\nbreak up metal beams.The operation was a “very, very challenging task,” said\nO.P. Singh, chief of the disaster response force. Rescuers also used dogs and\nspecial cameras to find people who were trapped, he said.“The area was very,\nvery crowded. Motorized rickshaws, taxis, there was a lot of traffic,” one\nwitness told NDTV television.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was in\nWashington at the time of the collapse, called Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee,\nthe top elected official of West Bengal state, to express grief at the tragedy\nand pledge federal support.He said he was “shocked and saddened,” according to\na message on his Twitter account. “My thoughts are with the families of those\nwho lost their lives in Kolkata. May the injured recover at the\nearliest.”Banerjee, whose has been campaigning for re-election this month,\ntold reporters that a private builder had missed several deadlines for\ncompleting the construction.The contract for the overpass was signed in 2007\nand it was expected to be completed in two years. Banerjee accused the\nprevious Communist government in West Bengal of not adhering to building\nregulations.“We completed nearly 70 percent of the construction work without\nany mishap,” said K.P Rao, a top official of IVRCL Infrastructure company,\nwhich was building the overpass. “We have to go into the details to find out\nwhether the collapse was due to any technical or quality issue.”Police have\nsealed the Kolkata office of the Hyderabad-based construction firm involved in\nbuilding the overpass. It is also investigating the firm's officials for\nalleged culpable homicide, punishable with life imprisonment, and criminal\nbreach of trust, which carries a prison sentence of up to seven years\n\n","title":"Rescuers search debris after Indian overpass collapse; 23 dead, 67 pulled out alive - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"15 people killed and many trapped in India after overpass collapses while under construction https://t.co/EuUkOGLuk4","date":"Thu Mar 31 13:15:29 +0000 2016","favs":15,"id":{"$numberLong":"715527940818210816"},"retweets":16},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1TkPekS"}

Now Apple is the one that needs the FBI's assistance.The FBI announced\nMonday that it managed to unlock an iPhone 5c belonging to one of the San\nBernardino shooters without the help of Apple. And the agency has shown\nno...The tension will manifest in \"much more litigation to understand the\ntechniques used to capture individuals,\" said Michael Zweiback, an attorney at\nAlston \u0026amp; Bird and former chief of the Justice Department's cybercrimes\nsection.The issue will not go away as the FBI's growing interest in probing\nthe Internet for criminal activity will require using \"techniques that are\nmore proactive — that are recognized exploits — to get access to information,\"\nZweiback said.In the Washington case, federal agents briefly seized control of\nPlaypen, a secretive online forum, accessible through Tor, where more than\n214,000 members traded what authorities describe as sexually explicit photos\nand videos, including of children. The FBI learned the Internet protocol\naddresses of Playpen visitors by using a software bug linked to Tor to defeat\nthe browser's security measures.Public defenders for Michaud, who is charged\nwith possession of child pornography, say they can't fully vet the legality of\nthe FBI's investigation without knowing how the agency hacked Tor. While the\ngovernment has turned over details about the software that identified his\naddress, it hasn't shared information about how that tracking tool was\nintroduced.Prosecutors and experts say what matters is that the hack didn't\ntamper with Michaud's data.\"Getting through the lock doesn't matter, as long\nas the information on the other side of the door isn't affected,\" Zweiback\nsaid, comparing digital searches with physical ones.Colin Fieman, an attorney\nfor Michaud, told a judge in his case last month that the government's\nobjections to revealing the vulnerability were \"puzzling.\" The information\nwasn't classified or confidential, he said, according to a court\ntranscript.Law enforcement generally seeks to protect its hacking methods as\nlong as possible because the techniques' usefulness shrinks when the public or\nmanufacturers are aware, Zweiback said.Fieman said only his technological\nexpert would examine the hacking tool.\"We are not looking to circulate this\nstuff,\" he told the court. \"We just need to look at it.\"**Join the\nconversation on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Last month, U.S. District Judge Robert\nBryan ruled in Fieman and Michaud's favor. But prosecutors this week asked\nBryan to reconsider, saying that the additional information wouldn't address\nthe defense's concerns. Justice and FBI officials didn't have immediate\ncomment.Fieman in an email Wednesday said he disagreed with the government's\nassertion that law enforcement privilege \"should trump a defendant's\nconstitutional rights to an effective defense and fair trial.\"Though his team\nmay eventually gain access to details of the FBI method, Tor has little\nrecourse. Suing the government to get the same information is unlikely to end\nwell, legal experts said.Kate Krauss, director of communications and public\npolicy for the Cambridge, Mass.-based nonprofit that develops and operates the\nbrowser, said her colleagues suspect that the issue exploited by the FBI has\nbeen fixed, but they want to confirm that.The FBI has agreed to help\nprosecutors gain access to an iPhone 6 and an iPod that might hold evidence in\nan Arkansas murder trial, just days after the agency managed to hack an iPhone\nlinked to the San Bernardino terror attacks, a local prosecutor said\nWednesday.Cody Hiland, prosecuting attorney...The FBI has agreed to help\nprosecutors gain access to an iPhone 6 and an iPod that might hold evidence in\nan Arkansas murder trial, just days after the agency managed to hack an iPhone\nlinked to the San Bernardino terror attacks, a local prosecutor said\nWednesday.Cody Hiland, prosecuting attorney...\"We're watching with interest,\"\nKrauss said over a voice call on the encrypted chat app Signal. \"We're the\ngold standard for online anonymity software, and we're committed to keeping\nthe security stronger.\"It's a desire shared by Apple too. Attorneys for the\nCupertino, Calif., company say they plan to insist that the government explain\nhow, with the help of an undisclosed outside group, investigators bypassed an\niPhone 5c's security — the same device authorities had maintained couldn't be\nopened without Apple's assistance.Krauss said Tor, just like the tech industry\nat large, prefers that people who find vulnerabilities in products privately\nreport them so they can be fixed before they are turned against users. But law\nenforcement and counter-terrorism agencies maintain a narrow set of bugs are\nbetter left untouched for investigative purposes.Apple and Tor may never\nconfirm the FBI's tactics. But the publicity around the two incidents could\nlead judges overseeing similar cases to ask more questions, said Robert\nCattanach, a former Justice Department attorney who specializes in\ncybersecurity for the law firm Dorsey \u0026amp; Whitney.\"You have skeptical judges\nand criminal defense lawyers using San Bernardino to exploit ways to get under\nthe FBI's skin if nothing else,\" Cattanach said. \"Even the most neutral\nfederal judge is going to give pause when the FBI makes\nrepresentations.\"Michael Vatis, a former official with the Justice Department\nand FBI, now a partner at Steptoe \u0026amp; Johnson, said any time that the FBI\nuses a technical vulnerability in a case, details of it are kept under seal.\nBut Cattanach said there were instances, though rare, when the FBI revoked\ncases because it was asked to share hacking methods, even just to defendants\nand their attorneys. He declined to provide details.Attorneys said the\nquestion of when authorities must bare all is set to explode in significance.\nThe FBI and police will need to rely increasingly on taking advantage of\ntechnical flaws to ferret out cybercriminals as tech companies introduce\nstronger security protections.\"There's been some frustration at the FBI that\nthey're operating with one hand tied behind their back,\" Cattanach said.\n\"They've since realized that if you're going to beat the bad guys at their own\ngame, you've got to play the game.\"But in improving capabilities, the FBI has\nturned into yet another security research group that tech firms want to learn\nfrom.\"There is a great deal of irony ... that the FBI is being asked to reveal\ntheir work now\" in the Michaud case, Vatis\nsaid._paresh.dave@latimes.com__david.pierson@latimes.com_**ALSO****With Model\n3, it's make or break for Tesla****Amazon to open a new fulfillment center in\nSan Bernardino****L.A. is losing out on $41 million in taxes from AirBnB,\nstudy says**\n\n","title":"In FBI hacks, tech firms get left in the dark as feds resist call to divulge secrets - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"In FBI hacks, tech firms get left in the dark as feds resist call to divulge secrets  https://t.co/HHF65SNqMV https://t.co/0DXoJCQeGp","date":"Thu Mar 31 12:52:29 +0000 2016","favs":11,"id":{"$numberLong":"715522151290380288"},"retweets":30},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1PHtRn2"}

After finding out she was pregnant following an impromptu booty call with\nthe youngest Lyon, and observing how Rhonda's baby was used to get Andre back\nin father Lyon's good graces, we saw a devious plot form in Anika's\neyes._While Rhonda waits for the police to take her to the hospital, the final\nvote by Hakeem has been cast to remove Lucious as CEO — prompted by Camilla\n(Naomi Campbell) whose wife, Mimi (Marisa Tomei), gifted her the controlling\nstake of Empire. Hakeem's hope is that he will become the new CEO, but that\nwon't happen if Lucious has anything to do with it. By the time Hakeem gets\nhome, Cookie is waiting for him in his living room, broom in hand. After\nimploring him to take back his betraying vote, she breaks the broom over his\nback. She then picks up her purse to continue the beating. And like the child\nhe is, Hakeem curls into a fetal position until it ends. The family coalesces\nat the hospital once they get the news of Rhonda's mishap — Hakeem comes too,\nbut isn't welcomed for obvious reasons. Though Rhonda prayed to God mid-pain\nto save the baby instead of her, the heir to the Lyon throne doesn't make it.\nThis causes Rhonda to question the existence of God, and in the face of her\nsuper-Christian husband, Andre. Meanwhile, Lucious is plotting to take back\nthe Empire. While loading a gun in his closet, he tells Cookie that if Hakeem\nbecomes CEO, \"he won't make it,\" meaning Lucious will kill his own son. But\nnobody messes with Cookie's boys. Mother Lyon asks Lucious to hold off on any\naction for 48 hours while she figures out a way to get back into Empire and\nbegin a take-back — because though the label Lyon Dynasty is her (and\nHakeem's) company, Empire is their legacy. On Camilla's first day in charge,\nshe reveals to Hakeem that she would like him to be CEO, but he's got to fight\nfor it against all the other board members who are interested. Oh, and he has\nto break up with Laura, the lead singer of his Latin Destiny's Child knockoff\nmenage a trois. But Hakeem thinks he's in love.Cookie then launches her plan.\nShe wants Empire to acquire Lyon Dynasty. Camilla emphatically declines as\nHakeem decides to break up with Laura. Luckily, or not so luckily, Lucious\ndidn't wait. He calls a meeting of his goons at Leviticus, the club he owns.\nThe plan is to intimidate all of the candidates for the Empire CEO role by any\nmeans necessary, but \"nothing illegal, like murder\" — though we know Lucious,\nhimself, is not above that either. The group carries out their orders: A\nwoman's cat is lynched, a man's car is blown up and another one's arm is\nbroken and eye blackened.At the same time Empire is going through said\nchanges, Jamal and Lucious are battling for the American Sound Award for Song\nof the Year._Reminder: Jamal has received a number of nominations. But the\nSong of the Year one is important because it's a nomination that Lucious never\ngot — until this year, for \"Boom Boom Boom Boom.\" This happenstance continues\na feud between Lucious and Jameson, Jamal's manager who hates Lucious'\nhomophobic ways._As Jameson continues his efforts to make Jamal the biggest\nLyon to date, he finds himself conflicted following Jamal's booty call with\nSkye (Alicia Keys). Jameson believes this dip in the lady pond conflicts with\nJamal's brand as the gay crooner. Jamal, however, affirms his gayness, or\nrather his decision to sleep with whomever he wants, when he wants.Cookie\nlends her voice to the situation, landing on Jameson's side that Jamal's gay\nidentity could be the thing that allows him to edge out Lucious for the big\naward. She tells him it's time to \"get your gay back.\"But Jamal, again, isn't\nhaving it. After all, he says, \"sexuality is fluid.\"Back at Empire, Cookie\ntakes another stab at getting on the inside. This time, Jamal and Andre are at\nher side. Here's the situation: Jamal's album is technically a joint venture\nbetween Empire and Lyon Dynasty. Because there were no specifics on which\nlabel would distribute, Jamal wants to give the duty to Lyon Dynasty, but\nbecause he's Empire's biggest act, Empire can't let that happen. And the\nproposition, once more: Empire acquires Lyon Dynasty, but Cookie retains full\nautonomy of the label. Additionally, mother Lyon becomes Empire's head of\nA\u0026amp;R.Though Camilla warns Empire CEO Hakeem against the deal, it's one he\nreally can't refuse. And finally, the family is back together. Sort of.\n**Other moments of note:****Get your life!

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5c7"},"content":"The cinder block homes lining the hillsides on the edge of this metropolis are\nconnected to the municipal network of water pipes.But the water doesn't arrive\nthat way. It comes on tanker trucks.Black exhaust and the groans of diesel\nengines fill the air as an aging fleet makes its deliveries.Marisol Reyes\nJimenez waited patiently as a truck pulled up. The driver unrolled a hose and\nfilled her cistern with enough water to cook meals, wash dishes, do laundry\nand take showers, at least for the next few days.Water is one of those things\nyou don't miss until it's not there, and here in Iztapalapa, one of the\npoorest sections of Mexico City, it's often not. \"You have to care for it,\"\nsaid Jimenez, a 46-year-old homemaker.In a city built on a lake bed where it\nrains all summer, the problem isn't exactly a shortage of water. Rather the\ninfrastructure of pipes is so riddled with cracks that a third of the water\nthe city puts into the system leaks into the ground. It's gone before it ever\nhas a chance to get here.\"Without the leaks, we would have enough,\" said Ramon\nAguirre, the director of Mexico City's water system.Making matters worse, the\ncity's population is growing fastest in the places where the water supply is\nthe most unreliable. Home to about 2 million people, Iztapalapa is a common\ndestination for people relocating in search of work.Wealthier areas of the\ncity, in contrast, usually have enough water to fill their swimming pools,\nwash their SUVs and water their golf courses.The disparity is not as simple as\nthe poor being neglected. Instead, its roots go back centuries. When the\nAztecs were deciding where to begin constructing their empire in 1325, they\nchose the islands of Lake Texcoco.During the colonial period, a debate ensued\nover what to do with the water surrounding the city. It was often stagnant,\ntriggering fears that it could be a breeding ground for disease. At the same\ntime, dry land was needed for farming, grazing and home building.The Spaniards\ndecided to drain the lake.As the water level fell and the population grew,\nMexico City radiated outward onto the lake bed.The most desirable places to\nlive had the cleanest and most accessible drinking water and were the least\nprone to flooding. At the end of the 19th century, the population was\nconcentrated in areas that today include the posh neighborhoods of west Mexico\nCity.Starting in the 1920s, crowding drove tenement dwellers farther and\nfarther from the center as they sought land and homes of their own, said\nMatthew Vitz, a historian at UC San Diego who has studied the city's\ncomplicated relationship with water.Efforts to extend the water infrastructure\nfailed to keep pace with the city's expansion.In 2012, Mexico modified its\nconstitution to guarantee every citizen the right to \"safe, acceptable and\naffordable water.\"\"But whether that transfers into the political will to get\nit done is another question,\" Vitz said.Today, nearly half of Mexico City's\nwater comes from aquifers, which are often contaminated and whose depletion is\ncausing the city to sink. An additional 40% comes from a reservoir and river\nto the west. Springs to the south provide the rest.In the more affluent\nneighborhoods, most residents pump their water up to their roofs into large\ncisterns that flow into their homes and apartments.The tanks offer insurance\nagainst interruptions in the city water supply. In January, when the city cut\noff water to millions of residents for five days to make repairs on the\nreservoir system, those with cisterns barely noticed. In poorer areas, many\nresidents can't afford them.About a million residents — more than a tenth of\nthe city's population — rely on the trucks for their water. The process is\nhorribly inefficient. The trucks guzzle diesel and some are so old they can\nhold only enough water to supply two houses on each trip, stretching the\ndelivery schedule well into the night.\"One day you bathe, the next day you\ndon't. One day you can wash the dishes, the next day you can't,\" said one\nresident, Linda Hernandez, explaining her struggle for water.Hernandez works\nas a volunteer coordinating water deliveries in her Iztapalapa neighborhood.\nSchools and medical facilities take priority over homes, where residents line\ntheir courtyards with buckets, pots and barrels that can be filled when the\ntrucks arrive.The water is usually not potable — residents throughout the city\nbuy bottled water for drinking — but without it, even basic sanitation is\nimpossible. Hernandez said she became a water activist for her neighborhood\nbecause there was not enough water to regularly clean the bathrooms at her\ndaughter's elementary school.Her daughter and other children were picking up\ninfections, she said.There is no simple solution to the city's water crisis.In\nmany neighborhoods with severe shortages, residents recycle much the water\nthat gets trucked in. Bathwater is used to flush toilets or wash the patio.\nNeighbors share any surplus, knowing that soon they may be the ones in\nneed.Another option is rainwater, which is abundant about half the year but at\nthe moment is mostly funneled into the city's sewer system, which sends the\ncity's waste to agricultural areas in the neighboring state of Hidalgo.A\ncompany called Isla Urbana plans to build 10,000 catchment systems over the\nnext three years for $500 to $800 per household. Each will be capable of\ncollecting more than 10,500 gallons a year — enough to dramatically improve\nquality of life even if it doesn't eliminate the need for trucks.Aguirre, the\nchief of the city's water system, called rainwater collection a \"provisional\nmeasure\" at best.As a longer-term solution, he said, the city plans to start\nconstruction this year of 22 water recycling plants, which will clean sewage\nand send the water back to homes, an increasingly common practice in cities\naround the world. The project is part of a plan to provide water to all\nresidents by 2018.The city also aims to repair all of its cracked pipes over\nthe next seven years.But as leaks are patched, new ones are likely to spring\nopen. And if the population keeps growing, it will require even more water to\nsustain itself._Tillman is a special correspondent.

There\nwas some speculation if Young would hold a grudge, apparently not. Young isn't\nan angry/confrontational person. In that sense only, Russell might have caught\na break.Earlier in the day, Lakers Coach Byron Scott grew tired after taking a\nhandful of questions from reporters about Russell and threatened to end the\ninterview unless questions were basketball-related.“It’s an internal problem,\nwe’ll handle it from in-house,” he said before his voice rose sharply. “If you\nwant to ask me about the Miami game that we’re playing tonight, let’s talk\nabout Miami and basketball.

Young did not know he was being\nfilmed.“D’Angelo is sometimes 20 going on 14,” said a person familiar with the\nsituation who declined to speak publicly. “They’ve all been trying to prank\neach other this season. This was a stupid prank.”Young and Lakers teammate\nJordan Clarkson made headlines last week when they were accused of harassing a\nwoman and her 68-year-old mother while driving in Hollywood.An internal Lakers\ninvestigation was inconclusive, saying there were “different interpretations\nof what happened.”Russell, the No. 2 overall pick in last year’s draft, had an\nunremarkable rookie season until an eight-game burst that started at the end\nof last month. He averaged 23.3 points over that span but faded the last two\nweeks and scored only five points on two-for-11 shooting against Utah.Just the\nsame, Scott recently complimented Russell for improving his attitude.“He works\nharder in practice now,” Scott said earlier this month. “I think the light for\nhim has kind of come on. Before we start practice, he’s a little bit of a\nclown at times, he has his fun, which is great.“When he starts practice, he’s\nserious. He works. As long as he can separate the two, I’m good with it.”There\nare eight games left in the Lakers’ season, including Wednesday’s. They are on\npace to finish with the worst winning percentage in their 68-year\nhistory.**Twitter: @Mike_Bresnahan****MORE LAKERS NEWS****Lakers' Kobe Bryant\nis not experiencing technical difficulties****Face of the Lakers Kobe Bryant\nis leaving fate of the franchise up in the air****Former Lakers and Clippers\nCoach Mike Dunleavy takes first collegiate coaching job at Tulane**\n\n","title":"D'Angelo Russell to reporters: 'Nothing to talk about' - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"D'Angelo Russell has apologized to Nick Young for that off-the-court incident https://t.co/gw4QyiHmFc https://t.co/MBb272bjAk","date":"Thu Mar 31 10:35:11 +0000 2016","favs":16,"id":{"$numberLong":"715487599083655174"},"retweets":18},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1M11u8z"}

It marks the third time since 2010 that a person\nhas died after getting wedged between their rails.Videos online show the young\nwoman with her head wedged in a chest-high fence on a street in Yulin, a city\nin northern China’s Shaanxi province.

The toxic substances department\nformally requested census tract-level data in September.The department said it\nis reviewing the health department's analysis and would make the findings\npublic once its examination is complete.Lead, which spewed from the plant for\ndecades, is a powerful poison. The toxic metal is most dangerous to young\nchildren, putting them at risk of lifelong developmental and behavioral\nproblems.Assemblyman Miguel Santiago (D-Los Angeles) said he was encouraged by\nthe move to use blood testing data, \"but I still have concerns and questions\nregarding how long it took to share the information and why there were\nbarriers in the first place.\"\"We're still investigating to ensure that this\nnever happens again, either in my community or any other community, when we're\nfacing a health crisis like this,\" Santiago said.Exide agreed to close the\nplant a year ago under a deal with federal prosecutors, which followed a\ncriminal investigation and community outrage toward state regulators for\nallowing the facility to operate for decades without a full permit.The Times\nrequested the blood lead analysis, which the state health department had\npledged to make public once it was complete, but was not provided a copy.Lee,\nthe Department of Toxic Substances Control director, told lawmakers Wednesday\nthe health department analysis has taken time because \"it's not simply a\nmatter of pushing a button on a computer.\" To visualize the blood lead data in\na useful way, health officials had to map more than 12,000 data points, she\nsaid.The Times previously obtained and analyzed blood test records from the\nLos Angeles County Department of Public Health and found that 547 people under\nage 21 living in census tracts in the Exide cleanup area had elevated levels\nof lead in their blood from 2010 to 2014.Gladys Limón, an attorney with\nCommunities for a Better Environment, said the state's delay is part of a\nregulatory failure \"to provide the necessary attention and resources to this\npublic health crisis and continues to endanger the lives of tens of thousands\nof residents of color\" in the overwhelmingly Latino neighborhoods near the\nplant.Limón called on lawmakers to launch \"independent investigations and\nhearings like those undertaken regarding the Flint lead health crisis.

All they talk about is that film and the fox,\" said Li. \"I told him many\ntimes our two-bedroom apartment is too small for a pet, but he wouldn't\nlisten.\"So Li went online to research her options. She quickly ruled out red\nfoxes after learning they get quite big. But then she saw postings about\nfennec foxes, the pint-sized species of Nick's short-tempered, big-eared\nsidekick, Finnick. All it took was a few clicks to find dealers offering to\nsell the nocturnal African animals, with prices starting around $3,075, even\nthough Chinese law requires buyers of the protected species to have permits\nnormally given only to institutions like zoos.\"Fennec foxes are very tiny,\nsmaller than a normal cat,\" she said. \"But I also learned it is sort of\nillegal. I'm not buying it. I told [my son] we are not allowed, and he is\nsulking.\"While Li erred on the side of caution — and the law — other Chinese\nparents are considering taking the plunge. Wild animal dealers in multiple\nChinese cities have reported a rush in interest in fennec foxes since\n\"Zootopia\" hit Chinese theaters in early March.

Zhang said fennec foxes were introduced as pets\nin China only about a decade ago.Fennec foxes, which are found in Sudan and\nother parts of northern Africa, are listed in Appendix 2 of the U.N.\nConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and\nFlora, or CITES. That means they're not necessarily threatened with\nextinction, but that \"trade must be controlled in order to avoid utilization\nincompatible with their survival.\"China recognizes CITES and classifies fennec\nfoxes as a \"Class 2\" protected species, meaning institutions or individuals\nmust apply for certificates from provincial governments to buy, raise or sell\nthem.But multiple sellers contacted by the Los Angeles Times in China\nexpressed a willingness to skirt the rules.\"We normally sell them to zoos, but\nhave received quite a few phone calls after the screening of 'Zootopia,'\" said\nan employee of a wild animal import-export company in Liaoning province whose\nphone number was posted on an online fox forum. \"One family from Jiangsu\nprovince bought a fennec fox from us not long ago,\" said the employee, who\ngave only his surname, Yuan. \"Then I received three other parents' calls, all\nfrom southern China, demanding the foxes. But we didn't have young foxes, so\nthey have paid some money to order newborn, baby foxes.\"Not a week goes by, it\nseems lately, without some shocking box-office statistic from China: A mermaid\nmovie has raked in more than $500 million in four weeks.

He said he acquired the male-\nfemale pair in December from a friend who works for an animal importing\ncompany.\"When they are in good mood, they like to jump onto my wife's shoulder\nwhen she is reading, and play with her,\" said the man, who would also give\nonly his surname, Yao. \"But they are very active at night and jump all over\nthe bedroom, which is very noisy.\"Yao said he changed his mind about raising\nthem because he and his wife are expecting a baby. He's been listing them for\nsale on Alibaba's EBay-like sales site Taobao, though platform administrators\nhave repeatedly deleted his ads. \"I used to hear from one customer on Taobao\nevery two to three days. But starting two weeks ago, I've heard from two to\nthree per day.\"CITES trade data reviewed by Humane Society International shows\nthat Sudan is the world's biggest exporter of live fennec foxes for both\ncommercial and zoo purposes. China ostensibly stopped importing fennec foxes\nfor commercial purposes in 2005, but the country has been the largest importer\nfor zoo purposes in the last decade, bringing in 140 in 2014, up from 14 in\n2011. (The United Arab Emirates is the biggest importer of fennec foxes for\ncommercial purposes, taking in 733 between 2005 and 2014.)Animal welfare\ngroups say they haven't noticed an uptick in interest in fennec foxes outside\nof China.\"We haven't seen the same kind of spike in the U.S. that we saw after\n'101 Dalmatians' and the 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,' when irresponsible\nmoviegoers flooded rescue groups with dogs and reptiles after the novelty of\ntheir new animal companions wore off,\" said Brittany Peet, deputy director of\ncaptive animal law enforcement for People for the Ethical Treatment of\nAnimals.Disney's \"Zootopia\" has some very real and topical messages about race\nand prejudice delivered in the form of a cuddly cartoon caper.

One former breeder in\nOklahoma said she had recently retired from the business after 15 years\nbecause she felt so few buyers were equipped to handle the demands of raising\na fox.\"A lot of us have gotten out of the business because we don't believe\nthe exotic animals belong to most people,\" said Terrie Klontz, who sold\nbetween 40 and 50 fennecs annually. \"I would get a lot of phone calls like,\n'Oh, my God, I went to the zoo, I want one because they're so cute!' A lot of\npeople want a companion animal, but these foxes are very aloof, nocturnal —\nthey're not going to sit on the couch with you. They're not going to sleep\nwith you. They don't potty train, so they pee and poop anywhere they want.\nThey destroy your carpet. I had one just digging at the Sheetrock in my wall\nbecause they're burrowers by nature.\"Thomas said filmmakers ought to \"be aware\nof potential unintended consequences of portraying animal subjects\" and\nconsider including \"appropriate messaging alerting viewers as to why their\nanimal subjects should not be considered as potential pets.\"It should have\nbeen fun — sitting in the Splash Zone at SeaWorld's Shamu stadium with her two\nsons, watching killer whales perform impressive tricks.

The kid doesn't think.That Russell secretly\ntaped pillow talk with Nick Young, then somehow allowed that tape to be\nreleased, confirms the Lakers' worst fears as they stumble toward the world\nbeyond Kobe Bryant.Russell is too immature to lead them there.His teammates no\nlonger trust him, his bosses appear fed up with him, and potential free agents\nsurely will be wary of playing with him.Lakers Nick Young and D'Angelo Russell\nspeak with the media before tipoff against Miami.Lakers Nick Young and\nD'Angelo Russell speak with the media before tipoff against Miami.Making it\nunanimous, when he was introduced to the fiercely loyal Lakers fans at Staples\nCenter before the game against the Miami Heat on Wednesday night, he was\nroundly booed. In fact, every time he touched the ball early in the game, he\nwas booed.Russell was supposed to represent the Lakers' next generation, but\ninstead has become their next problem. He was supposed to be the new Magic\nJohnson, but so far has behaved like a retread of Andrew Bynum. He has played\ndecently in spurts, even brilliantly on occasion, but he has done so while\nacting like an overgrown child.You can't pass Russell the torch, because he\nwill set something on fire, which is pretty much what happened with this video\nthat recently appeared on a celebrity gossip site.The tape was less than a\nminute, but the damage will last indefinitely. It was not only an invasion of\nprivacy for Young, who didn't know he was being taped while talking about\nbeing with women other than his fiancee, rapper Iggy Azalea. It was also a\nviolation of the trust of the entire locker room, whose foundations are built\non such faith.\"I feel as sick as possible,\" Russell said before Wednesday's\ngame. \"I wish I could make things better right away, but I can't.\"Lakers fans\nwho once bet the future on Russell should feel just as ill.Lakers Coach Byron\nScott talks to the media before tipoff against Miami. Lakers Coach Byron Scott\ntalks to the media before tipoff against Miami. He was drafted second overall\nlast year in the hopes that he would spend this season being a student and a\nsponge. Instead, he has been 20 going on 12.When asked about Russell's\nprogress Wednesday, a solemn Coach Byron Scott said, \"Up until this point,\nit's getting better and better. Obviously, this is going to knock it back a\nstep or two.\"When asked if this would hurt the already tenuous trust issues in\nthe Lakers' locker room, Scott said, \"Absolutely. Absolutely … yeah,\nabsolutely.\"At the urging of Lakers officials, Russell did the smart thing by\nhaving a news conference and owning up to his mistake.\"It wasn't a prank, it\nwasn't something for everybody else to see, it was for my eyes, his eyes\nonly,\" Russell said, later adding, \"Like I said, I'm sick. Only time can make\nthis really go away.\"But then he did another dumb thing by acting as if he had\nno idea how the tape got released.\"Honestly, no, this just got in the wrong\nhands,\" he said. \"I have no clue how that got out. If I did, I would\ndefinitely tell you guys.\"Seriously? A kid who is digitally savvy enough to\nsecretly videotape a conversation has no idea how that tape went public?\nNobody really thinks Russell intended for the videotape to wind up on a\nwebsite, but it seems clear that, as in his basketball game, he treated his\npersonal life carelessly enough to allow it to happen.Which brings up a bigger\nquestion — why videotape anything with an unaware subject in the first\nplace?\"We play around and we joke and we laugh and we say things that you\ndon't really repeat, that was just an incident of just playing too much goes\nwrong,\" Russell said. \"I take the full blame for that, recording the video.\nBut leaking the video wasn't me.\"He needs to own up to all of this, not just\npart of it, but that is the Lakers' burden as they begin the long attempt to\nrebuild his value both inside and outside the locker room.It is still too\nearly to say he was a draft bust, but it's certainly fair to say he has been a\nleadership bust.Some folks have compared Russell's betrayal to the time Kobe\nBryant told police of Shaquille O'Neal's indiscretions during the 2003 sexual\nassault investigation of Bryant. It took Bryant a couple of years to live down\na leaguewide reputation for being a snitch before he overcame his past and led\nthe Lakers to two more championships.This is worse. Bryant didn't tape his\ninterrogation and, if there was a tape, it was never released. Russell\nknowingly punked Young and then somehow allowed the rest of the world to punk\nhim too.In making a statement to the media without taking questions Wednesday,\nYoung said, \"Right now I think it's best me and D'Angelo handle the situation\nwe have in a private manner outside the media. We really do need to sit down\nand talk about it.\"Russell can talk, but will anyone listen? Should anyone\nlisten? How long before anyone listens again?The scariest part of all this is\nthat, in seven games, Bryant will be officially retired, and the ball\nbelonging to one of sports' most decorated franchises will be in Russell's\nhands.In another secret videotape to be released shortly after the season,\nLakers officials will be seen grabbing it from\nhim._bill.plaschke@latimes.com_**Twitter: @billplaschke****ALSO****Lakers'\nD'Angelo Russell is contrite over leaked video he shot of Nick\nYoung****D'Angelo Russell has apologized to Nick Young about off-the-court\nincident****Iggy Azalea thanks D'Angelo Russell for secret video of fiance\nNick Young, but she's in the minority**\n\n","title":"Bill Plaschke: This is a big rookie mistake for D'Angelo Russell - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Bill Plaschke: This is a big rookie mistake for D'Angelo Russell https://t.co/rB9SYlaMn0","date":"Thu Mar 31 06:50:06 +0000 2016","favs":22,"id":{"$numberLong":"715430956287586305"},"retweets":18},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1VUzIwN"}

White said he\ncan understand why the University of California decided to boost its revenue\nby admitting more students from out of state.A so-called nonresident student\npays about $25,000 more in UC tuition and fees each year than a student from\nCalifornia. Given the deep cuts to higher education since the 2008 recession,\nthe temptation is clear, White said.But as chancellor of the California State\nUniversity system, White said he can’t rely on out-of-state students to help\nmake ends meet.

But it does increase...Enrollment\nthroughout the system has increased by about 20,000 since then, but it hasn’t\nbeen enough to make room for everyone who wants to attend a Cal State school,\nWhite said. About 30,000 applicants who fulfilled all the admissions\nrequirements last fall got rejection letters anyway.When a qualified UC\napplicant can’t get into the campus of his or her choice, he or she will be\noffered a seat at UC Merced. There is no equivalent deal at CSU, said White,\nwho previously served as chancellor of UC Riverside.For a variety of family\nand financial reasons, Cal State students typically live close to home. So\nalthough a campus like CSU Channel Islands in Camarillo has room for more\nstudents, that’s simply not a practical option for someone who lives in\nNorthridge, he said.As a student at South Pasadena High School, Katherine\nUriarte aced six Advanced Placement classes, got top scores on her ACT, served\nin student government and nailed a summer internship at Caltech.It wasn't\nenough to get into UCLA or UC Berkeley.The daughter of a Mexican immigrant,\nUriarte still...As a student at South Pasadena High School, Katherine Uriarte\naced six Advanced Placement classes, got top scores on her ACT, served in\nstudent government and nailed a summer internship at Caltech.It wasn't enough\nto get into UCLA or UC Berkeley.The daughter of a Mexican immigrant, Uriarte\nstill...It’s a tough situation, White said. For decades, Cal State relied on\nthe state to pay for the vast majority of public higher education costs. Now,\nstate general funds cover about half these costs; tuition and fees cover the\nrest.Tuition has doubled after pre-recession levels, but it has remained flat\nsince 2011 and will remain that way next year as part of a funding agreement\nwith Gov. Jerry Brown.The same financial pressures have prevented\nadministrators from granting Cal State faculty the 5% raise they have been\nseeking for about a year, White said. This year, there’s room in the budget\nfor a 2% raise, with additional increases in the future.An independent\nmediator released a report Monday that sided with the California Faculty Assn.\nand said a 5% raise was warranted. About 26,000 professors, lecturers,\nlibrarians, counselors and coaches will strike next month if a deal isn’t\nreached.White, a former professor of human biodynamics, said he was\nsympathetic to the faculty union’s position and would continue talks to try\nand find a solution. The challenge, he said, is balancing faculty compensation\nagainst the costs of higher enrollment, academic support programs and much-\nneeded maintenance and upgrades to buildings and technology.Ultimately, every\none of Cal State’s top priorities is underfunded, he said. It’s a scenario\nwhere none of the choices is ideal.“What is the least lousy decision to make?”\nWhite said.****Follow @RosannaXia for more education news.********MORE FROM\nEDUCATION******20 high school swimmers rescued off La Jolla****Former USC\nchief Steven Sample is remembered for his deep faith****Michelle Rhee's\nStudentsFirst will merge with education advocacy group 50Can**\n\n","title":"Cal State can't rely on out-of-state students for a revenue boost.

For\nseveral years now he has been making life easier for every journalist who\nfollows the Affordable Care Act by heroically compiling health insurance\nenrollments under the law, explaining developments, debunking myths, and\nhectoring the nearly infinite sources of mis- and disinformation (not\nexcepting, on occasion, the Department of Health and Human Services) into\ngetting things right. His handiwork can be found at ACASignups.net, and he\ntweets at @charles_gaba.Gaba, who describes himself as \"a technophile and all-\npurpose cybergeek,\" does all this as a labor of love. He's an indispensable\nresource. His latest effort, displayed here, tells you why. It's a pie chart\nshowing all the different ways in which Americans get their health insurance.\nGaba explains his sources and methodology here. A few notes: **1\\. Most\nAmericans still get their coverage from traditional sources: **from their\nemployers (153 million, or 47.3%) and government programs such as Medicare and\nMedicaid--the pre-ACA variety, covering mostly children and their parents in\nlow-income households. They account for 79.7% of the population and are\nrepresented by the green and orange wedges. their numbers haven't changed much\nsince the ACA--in fact, the stability of the employer-covered wedge has\nsurprised healthcare planners at HHS and the Congressional Budget Office, who\nexpected lots of migration from employer-covered plans to Obamacare exchanges.\nGaba acknowledges that his employer number is a bit lower than estimates by\nthe Kaiser Family Foundation and the CBO, but attributes that to rounding and\noverlap.**2\\. More than 20 million Americans have gained coverage** directly\nas a result of the ACA, but that's not the whole story. This is the blue\nwedge, and it includes Medicaid expansion (11 million enrollees) and\nsubsidized enrollments on the ACA exchanges. Gaba adds 3 million Medicaid\n\"woodworkers,\" who are people previously eligible for Medicaid who finally\nsigned up as a result of ACA-prompted outreach and publicity. Another 10\nmillion are enrolled in exchange plans but are unsubsidized, or off-exchange\nbut ACA-compliant individual plans, or grandfathered plans that may not comply\nwith the ACA but are still serving previously-enrolled customers.**3\\. Some 29\nmillion Americans (9%) still don't have insurance.** They're in the red wedge.\nThey include 2.9 million in the \"Medicaid gap,\" which is created by state\nlegislatures and governors, invariably Republican, who have refused to expand\nMedicaid in their states despite almost all its funding coming from the\nfederal government. These people are victims of political stupidity.**4\\. The\nACA has impacts on health coverage far beyond direct enrollments in exchange\nplans and Medicaid.** As Gaba notes, many of the law's provisions apply to\nother health plans. These provisions include the ban on exclusions for pre-\nexisting conditions, preventive care without co-pays or deductibles, the\noutlawing of lifetime benefit limits, and other consumer-friendly standards.\nAnd that's not even to mention incentives built into the law aimed at\nmoderating the growth of healthcare costs, bringing costs down, and improving\nphysician and hospital practices.**Keep up to date with Michael Hiltzik.\nFollow @hiltzikm on Twitter, see his Facebook page, or email\nmichael.hiltzik@latimes.com.****Return to Michael Hiltzik's blog.**\n\n","title":"Where America gets its health coverage: everything you wanted to know in one handy chart - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Where America gets its health coverage: everything you wanted to know in one handy chart https://t.co/i1CR9NobSw https://t.co/d3ELxKuzU7","date":"Thu Mar 31 06:05:05 +0000 2016","favs":68,"id":{"$numberLong":"715419625723465728"},"retweets":102},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1q42Ndl"}

Mark Leno (D-San\nFrancisco), the bill’s author, said in an interview he expects the Senate to\nimmediately consider the plan, assuming it passes the Assembly, with an eye\ntoward sending the bill to Gov. Jerry Brown on Thursday. The bill is expected\nto have an easier time in the Senate, and Leno was confident about its\nultimate support in the Assembly.“It looks like we have a more than sufficient\nmajority vote on the Assembly side,” Leno said.The deal, which Brown announced\nMonday, was praised by Democrats on the Assembly Appropriations Committee as a\nway to raise the standard of living for millions of Californians. The bill\npassed by voice vote, meaning no support or opposition was formally tallied.\nProponents of the agreement said it would also include enough safeguards to\nensure that businesses and state government wouldn’t be overwhelmed by the\nwage hike in case of an economic downturn.“This bill will lift people out of\npoverty,” Leno said when presenting his measure Wednesday to the\npanel.Opponents of the bill including the California Chamber of Commerce, the\nCalifornia Restaurant Assn. and GOP Assembly members told the committee\nWednesday that the package was too rushed, didn’t take into account different\neconomic conditions across the state and failed to consider the wage pressures\non large and small businesses. Concerns about the bill’s long-term effects\nalso caused Assemblyman Tom Daly of Anaheim to formally oppose the package,\nthe lone Democrat to do so.Under the plan, the state’s hourly minimum wage\nwould increase 50 cents from its current $10 on Jan. 1, to $11 the following\nyear, and then increase by $1 annually until 2022 — though Brown and his\nsuccessor could delay the increases by a year if the economy falters.\nBusinesses with fewer than 26 employees would get an additional year to\ncomply. Then, the minimum wage would increase annually based on\ninflation.Brown negotiated the package after two labor unions gathered\nsignatures for November ballot measures that would increase the wage on a more\naggressive timetable. The governor touted his plan as a compromise that can be\nadjusted for changing economic conditions. The labor groups have said they\nwould pull their ballot measures if the deal passes.During Wednesday’s\nhearing, there was broad agreement that the package would affect the state’s\neconomy for years to come, but significant differences remained over whether\nthe impact would be good or bad.Economists from UC Berkeley testified that the\nplan would give 5.6 million workers higher pay without resulting in any net\njob losses. GOP lawmakers and business groups argued that the state is still\ntrying to measure the effects of the last minimum wage hike in 2013, and the\nplan could force businesses to lay off workers and replace low-wage jobs with\nmachines.\"The ultimate minimum wage is not something we control,\" said\nAssemblyman Jay Obernolte (R-Big Bear Lake). \"The ultimate minimum wage is\nzero, and that’s what you make if your job no longer exists.\"The divide along\nparty lines was expected. But the opposition from Daly could point to a\npossible hiccup.Daly said he was worried about the automatic cost-of-living\nincreases starting after the wage reaches $15 an hour. “I believe that the\nauthority of raising the minimum wage should remain with the Legislature and\ngovernor,” Daly said during the committee hearing. He declined further comment\nafterward.Daly is the first Democrat to publicly oppose the deal. But his\ncolleagues in a business-aligned group of Democrats have shared similar\nconcerns in recent days about the cost-of-living increases and the effects of\nthe wage hike on nonprofit organizations’ ability to pay their\nemployees.Assuming all Republicans in the Assembly vote against the plan, at\nleast 10 Democrats would have to oppose the bill to defeat it.  Legislators\nspoke to a packed committee room filled primarily with supporters of the plan,\nincluding minimum-wage workers — many wearing shirts with the Service\nEmployees International Union logo — who testified that an increase would help\nthem pay back debts and boost their quality of life.Beyond the impact on low-\nearning workers, an increase to the minimum wage will have ripple effects on\nthe state budget and throughout the economy. The state Department of Finance\nestimated that the wage hike would cost $3.6 billion annually by 2023,\nprimarily due to a pay boost for in-home healthcare workers in the public\nsector.Many other salaries are tied to the minimum wage, which could also\nresult in raises for those employees. Teachers, for instance, need to earn\ndouble the minimum wage or receive overtime pay because of state rules\ngoverning employees who are exempt from overtime.Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez\n(D-San Diego), the chairwoman of the appropriations committee, said the wage\nincrease would address one consequence of a minimum wage that hasn’t kept pace\nwith cost of living: government subsidies for low-wage workers.“We have a\nsituation by which even with a full-time job they’re relying on food stamps\nand public housing and free lunch programs,” Gonzalez said. “We are\nsubsidizing all of these businesses who are not providing enough for people to\nlive on.” **liam.dillon@latimes.com****Follow @dillonliam on Twitter**_Times\nstaff writer Patrick McGreevy contributed to this report._ **ALSO:****Gov.\nBrown hails deal to raise minimum wage to $15 as 'matter of economic\njustice'****Timeline of minimum wage increases in California****Who wins with\na $15 minimum wage?****Your voices: How would a minimum wage impact you?**\n\n","title":"Minimum wage deal clears first hurdle, could pass Legislature Thursday - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Minimum-wage deal heads to Legislature for vote after clearing first hurdle https://t.co/KL92PaYIEP https://t.co/7kRWVcHKP8","date":"Thu Mar 31 05:50:05 +0000 2016","favs":40,"id":{"$numberLong":"715415849914470400"},"retweets":36},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1PGQNCN"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5d7"},"content":"After deliberating for a little more than two hours, a San Diego jury said\nWednesday that former Mayor Bob Filner had harassed a longtime city parks\nemployee because of her gender, but found the harassment was neither serious\nnor pervasive.The San Diego Superior Court jury also determined that no sexual\nbattery occurred during the April 2013 incident, in which Stacy McKenzie\nclaimed the then-mayor touched her breast and buttocks during an event at a\nMission Bay park.McKenzie, 52, was not awarded damages.Her lawyer, Dan\nGilleon, had argued that McKenzie felt physically threatened when she met the\nmayor at a weekend event. It was a feeling, Gilleon said, that interfered with\nMcKenzie's work long afterward.\"This case is about abuse of power,\" he told\nthe jury during closing arguments.But lawyers for Filner and the city argued\nthat McKenzie had failed to show she suffered ongoing harm as a result of her\nencounter with the mayor.Filner, 73, a former 10-term congressman, stepped\ndown as mayor after more than a dozen women came forward during the summer of\n2013 with allegations of sexual harassment. He pleaded guilty in October of\nthat year to felony false imprisonment and two counts of misdemeanor battery\nfor incidents involving three women.Outside court, City Atty. Jan Goldsmith\nsaid his office reviewed each of the cases that arose out of the scandal and\nworked to settle those in which he and his deputies thought there was evidence\nof sexual harassment. The city and Filner have paid more than $1 million to\nsettle five of seven lawsuits.Goldsmith said there were two cases, both\nrepresented by Gilleon, that officials believed did not include facts that\nrose to the level of \"legal sexual harassment for which you get money.\"\nMcKenzie's was one of them; the other is still pending.According to her\ntestimony in the civil trial, McKenzie approached Filner at the April 21,\n2013, event, intending to introduce herself to the newly elected mayor. She\nsaid Filner asked her out to lunch and made it clear, while grabbing her\nwrists, that the invitation was for a date.Moments later, as McKenzie\nrecounted what had happened to her to a couple of co-workers, the mayor came\nup behind her and hooked his arm around her neck. While stroking McKenzie's\nleft arm with one hand, Filner let his other arm drop to her chest, brushing\nor grazing her breast, she said.\"I felt violated,\" she testified last\nweek.Gilleon told the jury that McKenzie avoided answering calls in her office\nfor months after the incident. A single mother, she feared losing her job and\nthe possibility of not being able to provide for her two children.The attorney\nasked for damages of $170,800 or more for medical expenses, as well as past\nand future mental and emotional distress.But the city's lawyers said McKenzie\njoked about the incident in emails with a co-worker. When she reported the\nincident to a human resources representative in July 2013, the city responded\nappropriately, the lawyers said.\"There was nothing in that office that was\nhostile or abusive toward Ms. McKenzie,\" Deputy City Atty.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5d8"},"content":"When Kim Jong Un made his first public speech as North Korea's leader in 2012,\nhe stood in front of a massive military rally in the capital’s main square and\ntold the crowd that they would “never have to tighten their belts again.” Kim\nwas referring to his country’s history of poverty and food shortages,\nparticularly a famine in the 1990s in which hundreds of thousands of people —\nif not more — starved to death.And just three months ago, Kim struck a\nsimilarly sunny note in his new year’s address, speaking of 2016 as a “golden\nage” during which North Korea would build “a thriving nation.”But in wake of\nnew economic sanctions imposed after its recent nuclear test, Kim’s regime\nseems to be changing its tune. This week, an official mouthpiece of the North\nKorean state made what appears to be the country’s first acknowledgment that\nit is preparing for worsening economic conditions.“We may have to go on an\narduous march, a time when we will again have to eat the roots of grass,” said\nan editorial in the Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the ruling\nWorkers’ Party of Korea.The sanctions, which on paper are the most severe in\n20 years, were approved by the U.N. Security Council after Pyongyang’s\nFebruary nuclear weapons test and more recent long-range missile launch,\nactions banned by Security Council resolutions.The sanctions are aimed at\nfurther restricting North Korea’s international trade and making it harder for\nthe already cash-strapped country to make the money it needs to fund weapons\nprograms. They go as far as to prohibit U.N. members from importing coal and\niron from North Korea, two key exports for the reclusive state.As text crawls\nacross the screen telling viewers about the \"last breath of the hideous\nAmerican monsters,\" an image of the White House explodes in a profusion of\nlow-tech graphics that seem straight from a 1980s video game.The three-minute\nvideo, posted on a propaganda website last week, also...As text crawls across\nthe screen telling viewers about the \"last breath of the hideous American\nmonsters,\" an image of the White House explodes in a profusion of low-tech\ngraphics that seem straight from a 1980s video game.The three-minute video,\nposted on a propaganda website last week, also...For decades, North Koreans\nhave lived in poor conditions while their government has poured huge sums into\nweapons development, and the state has used the language of collective\nsacrifice when selling tough times to the populace.“It’s an old pattern of\ntelling the population to endure short-term hardship for the promise of larger\nbenefits over the long term,” Daniel Pinkston, a lecturer at Troy University\nin Seoul, said of the Rodong Sinmun editorial.“They’re betting that the harm\nof the sanctions won’t last and ultimately their nuclear weapons will make the\ncountry stronger,” Pinkston added.The phrase “arduous march” is an allusion to\nthe North Korean state’s claim that its founding leader, Kim Il Sung, led a\nguerrilla campaign against the Japanese Imperial Army, which occupied the\nKorean peninsula early in the 20th century. It's the kind of publicity that\nwould seemingly scare off sightseers: A trio of U.S. citizens detained in\nNorth Korea pleading for help last week in brief, rarely granted media\ninterviews.Yet even as the ordeal for the men, who had gone to the reclusive\ncommunist outpost with tour groups, drags...It's the kind of publicity that\nwould seemingly scare off sightseers: A trio of U.S. citizens detained in\nNorth Korea pleading for help last week in brief, rarely granted media\ninterviews.Yet even as the ordeal for the men, who had gone to the reclusive\ncommunist outpost with tour groups, drags...It is now used as a euphemism for\nthe famine that ravaged North Korea in the 1990s, after the country was hit by\nthe loss of economic aid after the Soviet Union's collapse. Things got worse\nin subsequent years when torrential rains wiped out crops, causing widespread\nstarvation. North Koreans were told to struggle on, calling on the example of\nthe fight Kim Il Sung led for Korean independence in the 1930s against the\nmore numerous and better equipped Japanese.The regime could be invoking this\nhistory to prime the populace for the Party Congress, which will be held in\nMay for the first time in 35 years. At the Congress, Kim could announce\nchanges in the ranks of the country’s leadership, and new policy\ndirectives.Paik Hak-soon, an analyst at the Sejong Institute, a think tank\nnear Seoul, said the editorial was “meant to mobilize people both materially\nand ideologically ahead of the Party Congress, which comes at a time when\nNorth Korea is facing both economic difficulties and tensions with South Korea\nand the U.S.”North Korea’s launch of a long-range rocket Sunday has\npolicymakers in the United States, South Korea and China scrambling to answer\nto an old, vexing question: What's the most effective strategy for dealing\nwith an isolated state with a growing arsenal of increasingly dangerous\nweapons?Since...North Korea’s launch of a long-range rocket Sunday has\npolicymakers in the United States, South Korea and China scrambling to answer\nto an old, vexing question: What's the most effective strategy for dealing\nwith an isolated state with a growing arsenal of increasingly dangerous\nweapons?Since...Tensions have been high between the Koreas lately, with the\nU.S. and South Korea carrying out annual joint military exercises. This year’s\nare the biggest ever, a fact that has not gone unnoticed by Pyongyang. North\nKorea launched short-range projectiles off its east coast on Tuesday, the\nSouth Korean military reported, one of several such launches in recent weeks\napparently aimed at signaling Pyongyang’s objection to the drills.South Korea\nrecently cut off economic cooperation with North Korea, shuttering a joint\nindustrial park along the border.------------**FOR THE RECORD****March 31,\n6:11 a.m.:** An earlier version of this article stated that North Korea\nshuttered an industrial park jointly run with South Korea. South Korean\nofficials closed the facility.------------The North Korean economy is in far\nbetter shape today than when famine hit in the 1990s, but Kim Jong Un hasn’t\nushered in an era of prosperity as he pledged, analysts say.“For the economy,\nKim Jong Un’s tenure has been a mixed bag,” said Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein,\na nonresident Kelly Fellow at the Pacific Forum Center for Strategic \u0026amp;\nInternational Studies. \"On the one hand, he has shown a sense of pragmatism in\nacknowledging North Korea’s problems. On the other hand, no fundamental\nsystemic changes have occurred.”Kim took small steps toward addressing the\nproblem of North Korea’s mostly state-planned economy by introducing\nagricultural reforms that allow some farmers to sell their surplus products,\nbut such measures have not been widely implemented.Silberstein also pointed\nout that Kim has been well aware of the need to keep North Korea’s elite\ncontent, by focusing on improving conditions in the capital Pyongyang and\nsplurging on prestige projects like a luxury ski resort and water park. But\nwith these projects concentrated in Pyongyang, they do little to improve the\nlives of the majority, the people who are being called on to tighten their\nbelts._Borowiec is a special correspondent._**ALSO****Police round up at least\n5,221 suspects and kill 5 in a shootout after Lahore bombing****Family asks\nhuman rights panel for help in San Diego border death****In a first, liver and\nkidney from HIV-infected donor are transplanted into HIV-positive patients**\n\n","title":"North Korea warns: New famine may be coming - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"North Korea tells its people a new famine may come, they again may need to \"eat the roots of grass\" https://t.co/KhoRm1cqMr","date":"Thu Mar 31 05:05:06 +0000 2016","favs":31,"id":{"$numberLong":"715404529299116033"},"retweets":48},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1UV3u4U"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5d9"},"content":"A former Stanford University swimmer was convicted Wednesday of sexually\nassaulting a woman he met at a fraternity party.In a Palo Alto courtroom, the\njury found Brock Turner, 20, guilty of three felony counts: assault with\nintent to commit rape of an intoxicated woman, sexually penetrating an\nintoxicated person with a foreign object and sexually penetrating an\nunconscious person with a foreign object.The jury deliberated for just more\nthan a day before reaching a verdict, the San Jose Mercury News reported.\nTurner faces up to 10 years in prison in the case. Santa Clara County Superior\nCourt Judge Aaron Persky is scheduled to sentence him on June 2.Turner, then a\nfreshman, was arrested Jan. 18, 2015, after two men riding bicycles on campus\nabout 1 a.m. spotted him on top of an unconscious woman, according to the\npolice report filed with the criminal complaint.Turner and the woman, who was\nnot a Stanford student, both attended the same fraternity party that\nevening.In an interview with police, the Ohio native said he arrived at the\nparty about 11 p.m. and kissed a few women before hooking up with the woman\nwho was later found unconscious, according to the police report. He couldn't\nrecall her name, he told police.The two witnesses said that after he was\nspotted, Turner rose and fled. The two men said the chased him down and\nrestrained him until police arrived.A campus police officer found the woman\nlying on her side behind a dumpster near an on-campus fraternity. Unconscious\nbut breathing, she was taken to a hospital.Turner was booked in the San Jose\nMain Jail and released after posting bail. He remains free on bail until is\nsentencing.During trial, Turner's attorney, Mike Armstrong, said his client\ndid not know how drunk the woman was, the Mercury News reported. She had a\nblood alcohol level of .24 -- three times the legal limit for driving a\nvehicle -- while Turner had a blood alcohol concentration of twice the legal\nlimit.Deputy Dist. Atty. Alaleh Kianerci countered that Turner's pedigree\nshould not distract from his conduct that night.\"He may not look like a\nrapist, but he is the ... face of campus sexual assault,\" Kianerci said,\naccording to the Mercury News' report.After being charged, Turner voluntarily\nwithdrew from Stanford, and a university spokeswoman said at the time that he\nwas barred from setting foot on campus.Santa Clara County Dist. Atty. Jeff\nRosen said after the jury's decision was announced that he hoped the verdict\n\"will clearly reverberate through colleges and high schools anywhere in our\nsociety where there may be any doubt about the distinction between consent and\nsexual assault.\"Rosen added: \"No means no.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5da"},"content":"In a symbolic moment in California's slow but steady drought recovery, a state\nsurveyor on Wednesday found several feet of snow in the same Sierra Nevada\nmeadow that was bare and brown just a year ago.The depth of the snowpack was\ndeclared to be just below average, a huge improvement from last year, but\nstill far from enough to declare the drought over.Around 11 a.m., Frank\nGehrke, chief of the California Cooperative Snow Surveys Program, thrust a\nlong silver tube into Phillips Station’s renewed, robust snowpack and, minutes\nlater, told gathered reporters that there was more than 58 inches of snow on\nthe ground.That snow held 26 inches of water content, he said, just short of\naverage for the date.“A big improvement compared to last year,” Gehrke said,\n“but not what we had hoped for.”The Phillips Station measurement — which\nofficials said was 97% of average — provides data for just one location and\ntherefore is considered more symbolic than definitive. The results from the\nstation about 90 miles east of Sacramento are not necessarily representative\nof statewide conditions, officials say.   Water officials prefer to use the\nelectronic readings taken remotely at about 100 stations across the Sierra\nNevada for a more accurate assessment. The latest readings, taken Wednesday\naround 8:30 a.m. showed that the water content held by the state’s snowpack\nwas about 24 inches, or 87% of normal.Though still below average now, the\nsnowpack was in infinitely worse shape a year ago. On April 1, 2015, the\nstatewide snowpack’s water content was just 5% of normal — the lowest ever\nrecorded and the worst in hundreds of years. Data suggested that on average\nthere was one inch of water hidden in the snow, but there was no snow at all\non the Phillips Station field.“This was a dry, dusty field last year,” Gehrke\nsaid, adding that Wednesday’s snowpack \"seems good because it’s so much better\nthan last year.”Snowpack is important to California’s hydrology because when\nit melts, the water feeds into the state’s reservoirs; those reservoirs, in\nturn, send water to farmers in the Central Valley and to urban dwellers in\nSouthern California. In normal years, it supplies about 30% of the state's\nwater needs.The annual April 1 measurement is telling, officials say, because\nthe snowpack traditionally peaks around that time.Gov. Jerry Brown was on hand\nfor last year’s April 1 snowpack measurement to unveil a historic executive\norder requiring a 25% reduction in urban water use statewide -- the first such\nmandatory measure in California history.There were no dramatic announcements\nWednesday. An advisory from Brown’s office sent early in the day said the\ngovernor was out of the state.   One year ago Friday, Frank Gehrke hiked out\nto Phillips Station and stuck a tube onto a tuft of brownish-green grass.\nThere was no snow, but Gehrke had quite an audience.A gaggle of reporters and\neven Gov.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5dc"},"content":"Andrew F. Puzder, chief executive of CKE Restaurants Holdings -- that's the\ncompany that owns the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's restaurant chains -- has been\ntaking a lot of heat for an interview he gave earlier this month to Business\nInsider, in which he was quoted singing the praises of restaurant\nautomation.According to the quote, Puzder feels that machines are much easier\nto deal with than humans. \"They're always polite, they always upsell, they\nnever take a vacation, they never show up late, there's never a slip-and-fall,\nor an age, sex, or race discrimination case.\" (Technical note: \"upselling\"\nmeans steering customers toward products with higher price tags.) The business\npress picked up this ball and ran with it. Within days, there were headlines,\nlike this one in Fortune, declaring: \"This Fast Food CEO Wants to Replace\nWorkers With Robots,\" etc., etc. We would have joined in the fun but chose to\ncall Puzder first, to see if he wished to amplify. This led to an extended\ninterview late last week in which Puzder, 65, freely and cordially discussed\nhis views not only on automation, but the minimum wage, the Affordable Care\nAct, and other issues relevant to the low-income economy.As anyone can tell\nfrom his regular op-eds in the Wall Street Journal and elsewhere, Puzder's\nviews are unapologetically conservative. But they also reflect the worldview\nof a veteran business executive whose workforce is heavily tilted toward the\nlow-income end of the employment scale -- actually that's mostly the workforce\nof CKE's franchisees, who own and operate 92% of its restaurants. CKE, which\ntraces its history to the first Anaheim restaurant Carl Karcher opened in 1945\nand was taken private in 2010, is in the process of moving its headquarters\nfrom Carpinteria to Nashville.As is evident from their raunchy TV campaigns,\nCarl's Jr. and Hardee's (the first is essentially CKE's Western U.S. and\nHardee's its Eastern brand) target what might be termed the hairy-chested,\nbeer-drinking young men's demographic. That's also shown by their hamburger\nmenu choices, which often weigh in at 1,000-plus calories.But it's the low-\nincome workforce we're concerned with here; a segment most often impacted by\nsocial initiatives such as wage and benefit regulations. Puzder sees his\ncompany as providing a stepping stone for entry-level workers toward\nmanagerial careers, whether at CKE or elsewhere. \"Some move on to other jobs\nand challenges equipped with the experience you can only get from a paying\njob,\" he told a Senate committee last year. \"There's nothing more fulfilling\nthan seeing new and unskilled employees work their way up to managing a\nrestaurant.**\"**CKE offers tuition reimbursements for job and career-related\neducation and training to full-time employees who have been with the company\nfor a year, with a lifetime maximum of $20,000. It also offers health plans\nfor managers or those working 30 hours a week or more. But those benefits are\nfor corporate employees, not for those of its franchisees, who hire and\nsupervise the vast majority of workers in CKE restaurants. That's a major\nissue in the fast-food space, as the National Labor Relations Board, in a case\ninvolving McDonald's, is pushing hard to designate the big franchisor\ncompanies joint employers of workers hired by their franchisees.Puzder's views\nof the fast-food economy are more nuanced than one might expect from reading\nhis Wall Street Journal editorials alone, and they're worth hearing. We've\nbroken them up by theme, beginning with the issue that got the conversation\ngoing.**Technology and automation:** No,  Puzder doesn't intend to \"take\nhumans out of the fast food equation,\" as Fortune had it. His remark about\nmachines being so pliable was part of a longer exchange about the upsides and\ndownsides of automation, the second part of which didn't get reported.So he\nfollowed up with an op-ed in the Journal last week putting it on the record:\n\"Customer service is still very important and, for now, having access to a\nperson is important to assure smooth experiences for everyone. Increased\nautomation also makes it more difficult to build a company culture. There are\nmaintenance costs, and the business has to hire IT professionals to service\nthe technology. The technology can malfunction, spoiling a patron’s visit.\"\"I\nnever even mentioned robots,\" he told me, a bit chagrined. His point, he said,\nis that government mandates impose costs that \"make automation a more viable\noption for business.\" But \"we could never take out all the front-line\nemployees\" at CKE restaurants. At Carl's Jr. and Hardee's \"you have to have\npeople behind the counter because [customers] are used to that and people are\nmore comfortable with it.\" He might consider, however, equipping restaurants\nnear college campuses or other youth-oriented neighborhoods with touch-\nscreens, because he believes that millennials are more comfortable with\nautomated ordering. But he thinks more automation is the wave of the future.\n\"You can't stop the process,\" he said; it's the cost of those mandates that\nare forcing it to happen too fast. **Minimum wage:** Our conversation took\nplace the day before Gov. Jerry Brown and labor unions announced a deal to\nenact a $15 minimum wage in California through 2022, but judging from our\ntalk, Puzder would think this is a bad move. He says he's not against a\nminimum wage higher than today's federal level of $7.25 an hour, or even to\nindexing the minimum to inflation. But he believes a jump to $15, even over a\nfew years, inevitably will cost many low-wage workers their jobs. He's not\nalone in feeling uneasy about the magnitude of such a change, as we observed\nin our analysis of the state initiative here. We asked about the recent\nremarks of McDonald's executives, expressing satisfaction with the results of\ntheir initiative to raise the wages of restaurant employees above the\nprevailing legal minimums. Employee turnover is down, customer satisfaction is\nup, and hiring is up, too. “So far we’re pleased with it,\" McDonald’s U.S.\npresident Mike Andres told analysts at a recent meeting. \"It was a significant\ninvestment, obviously, but it’s working well.”Puzder observes, \"They're not\ntalking about $15 or $12 an hour, the kind of dramatic increases that are\nbeing bandied about in the political process right now.\"  CKE's average wage,\nhe says, is a bit over $10 an hour, \"so we're not talking about everybody in\nthe restaurant working for $7.25.\" (In California, the minimum wage is now\n$10.) \"But we're talking about entry-level jobs. Are people going to want to\nhire entry-level employees for these very high minimums, which come with\nObamacare, which come with mandatory sick leave, or other benefits which the\ngovernment imposes on business for these individuals? Are you going to be able\nto keep minimum wage entry-level job positions open for individuals?\"At CKE,\nhe says, \"people don't make minimum wage for a very long period of time. If\nyou're going to stay and you show you have value, then your wage is going to\ngo up. ... I don't think anybody plans to have a workforce of minimum-wage\nemployees. That's just not the way it works.\"  He adds, \"there's nothing wrong\nwith rational increases in the minimum wage that don't kill jobs.\" Adjusting\nthe minimum to inflation, he said, at least would avoid the abrupt jumps in\ncosts that occur when lawmakers try to rectify years of wage erosion all at\nonce.\"I started out scooping ice cream at Baskin-Robbins at a dollar an hour,\"\nhe said. \"I learned a lot about inventory and customer service ... but there's\nno way in the world that scooping ice cream is worth $15 an hour, and no one\never intended it would ever be something that a person could support a family\non. ... Those jobs just don't produce that kind of value like a construction\njob or a manufacturing job does.\" (Puzder didn't say, but judging from his age\nhe probably was scooping ice cream in the mid- to late 1960s, when one dollar\nwas worth what about $7.50 would be today.) **Obamacare:** The Affordable Care\nAct is one of the most frequent topics of Puzder's writings. CKE long has\noffered ACA-compliant health plans to managers or those who worked 30 hours a\nweek or more, and \"minimed\" plans to others. Today it still offers indemnity\nplans, which provide discounts for certain medical services, to workers\notherwise ineligible for more comprehensive coverage.  Puzder says the take-up\nrate on those plans is very low, which he interprets as a sign that the vast\nmajority of young people don't want the coverage and would rather pay the\nindividual penalty than pay for insurance.The difference is narrowing, though\n-- the penalty was $325 per person last year, but $695 this year. And many CKE\nemployees may not be taking up company coverage because it's cheaper to buy on\nthe ACA exchanges, especially for people eligible for tax subsidies.Puzder's\nbrief against Obamacare is familiar in conservative circles: Costs and\ndeductibles are rising, insurers are having trouble making money in the\nindividual market. He maintains that the program is giving small employers an\nincentive to lay off workers to avoid the insurance mandate, and that includes\nCKE franchisees. \"The government is traditionally not very good at managing\nthese types of programs,\" he told me. \"The incentives of Obamacare are not set\nup in a way that makes economic sense. Obamacare is surviving based on\nincreased government funding and increased taxpayer funding.\"Some of Puzder's\npoints merit challenging. The rise in insurance costs and deductibles predated\nthe ACA by many years, and in many respects have moderated since. While major\ninsurers have said they're not yet making money on individual ACA plans, most\nchalk that up to the growing pains of a market that didn't exist in its\npresent form three years ago, and say they're committed to staying in. Yes,\nObamacare is dependent on government funding -- that's what makes insurance\naffordable for low- and middle-income Americans, and allows states to provide\ncoverage via Medicaid. But that was part of the design from the inception. And\nwhile costs are expected to rise as more Americans become insured and file for\npremium subsidies, estimates of these costs have been recalibrated down: The\nCongressional Budget Office this month projected that coverage-related costs\nto the federal government would come to $466 billion in 2016 through 2019.\nThat's a bit higher than its projection a year ago, but 25% below its original\nprojection in 2010. Among the reasons are that the growth in healthcare costs\nhas been slowing, and fewer Americans than originally expected are leaving\nemployer health plans to buy insurance on ACA exchanges.As for whether\nObamacare is prompting small businesses to lay off workers or shrink their\nhours, it's possible that the world looks different to those on the firing\nline, like Puzder, than to those taking a macro view. But as we've reported,\nthere is simply no evidence of an increase in part-time workers since the law\nwent into effect, except those able to go part-time voluntarily because that\nno longer means giving up health coverage. Puzder found some of his evidence\nfor the dire impacts of the ACA in job statistics. He cites employment figures\nfrom the Bureau of Labor Statistic showing that since December 2007, which he\nidentifies as the beginning of the recession, the economy has added a net 4.8\nmillion jobs, of which 3.1 million, or 65% were part-time.But that time frame\nincludes two years in which the recession was still killing jobs. If one\nstarts at December 2009, when that trend bottomed out, the picture is much\ndifferent: Employment has risen by 13.1 million, of which 374,000 jobs were\npart-time -- 3%. So Puzder has included two years in which overall employment\nfell sharply before recovering, and full-timers got shifted to part-time work.\nBut that's changed since 2009 (and since the implementation of Obamacare after\n2010).Puzder knows the American workplace is changing, and he feels strongly\nthat his company occupies the sector where those changes are likely to bite\nfirst and hardest. That's why that sector is the target of some of the most\naggressive federal efforts to moderate the social impacts of market-driven\nchanges; Puzder argues that many such efforts are counterproductive.\"It sounds\ngood to say we're going to give everybody a raise,\" he told me, \"but I don't\nthink people think about the implications of that. If the business community\ndoesn't speak up, the politicians who garner votes by making those claims and\npassing this legislation are just going to keep saying things that just aren't\naccurate. It's important to speak up, so I did.\"**Keep up to date with Michael\nHiltzik.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5df"},"content":"An El Segundo police officer who says he has been harassed by a group of\nsurfers known as the Lunada Bay Boys of wealthy Palos Verdes Estates joined\nother alleged victims to file a class-action lawsuit on Tuesday.The officer,\nCory Spencer, and other plaintiffs are asking a federal judge to prevent\nmembers of the gang from congregating at the Bay, one of California most\ncoveted surf breaks. Additionally, the suit targets the city of Palos Verdes\nEstates, asking a judge to require the municipality to investigate and\nprosecute crimes committed by the group of surfers who alleged victims and\nwitnesses have accused of bombarding outsiders with dirt clods, slashing their\ncar tires and assaulting them in the water -- sometimes coordinating the\nattacks with walkie talkies.For years, beachgoers and witnesses have accused\nthe Bay Boys, some of whom are reportedly middle-aged, of bombarding outsiders\nwith dirt clods, slashing their car tires and assaulting them in the water —\nsometimes coordinating the attacks with walkie-talkies.“Palos Verdes Estates\nhas a long history of deliberate indifference in not investigating or\notherwise policing acts of violence and vandalism against visiting\nbeachgoers,” the suit alleges. “The response is always the same: City leaders\nacknowledge the problem, promise to do something, and then do little or\nnothing.”Police Chief Jeff Kepley, a named defendant, and City Manager Tony\nDahlerbruch did not return phone calls seeking comment.Olu Orange, an adjunct\nprofessor at USC who recently won a class-action lawsuit on behalf of people\nwho were unfairly targeted by gang injunctions, said it was unusual for a\ngroup of private citizens — rather than a government entity — to seek a gang\ninjunction.“It would be refreshing if this tool is used in a constitutional\nway,” Orange said. “Too often these affect people who have never done anything\nwrong in impoverished neighborhoods, but these guys live in an area where the\nmedian income is $170,000 and they can vandalize, assault and batter people,\nand can do it all under the watchful eye of the police.”Nearly four dozen\ninjunctions are in place throughout parts of L.A.’s roughest neighborhoods.\nThey are court orders that aim to severely curtail gang activity by, among\nother things, prohibiting gang members and their associates from socializing\nwith one another, carrying weapons or wearing certain clothing inside an\ninjunction's designated area — typically the neighborhoods where the gangs are\nactive.But, Orange said, it will be more difficult to get a federal judge to\norder the police to investigate alleged criminal activity by the Bay Boys more\naggressively.“For that, I think they will need to show a conspiracy between\nthe police and the alleged gang members,” he said.It has been years since\npolice made an arrest at Lunada Bay.The complaint says police have declined to\npursue assailants — including men who the plaintiffs said recently harassed a\nwoman who spoke to The Times for a story about the “localism” at the shore.The\npolice, the complaint said, “would not commit to a date to identify the …\nmember of the Lunada Bay Boys who poured beer on her and exposed himself to\nher, or other individual defendants who had harassed her.”Last month, an\nenforcement officer for the California Coastal Commission sent a letter to\nPalos Verdes Estates officials that said the Lunada Bay Boys were so\nentrenched in that stretch of coastline that they were subject to the\ncommission's watchdog regulations and permitting processes.The letter said:\n“Precluding full public use of the coastline at Palos Verdes Estates,\nincluding the waters of Lunada Bay, whether through physical devices ... or\nimpediments, such as threatening behavior intended to discourage public use of\nthe coastline, represents a change of access to water, and, thus, constitutes\ndevelopment.”In an interview Tuesday, officials with the Coastal Commission\nsaid they recently met with city officials to discuss ways they might improve\ntrail access and signage at Lunada Bay — although no commitments have been\nreached.“It would help people get to the coast, which is our goal, and it\nwould also potentially deter criminal behavior by having more eyes on the\nground,” said Andrew Willis, the commission's top enforcement agent in\nSouthern California.They also pushed to either permit or remove a stone fort\nat the water's edge allegedly constructed by the group as a party spot and\noutpost for coordinating harassment of outsiders.“Just because it’s sturdy\ndoesn’t mean it can’t be removed,” said Lisa Haage, the commission’s chief\nenforcement officer. “People remove development all the time along the\ncoast.”---UPDATE8:09 This story has been updated with material from the\ncoastal commission. **Follow me on

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5e2"},"content":"Blue Cross/Blue Shield, which is the largest player in the individual exchange\nmarket under the Affordable Care Act, has taken a close look at its enrolled\npopulation since the exchanges opened for business on Jan. 1, 2014. For some\nreason the Blues seem to be surprised at this finding:Members who enrolled in\n2014 and 2015 \"have higher rates of certain diseases such as hypertension,\ndiabetes, depression, coronary artery disease, human immunodeficiency virus\n(HIV) and Hepatitis C than individuals who already had BCBS individual\ncoverage....received significantly more medical services in their first year\nof coverage, on average..., (and) used more medical services across all sites\nof care—including inpatient hospital admissions, outpatient visits, medical\nprofessional services, prescriptions filled and emergency room visits.\"Here's\nthe money quote: \"Medical costs associated with caring for the new individual\nmarket enrollees were, on average, 19 percent higher than employer-based group\nmembers in 2014 and 22 percent higher in 2015.\"The Blues are implying that\nthese costs are higher than they expected, but the report actually tells a\nvery different story: It demonstrates exactly why the Affordable Care Act was\na necessity. The reason that new enrollees tend to be sicker than the previous\npool of patients in the individual market, and consequently are using more\nservices and costing insurers more, is that sick people were systematically\nexcluded from the individual insurance market prior to 2014. The mechanism was\nexclusions for pre-existing conditions, which were outlawed by the ACA.Federal\nhealthcare officials were quick to point that out Wednesday, after the\nreport's release. \"After years of being discriminated against, Americans with\npreexisting conditions are no longer locked out of coverage because of a\nhealth condition like asthma or diabetes,\" said Benjamin Wakana, a spokesman\nfor the Dept. of Health and Human Services. \"It’s no surprise that people who\nnewly gained access to coverage under the Affordable Care Act needed health\ncare; that’s why they were locked out of coverage before.\"That's demonstrated\ngraphically by the Blues' report. It shows, for example, that post-ACA\nenrollees are 242% more likely than pre-ACA enrollees to suffer from HIV, 140%\nmore likely to carry a hepatitis C infection, and 94% more likely to have\ndiabetes. (See chart below.)Of course, these are exactly the types of patient\nwho had almost no prayer of obtaining health insurance in the individual\nmarket before. The moment an applicant disclosed that he or she was HIV-\npositive, the doors would slam shut. Now they're open.The report underscores\nthis point in another way. While the post-ACA enrollees show materially higher\nrates of hypertension, diabetes, depression, and coronary disease than the\npre-ACA cohort (see chart below) they resemble the population of employer-\ninsured customers fairly closely.As Kevin Drum of Mother Jones observes, that\nshouldn't be surprising, because employer plans, like the ACA plans,\ntraditionally \"take all comers,\" healthy or ill--they haven't been permitted\nto exclude any individual, as long as the applicant meets the sponsoring\nemployer's standards (typically hours worked or job classification)._[UPDATE:\nRichard Mayhew, the health insurance authority at Balloon-juice.com, takes\nstrong issue with the notion that the costs of the post-ACA individual market\nenrollees resemble those of the employer-sponsored customer pool. On the\ncontrary, he says, the differences are \"very significant.\" Mayhew's issue is\nwith Drum's analysis, but since ours is similar we'll take his criticism on\nboard, too.__[Mayhew observes via the accompanying chart that utilization\nrates by new ACA enrollees are higher than those in the employer-sponsored\npool by as much as 40%, and in several categories approach or exceed 10%.\n\"Over millions of covered lives, differences of 10% of utilization for\noutpatient and medical professional claims is operationally significant,\" he\nwrites. \"Speaking as someone who does this for a living, we celebrate as a\nmajor success when an initiative drives down inpatient spend and utilization\nby 2%.  40% differential is massive.\" He says the differential makes sense, in\npart because full-time employment carrying insurance benefits is itself a\nscreen for health: \"If someone is sick with diabetes, depression and coronary\nartery disease, they are less likely to be working 30 hours per week.\"__[A\ncouple of points in response: HHS officials observe that the BCBS survey broke\nout the costs of newly-enrolled individual members and compared them both to\nthe costs of pre-ACA enrollees and to employer-plan members, but didn't show\nthe costs of the combined pre- and post-ACA individual enrollees--that is, the\nentire pool of healthier and sicker individual members. It's reasonable to\nassume that taken together, this pool will look even more like the employer-\nsponsored group. It's also worth repeating that newly-insured people are\nlikely to have elevated needs after years without insurance, but as they\nobtain treatment, their costs should decline.]_One predictable outcome of this\nchange in the individual market was that some pre-ACA enrollees--especially\nthe healthiest--would see their costs rise, as their insurance pools\naccommodated the one-time excluded. their old insurance rates were the product\nof now-outlawed cherry-picking. The other was that millions more people would\nhave access to coverage.Both eventualities have come to pass; the customers\nfacing the largest price increases tend to be the low-risk customers who\nconstituted a huge share of the cherry-picked customer base. But 9.1 million\nAmericans are now insured through the exchanges and receive tax subsidies to\nhelp pay for coverage. Another 9 million or so are on the exchanges, but\nunsubsidized. About 11 million are receiving coverage via expanded Medicaid\neligibility.Some healthcare experts, including a few at HHS, are wondering\nwhether the Blues timed their report to set the stage for the round of premium\nrequests that insurers will be filing in coming weeks for their 2017 plans.\nThe concern is that they'll be pointing to the report's findings about the\nhigher cost of insuring ACA enrollees to justify steep increases in their\nrequested rates. As Larry Levitt of Kaiser Family Foundation tweeted, \"This\nBCBS study is likely building the case for bigger hikes.\"But those rate\nrequests will need to be viewed in multiple contexts. For one thing, the\nlarger the request, the greater the chance that the insurer miscalculated its\ncosts in the first years of the ACA exchanges, whether out of incompetence,\ninexperience, or deliberately to grab market share. In such cases, they may be\ntrying to get back money they left on the table previously. Also, the initial\nrate requests typically are just opening bids, subject to oversight by state\ninsurance regulators. And the rates sought don't necessarily resemble those\npaid by customers, since more than 80% of customers in the market are eligible\nfor tax subsidies. Uncertainties about costs in the new individual market were\nexpected; that's why the law incorporated three years of risk adjustments,\nthrough which carriers that ended up with above-average risks were\ncompensated, and those with below-average risk pools had to give up some of\ntheir gains. In 2014, nearly $8 billion in reinsurance payments were\ntransferred to over-risked insurers for those with lower risks than the\naverage under this program, according to government figures.The Blues were\namong the biggest recipients, the government says, suggesting that their\ninsurance pools were somewhat sicker than the national average.This system\nworked well, by the way, until Congress threw in a monkey wrench by limiting\nthe administration's ability to make the transfers. The architect of this\nentirely unnecessary glitch was Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), who used it to\nburnish his credentials as a GOP presidential contender. To no avail,\nobviously. What are the biggest lessons to be drawn from the Blues' report:\nThe Affordable Care Act was necessary, and it's working.**Keep up to date with\nMichael Hiltzik.

The\nmessage was obvious: “I am the alpha male with the hot babe in my bed; Cruz is\na weak loser married to a homely shrew.”**SIGN UP for the free Opinion\nnewsletter \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Thanks to Trump, the 2016 campaign for the Republican\nParty’s presidential nomination has descended to a primal level. Unlike\nDemocrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, who have contained their\ndisagreements to quibbles over policy, Trump and Cruz are like two bull elk\nlocking horns in a battle for domination of the herd. While polls indicate a\nmajority of Americans are appalled by the spectacle, Trump supporters clearly\nlove it. They are drawn to Trump less for his program — thin as it is — than\nfor his imposing persona. They have bought into the idea that, as president,\nhe would face down the Chinese, the Mexicans, corporate leaders, Islamic\nterrorists and Vladimir Putin and bully them into doing his will.This vision\nof leadership is better suited to a gangster movie than to 21st century\ngeopolitics, but it indicates how some people have a strong inclination toward\nviewing international relations as an elemental clash of warlords. For people\nwho picture the world in such simple terms, the complex and nuanced diplomacy\nof German Chancellor Angela Merkel or U.S. Secretary of State John F. Kerry\nfeels weak, unheroic and forever unresolved, while the brash aggressions of\nPutin seem bold, muscular and even admirable.Let’s get one thing straight:\nThere is not a single cherished principle involved in the Senate Republicans’\nrefusal to hold confirmation hearings for Judge Merrick Garland, President\nObama’s Supreme Court nominee. Their opposition is entirely about partisan\npolitics and appeasing the militant conservatives...Let’s get one thing\nstraight: There is not a single cherished principle involved in the Senate\nRepublicans’ refusal to hold confirmation hearings for Judge Merrick Garland,\nPresident Obama’s Supreme Court nominee. Their opposition is entirely about\npartisan politics and appeasing the militant conservatives...Trump is running\nto be America’s Putin. It is no wonder that his list of celebrity endorsers is\nheavy with testosterone: former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka, bad boy actor\nCharlie Sheen, ear-biting boxer Mike Tyson, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban,\nflamboyant basketball star Dennis Rodman, gun-crazed rock-and-roller Ted\nNugent and pro wrestlers Hulk Hogan and Jesse Ventura. And also high on that\nlist are the country’s most prominent female pit bulls, Ann Coulter and Sarah\nPalin.Hollywood has encouraged this conception of the president as action\nhero. In the nearly identical White House disaster films, “Olympus Has Fallen”\nand “White House Down,” the president rises from the destruction ready for\ncombat. In “Independence Day,” the president flies a fighter jet to lead an\naerial attack on the invading aliens. In “Air Force One,” Harrison Ford plays\na commander in chief who personally takes out the bad guys.In real life, we\nhave not had very many presidents with an action hero aura. George W. Bush had\nthe swagger, but still seemed the hapless tool of his vice president. Bill\nClinton certainly had the lively libido of a major league playboy, but still\nwas just a doughy white guy who couldn’t resist a donut or a Big Mac. Even\nthough he was an actual war hero, the first President Bush had to deal with\n“the wimp factor.” Ronald Reagan probably came the closest to matching\nexpectations of a masculine war chief. He had the advantage of being a movie\nstar, which means much of his manly style was artifice. Nevertheless, he was a\ncapable horseman, and a leader on horseback cannot help but conjure up echoes\nof George Washington and Richard the Lionheart.Arguably, only one other recent\nWhite House resident comes close to the criteria for a movie-worthy president.\nHe has the unflappable cool of Clint Eastwood, the fluid stride of Denzel\nWashington and the smart, sardonic attitude of Daniel Craig’s James Bond. He\nis Barack Obama.You don’t buy it?

The “ruling is an opportunity for\nthe city of Los Angeles to go back to the drawing board and incorporate real\nimprovements and cleaner technology that will protect the communities that are\nburdened with this toxic air.”The lawsuit was filed in 2013 by a variety of\nplaintiffs, including the NRDC, the California attorney general, Long Beach,\nthe Long Beach Unified School District, the South Coast Air Quality Management\nDistrict, East Yard Communities for Environmental Justice, the Coalition for\nClean Air and the Coalition for a Safe Environment.In a prepared statement,\nport officials said the ruling will delay the project and deprive the region\nof many environmental benefits as wells as important rail infrastructure\nneeded by the growing ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.The officials added\nthat they will study the decision and discuss their next steps with Burlington\nNorthern and the Los Angeles Harbor Commission.If built, the 153-acre facility\nwould be located in Wilmington next to California 103, between Sepulveda\nBoulevard and Pacific Coast Highway and east of Alameda Street.The huge\nstaging center for trains hauling cargo from the harbor is predicted to handle\nup to 8,200 trucks a day and the equivalent of 2.8 million 20-foot shipping\ncontainers a year by 2035.The yard is bordered by industrial uses except for\nthe east side, where there are schools, playing fields, parks, housing for\nhomeless veterans and low-income, largely minority residential neighborhoods\nin west Long Beach.Health studies indicate that the area has\ndisproportionately high rates of asthma and respiratory illness -- especially\namong children -- related to emissions from diesel trucks and port\noperations.**Follow @LADeadline16 on Twitter for transportation and aviation\nnews.****ALSO****Head of L.A.

Arnold Schwarzenegger and 2010\ngubernatorial candidate Meg Whitman’s unsuccessful run.Trump, the national\nRepublican front-runner, leads among California Republicans, according to a\nnew USC-Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll. But he was nearly tied with rival Ted\nCruz among likely Republican voters.So the anti-Trump effort will be aimed at\nboosting Cruz in targeted congressional districts, which award nearly all of\nthe state’s 172 delegates, Stutzman said.“A vote for Cruz is a vote for an\nopen convention, and obviously that’s the objective at this point,” he\nsaid.Stutzman is joined by strategists Richard Temple and Ray McNally, whose\nfirm has worked for former Presidents George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush;\nformer Gov. Pete Wilson and entities associated with influential GOP donor\nCharles Munger Jr.Their effort, which is unnamed thus far, will be competing\nwith a handful of other national anti-Trump efforts. Stutzman said he believes\nthey will be more effective in California since they better understand the\ngeography and political intricacies of the state.On Wednesday morning, Ted\nCruz sat down with his wife and his mother in Madison for what the Texas\nsenator called a \"celebration of women.\" Later in the day, a poll from\nMarquette University provided new evidence of why Cruz is targeting women here\nin Wisconsin, which holds its primary Tuesday.Not only is Cruz beating Donald\nTrump among likely Republican voters, he has an even more sizable lead among\nwomen. Thirty-nine percent are backing Cruz, compared with 24% for Trump.\n(John Kasich was supported by 25% of women, but he trails behind the other two\ncandidates in overall numbers.) The margin of error among likely Republican\nvoters is plus or minus 5.8 percentage points. Trump is even more unpopular\nwithin the broader electorate — 77% of registered female voters said they have\nan unfavorable opinion of him. Their distaste for Trump could be a significant\nproblem in a general election match-up with Hillary Clinton, the Democratic\nfront-runner. One poll showed him losing female voters to Clinton by 21\npoints. If abortion were made illegal, women who undergo the procedure should\nface an unspecified \"punishment,\" Republican presidential front-runner Donald\nTrump said Wednesday.In an interview with Chris Matthews of MSNBC set to air\nWednesday night, Trump sought to tout his antiabortion bona fides, although he\ndid not specify how his view would translate into law.When Matthews asked him\nrepeatedly whether women who obtain abortions should be punished if the\nprocedure were made illegal, Trump said, \"There has to be some form of\npunishment.\"He added that he has \"not determined what the punishment would\nbe.\"Trump also told Matthews he did not believe men should also bear\nresponsibility for abortions.Trump said that if the U.S. should reverse Roe\nvs. Wade, which legalized abortion, \"you'll go back to a position like they\nhad where people will, perhaps, go to illegal places\" to have\nabortions.Nevertheless, he said, \"You have to ban it.\"  \nTrump has been viewed skeptically by some who are abortion opponents. They\nnote that the real estate developer has described himself as \"very pro-choice\"\nin the past. He has since said he's evolved on the issue and is now \"pro-life\n.\"Abortion-rights activists, including Cecile Richards, president of Planned\nParenthood, were quick to condemn Trump's comments.The Democratic presidential\ncandidates also swiftly chimed in, with Hillary Clinton calling Trump's\ncomments \"horrific\" and Bernie Sanders labeling them \"shameful.\"John Kasich,\nwho's seeking the Republican nomination as well, also condemned Trump, saying\nhis view wasn't an \"appropriate response.\"\"It's a difficult enough situation,\"\nKasich said.A prominent union that represents Border Patrol agents endorsed\nDonald Trump's presidential campaign on Wednesday, lauding the billionaire\nbusinessman for his \"bold\" and \"outspoken\" views on immigration.  \"If we do\nnot secure our borders, American communities will continue to suffer at the\nhands of gangs, cartels and violent criminals preying on the innocent,\" the\nNational Border Patrol Council, which has about 18,000 members, wrote in a\nletter of support. In total, the ranks of U.S. Customs and Border Protection\nemployees include about 21,000 agents.  \nThe union, which has chapters nationwide, has not endorsed candidates in the\npast. It is also restricted by federal regulations from making political\ncontributions to political parties or candidates. Trump has repeatedly vowed\nthat should he become president, a massive wall would be constructed along the\nU.S.-Mexico border to keep Mexicans immigrants, whom he has described as\n\"rapists\" and drug runners, from crossing into the country. He's also floated\nideas such as ending birthright citizenship and conducting mass deportations.\nIn its letter, the union notes that it wants \"elected officials to\naggressively pursue the interests of the country.\"\"Mr. Trump is correct when\nhe says immigration wouldn’t be at the forefront of this presidential campaign\nif, months ago, he hadn’t made some bold and necessary statements,\" the union\nwrote. \"And when the withering media storm ensued, he did not back down.\"\nTrump, who has visited with members of the union during stops to Arizona, said\nhe was privileged to have its support. \"This endorsement represents a total\nrejection of the corrupt politicians who have allowed transnational gangs and\ncartels to terrorize American communities,\" he said. Ted Cruz has a\nsignificant lead in Wisconsin's Republican primary, according to a new\nMarquette University poll. He is supported by 40% of likely Republican voters,\nwhile Donald Trump has 30% support and John Kasich has 21%.The margin of error\nis plus or minus 5.8 percentage points. Wisconsin holds its primary on\nTuesday. In the previous Marquette poll, conducted in February, Trump also had\n30% support, and Cruz had only 19%. Candidates who have since dropped out had\n31%.Cruz's leapfrogging of Trump in the new survey suggests that the Texas\nsenator has consolidated support in a diminished Republican field while the\nNew York businessman remains frozen in place.  \nIn the Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders is leading Hillary Clinton, 49% to\n45%. However, that's within the margin of error of 6.3 percentage points for\nlikely Democratic voters. A 15-year-old girl was groped and pepper-sprayed\nTuesday outside a Donald Trump rally in Janesville, Wis., police\nsaid.Authorities were searching for two people, one in the sexual assault and\nthe other in the pepper-spray attack, according to Janesville police.  \nVideo shows [warning: explicit language] the Janesville girl at the heart of a\nheated, racially tinged face-to-face clash between protesters and Trump\nsupporters outside the hotel where the front-runner for the Republican\npresidential nomination was holding a campaign rally.The girl, protesting\nTrump, was holding up a sign reading, “Damn Donald Back At It Again w/ The\nWhite Supremacy.” A fellow protester held another reading, “Black Lives\nMatter.” They were part of a cluster of white protesters in the midst of\nscores of Trump supporters.“If black lives matter, stop killing people,” one\nman yelled to the protesters. The crowd of Trump supporters also chanted at\nthem, “All lives matter!”As a man with gray hair confronted the girl, she\nsuddenly lowered her sign and accused him of touching her breast.“Don’t ...\ntouch me,” she shouted at him, using an expletive, as the crowd around her\nchanted, “Trump, Trump, Trump!”On the videos, the girl appears to punch the\nman or push him away, and then another man shoots pepper spray in her\nface.Police said a 19-year-old woman from Madison also was pepper-sprayed.\nBoth of those who were sprayed were treated at local hospitals, officials\nsaid.It was the latest in a series of sometimes violent clashes between\nprotesters and Trump supporters at his rallies, including a near-riot at a\nrecent Chicago event that the candidate canceled.At rallies in North Carolina\nand Arizona, Trump supporters were arrested after being captured on video\npunching hecklers. One of those videos is featured in a new Hillary Clinton\ncampaign ad.At the rally inside the Janesville hotel, Trump gave a lengthy\ndefense of his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who was charged with\nbattery Tuesday after officials said he grabbed a reporter’s arm as she tried\nto interview the candidate after a Florida news conference. Lewandowski denies\nthe allegation.After appearing to hint that she might vote for Donald Trump\nover Hillary Clinton in a general election matchup, Susan Sarandon insisted\nshe was misunderstood and would \"never support Trump.\"Sarandon, a Bernie\nSanders supporter, chastised fellow actresses Jamie Lee Curtis and Debra\nMessing on Twitter for criticizing her, telling them to watch her interview\ninstead of just reading misleading headlines.Sarandon was asked Monday whether\nshe planned to vote for Clinton over Trump.“I don't know,” Sarandon responded.\n“I'm going to see what happens.”Sarandon had also argued during the interview\nthat Clinton doesn’t share the ideals of Sanders supporters. She said Clinton,\nthe Democratic front-runner, accepts money from what she termed immoral\nsupporters — gas-drilling firms, Wall Street and agriculture giants like\nMonsanto.“They just feel like she's not authentic, that she's a liar,”\nSarandon said in describing her conversations with other liberals. And she\ncriticized Clinton’s campaign for failing to understand that voters want what\nshe called a “revolution” in politics -- a familiar Sanders term.“If you think\nit's pragmatic to shore up the status quo right now, then you're not in touch\nwith the status quo,” she said. Donald Trump took his support of his campaign\nmanager a step further Wednesday, accusing police of making a mistake in\ncharging him. \"Practically everybody that's seen it -- and I've been watching\ntelevision, I've been watching lawyers on television saying, 'You must be\nkidding, that this is the weakest charge we've ever seen,'” Trump said on\nABC’s “Good Morning America.” The GOP front-runner argued during multiple\nmorning television interviews that his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski,\nbarely touched former Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields at a March 8\ncampaign event. Surveillance video shows Lewandowski grabbing Fields, and\nLewandowski was charged Tuesday with simple battery. He denies the\nallegations.“She wasn’t yanked down; she was hardly even touched. ... He\ndidn’t try to throw her to the ground,” Trump said. He then said reporters\nneed to investigate a more pressing issue — why did Fields try to touch Trump\nhimself, he asked, and should he press charges against her?On NBC’s “Today,”\nhost Savannah Guthrie tried to press Trump, but the candidate yelled over her\nattempts ask other questions. “When you look at this, it was so minor. ... We\nhave people in the Middle East chopping off heads and drowning people in\ncages,” Trump said on “Today.” The primary fight between Hillary Clinton and\nBernie Sanders may have grown sharper in tone in recent days, but don't count\nDemocratic National Committee Chief Executive Amy Dacey as someone worrying\nabout a contested convention when Democrats pour into Philadelphia ins\nJuly.Dacey said she is confident that one of the two will be the presumptive\nnominee going into the convention, she told reporters during a stop on her\nWest Coast tour Tuesday.\"I'm fully confident that people are going to come\ntogether,\" she said of the factions behind Clinton and Sanders.\"There will be\nan ability to come together in a respectful way,\" she said. 'I don't think it\nis any comparison to the tone and tenor you've seen on the Republican\nside.\"Despite singing the tune of intra-party \"Kumbaya,\" Dacey stepped up to\ndefend a fundraiser Clinton is hosting this month that costs $353,400 per\nperson to attend. Sanders on Sunday called the reliance on high-priced\nfundraisers “obscene.”\"There is a lot of talk about campaign finance reform,\nyou know, and there always will be. We are playing the election season on the\nfield that we are on,\" she said. \"And I think the bottom line is we are going\nto get all the resources that we need to do that.\"\"We are being very smart\nabout our resources because I think that we will never have enough in\ncomparison to our Republican counterparts,\" she said.Dacey spoke before\nattending a fundraiser at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Los Angeles meant to\ntarget Asian American supporters in the L.A. area. She was joined by Rep. Judy\nChu, who leads the Asian caucus in Congress, Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Torrance) and\nRep. Mark Takano (D-Riverside).Dacey said shoring up the Democratic coalition,\nespecially among young people and minorities is key for the DNC.\"[Clinton and\nSanders] have run campaigns, both, that are worthy of the office, and they are\nfocused on ensuring everyone in America has a fair shot.\" she said. \"I'm\nconfident one of them will be the 45th president of the United States, but I'm\nnot underestimating the amount of work that is going to take.\"Political\nviolence dominated the presidential race once again Tuesday as Florida police\ncharged Donald Trump’s campaign manager with battery on accusations of\ngrabbing a reporter’s arm and bruising her as she tried to interview the\nRepublican front-runner after a news conference.Trump stood by his campaign\nmanager, Corey Lewandowski, and attacked the credibility of the accuser,\nreporter Michelle Fields, who was working for the conservative news outlet\nBreitbart when the incident occurred March 8.Police in Jupiter, Fla., released\na video that appears to show Lewandowski yanking Fields as Trump walks through\na crowd at the Trump National Golf Club, contradicting Lewandowski’s earlier\nstatement that he never touched her.Read moreDonald Trump, the business-mogul-\nturned-politician, has upended the election conversation like no recent\ncandidate before him.

It\npraises cultural differences and features scenes of New Yorkers from different\nraces and cultural backgrounds interacting. “We don’t all look the same,”\nClinton says in the ad. “We don’t all sound the same, either.”As Clinton\nfocuses on Trump, she is also paying close attention to her well-funded\nDemocratic rival Bernie Sanders, a Brooklyn native who is vowing to disrupt\nClinton’s march toward the nomination with a big push in the state Clinton\nrepresented in the Senate.

Robert Bentley\nresigned Wednesday, a week after he publicly admitted making inappropriate\nremarks to her but denied the two ever had an affair.Soon after, a GOP\nlawmaker said he planned to introduce a resolution to begin impeachment\nproceedings against the Republican governor.Rebekah Caldwell Mason announced\nher resignation in a statement sent by the governor's office, saying she would\nno longer be his senior political advisor and would no longer be paid by his\ncampaign fund.\"My only plans are to focus my full attention on my precious\nchildren and my husband who I love dearly,\" she said.As Bentley's confidante,\nsounding board, advisor and message molder, Mason has been there for the\nbiggest moments of his political career, from his improbable 2010 election to\nthe development of his major policy initiatives. More recently, she has been\nat the center of the lowest moment of his political career.When Joshua McKoon\nlearned that AT\u0026amp;T, Bank of America and hundreds of other companies had\ntaken out a full-page newspaper advertisement to protest Georgia's \"religious\nliberty\" bill, the Republican state senator took to Twitter.\"How grotesque,\"\nhe wrote.The ad, which appeared Easter Sunday in...When Joshua McKoon learned\nthat AT\u0026amp;T, Bank of America and hundreds of other companies had taken out a\nfull-page newspaper advertisement to protest Georgia's \"religious liberty\"\nbill, the Republican state senator took to Twitter.\"How grotesque,\" he\nwrote.The ad, which appeared Easter Sunday in...**Join the conversation on\nFacebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Last week, Mason was thrust into the spotlight when an\nofficial who had just been fired accused the 73-year-old governor of having an\ninappropriate relationship with Mason. Law Enforcement Secretary Spencer\nCollier made the allegations a day after he was fired. The scandal has\nengulfed Bentley, a mild-mannered dermatologist and former Baptist deacon\nwhose political ascendency was based partly on his morally upright, honest\nreputation.Dianne Bentley, the governor's ex-wife, filed for divorce in 2015\nsaying their 50-year marriage had suffered an irreparable breakdown.Recordings\nobtained by the Associated Press purportedly show the governor — before his\ndivorce — professing love to someone named Rebecca or Rebekah and telling her\nhow much he enjoyed kissing and touching her.The recordings were provided by a\nformer administration member who did so on condition of anonymity to avoid\nangering politically powerful former associates.In a furtive phone call,\nBentley says his family is vacationing at the beach and tells the person on\nthe other end: \"I love you so much; I worry about loving you so much.\"While\nthe governor is clearly heard, the person on the other end is not.Later, he\ntalks about getting physical. Bentley says he meant to text the person, but\naccidentally sent the message to a male aide.\"It didn't say, 'Hey baby I love\nyou so much and I'd like to spend the rest of my life with you. ... You kiss\nme. ... I love that. You know I do love that. You know what, when I stand\nbehind you and I put my arms around you and I put my hands on your breasts and\nI put my hands on you and just pull you in really close. I love that, too.\"The\nfallout from the scandal does not appear to be over. Rep. Ed Henry said\nWednesday that he plans to introduce the impeachment resolution when the\nAlabama Legislature returns from spring break next week because the governor\nhas lost the confidence of lawmakers and voters. Henry and Bentley are both\nRepublicans who have frequently clashed over the past two years, including\nover the governor's proposal last year to raise taxes.However, Henry\nacknowledged the resolution faces an uphill climb. A majority of House members\nwould have to vote to begin proceedings.Mason, a former television news anchor\nin Bentley's hometown of Tuscaloosa, signed on as spokeswoman for the little-\nknown legislator's 2010 long-shot bid for governor. She worked as the\ngovernor's communications adviser before leaving to work on his 2014\nreelection.Observers said Mason helped the governor talk through options as he\nweighed decisions ranging from taking down Confederate flags to his proposed\n$800 million prison construction project before lawmakers.Her detractors\nwithin the administration said her opinion increasingly became the only one\nBentley would trust.\"At the end of 2014, Governor Bentley made it clear to me\nin no uncertain terms that from that point forward anyone who questioned\nRebekah's influence would be fired,\" Collier said.As his senior political\nadvisor, she was not paid by the state. Instead, she was paid with campaign\nfunds — something the governor's office said Bentley had done with previous\npolitical advisers in his administration.Campaign records show Bentley's\ncampaign paid Mason's company, RCM Communications, $76,500 in 2015 for\nconsulting and travel reimbursement. Mason disclosed last week that the\nAlabama Council for Government Excellence, a nonprofit formed to promote\nBentley's agenda, also paid her company $15,000 for consulting work.Mason's\nhusband also works for Bentley as the director of Serve Alabama, the\nGovernor's Office of Faith-Based and Volunteer Service.In a statement issued\nlast week, she said Bentley \"apologized to me and to my family, we accepted\nhis apology and have put all of this behind us.\"**ALSO****North Carolina's\nattorney general says he won't defend transgender law in court****Some call it\nreligious freedom, others call it anti-gay.

But the law allows the city to clamp down in this way in the\nfuture.City Councilman Joe Buscaino said the measure balanced the city's need\nfor safe and clean streets with homeless people's personal property rights.For\nnearly a year, Los Angeles has wrestled with how to curtail a sharp spike in\nstreet encampments while respecting homeless people's rights to hang on to\npersonal property.Faced with the most unsheltered people in the country, and\nratty shantytowns from the Cahuenga Pass to the harbor, the city...For nearly\na year, Los Angeles has wrestled with how to curtail a sharp spike in street\nencampments while respecting homeless people's rights to hang on to personal\nproperty.Faced with the most unsheltered people in the country, and ratty\nshantytowns from the Cahuenga Pass to the harbor, the city...\"We recognize\nthis is just one step forward to address the homelessness crisis,\" said Carol\nSchatz, president of the Central City Assn. of Los Angeles. \"But right now you\nhave the ability to adopt an ordinance that promotes healthy and safe\nstreets.\"Skid row activists called the measure draconian and demeaning and\nwarned that it could run up against federal opposition to criminalizing\nhomeless people's status.Under the law, homeless people can be cited or\narrested on a misdemeanor charge for failing to clear the sidewalks or failing\nto take down their tents between the hours of 6 a.m. and 9 p.m.\"How can I get\nout of homelessness when you keep throwing me literally in the trash?\" said\nGeneral Jeff Page.Members of Los Angeles Community Action Network, a skid row\nadvocacy group, paraded through the City Council chambers wrapped in garbage\nbags spray-painted \"I am human. Not trash.\"The city has been grappling for the\nbetter part of a year with how to respond to shantytowns that leapfrogged\ntheir traditional downtown boundaries as the city's homeless population rose\n20% in two years, to 26,000 people.After adopting the original storage bill in\nJune, the council suspended enforcement while modifications were debated.Under\nthe new measure, the city can impound homeless people's \"excess personal\nproperty\" after providing 24 hours' notice. The measure defines that as\n\"personal property that cumulatively exceeds the amount of property that could\nfit in a 60-gallon container with the lid closed.\"The city will store these\nitems for 90 days, during which time the owners can claim them. But they\ncannot evade further confiscation by moving the items to another public area,\nthe ordinance says.With no advance warning, the city can seize and impound a\ntent that has not been taken down during the day.\"They will be allowed to\nerect tents in the nighttime hours,\" Buscaino said.Bulky and contaminated\nitems can be seized and discarded without warning. Wheelchairs, crutches and\nwalkers are exempt, and homeless people can keep their tents up in daytime\nhours if the temperature falls below 50 degrees.Westside Councilman Mike Bonin\nsaid he was \"not happy\" with the measure but saw it as an improvement over the\noriginal law, which he said dictated that \"you can't have any belongings.\"\"A\nno vote today keeps in place a crueler law,\" Bonin said. \"I remain a reluctant\nyes.\"\"It's better than what we have now,\" Councilman Curren Price\nagreed.Cedillo, however, said the city cannot help homeless people and\ncriminalize them at the same time.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5eb"},"content":"The FDA has approved new labeling for the drug Mifeprex that could make it\neasier for women in some states to access medical abortions.Mifeprex (its\ngeneric name is mifepristone) is also known as \"the abortion pill\" or the\n\"early option pill.\"It was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration\nin 2000, and has since been used by more than 2.75 million women in the United\nStates, according to Danco Laboratories, the company that manufactures the\ndrug. Even with the new labeling, Mifeprex is only available to women who are\nin their first trimester of pregnancy. It works by blocking a hormone called\nprogesterone that is needed for a pregnancy to continue.It is usually used in\nconjunction with another drug -- misoprostol -- taken one to two days later\nthat causes the uterus to actively contract and end the pregnancy.The new FDA-\napproved Mifeprex label will include several changes that were recommended by\nthe World Health Organization in 2003 and were endorsed more recently by the\nAmerican Medical Assn. and the American College of Obstetricians and\nGynecologists.It extends the amount of time a pregnant woman can take the drug\nfrom seven weeks after her last menstrual period to 10 weeks.It says women can\ntake the misoprostol in the comfort of their own home rather than in the\npresence of a physician.------------**For the record****March 31, 1:19 p.m.:**\nA previous version of this story stated that women could take Mifeprex at\nhome. Mifeprex is administered in a doctor's office.

That's\nbecause legislators in those three states have enacted laws requiring Mifeprex\nto be given in strict accordance with the regimen outlined on the drug's\nlabel. Lawmakers passed similar restrictions in Arizona, Arkansas and\nOklahoma, but those have been blocked by court orders.\"Those laws made it\nimpossible for doctors to follow the latest science in those states,\" said Dr.\nBeverly Winikoff, president of Gynuity Health Projects, an organization that\nadvocates for women's reproductive rights. \"Now, when you follow the label,\nyou are following the latest science.\"**Follow me @DeborahNetburn ****and\n\"like\" Los Angeles Times Science \u0026amp; Health on Facebook.**\n\n","title":"FDA softens restrictions on 'abortion pill' Mifeprex - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"FDA softens restrictions on \"abortion pill\" Mifeprex https://t.co/WTNX10WqRc","date":"Wed Mar 30 23:05:07 +0000 2016","favs":21,"id":{"$numberLong":"715313936921395200"},"retweets":18},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1PGoepc"}

Sandoval is a nine-\nyear Fairfield police veteran.Sandoval feared James Jarrard was reaching for\nhis waistband for a weapon, so he fired shots at him and struck him once in\nthe neck, police said.****NEWSLETTER: Get essential California headlines\ndelivered daily \u0026gt;\u0026gt;** **“With no time to retreat or items of cover to\nprotect him, the officer fired two shots from his duty pistol, striking\nJarrard once in the right side of his neck,” the police department said.No\nweapons were found, and Jarrard later told investigators he was reaching down\nto pull up his pants.The police department’s Major Crimes Unit and\ninvestigators with the FBI’s Safe Streets Task Force have been interviewing\nwitnesses and reviewing evidence to determine what led to the police\nshooting.Authorities said it all started Monday with a witness who recognized\nJarrard from media reports regarding the shooting of an 8-year-old boy who was\nshot in the neck in Concord, Calif.Concord police identified Jarrard as the\nsuspect and warned that he was armed and dangerous. An arrest warrant was\nissued for Jarrard for attempted murder.The witness followed Jarrard to the\nparking lot of a Lowe’s store in the 3400 block of North Texas Street and\nprovided police with a description of a vehicle. The vehicle was reported\nstolen from Walnut Creek.Officers arrived at the parking lot to find Jarrard\nstanding outside the vehicle, and they started to approach him.Jarrard then\nran away as officers ordered him to the stop.While one officer chased him, two\nother officers drove through an alley to corner him.But when Jarrard saw the\npolice vehicles in the alley, he turned around and ran toward the two\nofficers.“Jarrard began reaching and grabbing at his waistband area as he ran\ndirectly toward the officers,” the police department said.That’s when Sandoval\nshot Jarrard.Police said Sandoval was “faced with a reported armed and\ndangerous felon now running toward him who was reaching into his\nwaistband.”Jarrard was taken to an area hospital, where he is in stable\ncondition.Once he is released from the hospital, Jarrard will be transported\nto the Solano County jail on suspicion of attempted murder, resisting arrest,\nviolating parole and possession of a stolen car, methamphetamine and drug\nparaphernalia, police said.**MORE: Get our best stories in your Facebook feed\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;****For breaking news in California, follow ****VeronicaRochaLA** **on\nTwitter.****ALSO****Man on Tulare County sheriff's most wanted list is wounded\nby deputy during capture****Head of L.A.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5ef"},"content":"Scientists looking to probe the atmosphere of a super Earth have discovered a\nnearby planet with strange properties – including a day side that’s about\n1,300 degrees kelvin more than the night side.The planet 55 Cancri e,\ndescribed in the journal Nature, could shed light on the behavior of\nincreasingly Earth-sized planets in extreme situations.As telescopes like\nNASA’s Kepler spacecraft have pinpointed all manner of alien worlds, from\nsuper Jupiters to planets smaller than Earth, scientists’ attention has turned\nto those planets’ atmospheres. After all, it’s the composition of the\natmosphere (if a planet has one at all) that will help determine if a planet\nis suitable for life as we know it.Finding planets, however, is delicate work;\nexamining the thin sliver of atmosphere around those planets is exceedingly\ndifficult. For the most part, researchers have only really been able to do it\nfor enormous gas giant planets.But for this paper, the researchers tried to\ncharacterize the atmosphere of 55 Cancri e, which sits about 40 light-years\naway from Earth. 55 Cancri e is thought to be almost twice the Earth’s size\nand hold eight times its mass, and it circles its star in a mere 18 hours –\nwhich gives scientists a lot of opportunities to observe it.Here's a view of\nthe Milky Way galaxy like you've never seen before.The Atacama Pathfinder\nExperiment telescope in Chile (APEX for short) captured this super-panoramic\nimage of our home galaxy, mapping the full view of the galactic plane as seen\nfrom the Southern Hemisphere in unprecedented detail.Here's a view of the\nMilky Way galaxy like you've never seen before.The Atacama Pathfinder\nExperiment telescope in Chile (APEX for short) captured this super-panoramic\nimage of our home galaxy, mapping the full view of the galactic plane as seen\nfrom the Southern Hemisphere in unprecedented detail.“There’s really no other\nplanet like it,” said study co-author Stephen Kane, an astrophysicist at San\nFrancisco State University.  Using NASA’s infrared-seeking Spitzer Space\nTelescope, an international team of astronomers observed the planet for a\ntotal of 75 hours over the course of a month in 2013. This planet, which sits\njust 1.2 million miles from the star's surface, has been tidally locked\nbecause of the star’s gravity, which means that the same face of the planet\nremains turned toward the star (just as the same side of the moon faces\nEarth).As scientists work to unravel the mysteries of Zika, a scientific\nvisualization firm has created a realistic 3D model of the mosquito-borne\nvirus that lets you see it up close and extremely personally.The engrossing\nimages come courtesy of Visual Science, a Moscow-based studio that was\npreviously...As scientists work to unravel the mysteries of Zika, a scientific\nvisualization firm has created a realistic 3D model of the mosquito-borne\nvirus that lets you see it up close and extremely personally.The engrossing\nimages come courtesy of Visual Science, a Moscow-based studio that was\npreviously...The researchers mapped out a single region within a single\ncentral pixel in the detector, and then used that information to remove\nsensitivity variations in their observations.“This is a really hard\nmeasurement to make,” said study co-author Jessica Krick, an astronomer with\nthe Spitzer Space Telescope at Caltech. “In fact, they did it a few times to\nmake sure that what they were seeing was real.”That side turned out to be a\nbroiling 2,700 degrees kelvin – not that far off from the stellar surface\ntemperature. On the other side, it was a mere 1,380 degrees kelvin – which,\nrelatively speaking is dramatically cooler.This perplexed the researchers –\nafter all, atmospheres tend to take the heat from the day side and spread it\naround to the dark side.On Earth, “that’s good for us, because otherwise we’d\nall freeze to death when it’s nighttime,” Kane said.This could mean a number\nof things. Perhaps there isn’t really an atmosphere at all on this planet –\nit’s simply been boiled away by its proximity to the star’s surface.The\nresearchers also found a particular source of heat on the day side, which they\nthink could potentially be significant volcanic activity that might be\ncontributing to the temperature difference between both sides.“I think it’s\ninteresting that we don’t really understand how this could happen,” Krick\nsaid.The mystery may be solved with the completion and launch of NASA’s James\nWebb Space Telescope, the scientists said.In the meantime, she added,\ntheorists will probably need to come up with better models to explain this\nplanet’s strange behavior.“There’s a lot of theory work that needs to be done\nin the future as well to understand what it could mean that we’re seeing this\nbig temperature variation,” she said.  **Follow @aminawrite on Twitter for\nmore science news and \"like\" Los Angeles Times Science \u0026amp; Health on\nFacebook.**\n\n","title":"Hot nights, scorching days: Extreme super Earth baffles astronomers - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Hot nights, scorching days: Extreme super Earth baffles astronomers https://t.co/kjpOl5Ic8b https://t.co/FnNLYBle5q","date":"Wed Mar 30 21:45:14 +0000 2016","favs":42,"id":{"$numberLong":"715293837338550272"},"retweets":35},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1MBW7fZ"}

So long as Young’s\nbehavior stays within the norms of this particular subculture, it’s not smart\nof Russell to expose it. This is professional sports’ variation of the so-\ncalled “guy code.”Trust is a key component of successful teams and whatever\ntrust his teammates had in Russell is now gone. If Russell secretly recorded\nYoung’s confession of infidelity, the other players have to be wondering what\nhe might do to them.The backlash Russell is facing is of a similar vein to\nwhat Jose Canseco encountered when he released a book detailing widespread\nsteroid use in baseball.The problem wasn’t Canseco’s truthfulness – by all\naccounts, what he wrote was largely accurate. The issue was that Canseco\npotentially jeopardized the livelihoods of his former co-workers. He\ncompromised the well-being of the group and, as a result, he was\nshunned.Revealing the extramarital affairs of others is huge a no-no in\nclubhouses.There’s precedent for this on the Lakers. Kobe Bryant’s long-\nrunning feud with Shaquille O’Neal escalated when Bryant told police of\nO’Neal’s indiscretions while being investigated for sexual assault in 2003.\nO’Neal was traded a year later.Bryant was already an established superstar at\nthat point in his career and the Lakers were set on building their team around\nhim.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5f4"},"content":"The chief executive of the Los Angeles County Fair Assn., who made more than\n$1 million in total compensation in 2014 even as the nonprofit organization\nreported steep financial losses, resigned Wednesday, saying he had “become a\ndistraction” to its work.James Henwood Jr., who led the association for two\ndecades, will be replaced on an interim basis by former Cal Poly Pomona\nPresident J. Michael Ortiz, chairman of the fair organization's board of\ndirectors.Henwood's departure follows a Los Angeles Times investigation that\nfound that he and other executives received lucrative pay and benefit packages\ndespite several years of red ink at the association. The organization stages\nthe annual fair and operates a number of year-round enterprises at the\ntaxpayer-owned fairgrounds in Pomona.In 2014, the most recent year for which\nfigures are available, the association reported a loss of $3.44 million,\nfederal tax returns show — its fifth straight year of negative results. During\nthat period, compensation for Henwood and his top managers increased\ndramatically.Day and night, the stench of raw sewage wafted through the aging\ntrailer park in Pomona.The odor billowed from scores of uncapped pipes that\nempty the waste tanks underneath the trailers.\"Any time anybody flushes their\nsewage out of their tanks, you smell it,\" said Dave Smith, 62, who has\nlived...Day and night, the stench of raw sewage wafted through the aging\ntrailer park in Pomona.The odor billowed from scores of uncapped pipes that\nempty the waste tanks underneath the trailers.\"Any time anybody flushes their\nsewage out of their tanks, you smell it,\" said Dave Smith, 62, who has\nlived...Late last year, in response to the Times report, the county Board of\nSupervisors ordered an audit of the association's finances. The association\nleases roughly 500 acres of fairgrounds, known as the Fairplex, from the\ncounty.A spokesman for Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, who called for the\naudit, said Wednesday the examination could take two more months to complete.\nIt originally was scheduled to be wrapped up this month.A state audit of the\nassociation is also pending.A spokeswoman for the fair organization did not\nimmediately respond to questions of whether Henwood's resignation had anything\nto do with the audits or whether he was receiving a severance package.\nHenwood's contract was due to expire at the end of this year, the association\nsaid.Henwood did not respond to interview requests.In a statement Wednesday,\nthe fair association said Henwood had planned to leave the organization at the\nend of 2016 when his contract expired, but moved up his departure. The\nstatement quoted Henwood as saying he was “very proud” of his tenure but\nadding: “Lately I have become a distraction from the great work that [the\ncounty fair association] does. I love this organization too much to let that\nhappen. Accelerating a change in leadership will allow [the association] to\nrefocus on its important role in the community.”Seven months after two young\nwomen died of suspected drug overdoses after attending a rave concert at the\nfairgrounds, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Fair Assn. said Tuesday\nthat the group is not planning to host raves this year. “We are not looking to\nhost [electronic dance music] concerts...Seven months after two young women\ndied of suspected drug overdoses after attending a rave concert at the\nfairgrounds, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Fair Assn. said Tuesday\nthat the group is not planning to host raves this year. “We are not looking to\nhost [electronic dance music] concerts...Henwood was paid $1,045,088 in salary\nand benefits in 2014, a 17% increase from the previous year, according to the\ntax records. The figure included about $443,000 in bonuses.Since 2009, the\nlast year the association finished in the black, his total compensation has\nrisen 90%.Four executives who report to Henwood — the chief financial officer\nand vice presidents for operations, sales and branding — received total\ncompensation ranging from about $313,000 to $455,000 in 2014.Henwood, 69, a\nformer Orange County mall manager, had defended the pay levels as appropriate\nand said losses reflected money reinvested into the Fairplex.Earlier this\nyear, Stephen Morgan, a member of the association's governing board, which\napproved the compensation amounts, said the panel believed the salaries and\nbonuses were justified because of the complexity of the organization.He noted\nthat the association, in addition to the fair, runs a hotel and conference\ncenter at the Fairplex as well as a catering company, an equipment rental firm\nand trailer and RV parks.Morgan, president of the University of the West in\nRosemead, said Wednesday that Henwood had “served the Los Angeles County Fair\nAssn. very well,” but had determined he had become “a lightning rod” because\nof the reports on his compensation. Henwood concluded “that it was not in the\nbest interest of the Fairplex to remain,” Morgan said.Ortiz said in a\nstatement that he was honored by his appointment to the interim position and\nplanned to “help the organization maximize … current programs and\nresources.”The Times also has reported that the association had drifted from\nits tax-exempt mission as a nonprofit to promote local agricultural interests.\nMost of its activities have little or nothing to do with farming or farmers,\nand some neighbors said the association's hosting of rave concerts at the\nFairplex had brought noise, drugs and crime to the community.U.S. Rep. Norma\nTorres (D-Pomona), whose district includes the fairgrounds, has asked the\nInternal Revenue Service to investigate the association to determine whether\nits tax exemption should be rescinded. IRS officials have declined to comment\non the matter.Through a spokeswoman, Torres said Wednesday that she hoped “new\nleadership will bring about long-needed changes to not just make the Fairplex\na profitable venture, but also a good neighbor for the surrounding\ncommunities. Changing leadership alone, however, will not solve the\nproblem.“For years the Fairplex has benefited from tax-exempt status and from\nother local and state resources, yet they haven't held up their end of the\nbargain. Moving forward they must account for how these resources were used in\nthe past and commit to greater oversight and accountability of their\nmanagement and operations to prove they can be good stewards of taxpayer\ndollars and responsive to the concerns of local residents.”Meanwhile, The\nTimes reported this month that residents of the association-run trailer park\nhad long complained that the property was being neglected. They noted that\ndozens of sewer pipes were left uncapped, emitting a foul odor. Residents said\nbathrooms were in disrepair, a laundry room was shuttered, and overhead power\nlines had peeling insulation.At the same time, the association regularly\nraised the tenants' rent and had for years improperly collected from them a\n“transient occupancy” tax, the type levied on hotel guests. The tax amounted\nto 10% of the monthly rent for trailer spaces. It was unclear how long the tax\nhad been collected, but some residents say they had paid it for 10 years or\nmore. The collections stopped last year after a tenant complained.Henwood\nlater told The Times he regretted not having paid more attention to problems\nat the trailer park.The L.A. County association paid its executives far more\nthan other fair organizations in California, including those that reported\nbetter financial results.The head of the fairgrounds that holds the San Diego\nCounty fair, for example, had a salary-and-benefit package in 2014 of about\n$194,000, less than a fifth of Henwood's compensation. The manager of the\nOrange County Fair made about $212,000 that year.The San Diego and Orange\nCounty fairs, which drew more visitors than L.A.'s the last two years, are run\nby state agencies.**paul.pringle@latimes.com****Follow @PringleLATimes on\nTwitter****ron.lin@latimes.com****Follow @ronlin on\nTwitter****ALSO****Plaschke: This is a big rookie mistake for D'Angelo\nRussell****Pregnant woman's death spurs a safety debate about China's street\nfences****Apple wants the FBI to reveal how it hacked the San Bernardino\nkiller's iPhone**\n\n","title":"Head of L.A.

Analysts expect the epic superhero battle will\ngenerate $60 million to $65 million in box-office revenue from the U.S. and\nCanada this Friday through Sunday. That would represent a decline of roughly\n60% or more from its debut.Major franchise films tend to post steep drops in\ntheir second weekends, partly because most hard-core fans flock to theaters\nwhen movies first debut.Last year's hit \"Furious 7\" and 2012's \"The Dark\nKnight Rises\" both dropped about 60% week-to-week. \"Batman v Superman\" could\nbe weighed down by a less-than-stellar audience response, indicated by its\naverage \"B\" grade from exit polling firm CinemaScore.Warner Bros. is counting\non continued robust overseas sales. The movie has grossed a global total of\n$435 million so far, with $181 million of that coming from the U.S. and Canada\nmarket. \"Batman v Superman\" cost $250 million to make and is intended to set\nthe stage for a series of future movies based on DC Comics characters to\ncompete with Disney's Marvel Studios. Upcoming DC films include \"Suicide\nSquad,\" \"Wonder Woman,\" \"Justice League\" and \"Aquaman.\"Nothing else at the box\noffice is expected to give the caped crusaders much of a fight.\"God's Not Dead\n2,\" the sequel to the 2014 indie Christian hit from Pure Flix Entertainment,\nis estimated to gross $8 million to $12 million in domestic ticket sales,\naccording to people who have reviewed pre-release audience surveys. That would\nbe a solid result for the low-budget picture and provide further evidence of\nthe market for faith-based movies.The original \"God's Not Dead\" opened with $9\nmillion and ended up with $60.7 million in sales — a profitable result for a\npicture that cost just $2 million to make.The horror spoof \"Meet the Blacks\"\nis getting a mid-level release this weekend targeting African American\nmoviegoers. The low-budget parody of \"The Purge,\" starring Mike Epps and\ndirected by Deon Taylor, is expected to take in $5 million or less from its\ndebut in about 1,000 theaters.Say what you will about \"Batman v Superman: Dawn\nof Justice\" (and people have said plenty), at 2 hours and a 33 minutes —\npacking in three of the comic-book realm's biggest icons, a psychotic\nsupervillain, a giant alien monster and more plot threads than you can shake a\nkryptonite-tipped spear...Say what you will about \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of\nJustice\" (and people have said plenty), at 2 hours and a 33 minutes — packing\nin three of the comic-book realm's biggest icons, a psychotic supervillain, a\ngiant alien monster and more plot threads than you can shake a kryptonite-\ntipped spear...In limited release, the well-reviewed Warner Bros. science\nfiction tale \"Midnight Special\" will try to expand its audience after earning\n$374,000 from five theaters.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5f6"},"content":" _This__ article was originally published in 2009. The property is now up for\nsale._It's a murder mystery that has puzzled a Los Feliz neighborhood since\n1959.The criminal-case part was solved quickly enough. Homicide investigators\nfound that Dr. Harold Perelson bludgeoned his wife to death with a ball-peen\nhammer, savagely beat their 18-year-old daughter and then fatally poisoned\nhimself by gulping a glass of acid.Authorities removed two other children from\nthe sprawling hillside estate that overlooks downtown Los Angeles, locked the\nfront door to the 5,050-square-foot mansion, and left.Fifty years later, the\nGlendower Place home remains empty.The estate's terraced grounds are\npockmarked by gopher holes and overgrown with grass that sprouted after recent\nrains -- growth that neighbors know will turn brown when summer returns. A\npond is partly filled with rainwater. Weeds poke through cracks in a curving\nasphalt driveway.On the outside, the mansion itself appears to be slowly\ndecaying.Through grimy, cracked windows, one can see dust-covered furniture,\nincluding a 1950s-style television set, seemingly frozen in time. What appear\nto be gaily wrapped Christmas gifts sit on a table.And in the hills near the\nGreek Theatre, the questions linger:Why has the current owner kept the home as\nit was on Dec. 6, 1959? Will another family ever again bring life to the\nestate once described in a sales ad as \"beautiful\" and \"delightful\"?Built in\n1925, the three-story Spanish revival-style home has a basement that boasts a\nmaid's quarters. The first floor features an entrance hall flanked by a\nglassed-in conservatory and large living room. Toward the back is a den, a\ndining room and the kitchen.Four master-bedroom-size sleeping chambers are on\nthe second floor. A bar-equipped ballroom measuring 20 feet by 36 feet is on\nthe third level.Real estate experts have suggested that the mansion, with its\nspectacular view of the Los Angeles Basin and the Palos Verdes Peninsula,\ncould fetch as much as $2.9 million if sold.\"No one has lived there since the\nmurders,\" said Dr. Cheri Lewis, who grew up across the street from the mansion\nand still lives in the neighborhood.Lewis vividly remembers the predawn\nmorning when Perelson, 50, killed his 42-year-old wife, Lillian, and severely\nbeat his teenage daughter.When two younger children were awakened by the\nvictims' screams, Perelson told them they were simply having a bad dream, his\nyoungest daughter told police. \"Go back to bed. This is a nightmare,\" he told\n11-year-old Debbie. She and her 13-year-old brother, Joel, escaped injury\n.Eighteen-year-old Judye Perelson ran from the mansion and staggered to a\nneighbor's house. She was treated at Central Receiving Hospital and then taken\nto General Hospital with a possible skull fracture, The Times would report the\nnext day.\"Judye came to our door. I remember having my hand in her blood,\"\nrecalls Lewis, now a Beverly Hills dentist.\"I used to baby-sit the children\nthere. I was supposed to spend the next night there, in fact.\"Police found\nPerelson lying dead on the floor next to his wife's blood-soaked bed. He was\nstill clutching the hammer. On a nightstand next to his bed, investigators\nfound an open copy of Dante's \"Divine Comedy,\" which was opened to Canto\n1.\"Midway upon the journey of our life I found myself within a forest dark,\nfor the straightforward pathway had been lost . . . ,\" read the\npassage.Detectives speculated that Perelson, a physician affiliated with an\nInglewood medical clinic, was distressed by financial difficulties.In Judye\nPerelson's sports car, police found a note written to an aunt that told of the\nfamily being \"on the merry-go-round again, same problems, same worries, only\ntenfold. My parents, so to speak, are in a bind financially.\" The teenager\nspoke of getting a job to help the family out.After the rampage, relatives\ntook the younger Perelson children to the East Coast, Lewis said. The current\nwhereabouts of the three are unknown.The story of the murder-suicide and the\nlocked-up mansion has been told and retold ever since, each time a newcomer\nmoves into the neighborhood or when visitors come upon it.House painter Steve\nKalupski was puzzled one summer day eight years ago when he glanced over at\nthe mansion from a neighboring dwelling where he was working. Through a grimy\nwindow, he said he could see gifts piled next to what in the dimness appeared\nto be a Christmas tree.\"I asked the owner of the home where we were working\nwhy it was there, and she told me the story,\" said Kalupski, a Hollywood\nresident who now is an ad agency producer.His friends didn't believe him when\nhe told them what he'd seen. So he began a ritual of driving them to the Los\nFeliz hillside to show them the abandoned mansion. He took Hollywood Internet\nentrepreneur Babette Papaj there two months ago. \"It was dark and scary. I was\nafraid to get out of the car,\" she said.Neighboring Glendower Place resident\nSheree Waterson said a friend of hers tried one night to check out the mansion\nin what she describes as \"a Nancy Drew moment.\"The woman pushed open a rear\ndoor and walked in, but she didn't get far before a burglar alarm went off.\nShe turned around and left, joking later about \"ghosts\" when she returned to\nWaterson's home. Soon, her hand was throbbing painfully.\"She'd been bitten by\na black widow. There was a red vein going up her arm. She had to go to the\ndoctor,\" said Waterson, a clothing company executive.\"Two nights later the\nalarm kept going off at my house on my back door. But there was no one there.\nIt was like the ghost was following us.\"A year after the murders, in 1960, the\nmansion was sold in a probate action to a Lincoln Heights couple, Emily and\nJulian Enriquez. Neighbors remember that the pair visited the house and\nbrought property there to store but didn't move in.In time, the place\ngradually fell into disrepair. Antique light fixtures dating from the 1920s\ndisappeared from the outside.Over the years, neighbors say they have helped\nmaintain the property by painting a street-side garage and tidying up the\nfrontyard. They placed a chain across a driveway that leads to the rear of the\nmansion, giving each nearby resident a key to its lock.Several years ago the\ncity required current owner Rudy Enriquez to replace stucco that had peeled\nfrom the sides of the house and front walkway walls and to repaint the place,\nneighbors say.\"We had major problems.,\" explained Jude Margolis, a former\nneighborhood resident who now lives in Hancock Park.\"Hookers were coming in.\nEverybody was bringing guests up there. One night I was sitting outside and I\nnoticed that people were over there having a picnic in the backyard,\" said\nMargolis, an artist. (The burglar alarm was installed after that.)Enriquez\ninherited the mansion when his mother died in 1994. Since then, he has been\napproached many times by potential buyers but has steadfastly refused to sell.\nHe tells everyone he hasn't decided what he wants to do with the property.\"I\nasked him why not lease it, at least. You can't have a house sit empty for 50\nyears and not expect it to fall apart. It's a tear-down now. It's a shame,\"\nMargolis said.Enriquez never invited her into the mansion when he visited it.\nAnother neighbor, Steven Hurley, has never been inside, either.\"There are all\nkinds of stories about the house. Rudy's a very nice man. He's just not\ninterested in doing anything with that house. He's never going to sell it,\"\nsaid Hurley, a lighting company sales manager.Enriquez, a 77-year-old retired\nmusic store manager who lives in the Mount Washington area, said he remains\nuncertain about his plans. \"I don't know that I want to live there or even\nstay here,\" he said. He might relocate to Hawaii or Arizona, he added.But it\nhas nothing to do with the mansion's violent past.\"I've never looked at it as\nbeing haunted,\" he said. \"For a time I had two cats inside there and I had to\ngo often to feed them. I still go there often -- I was there last night, in\nfact. I think now I'll be going more often.\"The only spooky thing there is me.\nTell people to say their prayers every morning and evening and they'll be\nOK.\"_bob.pool@latimes.com__Times researcher Robin Mayper contributed to this\nstory._\n\n","title":"On a Los Feliz hill, murder -- then mystery - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Mysterious, abandoned mansion of gruesome murder-suicide in L.A. is up for sale.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc5f7"},"content":"A faulty light fixture that electrified a family's Palm Springs swimming pool\nprobably caused the death of a father who dived into the water to save his\nunconscious daughter, authorities said Wednesday.James Tramel, a 43-year-old\nexecutive at RevJet marketing in Silicon Valley, jumped into the pool on\nEaster Sunday when he saw that his 9-year-old daughter had sunk to the bottom\nand was not moving, according to Palm Springs police Sgt. William\nHutchinson.“I think most people, your first instinct is to dive in and rescue\nyour child. I think a lot of people unfortunately would have taken that\nroute,” Hutchinson said. “He may not have known … what was going on.”\nAccording to a preliminary investigation into Sunday’s incident, a light\nfixture in the pool was missing screws and may have had some kind of power\nsurge, electrifying the water, Hutchinson said.Those nearest to the fixture —\nTramel's 9- and 10-year-old daughters and Tramel himself — suffered the most\nserious effects from the malfunction. Others who were using the pool, Tramel’s\nwife, a 6-year-old boy and two other girls, ages 6 and 8, were treated at the\nscene.Tramel lost consciousness as soon as he entered the water and died later\nat a hospital, authorities said. His younger daughter remains in critical\ncondition, while the 10-year-old girl remains in stable condition, Hutchinson\nsaid.“It’s just all over tragic,” Hutchinson said. “It was just a sad\nexperience for everybody.”Hutchinson said that that if a person suspects that\na pool has become electrified, they should shut off the electrical circuit\nbreaker to the pool's lighting and pump systems.A GoFundMe page has been\nestablished in Tramel’s memory by RevJet Chief Executive Mitchell Weisman to\nhelp fund Tramel’s children's education or nonprofits of the family’s\nchoice.Tramel was vice president of sales for the West Coast of RevJet,\naccording to his LinkedIn page.Authorities say the accident occurred at the\nfamily's second home. Their principal residence is in Burlingame, south of San\nFrancisco.The incident remains under investigation.“Obviously at this point,\nwe think it’s completely accidental,”  Hutchinson said.In addition to\nshattering Tramel's family, the freak accident left emergency workers\nshaken.“I have a pool. I got to tell you, it scared the heck out of me,\" said\nHutchinson, who is also a father. \"Thinking about that pool, I went home and\nscheduled a contractor.”**MORE: Get our best stories in your Facebook feed\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;****For breaking California news, follow\n@JosephSerna.****ALSO****Former Los Angeles City Councilman Bill Rosendahl\ndies at 70****LAFD engine driver suffers medical emergency and crashes,\nstriking cars and power poles****Former USC President Steven B.

The patient who acquired a new kidney 30 years after contracting\nHIV is already home from the hospital, she said.Despite their slovenly habits\nin agricultural settings, pigs raised in biomedical labs are clean enough that\nmany humans would welcome —indeed, do welcome — the use of their tissue for\nlife-saving transplants.

Transplanted heart valves routinely come from pigs as well as\ncows.But the dream of...The second patient, who has been HIV-positive for 25\nyears, remains in the hospital, Durand reported. But that patient’s new liver,\nwhich replaces one that failed after complications from a hepatitis C\ninfection, is “functioning extremely well,” she added.“We’re encouraged by\nthese first transplants,” Durand said.Alexandra K. Glazier, chief executive of\nthe New England Organ Bank, which facilitated the organ donation, praised the\n“remarkable family who saw beyond their own loss” and agreed to the gift. The\nfamily declined to identify the organ donor but described her as “a daughter,\na mother, an auntie, best friend and sister” who “was able to leave this world\nhelping the underdogs she fought so hard for.”Under the HOPE Act, only\ntransplant recipients who are HIV-positive are eligible to receive organs from\nHIV-positive donors. Still, the change is expected to make hundreds and\npotentially thousands of transplantable organs available each year to HIV-\ninfected people with end-stage diseases of the kidneys, heart, liver or\nlungs.While the Hopkins surgeries involved the use of organs from a dead\ndonor, experts expect that living HIV-positive donors soon will step forward\nto offer a kidney for transplantation. Dr. Segev said that many HIV-infected\ndonors are likely healthy enough to donate an organ without great risk to\ntheir health. Research protocols for the care of living HIV-positive donors,\nhe added, will be drafted “over the next few months.”In the meantime, Segev\nurged those living with HIV to make clear to families and loved ones their\nwillingness to become post-mortem organ donors.As other transplant centers\njoin Johns Hopkins in performing the procedures, the practice promises to\nshorten the line for all who await the call that a donor organ has become\navailable.There are 121,220 patients on the Organ Procurement and\nTransplantation Network’s waiting list, and a name is added, on average, every\n10 minutes. Each day, an average of 22 patients die waiting for an organ.Of\nthe close to 31,000 organ transplants performed annually in the United States,\nthose involving organs from HIV-infected donors will remain a small minority.\nExperts estimate that each year, 500 to 600 HIV-positive people will die under\ncircumstances that would make their organs available for transplant. As more\nHIV-infected patients on the waiting list receive organs, uninfected patients\nalso will move up in line.Segev predicted Wednesday that “as we get the word\nout, we’ll have more and more donors become available,” easing the shortage of\norgans. Prospective transplant patients living with HIV could elect to\nconsider an HIV-positive organ and might find they get transplanted faster, he\nsaid Wednesday. Or they could continue waiting for an uninfected organ to\nbecome available.Dr. David Klassen, chief medical officer of the United\nNetwork for Organ Sharing, said that key questions remain about the new\ngeneration of transplants, which are conducted under rules that treat them as\nresearch procedures. Among those are whether organs from HIV-positive donors\nwill be as resilient as organs that have come from uninfected donors.Klassen\nalso said that in matching donors and recipients, physicians will have the\nadded challenge of trying to ensure that an HIV-infected recipient does not\nget an organ from a donor infected with a more aggressive strain of the human\nimmunodeficiency virus. In most cases, he said, that fit can be assumed if\nboth recipient and donor have taken the same anti-viral medications and done\nwell on them.But in cases in which a donor’s HIV infection is diagnosed at the\ntime of his or her death, ensuring that match may not be possible, Klassen\nsaid.Still, Klassen emphasized that the new procedures underscore how\ndramatically the prognosis for HIV-positive patients has changed.“Certainly\nfor years, when HIV first came on the scene, it was a fatal illness: Everybody\nthat got it died,” he said. HIV-positive patients were not likely to get\nlisted on the wait list because their prognoses were poor, and the thought of\nusing HIV-infected organs would have been unthinkable, he said. With the\nsuccess of anti-viral cocktails in treating HIV-infected people, “patients\nreally have good prospects for long-term survival,” Klassen said.“All these\nchanges in transplantation are completely dependent” on those changes, he\nsaid. HIV-positive patients, who are at a higher risk of developing kidney\nfailure because of the disease, have long been eligible to stand in line for\ntransplanted organs alongside uninfected patients.And at major transplantation\ncenters, surgeons have substantial experience in performing surgeries on HIV-\ninfected patients. Between 2005 and 2015, surgeons in the U.S. transplanted\ndonated organs into at least 1,376 HIV-positive patients. Centers where those\nprocedures have been performed will be the first to gain approval for\ntransferring organs from HIV-positive donors to HIV-positive recipients.While\nJohns Hopkins is the first transplant center to perform the experimental\nprocedure, two others — Hahnemann University Hospital in Philadelphia and Mt.\nSinai Hospital in New York — also have applied to perform such procedures as\ndonor organs become available.Segev called the surgeries, which took place a\nfew weeks ago, “really only the beginning.” In a bid to improve patients’\noutcomes, Johns Hopkins and 29 other hospitals will form a consortium to share\ntheir experience with these surgeries and others in which patients with HIV\nreceived uninfected organs.The post-surgical treatment protocols for\ntransplant patients living with HIV — including a lifelong regimen of\nimmunosuppressive drugs — are a particular concern. But Durand said the record\nof success has been good.“With careful selection and careful monitoring, this\nis a very safe and effective procedure for those with HIV,” Durand said\nWednesday.As of late Tuesday, five HIV-positive transplant candidates were\nlisted at approved centers for HIV-positive organs, according to UNOS\nspokeswoman Anne Paschke. Four were awaiting a kidney, and one awaits a\ndonated liver, she said.**\\------------****FOR THE RECORD****March 30, 1:29\np.m.:** An earlier version of this article misspelled the last name of UNOS\nspokeswoman Anne Paschke as Plaschke.**\\------------**  **Follow me on Twitter\n@LATMelissaHealy and \"like\" Los Angeles Times Science \u0026amp; Health on\nFacebook.****ALSO****Scientists are sending fungi into space in the hope of\ndeveloping new medicines****To maximize speed-dating success, uncross those\narms and take up space****Yosemite's granite cliffs are 'breathing,' and heat\ncan make them fall**\n\n","title":"In a first, liver and kidney from HIV-infected donor are transplanted into HIV-positive patients - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"In a medical first, HIV-infected organs are transplanted into HIV-positive patients https://t.co/kxXKF78E06 https://t.co/xaI9nLyaG0","date":"Wed Mar 30 17:14:44 +0000 2016","favs":37,"id":{"$numberLong":"715225759942631424"},"retweets":48},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1UCGY10"}

When it finally was made public\nand a prosecutor announced the officers wouldn't be charged, they were\nenraged.Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman on Wednesday cleared the\nofficers, saying forensic evidence backed their account that 24-year-old Jamar\nClark was not handcuffed and was struggling for an officer's gun when he was\nshot. Clark ignored warnings to take his hand off Officer Mark Ringgenberg's\ngun, leading Officer Mark Schwarze to shoot Clark as the officers feared for\ntheir lives, Freeman said.“Ringgenberg communicated to Schwarze that Clark had\nhis firearm and that Schwarze should shoot Clark. Schwarze did. His actions\nwere reasonable given both his observations and Ringgenberg's plea,” the\nprosecutor said.James Clark, right, the father of Jamar Clark, at a news\nconference March 17 in Minneapolis.James Clark, right, the father of Jamar\nClark, at a news conference March 17 in Minneapolis.But Freeman's detailed\nversion of the events early on Nov. 15, and his release of the investigative\ndocuments, drew derision even at the news conference from activists who\naccused him of favoring police over the accounts of bystanders who said Clark\nwas handcuffed when he was shot. Several of the critics were among those who\nmaintained a protest encampment outside a police station for 18 days and led\nmarches and largely peaceful protests across the Twin Cities area after the\nshooting.“If we cannot find justice here, we will find it in the streets,”\nMica Grimm, an organizer with Black Lives Matter Minneapolis, told reporters\nafter Freeman's announcement.Nekima Levy-Pounds, president of the Minneapolis\nNAACP, vowed to keep pressure on police.“We're going to take to the streets.\nAnd we're going to fight until we get what we came for,” Levy-Pounds said.Aryn\nSeymour, 3, with her mother, Alexandria Lane, at a rally of about 40 people\nFeb. 12 in Minneapolis.Aryn Seymour, 3, with her mother, Alexandria Lane, at a\nrally of about 40 people Feb. 12 in Minneapolis.Protesters gathered Wednesday\nevening at the site where Clark was shot in north Minneapolis while others met\nat a park on the southern edge of downtown. The two groups met at the Hennepin\nCounty Government Center, where Freeman made his announcement earlier in the\nday, and the mixed-race crowd swelled into the hundreds. Several speakers\naddressed the group, which chanted and carried signs that said “Justice for\nJamar” and “Black Lives Matter.” The crowd remained peaceful and its numbers\ndwindled as the night went on.The question of whether Clark was handcuffed by\nthe officers, who were responding to a report that he had assaulted his\ngirlfriend and was interfering with paramedics, was central in the\ncase.Freeman said 20 civilian witnesses gave different versions of whether\nClark was handcuffed. Two said he wasn't, six weren't sure and 12 said he was,\nbut they disagreed on whether both his hands were cuffed and whether his hands\nwere in front of him or behind his back. Freeman said none of the 10\nparamedics and police witnesses who saw Clark right after the shooting saw him\nin handcuffs.With conflicting accounts, Freeman said he relied on forensic\nevidence, including physical examinations that found no injuries or markings\non Clark's wrists that would have been consistent with handcuffs.Hundreds of\npeople protested Nov. 16 in Minneapolis after Jamar Clark's death.Hundreds of\npeople protested Nov. 16 in Minneapolis after Jamar Clark's death.In an\ninterview later with KSTP-TV, Freeman said activists who criticized his\ndecision were speaking out of frustration. He again cited what he called\n“hardcore forensic evidence,” noting Clark's DNA was found on the butt of\nRinggenberg's gun and all over his utility belt, supporting their account of a\nstruggle.The release of videos investigators had gathered was a key demand of\nthe protesters last fall. However, only videos taken from the back of the\nambulance showed much of the incident. Clark can be seen standing outside the\nambulance. In the key segment, Ringgenberg can be seen in the top left corner\ntaking Clark down to the ground. The shooting itself happened just off camera,\nbut the officer can be seen getting up afterward and straightening his\nbelt.“That was murder,” Levy-Pounds exclaimed as she watched the video for the\nfirst time.Mayor Betsy Hodges, Police Chief Janee Harteau, and Lt. Bob Kroll,\nhead of the police officers' union, all praised the thoroughness and\ntransparency of the investigation. Freeman made the charging decision himself\nafter initially planning to rely on a nonpublic grand jury process, and he\nposted more than 1,000 pages of investigative materials, videos and other\nevidence on his website.“We now expect all members of the public to peacefully\naccept the process and outcome that exonerated officers Mark Ringgenberg and\nDustin Schwarze,” Kroll said. “ I would ask the residents of Minneapolis to\npause and reflect how we can move forward in a peaceful manner.”A federal\ninvestigation is still pending into whether police violated Clark's civil\nrights through excessive force.

He was 70.Rosendahl\ndied early Wednesday morning at his home in Mar Vista, surrounded by friends\nand family, after a four-year battle with cancer, according to a statement by\nDavid Graham-Caso, communications director for City Councilman Mike\nBonin.Rosendahl was diagnosed in 2012 with cancer of the ureter, the tube that\nconnects the kidney to the bladder. The disease went into remission in 2013,\nbut it reappeared in 2014.His loved ones were told by doctors in January that\nRosendahl could pass away \"any day,” Graham-Caso said, so for the last three\nmonths, they have been visiting his home, holding something of “an amazing\nliving wake.\"Rosendahl is survived by his longtime partner, book publisher\nHedi El Kholti.His funeral will probably be held at St. Monica Catholic Church\nin Santa Monica.U.S. Rep. Janice Hahn (D-San Pedro), who served with Rosendahl\non the City Council for several years, expressed heartbreak over his\npassing.\"Bill was one of the most selfless and kind-hearted individuals I have\never known,\" she said. \"That heart made him an incredible advocate and a\nbeloved champion for the people he represented. He was brave in the face of\nadversity and had a contagious passion for life.\"A gregarious force at City\nHall who advocated for the homeless, gays and lesbians and other liberal\ncauses, Rosendahl in his later years became a vocal proponent of medical\nmarijuana, which he grew and used to help treat pain from his cancer.In the\nbuttoned-up world of politics, he was an opinionated eccentric, once donning\nan Army hat in City Council chambers to denounce the wars in Iraq and\nAfghanistan. He was known around town for sharing cartons of eggs produced by\nthe hens he kept in the backyard of his Mar Vista home.“He saw the absolute\ndignity in everybody, whether it was a billionaire that he represented in\nBrentwood or someone who was living on the streets,” said Bonin, who served\neight years as Rosendahl’s chief of staff.Elected in 2005 from a wealthy\nWestside district that stretches from Westchester to Pacific Palisades, the\nlifelong Democrat held his inauguration ceremony on the Venice Boardwalk with\na rabbi, a priest and a shaman present. Guests were serenaded by the Venice\nDrum Circle.Born May 15, 1945, to German Catholic immigrants who fled Europe\nduring Adolf Hitler's rise to power, Rosendahl and his seven siblings grew up\nin Englewood, N.J.As a teen, he became involved in the civil rights movement,\nand he said he was on the Washington Mall in 1963 to hear the Rev. Martin\nLuther King Jr. deliver his “I Have A Dream” speech.It was not the only time\nRosendahl would have a front-row seat to history. An organizer on Robert F.\nKennedy's presidential campaign, he later described being at the Ambassador\nHotel in Los Angeles in 1968 the night Kennedy was assassinated. As a\ncouncilman, Rosendahl helped turn the hotel site into a public school complex\nnamed after Kennedy.After a stint in the Army counseling soldiers returning\nfrom the Vietnam War and a job on George McGovern's presidential campaign,\nRosendahl took off for 18 months, traveling through Europe, the Middle East,\nAfrica and South America.**\\-------------****For the record****1:56 p.m.: **An\nearlier version of this article reported that Bill Rosendahl worked on the\npresidential campaign of Eugene McCarthy before embarking on a trip around the\nworld.

He said he was conflicted\nabout his sexuality because of attitudes toward gays and lesbians in the\nCatholic Church.After his mother’s death in the 1970s, he came out to the rest\nof his family and moved to San Francisco, where the gay rights movement was\ngaining momentum. A few years later he moved to Los Angeles, settling in\nVenice Beach.Rosendahl got a job as an executive at cable television provider\nAdelphia Communications Corp. Along with his managerial duties, he hosted a\npublic affairs shows that featured interviews with local and national\npoliticians. After leaving the company, he decided to make his own run for\npolitics.On the Los Angeles City Council, he opposed the large-scale expansion\nof L.A. International Airport and pushed for more public transit to ease\ntraffic on congested Westside streets. He also spoke out on issues beyond the\ncity, publicly criticizing former President Clinton for not doing enough for\ngays and faulting President Obama for not ending all wars overseas.Rosendahl\nopted not to run for a third term after his cancer diagnosis in 2012.

I think that’s the big headline:\nThe Lyons family comes back together initially to vanquish their enemies, to\ntake their company back while always and forever competing with one another\nfor all the same things. So, there are shifting allegiances in the context of\nall that, but it’s very much about the love and the treachery among these wild\nand crazy people.**What were some of the narrative arc concerns you had this\nseason?**We’ve started a couple of stories that we’ve been looking forward to\nplaying through. The story of Lucius losing his company and coming back hard\nand reconnecting with his gangster past in the course of that has been a big\nstory for us and the repercussions that it has on his children and on Cookie.\nThe way that Cookie and Lucius reconnect in the course of that is one of the\nloveliest and most exciting things to me. I think you saw it in our midseason\nfinale -- that last scene between Lucius and Cookie just brings back the\nconnection between them, that connection that never goes away.

I’ve learned over the years that\nthose scenes really emerge on set and the actors have a lot to do with them,\nand the directors, and the stunt coordinators. I prefer not to say, “then she\npulled her ear,” because it never happens that way. You spend all your energy\nas a writer writing and imagining the moments and then the actor will say,\n“I’m not pulling her ear.” But I will say that fight in Episode 10, it didn’t\nall wind up in the cut. Lee Daniels came into the room while we were breaking\nthat scene and he was like, “Oh, I know exactly how this fight is going to\nplay out.” He pitched out every single second of it. “She spits!

How did that process go?**We selected the “Empire”\nartist. We finished shooting the season. That artist was selected by our\nexecutive producers. The artist that was chosen gets a very big feature spot\non “Empire” in our second-to-the-last episode. It was surprisingly successful.\nIt didn’t take a lot of our time and effort. And because music is such a big\npart of our show, our obligation was simply to make sure that the artist that\nwon was featured in some small way. But we wound up really liking the work and\nthey felt like “Empire” and we gave them a much bigger spot than we were\nobliged to give them.**The show definitely knows how to get heads turning with\nits guest spots.

But the last half of the\nseason is much more about the family. Frankly, we’re not having as many guest\nstars. We’re concentrating on telling our stories. That’s not to say there\naren’t some amazing actors coming to the second half of the season, but\nthey’re all there in service of the story. There wasn’t a single instance in\nwhich I was told, “Hey, so-and-so wants to be on the show, find a way to get\nthem in,\" and I had to jump through hoops and break my back trying to\naccommodate a story line. We simply cast all of the characters that we wrote\nwith amazing actors. I’m not going tell you who all of them are because it\nwould amount to spoilers.**The show got very political with a number of nods\nto the Black Lives Matter movement. In what ways will that continue, if at\nall? Any chances of digs at Donald Trump or other presidential candidates?** I\ndon’t think we reference any of the presidential candidates in the latter half\nof the season. The show is political by its nature. Our characters have\npolitical points of view. Their lives are political. They know people in high\nplaces and there’s no question the show will continue to traffic in those\nthemes because it’s natural to the show and fun and it’s what gets us all on\nfire.** The show has spawned a number of \"Empire\"-branded ventures --\nclothing lines, soundtracks, etc. What's the status of an \"Empire\" tour?**  \nWe’re talking about it. I’m not sure exactly what form it will take because\nthere’s some really exciting ideas in the mix.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc601"},"content":"In a last-ditch effort to strike a deal before the start of the new baseball\nseason, Time Warner Cable has once again sweetened an offer to other pay-TV\nproviders in hopes of winning wider carriage for the Dodgers' TV channel in\nSouthern California.But there still are no takers — increasing the likelihood\nthat Monday will mark the start of a third season without an end to the bitter\nstalemate over distribution of SportsNet LA, the television channel owned by\nthe Los Angeles Dodgers.The two-year dispute highlights the changing economics\nof cable television. Pay-TV operators are determined to hold the line on\nrising programming costs in an effort to retain their customers. They are\nworried that loading up expensive sports channels will drive up monthly bills\nand encourage more customers to cut the cable cord.Squeezed out are Dodger\nfans irritated by the prospect of missing Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin\nScully's final season in the Dodgers' broadcast booth.“This situation is so\nmaddening,” said Bill Waxman, 65, of Simi Valley, who has followed the Dodgers\nfor decades but gets his TV service from AT\u0026amp;T, which does not carry the\nchannel. Waxman said he has written letters to the Dodgers owners — including\nMagic Johnson — the commissioner of Major League Baseball and even the head of\nthe Federal Communications Commission, to no avail.“For years, the Dodgers\nwere the team in our living room. They were the soundtrack of our summers,”\nWaxman said. “We get to see the Angels, the Lakers, the Clippers and the\nKings, but we can't watch the Dodgers.”Customers in about 1.8 million homes in\nthe Los Angeles region that receive TV service from Time Warner Cable and\nCharter Communications have the channel in their lineups. But there are an\nadditional 3 million homes in the metropolitan Los Angeles area without\nSportsNet LA. Some customers, like Waxman, are not interested in switching\nproviders because they like their current bundles of TV and Internet\nservice.Is Vin Scully — and a big discount from Time Warner Cable — enough to\nstop the Dodgers television blackout from entering a third straight\nseason?Don't bet on it.As The Times reported Tuesday, Time Warner Cable is\ncutting its asking price for SportsNet LA — which telecasts Dodger games — by\n30%...Is Vin Scully — and a big discount from Time Warner Cable — enough to\nstop the Dodgers television blackout from entering a third straight\nseason?Don't bet on it.As The Times reported Tuesday, Time Warner Cable is\ncutting its asking price for SportsNet LA — which telecasts Dodger games — by\n30%...Time Warner Cable confirmed Tuesday that it has proposed a new deal —\nits second offer in a week — to try to coax AT\u0026amp;T, which now owns the\nsatellite service DirecTV, as well as Cox Communications and other pay-TV\nproviders back to the bargaining table.Last week, Time Warner Cable\nacknowledged that it had cut the price of Sports-  \nNet LA by 30% for one year to try to end the impasse. But pay-TV providers\nbalked, saying the price of the channel — offered this year for about $3.50 a\nmonth, per customer home — was still too high.In 2015, the company charged an\naverage of $4.90 a month per subscriber home, according to consulting firm SNL\nKagan.Pay-TV operators privately acknowledged that they were wary of signing a\none-year deal with Time Warner Cable. They worried that the price of the\nchannel would soar within a couple of years so that Time Warner Cable could\nrecoup some of the costs of its expensive arrangement with the Dodgers'\nowners.Time Warner Cable now is offering a six-year deal. The first year would\nbe offered at the lower $3.50-a-month introductory price, with a slightly\nhigher rate in subsequent years, according to one person familiar with the\nproposal who asked not to be identified discussing sensitive deal points.Time\nWarner Cable declined to discuss details of its latest offer. “We have, in\nfact, extended another offer to AT\u0026amp;T/DirecTV that is longer than one\nyear,” said Maureen Huff, a Time Warner Cable spokeswoman. She declined to\nelaborate.There are several reasons the other pay-TV providers continue to\nrefuse to play ball. One is that Time Warner Cable is in the process of being\nacquired by another firm, Charter Communications, and some providers are\nwaiting to see whether Charter offers the channel at an even lower rate.Even\nwith the price cut, SportsNet LA remains one of the highest-priced TV channels\nin the nation.Pay-TV executives also noted that the value of the channel\ncontinues to diminish because the most ardent Dodger fans already have\nswitched to a provider that carries the channel. The customers who remain have\nnot been as bothered by the blackout, making these executives less motivated\nto spend a lot of money for SportsNet LA.“We know that the Dodgers are popular\nsports programming for select customers, but that programming comes at an\nextremely high price for all customers,” said Cox Communications, which\nprovides service in Palos Verdes, Santa Barbara and parts of Orange and San\nDiego counties. “We will continue to work with Time Warner Cable-SportsNet LA\nto fight on behalf of all our customers, not just sports/Dodgers fans.”Another\nreason for the reticence is that several pay-TV operators experienced buyer's\nremorse after they agreed in 2012 to carry Time Warner Cable SportsNet, which\nbroadcasts Los Angeles Lakers games. That channel is offered for about $4 a\nmonth, per subscriber home, according to SNL Kagan.Mayor Eric Garcetti spoke\nout Tuesday night on Time Warner Cable's efforts to end the standoff over\ndistribution of the sports channel owned by the Los Angeles Dodgers.Time\nWarner Cable said late Tuesday that it had cut by 30% the price of the sports\nchannel offered to DirecTV and other pay-TV...Mayor Eric Garcetti spoke out\nTuesday night on Time Warner Cable's efforts to end the standoff over\ndistribution of the sports channel owned by the Los Angeles Dodgers.Time\nWarner Cable said late Tuesday that it had cut by 30% the price of the sports\nchannel offered to DirecTV and other pay-TV...Time Warner Cable launched that\nnetwork, and then the Lakers fell apart. TV ratings for games sank, and\nDirecTV and other pay-TV operators do not want to get stuck with two costly\nsports channels that draw small audiences.Some fans blame the Dodgers\norganization as much as Time Warner Cable for the situation.“It is a truly\npathetic gesture by the Dodgers, a real slap in the face to fans who have\nfollowed the team for years and years,” said Kevin Holmes, 63, who lives in\nLake Arrowhead. His provider, Dish Network, does not carry the channel. “There\nis no such thing as loyalty anymore.”There is one wild card in the dispute.\nLater this week, Frontier Communications will take over Verizon FiOS systems\nin three states, including California. That company plans to review its\nofferings and might make some adjustments.“We will evaluate the channel\nlineups and other products and services that we would like to provide our new\ncustomers,” said Steven C. Crosby, a Frontier spokesman. “But we don't plan on\nmaking any changes right now.”Time Warner Cable's sweetened offer for\nSportsNet LA was designed to entice DirecTV, in particular. Under the deal,\nSportsNet LA would be offered in the second and subsequent years at roughly\nthe same price that DirecTV sells a channel that it owns in the Seattle\nmarket, according to the knowledgeable person.DirecTV owns the Root Sports\nNorthwest channel, which provides coverage of the Seattle Mariners and two\nsoccer teams. This year, pay-TV operators pay an average cost of $3.84 a month\nper subscriber home for that channel, according to SNL Kagan.AT\u0026amp;T declined\nto comment Tuesday.The L.A. area is not the only market where a dispute over\ndistribution of a regional sports network is raging.

Pat\nMcCrory...Religious conservatives still play a major role in American\npolitics, with evangelical Christians holding steady over the last decade or\nso at just over a quarter of the U.S. adult population. In Georgia, that\nfigure is 38%, according to the Pew Research Center.Their power was on display\nwhen the Georgia Legislature approved the bill this month. Only 10 of 157\nRepublican lawmakers voted against it.But as major corporations began their\nprotest and entertainment industry powerhouses threatened to stop film\nproduction in Georgia if the bill was signed into law, moderate conservatives\nbegan to fear that the legislation could cost the state billions of\ndollars.Only California and New York have more television and movie production\nthan Georgia, which has lured Hollywood with tax breaks and cheap labor\ncosts.The governor said he could see no compelling need for the bill.

Nathan Deal's decision Monday to veto\ncontroversial legislation that looked to expand individuals' and business'\nrights to deny services to those whose way of life conflicts with their\nreligious beliefs.The stakes were high for Georgia....The bill would have\nensured that a pastor could not be forced to perform a same-sex wedding and\nthat nonprofit faith-based organizations could legally refuse to rent or lease\nproperty for events they found objectionable. It also would have given such\ngroups the right to fire or not hire people whose practices they opposed on\nreligious grounds.Though critics pounced on the bill as discriminatory, its\nproponents said they merely wanted to provide people of religious faith with\nmodest protection from mounting pressure to accept gay marriage.\"We simply\nwant to act out our faith,\" Hattaway said. \"We don't want to harm anyone. We\nminister to people and we feed the hungry, and we don't ask what lifestyle\npeople are living. But we also don't want people telling us to embrace a\nlifestyle that is clearly immoral and denounced in Scripture.\"\"A lot of people\nfeel betrayed\" by the veto, he said. \"If a Republican governor, put in office\nby people who are conservative, Bible-believing Christians, can't stand boldly\nand protect our basic liberties, I think we are all threatened.\"He and other\nChristian conservatives said their religious liberties were increasingly being\nput at risk by a series of legal decisions over the last decade, culminating\nwith the Supreme Court's ruling last year legalizing same-sex marriage.They\nhave reached the conclusion that their political power has been waning despite\ntheir sheer numbers.\"There's a growing sense that we're a majority whose\nrights and freedoms are being trampled upon,\" said Mike Stone, 45, senior\npastor of Emmanuel Baptist Church in the south Georgia town of Blackshear.\"I'm\ntired of politicians treating the church as a mistress,\" he said. \"They come\nround every two years when they need an itch scratched, but they're not\nwilling to make a long-term commitment.\"The biggest threat to the religious\nagenda is that American society as a whole is changing.Even in conservative\nGeorgia, attitudes toward gay marriage have become significantly more liberal.\nIn 2004, 76% of Georgia voters approved a referendum to prohibit gay\nmarriage.Today, Georgians are essentially equally divided on the issue,\naccording to a poll by the Public Religion Research Institute. It also found\nthat about two-thirds of Georgians want laws to protect gays and lesbians from\ndiscrimination in employment, housing and public services.Tom Taylor, a pro-\nbusiness Republican state representative in the affluent Atlanta suburb of\nDunwoody, said the shift was driven in part by people moving to Atlanta from\nother states.\"I think you're going to see a lot more growth of the more\nmoderate folks within the Republican Party,\" said Taylor, who voted against\nthe religious freedom bill. \"There's always going to be the squeaky wheel\nthat's in front of the camera, but they might not represent the views of the\nentire state.\"_Jenny Jarvie is a special correspondent._**ALSO****North\nCarolina's attorney general says he won't defend transgender law in\ncourt****Some call it religious freedom, others call it anti-gay.

Jerry Brown had\nassembled at the outpost 90 miles from Sacramento to watch Gehrke work and\nbear witness to the severity of California's drought.What followed was a\nhistoric executive order from Brown that required a statewide 25% cut in urban\nwater use and set in motion a fundamental rethinking about how Californians\nuse the precious resource.**UPDATE: Sierra snowpack shows improvement, but not\nenough to declare California's drought over**On Wednesday, when Gehrke hikes\nout to the field again, he'll have something to measure. But the snow\nsituation isn't the only thing that's changed in a year. Californians have\nlargely risen to Brown's challenge and begun to transform their relationship\nwith water — even as they prepare for another hot, dry summer.\"It's really\nimportant to recognize that people in California have done something\nextraordinary,\" State Water Resources Control Board Chairwoman Felicia Marcus\nsaid when announcing that the state would come close to meeting Brown's 25%\nmandate. \"I think the governor will be very proud.\"All along, officials have\nemphasized the importance of capitalizing on the crisis to thrust California's\nantiquated water policies and systems into the 21st century. The drought\nemergency has reminded many local agencies that relying on a single source of\nwater can be risky, so they have expedited plans to diversify their\nportfolios.Los Angeles is racing to cut its purchases of imported water in\nhalf by 2024 and has developed a \"master plan\" to capture more rainwater. The\nMetropolitan Water District of Southern California announced its intention to\ninvest in a massive plant in Carson capable of turning sewage into drinkable\nwater. And in the coming months, West Basin Municipal Water District is\nexpected to release a report outlining plans for a desalination plant in El\nSegundo.Meanwhile, a long-planned proposal to change the way water is\ntransported through the Sacramento-San Joaquin delta is still undergoing a\nlengthy environmental review.Water providers, including the Los Angeles\nDepartment of Water and Power, have revamped their rate structures to\nencourage conservation, even as they grapple with a controversial court ruling\nthat dictates how they can calculate costs.\"It's a modest start,\" said\nStephanie Pincetl, director of UCLA's California Center for Sustainable\nCommunities. \"You can't know in advance if there's a sea change.... We just\ncan't give up.\"Brown's April 1 order came after several previous actions meant\nto bolster the state's water supply and blunt the drought's effects. His\ninitial call for Californians to voluntarily cut their water use by 20% had\nlargely fallen on deaf ears. So, leveraging a barren field as his backdrop and\na statewide snowpack that had plummeted to its lowest level in centuries,\nBrown unleashed the state's first mandatory drought restrictions.The 25%\nreduction in urban water use stood as one cornerstone of the executive order;\na statewide initiative to replace 50 million square feet of lawn with drought-\ntolerant landscaping was another.In February, state regulators announced that\nCalifornians had cut their water consumption by 24.8% over a span of eight\nmonths and saved more than 1.1 million acre-feet of water.Thanks in part to a\n$340-million boost in turf rebate funding from the Metropolitan Water\nDistrict, officials say the Southland alone removed 121 million square feet of\nturf from January 2014 to January 2016.Meanwhile, state employees were working\nbehind the scenes to update rules related to watering landscapes — another\nrequirement of the executive order. In July, the California Water Commission\napproved changes that effectively limit how much grass can be planted outside\nnew homes and all but ban grass in landscapes of new commercial, industrial\nand institutional buildings.By June, Californians named water and drought as\nthe most important issue facing the state, according to a survey by the Public\nPolicy Institute of California. About 70% of adults said water supply in their\npart of the state was a \"big problem.\"Although a survey this month showed\nfewer people still held those views, Mark Baldassare, president of the Public\nPolicy Institute, said the issue has unusual \"staying power.\"\"A lot of people\nare still concerned,\" he said. \"This is an issue that a few years ago was not\non people's radars at all.\"Statewide conservation has slowed in recent months\nas Northern California has enjoyed El Niño-fueled rain and snow. But officials\nsay the drought is not over.\"One year of average rainfall [will] not offset\nfour years of record-breaking drought and heat,\" said Gareth Lacy, a spokesman\nfor Brown. \"No one knows what the future will bring, and we must continue to\nprepare for the possibility of another dry year.\"In a nod to improved\nhydrology, Marcus' water board approved modest changes to the state's\nemergency drought that will allow suppliers to save slightly less water than\nthey were previously required to.The latest version of the regulation expires\nin October but could be modified after water board staff members analyze the\nstate's snow situation.\"Right now we're at halftime, and we have a decent\nscore on the board,\" Marcus said in a recent interview. \"We're having a party\nfor being barely average for this time of year in a couple of big reservoirs …\nbut it's not great.\"Experts say this drought — which Marcus likened to \"the\nwake-up call of the century\" — has been particularly punishing because it has\nbeen unusually hot. 2014 had the highest statewide average temperature in more\nthan a century, state officials said. 2015 came in second.The warming\nconditions have not been good for the snowpack, which usually reaches its peak\naround April 1, officials say. As temperatures warm, the snowpack melts and\nruns off into the state's reservoirs, providing California with about 30% of\nits water.On Tuesday the water content of the statewide snowpack stood at 87%\nof average for the day — far better than the 5% showing a year ago but still\nless that officials would like.\"Conditions aren't suddenly flipped on their\nhead when we get a little bit of rain,\" said Doug Carlson, a spokesman for the\nDepartment of Water Resources. \"The big picture is not rain.... The big\npicture is weather and climate. We most likely have lived into a new\nnormal.\"_matt.stevens@latimes.com_**Twitter: @ByMattStevens****ALSO****El\nNiño: Preparing now for disasters later****Dramatic before \u0026amp; after images:\nHow El Niño transformed the California landscape****These scientists studying\ncoral reefs were brought to tears -- but in a good way**\n\n","title":"State snowpack has changed a lot in the last year — as have Californians' attitude toward water - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"State snowpack has changed a lot in a year, as have Californians' attitude toward water https://t.co/un3znXNMq1 https://t.co/uc7ZWeZYWN","date":"Wed Mar 30 13:45:14 +0000 2016","favs":45,"id":{"$numberLong":"715173038732480512"},"retweets":63},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1SwJZfC"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc605"},"content":"For nearly a year, Los Angeles has wrestled with how to curtail a sharp spike\nin street encampments while respecting homeless people's rights to hang on to\npersonal property.Faced with the most unsheltered people in the country, and\nratty shantytowns from the Cahuenga Pass to the harbor, the city in June\nrewrote a municipal ordinance — 56.11 — authorizing aggressive encampment\nsweeps. It later approved an ambitious, $2-billion plan to end homelessness in\nthe next 10 years.But as concerns surfaced about potential lawsuits and\nfederal condemnation of criminalization, officials suspended enforcement while\nthey debated softening some provisions. On Wednesday, the City Council plans\nto take up the proposed changes.**Join the conversation on Facebook\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**The council's homelessness and poverty committee in August called\nfor dropping misdemeanor penalties and fines for people who refuse to take\ndown their tents or relinquish their possessions. The panel also tied property\nconfiscation to expanding municipal storage bins for homeless people, which\ncurrently exist only on skid row.Yielding to opposition from City Councilman\nJoe Buscaino and others, the new law retains criminal penalties from the\noriginal measure, but follows the recommendation to link storage to\nenforcement. Homeless people can keep only what can they fit in a 60-gallon\ncontainer, unless the city provides storage within a two-mile radius. In that\ncase, homeless people must confine their belongings to what they can carry in\na backpack. Seized belongings can be reclaimed from city storage for 90\ndays.Just one day after advocates for the homeless filed a federal civil\nrights lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles, work crews and police were out\nagain Tuesday making arrests and removing homeless encampments along a highly\nvisible stretch of the 101 Freeway downtown.The sweep, which was\nconducted...Just one day after advocates for the homeless filed a federal\ncivil rights lawsuit against the city of Los Angeles, work crews and police\nwere out again Tuesday making arrests and removing homeless encampments along\na highly visible stretch of the 101 Freeway downtown.The sweep, which was\nconducted...At a homelessness and poverty committee hearing March 17, downtown\nbusiness representatives applauded the revisions as a necessary counterpunch\nto a crisis of disorder in public streets. A spokeswoman for Mayor Eric\nGarcetti, who called for revisions to the original law, said he is likely to\nsign the ordinance if the council approves it.\"The mayor believes that this\nordinance reflects the changes he asked for,\" spokeswoman Connie Llanos said\nin an email. \"It balances the needs of those living on the streets with public\nhealth concerns.\"Westside Councilman Mike Bonin, however, told the committee\nhe was voting for the new law \"reluctantly\" because it puts enforcement before\nstorage.\"It's only common sense, providing sufficient storage, and as a body\nwe have failed at that,\" Bonin said. \"We keep saying we're going for a\nbalanced approach and we're not.\"Bonin and Eastside City Councilmen Gil\nCedillo raised alarms about possible new lawsuits from homeless advocates.The\ncity has suffered a string of courtroom defeats over its enforcement policies,\nincluding other forays into confiscating homeless people's possessions.Earlier\nthis month, homeless advocates filed suit, accusing the city of launching a\nnew campaign to illegally seize and destroy property and remove homeless\npeople from skid row sidewalks.Bonin warned the city could end up paying more\nfees to civil rights attorneys, including Carol Sobel, one of the lawyers who\nfiled the new suit. She and other attorneys have earned at least $1.7 million\nin recent years for representing homeless people against the city.\"We may as\nwell open up the keys to reserve funds to Carol Sobel,\" Bonin said.Cedillo\nalso raised the prospect of federal funding cuts if the measure is seen as\ncriminalizing homeless people.In a report last August, homelessness officials\nin Washington said that \"forced dispersal of people from encampment settings\nis not an appropriate solution or strategy.\" Federal authorities also signaled\npossible funding sanctions for jurisdictions that push criminalization\npolicies.\"We're certainly under scrutiny,\" Cedillo told the committee.\"It's\nvery important we don't have criminal sanctions that appear to be engaged with\nthe mere fact of being homeless,\" said Peter Lynn, executive director of the\nLos Angeles Homeless Services Authority.The authority is awaiting word this\nspring on its application for $28 million in federal funds to build permanent\nsupportive housing. Lynn did not answer when asked during the committee\nhearing whether he believed the new ordinance could jeopardize the city's\nchances for the competitive award.Senior Asst. City Atty. Valerie Flores said\nher office had inserted amendments to make the law more \"compassionate\" by\nexcluding bikes, wheelchairs, walkers and carts from the list of items to\nimpound.\"This is uncharted territory,\" Flores said. \"We're also under an\nobligation to keep areas clean and healthy.\"An unanswered question is where\nthe people will go when their tents are gone. The city this year spent $30\nmillion expanding emergency shelter capacity, outreach and other services to\nhomeless people, but fell short of a pledge by some officials and the mayor to\nallocate $100 million.The city is also short of housing or shelter for 12,000\nhomeless people, City Administrative Officer Miguel A. Santana said in a\nreport last October, and it is struggling to find the money to roll out its\nhomelessness abolition plan.\"Outreach without [housing] placement is no use,\"\nOrlando Ward, executive director of external affairs at Volunteers of America-\nGreater Los Angeles, said in an interview last week.Meanwhile, violent crime\nin the downtown L.A. Police Department district that includes skid row rose\nmore than 57% last year from January through August compared with the same\nperiod a year earlier, and property offenses climbed nearly 25%, according to\npolice data. A transgender woman named Kourtney Yochum was gunned down last\nweek during the day outside her apartment on the corner of San Pedro and 5th\nstreets, in skid row's teeming center. Police called the killing a possible\nact of domestic violence.\"Leaving these tents up puts the homeless in danger\nand turns the area completely over to the criminal element,\" LAPD Officer Deon\nJoseph, an 18-year veteran of skid row patrols, said in a Facebook posting\nthis month. \"It robs the homeless of any incentive to seek housing or\nshelter.\"Downtown landlords are beginning to report higher turnover because of\nthe squalor in the streets, Patricia Berman told the homelessness committee.\nThe new ordinance strikes the right balance between competing interests, she\nsaid.\"We 'd like to find a way to make the city wonderful for everyone,\" said\nBerman, chairwoman of the Downtown Los Angeles Neighborhood Council's board of\ndirectors.gale.holland@latimes.com**Twitter: @geholland****ALSO****Who wins\nwith a $15 minimum wage?****Businessman charged in 'diabolic' slaying of Santa\nBarbara herbalist and family****L.A.

But little about this Supreme Court nomination fight is ordinary.And so\nthe scene Tuesday of a Republican senator photographed alongside President\nObama's court nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, was a sign to the White House of\nforward progress — another yard toward the goal line the administration sees\nas entirely within reach.\"We should be doing our job,\" Republican Sen. Mark\nSteven Kirk of Illinois told reporters crammed into his Senate office during\nthe congressional recess. \"We need … a rational, adult, open-minded\nconsideration of the constitutional process.\"Kirk became the first Republican\nsenator to meet with Garland, the latest advance in the slow and deliberate\nbattle of attrition that White House officials have embarked on in the Supreme\nCourt confirmation fight.

Mark Steven Kirk became the first Republican to meet\nwith President Obama's pick for the Supreme Court on Tuesday, and had strong\nwords for fellow GOP senators who are blocking the nomination until a new\npresident is in the White House.Kirk chatted for about 25 minutes in his\nCapitol...The fight to get Garland confirmed has shaped up to be as fierce as\nany in recent memory, pitting entrenched opponents in the White House and the\nSenate Republican majority against each other amid an atmosphere of deep-\nseated election-year partisanship. A 4-4 decision Tuesday by the remaining\njustices in a major labor rights case only further underscored the stakes at\nplay.Garland's meeting with Kirk was one of a handful of hopeful signs of late\nfor those who expect the judge to win confirmation. Local newspapers\ndocumented the tough audiences faced at home Monday by Iowa Sen. Charles E.\nGrassley, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, who would preside over any\nconfirmation proceedings this year.Grassley, a six-term senator who is up for\nreelection in November, has been a focal point of efforts by Democrats and\nleft-leaning groups to pressure Republicans into considering Garland. Obama's\nallies see consideration of Garland as a requirement of senators'\nconstitutional obligation to \"advise and consent\" on such nominations.Grassley\nhas stood by the Republican argument that voters, rather than a term-limited\npresident, should have a chance to help shape the balance of the court this\nelection year. But the White House said it was \"heartened\" that Grassley said\nhe was prepared to accept the traditional questionnaire that high court\nnominees routinely fill out — casting it as another gain, however minuscule,\nfor Obama.\"We expect that, alongside this request, committee members will do\ntheir jobs by completing meetings with the nominee, [calling] a hearing, and\ngiving Judge Garland the consideration he deserves,\" White House spokeswoman\nBrandi Hoffine said.The administration sees other milestones ahead that could\nhelp sustain interest in the Supreme Court fight even amid competition for\npublic attention from the presidential campaign and other major news.Noting\nthat the day after Democratic Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania sat down with\nGarland last week, his Republican colleague, Patrick J. Toomey, announced he\nwould do the same, aides say that eventually, more meetings — at least 16\nRepublicans have expressed openness to seeing Garland, they say — could lead\nto a hearing, and then a hearing to a vote.\"There's a well-defined process for\nconsidering Supreme Court nominees, and we're taking that process one step at\na time,\" a White House official said. \"Two weeks ago, Republicans were nearly\nuniversally refusing to meet with our nominee — that's not the case today.\"But\nRepublicans scoff at the administration's assessment of the state of\nplay.\"Obviously that's their hope. As we've seen throughout the Obama\nadministration, hope is not a plan,\" said Brian Rogers, executive director of\nthe Republican opposition research firm America Rising Squared, which has been\nfocused on the court battle and participated in a discussion with Republican\nleadership on the issue.A well-planned legal assault on public unions\ncollapsed Tuesday when the Supreme Court deadlocked over a California woman’s\nlawsuit to strike down mandatory fees, the strongest evidence yet that Justice\nAntonin Scalia’s death has stymied the court’s conservatives.The 4-4 split\nkeeps in place a...A well-planned legal assault on public unions collapsed\nTuesday when the Supreme Court deadlocked over a California woman’s lawsuit to\nstrike down mandatory fees, the strongest evidence yet that Justice Antonin\nScalia’s death has stymied the court’s conservatives.The 4-4 split keeps in\nplace a...Rogers said that most Republicans, particularly conservatives,\ncontinue to support the leadership's strategy and that the White House is\noverstating dissent within Senate Republican ranks. For every Kirk who is at\nodds with the approach of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, there are\ndozens of senators who support it.\"McConnell has been as clear as day on this,\nthat we are going to go ahead and wait and let the people decide,\" Rogers\nsaid. \"And ultimately, it's leader McConnell and the leadership team that is\ngoing to make that call. And they've shown no signs of wavering.\"Republicans\nlargely view the White House's bid to confirm Garland as simply a proxy for a\nDemocratic campaign to win back the Senate, one that was unlikely to succeed,\nsaid a senior Republican aide, who would not be named discussing the politics\nof the Supreme Court fight.The aide noted that a coalition of Democratic\noutside groups seem to have limited their persuasion campaigns to Republican\nlawmakers who are in tough reelection fights, and that given the hyperpartisan\nclimate, any swing voters that Republican senators might attract by supporting\nObama's nominee would be more than offset by losing the votes of party\nloyalists, while Democratic voters would simply find another reason to oppose\nthem.\"You name me one Democrat who's going to change their vote [in a Senate\nrace] over having a hearing, and I'll buy you lunch,\" the aide said. \"There's\nno upside.\"A recent survey from the Pew Research Center found that 46% of\nrespondents wanted the Senate to confirm Garland, while 30% did not and 24%\nhad no opinion. While the percentage of Democrats who wanted him confirmed was\ngreater than that of Republicans who did not, Republicans were more likely to\nsay that the Supreme Court was an important issue to them than Democrats.As\nfor Obama, aides found cause Tuesday from the Supreme Court itself to\nreiterate their argument for considering Garland. Split decisions raise\nconstitutional concerns that senators must consider in the court battle, said\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.And he employed a Republican to make\nhis case.In 1988, \"President Reagan made a persuasive case that every day …\nthat goes by without the Supreme Court being fully staffed was a problem for\nthe country and one that the Congress had a constitutional responsibility to\naddress,\" he said.\"We agree with\nthat.\"_michael.memoli@latimes.com__lisa.mascaro@latimes.com_**ALSO****After\nGeorgia veto of anti-gay bill, evangelical Christians feel betrayed****Trump\nstands by campaign manager charged with battery against reporter****Obama\nplays media critic, partly blaming the industry for 'coarsening' political\ndebate**\n\n","title":"White House says it's chipping away at GOP resistance to considering Supreme Court pick Merrick Garland - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"White House says it's chipping away at GOP resistance against SCOTUS pick Merrick Garland https://t.co/qro2c11JPB https://t.co/6USgBdfPZy","date":"Wed Mar 30 13:15:11 +0000 2016","favs":34,"id":{"$numberLong":"715165476763123720"},"retweets":25},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1ZKzCb5"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc608"},"content":"I always thought I would see Anna again. We hadn't been in touch for years,\nbut our collaboration had been so intense that not connecting again was\ninconceivable. Now it's never going to happen.Anna, known professionally as\nPatty Duke, died with terrifying unexpectedness Tuesday at the age of 69. As\nthe co-writer of her \"Call Me Anna\" 1987 autobiography, I spent a couple of\nyears in the mid-1980s working closely with her, an experience so intense it\nmight have been yesterday.I interviewed her for hours in her West Los Angeles\nhome. I spent time with her sons Sean and Mackenzie Astin, was on the Georgia\nset of the TV movie where she met her future husband, Michael Pearce, but most\nof all I experienced the force of her personality, her energy, unblinking\nhonesty and irresistible sense of humor.I'd met her on assignment for TV\nGuide, and her story of what she had gone through as the manipulated child\nstar of the hugely popular \"The Patty Duke Show\" and her struggles with manic\ndepression so riveted me that I came back a month later and asked whether she\nwanted to collaborate on a book.\"I'll ask you questions, we'll tape record\nyour answers, and the book will sound like you wrote it,\" I told her. Her\nreply came immediately and with what I came to recognize as her trademark\ndirectness: \"How can you do that?\"Patty Duke, like so many child actors before\nand after, lived her life in the public eye. That spotlight brought to focus\nher most private struggles as she became a powerful advocate for mental\nillness awareness in addition to being a gifted actress. Duke died early\nTuesday morning in Coeur d’Alene,...Patty Duke, like so many child actors\nbefore and after, lived her life in the public eye. That spotlight brought to\nfocus her most private struggles as she became a powerful advocate for mental\nillness awareness in addition to being a gifted actress. Duke died early\nTuesday morning in Coeur d’Alene,...I was so flummoxed that I said the first\nthing that came into my mind: \"I don't know, but I can do it.\" A light of\nrecognition came into her eyes and she said, \"I know just what you mean.\nThat's the way I feel about acting.\" And so our adventure began.Throughout the\ninterview process, Anna flinched from nothing. Not the way her managers, John\nand Ethel Ross, stage-managed her life as a young star, changing her name from\nAnna Marie Duke to Patty Duke and maneuvering her parents out of the way, and\nnot the terrors that came with young adulthood.At that point, she had the\nfreedom that came with her supporting actress Oscar for playing Helen Keller\nin \"The Miracle Worker\" (at 16, she was then the youngest person ever to win\nan acting Academy Award), but she also suffered from bipolar disorder, an\nillness that would go undiagnosed until her 30s. That led to wildly erratic\nactions, including a marriage that lasted 13 days.She was justifiably proud of\nhaving survived her adversity and prospered to the point where her peers had\nelected her president of the Screen Actors Guild. \"Call Me Anna\" starts with\nan anecdote about taking a SAG meeting with Sid Sheinberg, then president of\nMCA, in the same office where 15 years earlier she had thrown a Mickey Mouse\nclock at him.Her reason for writing the book, in fact, was to help other\npeople who were suffering from this disorder, then known as manic depression,\nto let them know there was hope for them if they sought treatment as she had.\nIn this she was wonderfully successful, so much so that she later wrote\nanother book, \"A Brilliant Madness,\" solely about living with this illness.My\nfavorite stories in \"Call Me Anna,\" however, are not the grim ones but others,\nthe ones that feature humor, like her Catholic childhood memory of playing nun\nwith a girlfriend: \"Assign a lot of homework, whack the table with a ruler,\nfight about who was in charge.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc609"},"content":"A year after Jay Z, Beyonce, Nicki Minaj, Kanye West, Rihanna and a host of\nother A-list musicians gathered for a splashy launch event for Tidal, the\nartist-owned streaming service is celebrating by releasing a report card that\ndetails its first year. Tidal claims to have passed 3 million paid subscribers\nacross the 46 countries in which the service is available, roughly 2.5 million\nmore than it had when it originally launched in late 2014, before the service\nwas acquired by Jay Z last year. The service co-owned by the aforementioned\nartists, along with Madonna, Alicia Keys, Arcade Fire, Calvin Harris, T.I.,\nColdplay, Daft Punk, Deadmau5, Jack White, Jason Aldean, J. Cole, Rihanna,\nDamian Marley, Indochine, Lil Wayne and Usher, has made progress despite being\nheavily maligned by critics and other artists.That said, it still lags behind\nrival competitors. Apple Music, which launched a few months after Tidal's\nflashy rollout, boasts 11 million paid subscribers, and just last week, Daniel\nEk, the CEO of the nearly 10-year-old Spotify, announced the service had hit\nthe 30-million mark of paid subscribers. However, only Apple has come close to\nTidal in terms of exclusive releases from major acts. Prince debuted his\nlatest album, \"HITnRUN Phase Two\" exclusively on Tidal, and the service\nremains the only place where you can stream his discography. Lil Wayne, who is\ncurrently in the middle of a lawsuit with his longtime label, released an\nexclusive album to Tidal last summer. There will likely never be an album\nrelease week as strange, and exhaustingly controversial, as the one just given\nto us by Kanye West.In the days since West previewed his new album, “The Life\nof Pablo,” in a splashy, chaotic, listening party/fashion show for a sold-out\ncrowd at Madison Square...There will likely never be an album release week as\nstrange, and exhaustingly controversial, as the one just given to us by Kanye\nWest.In the days since West previewed his new album, “The Life of Pablo,” in a\nsplashy, chaotic, listening party/fashion show for a sold-out crowd at Madison\nSquare...Beyonce and Nicki Minaj nearly broke the Internet when they debuted\nthe video to \"Feeling Myself\" on the service. Beyonce used Tidal to drop the\nlo-fi clip to an exclusive track, \"Die for You,\" and also sent a jolt before\nthe Super Bowl with her new single, “Formation,” which she offered for free\ndownload on Tidal.Tidal's bumpy rollout of Rihanna’s “Anti” album resulted in\n1.4 million downloads in less than 24 hours, and the record was also streamed\n14 million times in its first 14 hours of release.Shortly after Rihanna's\nrelease, Kanye West used Tidal for the unconventional launch last month of his\nnew album, “The Life of Pablo.” “Relax, but we have to blindfold you,” said\nthe driver. A chorus of gasps filled the bus as he passed out blindfolds\nemblazoned with the Tidal streaming service logo.There could only be one\nexplanation for this \"Mission: Impossible\"-like move: We were headed to\nRihanna's house.It was 9 p.m. Wednesday...“Relax, but we have to blindfold\nyou,” said the driver. A chorus of gasps filled the bus as he passed out\nblindfolds emblazoned with the Tidal streaming service logo.There could only\nbe one explanation for this \"Mission: Impossible\"-like move: We were headed to\nRihanna's house.It was 9 p.m. Wednesday...He debuted the album at a chaotic\nlistening party/fashion show for a sold-out  Madison Square Garden that also\nserved as the debut for his Yeezy Season 3 clothing line.After Tidal's live\nstream -- which at one point crashed under the weight of some 20 million\npeople -- West announced digital copies of the album were for sale via his\npersonal website and streaming on Tidal before the album became a Tidal-only\nexclusive. He later revealed he'd never release it on Apple, although on\nMonday he released the Rihanna and Swizz Beatz-assisted single \"Famous\" to\nboth Apple and Spotify. Despite, and likely because of, \"The Life of Pablo's\"\nexclusivity to one streaming site, people acquired West’s album in great\nnumbers -- even if they refused to sign up for Tidal. More than 500,000 people\nhad downloaded pirated versions of the album in the week after the album was\nreleased.West has been tinkering with \"Pablo\" in real-time on Tidal, upending\nthe notion of a finished album, and according to the service, the album was\nstreamed 250 million times in its first 10 days of release.Tidal has also\nrolled out exclusive video content from Madonna, Usher, T.I. and Harris, and\nhas livestreamed dozens of events over the last year, including Jay Z's\nBudweiser Made in America Festival and Hot97’s Summer Jam, along with concerts\nfrom J. Cole and Beyonce. _gerrick.kennedy@latimes.com_**For more music news,\nfollow me on Twitter: @gerrickkennedy**\n\n","title":"How is Tidal doing?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc60b"},"content":"Juergen Klinsmann looked more tired than relieved Tuesday after his U.S.\nsoccer team rescued its World Cup qualifying campaign with a 4-0 victory over\nGuatemala.“It's been a long couple of days,” he said with a weak chuckle as he\nslumped wearily into a folding chair.Days that included an embarrassing 2-0\nloss in Guatemala, withering criticism of his lineup choices and renewed calls\nfor his ouster. So as much as Klinsmann needed a win Tuesday, he also needed\nit to come in convincing fashion.And his team responded with its most complete\nperformance in nearly a year, using goals from Clint Dempsey, Geoff Cameron,\nGraham Zusi and Jozy Altidore to turn a pressure-packed game into a laugher.“A\nhuge compliment to every one of them for a very clear message that we are on\ntop of the game and we're in the driver's seat again,” Klinsmann said.Well,\nnot quite. Trinidad \u0026amp; Tobago still leads the four-team, fourth-round\nqualifying group with 10 points, three better than the U.S. But the win pushed\nthe Americans into second, a point in front of Guatemala with two September\nqualifiers remaining against Trinidad \u0026amp; Tobago and St. Vincent \u0026amp;\nGrenadines. The top two teams qualify for the final round, and that leaves\nKlinsmann's team in control of its own destiny — a destiny that was very much\nin doubt a couple of long days ago.“We needed a big reaction. And I think\neverybody had that same mind-set,” midfielder Kyle Beckerman said. “It was\njust all about responding tonight.”Added Galaxy attacker Gyasi Zardes: “As\nsoon as the ref blew the whistle, everybody was switched on. We were together\nthroughout the whole 90 minutes.”Zardes got together with Dempsey a dozen\nminutes after that whistle blew, taking two Guatemalan defenders with him when\nhe ran under a Cameron long ball into the penalty area. That left Dempsey, who\nwas trailing the play, free and after the ball took a fortunate bounce off\nZardes' left shoulder, Dempsey had an open net to shoot at.Cameron doubled the\nlead in the 35th minute by nodding home a Michael Bradley free kick. And when\nZusi scored off another Zardes assist just minutes after the break, the rout\nwas on.Zusi, who wasn't even called up to the team until Sunday afternoon, was\none of five new starters employed by Klinsmann after last week's loss.\nKlinsmann also moved Cameron back to central defense, his more comfortable\nposition, and pushed DeAndre Yedlin from the wing into his more natural\nposition as a right back.“These are the adjustments you have to make. And we\nmade them and it worked out,” Klinsmann said.It was the fourth lineup\nKlinsmann has started in as many qualifiers. The two previous U.S. national\nteam coaches, a U.S. Soccer spokesman said, combined to use the same lineup\nonly three times in 210 games.“So much for consistency,” Klinsmann said with a\nsmile.Altidore, who came on midway through the second half, finished the\nscoring in the final minute of regulation with his 34th international goal.\nAmong Americans, only Dempsey and Landon Donovan have more.And on the other\nend a U.S. stubborn defense anchored by Cameron and Steve Birnbaum allowed\njust one shot to get through to goalkeeper Brad Guzan, who made the easy\nsave.All in all, it was a dominating performance.Now Klinsmann and his team\nhave two months to continue regrouping before opening play in June's Copa\nAmerica, where they were drawn into a challenging group that includes\nColombia, Paraguay and Costa Rica. That will be followed by more World Cup\nqualifiers in the fall.But after Tuesday's performance, those are games the\nU.S. can look forward to with confidence, not dread.“It was crucial,” Dempsey\nsaid of the win. “If we didn't win tonight, we were going to be in a really\ntough spot. Now we're sitting better, but we've still got work to do.“We\nlearned a lot about ourselves and a lot about the character of this team by\nhow we were able to bounce back with that pressure.”**Follow Kevin Baxter on\nTwitter @kbaxter11**\n\n","title":"U.S. men turn it around with 4-0 win over Guatemala - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"World Cup qualifying: U.S. wins a game it couldn't lose, beating Guatemala, 4-0 https://t.co/YF118v6sqO","date":"Wed Mar 30 07:50:08 +0000 2016","favs":26,"id":{"$numberLong":"715083675566796800"},"retweets":22},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1qgU9aW"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc60c"},"content":"Thankfully, mercifully, and please feel free to use any other adverb that\napplies, the Lakers are finally stumbling into the last turn of their 2015-16\nabyss.They'll have to finish 6-2 to tie last season's ugly 21-victory total,\nand if you think a team that's won 20% of the time can suddenly win 75% of its\nremainders, you're the most optimistic optimist in optimism history.Almost\neverybody was speechless Monday after the Lakers matched their largest loss\never, a 123-75 point debacle in Utah.How to describe it?\"You can't. It's\nembarrassing,\" power forward Julius Randle said after getting two points and a\nrebound in 24 minutes. And he's one of the Lakers' more dependable\nplayers.Magic Johnson tried to fathom it on Twitter, saying the Lakers (15-59)\nlacked hustle and \"were out there going through the motions.\"That's from a guy\nwho's close friends with Lakers Coach Byron Scott.Then Johnson called this\nseason \"the worst in Lakers history\" about a week before it could become\nofficial.\"The only good thing about this Lakers season is that we get a chance\nto say goodbye to Laker Great and Future Hall of Famer, Kobe Bryant!\" he\nsaid.The young Lakers haven't been looking too great lately, starting with\nRandle.He has plenty of drive on most nights, but one play Monday captured his\nlack of height for his position. He pump-faked once, twice, three times from a\ncrowded spot down low, couldn't get Utah's big men to bite and threw up an\noff-balance layup attempt. It was a miss.Rookie D'Angelo Russell was scoreless\nin the first half as the Lakers trailed by 27. He looked tentative, nothing\nlike the player who had a six-game run earlier this month in which he averaged\n23.7 points.At least there's Bryant, or whatever's left of him, for the final\nlap of his 20-year career. He delivered a staggering minus-43 rating in the\nplus-minus category against Utah and, here's the best part, was credited with\nshutting down red-hot Rodney Hood in the second half.Not that Bryant sounded\nreally excited about any of it. \"I'd rather not have to chase him all over the\nplace like that. My body can't really do that too much,\" he said, smiling\nruefully.One of the season's recent paradoxes continued to present itself\nafter the game. Young opponents hammer the Lakers and then want to hang with\nBryant.Hood, who scored 30 points Monday and tied a Jazz record with eight\nthree-pointers, took photos with Bryant afterward outside the Lakers' locker\nroom. A week earlier, similarly young Devin Booker visited Bryant in the\nlocker room after scoring 28 points in a breezy Phoenix victory.Not to be\nforgotten, the older generation also wants a final chat with Bryant. Former\nJazz center Mark Eaton hung around outside the Lakers' locker room Monday,\nwaiting patiently for Bryant to finish with the younger players. He was 39 and\nretired from the league when Bryant's career started. He did not need photos\nwith him, just a minute or two of quiet and seemingly enjoyable\nconversation.It belied the mess the Lakers had become. They once again forgot\nto show up early and trailed, 17-2. It wasn't long before they flubbed a two-\non-one fastbreak as Russell's lob pass was too high for the badly slumping\nJordan Clarkson.It got worse later when Gordon Hayward drove past Russell and\ndunked on Roy Hibbert, who glowered at the utter lack of perimeter defense.How\nmuch more of this? Only two more weeks.Bryant will play against old pal Dwyane\nWade and the Miami Heat on Wednesday and then old rival Boston one last time\nSunday. It could get really uncomfortable next week with back-to-back games\nagainst the Clippers, who have won nine consecutive times against the Lakers\nand get Blake Griffin back this weekend.There will then be a three-game trip\nbefore Bryant's career concludes April 13 at home against Utah. The Jazz have\nnow beaten the Lakers by an average of 29 points in three games. Just to be\nclear, Utah's record is 37-37.And to be brutally clear, everybody involved\nwith the Lakers will be glad when this season ends. Except maybe Bryant.**Up\nnext for Lakers**:VS.

Roberts immediately stepped\nforward and tore off his jersey as his players roared.Moments later he was on\nhis back with a giant block on his chest, a towel over his face, and a\nsledgehammer coming down up on him.\"Yeah, there was a little bit of a pressure\nthere,\" Roberts said. \"I mean, like, real pressure on my chest.\"The strike was\nperfect. The block was shattered. The manager was unharmed. Roberts leaped\ninto the admiring high-fives of his cheering players.\"I've never seen that\nkind of energy coming from somebody who was about to get hit in the chest with\na sledge hammer,\" Moore said. \"You've got to have guts to do that, especially\non the spur of the moment. You've got to really want to give it up for the\nteam.\"An exaggerated metaphor, perhaps, but the perfect metaphor for the new\nguy in a uncertain clubhouse, a guy searching not only for fight, but faith.\"I\nwas showing complete trust in a guy I just met five minutes ago,\" Roberts\nsaid. \"I hope the players and coaches will trust me like that.\"That would be\nnice, because Monday in San Diego, the real sledgehammer is coming.Even under\nthe most perfect of conditions, Chris Woodward works one of the most confusing\njobs in baseball.He's on the field, but he's not.

He challenges himself. He\nchallenges his team. Injuries are not an excuse. Shrugs are not allowed.\"What\nhas happened this spring is not exactly how you'd want to write it up, but I'm\nnot going to hang my head,\" Roberts said. \"No distractions. Minimize the\nnoise.

The players stop by to laugh at\nit. Yasiel Puig stops by every day to say hello. The office is a place of\nwarmth. It is also a place of accountability, as he has also already summoned\nseveral players for scoldings, usually involving intensity.''We're going to\nhave a certain style, a certain mentality when we play,\" Roberts said. \"That's\nwhat we're working on now.\"The style and mentality of this team feels vastly\ndifferent than in recent years under Joe Torre and Don Mattingly. It feels\nyounger. It feels more alive. It's only spring, but it's a start.\"It's\ninfectious, energetic, positive,\" catcher A.J. Ellis said. \"It's fun every day\nto come to the ballpark.\"New season, new attitude, even a new nickname. Many\nfolks have starting calling Roberts \"Doc,\" which sounds strange to those who\nknew him during his 10-year major league career, but whatever. It's a\nperfectly old-school baseball moniker that also relates to the sort of surgery\nRoberts is attempting on this team's insides. He acknowledges the players'\nvastly different personalities, but won't accept those differences leaking on\nto the field as in past years.\"You've got to let guys be individuals, but you\nalso have to be accountable to your teammates, and there's certain lines you\nwon't cross because you respect one another,\" said Roberts.He has defined\nthose lines with messages delivered in the sort of daily meetings that are\nusually found in the rickety clubhouses of rookie league teams. Players who\nonce barely spoke to each other now stand in front of each other and share\neverything from their jokes to their histories.\"Some of the most phenomenal\ncoaches I ever played for were on our previous staff, but sometimes those\nvoices are drowned out or go stale,\" Ellis said. \"The fresh voice has been\ngreat. There's been a running dialogue between Dave and the team, he's up\nthere ad-libbing, improvising, asking questions, calling out some young guys,\ncreating more dialogue.\"Defining the line between himself and the front office\nled by Andrew Friedman and Farhan Zaidi is going to be more difficult. Roberts\nknows it probably would sound more traditionally managerial to claim he will\nmake all decisions unilaterally, but he wants to be honest. No, he doesn't\nhave to listen to anybody, but, yes, he will listen to everybody.\"I have as\nmuch control as I want, but I encourage as much information as I can get,\" he\nsaid. \"The coaches are going to have thoughts, the front office is going to\nhave thoughts, and once I get all their information, then I'll make my\ndecision.\"There is one thing Roberts must do on his own. He did it during a\nday off in the middle of last week. He flew back to San Diego to undergo his\nannual PET scan to check for a recurrence of Hodgkin's lymphoma, which he\nsuccessfully battled in 2010.\"I do hold my breath, a little bit,\" he said.Five\nhours later, he was informed that the scan was clean. An hour later he was\nsitting at his office desk, laughing, gesturing, managing.\"I'm in a great\nplace, you know?\" he said firmly, preparing himself for another bout with that\nhammer.**Follow Bill Plaschke on Twitter @BillPlaschke****ALSO****North\nCarolina's Roy Williams again will be the Final Four's best-dressed\ncoach****Dodgers' Ross Stripling is still in the conversation for the\nrotation****Lakers teammates 'ticked off' at D'Angelo Russell because of\nsecretly recorded video**\n\n","title":"Bill Plaschke: Dave Roberts hammers home a new attitude in clubhouse - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Dave Roberts hammers home a new attitude in clubhouse https://t.co/rBaXGuv5ek https://t.co/CmU4kA8F2x","date":"Wed Mar 30 06:30:16 +0000 2016","favs":25,"id":{"$numberLong":"715063575799267328"},"retweets":23},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1qgSzpE"}

Kamala Harris and New\nYork Atty. Gen. Eric Schneiderman and launch their own independent\ninvestigations into whether Exxon Mobil Corp. misled investors and the public\nabout climate change risks.Massachusetts Atty. Gen. Maura Healey said at a\nnews conference in New York that her office had a moral obligation to\nact.\"Part of the problem has been one of public perception,\" Healey said.\n\"Certain companies, certain industries, may not have told the whole\nstory.\"Seventeen states and territories — including Vermont, Maryland,\nVirginia, Connecticut and the District of Columbia — are working together to\nexplore legal avenues for fighting climate change, said Schneiderman, who led\nthe event.A spokeswoman for Exxon said in a statement that the investigations\nwere baseless.\"The allegations leveled against Exxon Mobil again today are\npolitically motivated and based on discredited reporting funded by activist\norganizations,\" Suzanne McCarron said. \"We are actively assessing all legal\noptions.\"McCarron said suggestions that the company had reached conclusions\nabout human-caused climate change decades ago and then withheld them from the\npublic are \"preposterous.\" Instead, she said the company's scientists were\nfully engaged in climate change research, adding that Exxon recognizes the\nrisks posed by a warming atmosphere.Last November, Schneiderman's office\nsubpoenaed Exxon for documents related to its climate change research dating\nto the 1970s. Schneiderman's office also demanded files concerning business\ndecisions the company made that were influenced by its knowledge of climate\nchange.Schneiderman's subpoena was announced in the aftermath of published\nreports in the Los Angeles Times and Inside Climate News, which showed that\nExxon incorporated climate change research into its business operations while\nmaking public statements disputing the very same science._Phillis is a\nreporter with Columbia University's Energy \u0026amp; Environmental Reporting\nproject.__environment@latimes.com_\n\n","title":"States expand probes into whether Exxon Mobil hid climate change risks - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"States expand probes into whether Exxon Mobil hid climate change risks https://t.co/O0Lt3cIoJC","date":"Wed Mar 30 06:15:06 +0000 2016","favs":22,"id":{"$numberLong":"715059760660365312"},"retweets":26},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1qgRXQJ"}

Now\nApple is the one that needs the FBI's assistance.The FBI announced Monday that\nit managed to unlock an iPhone 5c belonging to one of the San Bernardino\nshooters without the help of Apple. And the agency has shown no interest in\ntelling Apple how it skirted the phone's security features, leaving the tech\ngiant guessing about a vulnerability that could compromise millions of\ndevices.\"One way or another, Apple needs to figure out the details,\" said\nJustin Olsson, product counsel at security software maker AVG Technologies.\n\"The responsible thing for the government to do is privately disclose the\nvulnerability to Apple so they can continue hardening security on their\ndevices.\"But that's not how it's playing out so far. The situation illuminates\na process that usually takes place in secret: Governments regularly develop or\npurchase hacking techniques for law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts,\nand put them to use without telling affected companies.A legal battle weighing\nprivacy rights against the government's need to investigate terrorism came to\nan end Monday when the FBI said it found a way to gain access to Syed Rizwan\nFarook's iPhone 5c.The announcement may have staved off a historic court\nbattle, but questions still linger about how...A legal battle weighing privacy\nrights against the government's need to investigate terrorism came to an end\nMonday when the FBI said it found a way to gain access to Syed Rizwan Farook's\niPhone 5c.The announcement may have staved off a historic court battle, but\nquestions still linger about how...What's different in this case is that the\nworld has been watching from the start. After Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife\nkilled 14 people in December, the government publicly sought a court order to\ncompel Apple to unlock Farook's work phone. Apple opposed that order,\nheightening long-standing tensions between Silicon Valley and law\nenforcement.Now that the FBI has dropped its case against Apple, there's a new\nethical dilemma: Should tech companies be made aware of flaws in their\nproducts, or should law enforcement be able to deploy those bugs as crime-\nfighting tools?It's unclear whether the FBI's hacking technique will work on\nother versions of the iPhone, though a law enforcement official who spoke on\nthe condition of anonymity said its applications were limited.Some news\noutlets citing anonymous sources have identified Israeli police technology\nmaker Cellebrite as the undisclosed third party helping the government, but\nneither the company nor the FBI has confirmed those reports.A source who is\nunauthorized to discuss the case told The Times the FBI was provided with the\nability to incorrectly guess more than 10 passwords without permanently\nrendering the phone's data inaccessible. That allowed the agency to use\nsoftware to run through potential pass codes until it landed on the correct\none. It is not clear what info, if any, was gleaned from the phone.Attorneys\nfor Apple are researching legal tactics to compel the government to turn over\nthe specifics, but the company had no update on its progress Tuesday.The FBI\ncould argue that the most crucial information is part of a nondisclosure\nagreement, solely in the hands of the outside party that assisted the agency,\nor cannot be released until the investigation is complete.Many experts agree\nthat the government faces no obvious legal obligation to provide information\nto Apple. But authorities, like professional security researchers, have\nrecognized that a world in which computers are crucial in commerce and\ncommunications shouldn't be riddled with technical security flaws.**SIGN UP\nfor the free California Inc. business newsletter \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Even the White\nHouse's cybersecurity coordinator has acknowledged there are times when more\npeople could be harmed by an unfixed security issue than helped by the\ngovernment covertly using the loophole as part of an investigation.A secretive\nWhite House-led procedure governs whether companies get notified of potential\nflaws.Officials involved in the multi-agency deliberations — called the\nVulnerabilities Equities Process — consider the risks and rewards of keeping\nflaws secret, according to federal records. They weigh whether the government\ncould get the information in some other way and how likely it is someone else\nwill discover the same vulnerability.Federal officials have maintained that\nthey lean toward private disclosure of a newly discovered vulnerability in the\nmajority of cases.But in some cases, federal agents have apparently benefited\nfrom previously unknown technical slip-ups by software developers.The National\nSecurity Agency, though it denies the claim, reportedly took advantage of a\nflaw in the way websites transmit sensitive data for two years before private\nresearchers uncovered the issue in 2014. Attorneys in two other cases have\naccused the FBI of using bugs in the Tor Internet browser to identify\nsuspected criminals.Apple's anxiety is understandable. No tech company wants a\nmajor security gap in its products — and most are given months of warning to\nfix issues before they are made public by the researchers who discover\nthem.That's why Apple sees the government holding a moral obligation to\ndisclose details of its hacking technique.\"Apple's best chance is to make a\ncompelling case that the disclosure of this exploit is in the interest of\nnational security, as in, if it remains undisclosed and undiscovered, it\npotentially puts innocent users at risk of data breach,\" AVG's Olsson\nsaid.Apple stated in court filings that part of the reason its executives\nfeared developing software to circumvent iPhone security features was that\nonce created, it could end up in the wrong hands. That same argument could\ncome into play with the disclosure issue if Apple makes a public plea that the\ngovernment and the outside group can't properly safeguard the technique. Last\nyear, an Italian company that bought and sold bugs saw its entire database\nleaked onto the Internet. The security issue could explain why the FBI and the\noutside party are being so secretive about the process.The successful hack of\na phone linked to the San Bernardino terror attacks is unlikely to help police\nwin greater access to encrypted data in thousands of smartphones sitting in\nevidence lockers nationwide, legal experts and law enforcement officials\nsay.The process used to gain access to Syed...The successful hack of a phone\nlinked to the San Bernardino terror attacks is unlikely to help police win\ngreater access to encrypted data in thousands of smartphones sitting in\nevidence lockers nationwide, legal experts and law enforcement officials\nsay.The process used to gain access to Syed...There's also the concern that\nnow that an iPhone can be hacked, others will try. The iPhone has been seen as\n\"a tiny little Fort Knox that from the outside has shown very hard to get\ninto,\" said Kevin Bocek, vice president of security strategy and threat\nintelligence at Venafi.The San Bernardino situation changes the dynamics,\nproviding a reason for \"cybercriminals and amateur hackers to come out of the\nwoodwork,\" said Peter Tran, a general manager at RSA's advanced cyber defense\ngroup.Although someone helped the FBI crack the iPhone, probably in exchange\nfor money, other people who stumble upon the same hacking technique could\nchoose to sell to cyberthieves or other governments. An extensive underground\nonline network, concentrated in Eastern Europe, does just that everyday, Bocek\nsaid.Apple generally doesn't reward bug-finders with cash. But given the\npublicity in this instance, experts said Apple could turn to the black market\ntoo.\"It proves once again that what you don't know, you can buy,\" said Nikias\nBassen, principal mobile security researcher at\nZimperium.paresh.dave@latimes.com**Twitter: @peard33**_Times staff writers\nJames Queally and Richard Winton contributed to this report._**See more of our\ntop stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;****MORE ON APPLE VS.

He said McKenzie showed signs\nof ongoing anxiety, but that had been present in her records 10 years\nearlier.McKenzie, a district manager in the city's Park and Recreation\nDepartment, filed her lawsuit against Filner and the city in December 2013,\nnearly eight months after the incident at a Mission Bay park during which, she\nsays, Filner behaved inappropriately.She testified that after she introduced\nherself to the mayor at the event, he grabbed her by her wrists and asked her\non a date. Moments later, he approached her from behind as she spoke with two\npark rangers, pressed his body against hers and wrapped his right arm around\nher neck.During that latter move, she said, he let his arm drop and brush\nagainst her breast.Filner testified last week that he does not remember\nmeeting McKenzie nor does he recall the incident she described. He denied the\nallegations of sexual harassment, saying, \"There are some things I would never\ndo.\"Filner resigned from the mayor's office in August 2013 after more than a\ndozen women came forward, saying they were harassed. In October of that year,\nhe pleaded guilty to felony false imprisonment and two counts of misdemeanor\nbattery, charges stemming from incidents with three other women at public\nevents.McKenzie was not one of the women identified as victims in those\ncharges.Addario, the psychiatrist, said Tuesday that he believed McKenzie was\n\"shocked\" by the April 21, 2013, incident with Filner, and that it — among\nother things, including the lawsuit — caused stress in her life.\"She felt he\nwas odd,\" the doctor testified, recalling his conversation with the plaintiff.\n\"Not only that this was peculiar behavior, but that there was something wrong\nwith him.\"But the doctor said the incident McKenzie described, as well as\nreactions from her co-workers, did not fit the typical profile of sexual\nharassment in the workplace. He noted, for example, that many fellow city\nworkers, including Kathryn Ruiz, a parks and recreation human resources\nrepresentative, were \"supportive and kindly\" toward her.He said there was no\nevidence that any co-workers who supported her were punished for it in any\nway.\"That's not typical of what you see in sexual harassment cases,\" the\ndoctor said.Addario also said that McKenzie did not seek treatment after the\nincident with Filner. According to the testimony, she didn't complain about it\nto her primary care physician until sometime in 2014.After presenting\ntestimony from other witnesses, including the city's human resources director,\nequal employment opportunity manager and chief operating officer, attorneys\nfor Filner and the city rested their case.Lawyers on both sides of the case\nare expected to give their closing arguments\nWednesday._dana.littlefield@sduniontribune.com__Twitter:\n@danalittlefield__Littlefield writes for the San Diego Union-Tribune._**See\nmore of our top stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;****ALSO****Report details the\nChargers' plans for $1 billion stadium in San Diego****DNA belonging to an\nunknown man found on another Grim Sleeper victim, defense says****Former USC\nPresident Steven B.

In Chapel\nHill, he is known almost as much for his sideline attire as he is for his\nsleepy drawl and two national championships. One fan blog tracks Williams'\nsuit and tie choices each game.\"In the world of clotheshorses,\" Julian said,\n\"Roy is not only a thoroughbred, he is Secretariat.\"For his silks and linens,\nhe trusts no designer more than Julian, whose family clothing shop, Julian's,\nhas been a staple on Chapel Hill's Franklin Street since 1942.Julian has been\nthe school's unofficial haberdasher, and its good-luck charm, for more than 25\nyears.In 1990, when Dean Smith wanted to redesign the Tar Heels' uniforms, he\ncalled Julian. \"This is like having God phone you and ask for new halos for\nthe archangels,\" Julian said.Julian drew up 30 different designs. Some leaked\nearly, and everyone had a different preference. It was a nightmare. So Julian\ndevised a solution.\"I asked Michael if he would weigh in,\" Julian\nsaid.Julian's plan worked — who in town would dare disagree with Michael\nJordan? And thus Julian's iconic argyle made its way into North Carolina's\nuniforms.Julian said the design, with its diamonds and crosses, was evocative.\n\"Some people thought that the argyle looks like a four-corners play,\" he\nrecalled.A season after the redesign, North Carolina won the national\nchampionship.The design stuck, and later crept onto the sideline. Williams\nbegan patronizing Julian's when he was an assistant coach. Julian's suits,\nwhich can cost well into four figures, had long been an aspiration.\"When I was\na student,\" Williams once told radio station WRAL, \"I used to go in, but I\ncouldn't afford anything.\"When Williams became the coach in 2003, he visited\nthe store for biannual fittings. Eventually, word got out.\"He'd get so swamped\nthat we just felt really bad,\" said Bart Fox, Julian's nephew and the store's\nmanager.Now, before each season, Julian and Fox visit Williams' office. Julian\ndiscusses the new styles; Fox resizes Williams for fit.Williams is versatile.\nHe has classic single-breasted suits with traditional peak lapels. But he's\nalso fond of bright patterns.Players know it's a big game when Williams is\nwearing something extra nice. Walk-on Spenser Dalton said he especially liked\nthe pink suit Williams wore at this season's first practice.\"He's a pretty fly\ndude, honestly,\" forward Joel James said.Julian said Williams' style \"is very\nCarolina,\" but it might be the other way around.\"There isn't a day that goes\nby in our store that someone doesn't come in and say, 'I saw Roy in that\njacket! Roy has that tie! Roy has those socks!'\" Julian said. Then they'll ask\nfor the same. \"He's a cultural icon for us.\"Williams doesn't wear Julian's\nclothes exclusively. \"Only the ones that look good,\" Fox joked.But they are a\nfavorite. Once, Fox said, an employee calculated Williams' winning percentage\nwhen the coach was wearing Julian's clothes. It was more than 90%.Williams is\na dream client for Julian, whose store has been in the family for three\ngenerations. Julian attended North Carolina. So did his father, a sister, a\nbrother-in-law, four children and one wife.Back when the Charlotte Hornets\nwere the only professional team in the state, Julian designed their purple and\nteal uniforms. He declined a cash payment and instead asked for a monthly\ndelivery: five pounds of hickory-smoked shredded pork. Julian was living in\nNew York, and he longed for good Carolina barbecue.Today, Julian's Chapel Hill\nboutique looks like the inside of a robin's nest. He has hatched Carolina-\nblue-splashed varieties of pretty much everything.Julian has designed almost\n1,000 articles of clothing for Williams, including one ensemble after the\ncoach underwent rotator-cuff surgery. Williams couldn't wear a jacket because\nhe was in a sling, so Julian produced a shirt with print that looked like a\nplaid sport coat. He then had a tailor take fabric from an argyle necktie for\na matching sling cover.This year, Julian designed Williams' suit for the NCAA\ntournament regional final. (\"That was his 'I'm in charge' gray,\" Julian said.\n\"And he was.\") But two other suits might be more exciting. One is gray with a\nsubtle blue plaid. The other is charcoal with a bold horse-blanket\npattern.Williams already won wearing both this postseason, and Julian reasons\nit's a decent bet he'll wear one again.Either should look good sprinkled with\nconfetti._zach.helfand@latimes.com_\n\n","title":"North Carolina's Roy Williams again will be the Final Four's best-dressed coach - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"North Carolina's Roy Williams again will be the Final Four's best-dressed coach https://t.co/N27M6QAKLH https://t.co/sUyPzAOe0L","date":"Wed Mar 30 03:40:06 +0000 2016","favs":40,"id":{"$numberLong":"715020754228797440"},"retweets":31},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1RxNMaf"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc614"},"content":"All five presidential candidates are campaigning in Wisconsin ahead of next\nweek's primary there. Not only did Donald Trump back away from his pledge, Ted\nCruz and John Kasich skirted the question during CNN's town hall. A major\npoint of contention within the Republican presidential primary is whether\nlosing candidates will support the party's eventual nominee. All of them have\npromised to do so, including Donald Trump. However, Trump, the New York\nbusinessman and current Republican front-runner, backed out of that pledge\nduring a CNN town hall on Tuesday night.\"I have been treated very unfairly,\"\nhe said.Ted Cruz has started evading the same question as the battle heats up\nbetween him and Trump, often insisting that Trump simply won't be the nominee\nin the end. That's the argument of a 5-year-old.Shortly after sitting down for\na CNN town hall on Tuesday night, Ted Cruz was asked about the improbable math\nof him winning the Republican presidential nomination.The Texas senator has\nwon 35% of the delegates so far, but he would need to win 85% for the rest of\nthe primary to clinch the nomination before the convention in July. Cruz\ninsisted he can pull it off, saying \"we're competing to win.\" He also said\nhe's in a better position to come out on top if there's a contested\nconvention.  “John Kasich has no path to winning,” Cruz said, referring to the\nOhio governor who is trailing Cruz and Donald Trump, the Republican front-\nrunner.  \nCruz said a candidate needed to win eight states before he could be considered\nby delegates at the convention, and Kasich has won only his home state of\nOhio.However, even though that rule was in effect in 2012, it's not on the\nbooks this year. You look good and tough. I wouldn’t want to fight you. Do you\nthink I could take you in a fight? I don’t think so. What do you think? How\nabout we do it right now? That’d be great for television.On social media,\nspeaking to reporters aboard his private plane and, finally, at a town hall\nwith supporters, Donald Trump on Tuesday offered support to his embattled\ncampaign manager, who faces a battery charge stemming from an encounter with a\nreporter at a news conference.  \nAnd in doing so, Trump sought to cast blame on the reporter, Michelle Fields,\nwho pressed charges against campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. \"This young\nwoman who complained was talking about maybe being thrown to the floor ...

Did\nyou see any change in her face?\" Fields, who at the time was a reporter for\nBreitbart News but later resigned when the organization did not back her\nclaim, alleged that Lewandowski forcibly grabbed her after a March 8 news\nconference at the Trump National Golf Club. Fields posted online that she was\nnearly pulled to the ground and tweeted pictures of her bruised arm. Trump\nsaid he would not fire Lewandowski based on the video, which shows Lewandowski\ngrabbing Fields.  \"The easiest thing, 'Corey, you're fired,'\" Trump said in a\nnod to his show \"The Apprentice,\" in which he famously fired people.But \"I’m\nnot going to destroy a man for that,\" he said of Lewandowski.  I’m not going\nto destroy a man for that.Read moreHillary Clinton said Donald Trump\nultimately bears responsibility for the legal troubles of his campaign\nmanager, who was charged Tuesday with battery following an altercation with a\nreporter. Asked whether the accusation by a female journalist against Trump\ncampaign manager Corey Lewandowski will hurt Trump with female voters, Clinton\nreplied: \"The reporter who brought the charge deserves a lot of credit for\nfollowing through on the way she was physically handled at an event, and I\nthink the charges being brought today certainly suggest that the authorities\nthought that her story was credible.”Clinton, speaking to reporters after a\ntour of the Pearl Street Brewery in La Crosse, Wis., laid the blame on\nTrump.\"Every candidate has to be responsible for what happens in their\ncampaign and, as I've said repeatedly, what Donald Trump has been doing these\nlast months is inciting violent behavior and aggressive behavior that I think\nis very dangerous and has resulted in attacks on people at his events and this\ncharge that was brought against his campaign manager,\" she said. \"I'm not\ngoing to comment on a pending legal or criminal case, but I think that\nultimately the responsibility is Mr. Trump's.\"She continued: \"The message that\nDonald Trump has been deploying since he got into this campaign has been very\nnegative. ... His consistent attacks on immigrants, on Muslims, on women, in\nparticular his ongoing insults at Megyn Kelly that really suggest that he set\nthe tone and that he has incited negative and really mean-spirited language\nand actions. I said that he is like a political arsonist; he has set some\nfires and then people have acted in ways that I think are deplorable, and\ntherefore he has to be held responsible.\"Clinton declined to say whether she\nwould fire her own campaign manager in a similar situation. \"I'm not going to\ncomment on this particular case. The charge has been made and they deserve to\nhave their cases heard. I'm making a larger point that the entire campaign has\nbeen played to our worst instincts, has set people against each other, and I\ndon't think that has any place in presidential politics or any\npolitics.\"Donald Trump vehemently defended his campaign manager Tuesday, hours\nafter he was charged with battery in an encounter with a reporter following a\nnews conference this month. \"It would be very easy for me to discard people; I\ndon’t discard people,\" Trump told reporters aboard his private plane in\nJanesville, Wis. \"I stay with a lot of people that are treated unfairly ....\nIf you look at that tape, he was very, very seriously maligned.\" Trump, the\nfront-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, was referring to\nsurveillance video from the March 8 news conference at the Trump National Golf\nClub in Jupiter, Fla., that appears to show campaign manager Corey Lewandowski\ngrabbing former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields as she tried to ask Trump a\nquestion. \"If you look at her ... she’s grabbing at me and he’s acting as an\nintermediary, trying to block her from doing that,\" Trump said Tuesday.  \nIn the days after the incident, Lewandowski denied touching Fields and even\ninsisted he had never met her. Still, Trump did not waver in his support of\nLewandowski on Tuesday. He said the video was \"conclusive\" in that Lewandowski\nwas innocent. \"I told him, 'You should never settle this case, you should go\nall the way,'\" Trump said.  \nOn Twitter, Trump also sent out a barrage of tweets casting blame on Fields\nfor \"touching\" him. Police in House Speaker Paul Ryan's hometown of\nJanesville, Wis., summoned reinforcements from across the region to avert\ntrouble at Donald Trump's first campaign rally in 10 days.More than 300\nofficers from across southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois gathered at a\nHoliday Inn Express in Janesville where Trump planned to kick off his\nWisconsin primary campaign Tuesday afternoon. The state holds its primary next\nTuesday.Hours before Trump's arrival, dozens of officers wearing fluorescent\ngreen vests watched quietly as protesters in the parking lot chanted, \"No hate\nin our state.\"Janesville Police Chief David Moore said he hoped to avoid the\nkind of violence that broke out at a recent canceled Trump rally in\nChicago.\"We coordinated with Secret Service to make sure those things don't\nrepeat themselves,\" he said.Trump's campaign complicated the situation by\nissuing 5,000 tickets for a venue that accommodates only 1,000, Moore said.In\nprevious years, former President George W. Bush, Gov. Scott Walker and Ryan\nhave all held big events at the hotel. One event of Walker's drew a huge union\nprotest against his measures to curb labor's collective bargaining power. But\npolice on Tuesday expected a bigger crowd, perhaps several thousand, to\nprotest the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination.\"We think\nthe threat is bigger,\" Moore said of the potential for violence.As Donald\nTrump defended his campaign manager, who was charged Tuesday with simple\nbattery of a reporter, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz stressed that chaos and violence\nare ongoing themes of the billionaire businessman's presidential campaign.\n\"This is the consequence of the culture of the Trump campaign, the abusive\nculture,\" Cruz, Trump's chief rival for the GOP nomination, told reporters\nwhile campaigning in Wisconsin. \"When you have a campaign that is built on\npersonal insults, on attacks and now physical violence, that has no place in a\npolitical campaign, it has no place in our democracy.\"Police in Jupiter, Fla.,\ncharged Corey Lewandowski, Trump's campaign manager, with the misdemeanor\noffense after former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields alleged that he\nforcibly grabbed her following a March 8 news conference at the Trump National\nGolf Club. Surveillance video released by police Tuesday showed Lewandowski\ngrabbing Fields' arm as she attempted to speak with Trump. Trump and his\ncampaign have said Lewandowski is not guilty. \"If I was in this circumstance,\nI would take some sort of action, either a suspension or firing,\" Ohio Gov.\nJohn Kasich, the third candidate in the GOP race, said on Tuesday.John Weaver,\nKasich's chief strategist, said on Twitter that \"campaigns reflect the values\nof the candidate.\"\"I know ours does. If this bully worked for John Kasich, he\nwould have been fired long ago,\" he said. Ahead of Wisconsin's April 5\nprimary, Trump was scheduled to hold a rally in Janesville on Tuesday and then\nparticipate in a CNN-hosted town hall in Milwaukee.

After the recent bombings in Brussels, Cruz called for patrols of\nMuslim neighborhoods. He added to his argument in a Monday op-ed article in\nthe New York Daily News, in which he said the U.S. can’t fight until it\nidentifies the enemy — radical Islamic terrorism. Johnson agreed that the\ncountry needs to protect itself, but he said the two GOP presidential\ncandidates’ methods are “counterproductive.” “It is critical that we build\nbridges to American Muslim communities, not vilify them, not drive them into\nthe shadows, and encourage them to work with us,” Johnson said.  Donald\nTrump’s campaign manager has been charged with battery after a reporter said\nhe forcibly grabbed her following a news conference in Florida.  \nCorey Lewandowski was issued a summons for misdemeanor battery on Tuesday by\nJupiter Town Police. Michelle Fields, then a reporter for the Breitbart News\nNetwork, said that Lewandowski pulled on her arm, leaving bruises, at the\nMarch 8 event at the Trump National Golf Club.Police released surveillance\nvideo Tuesday:  \nThe Trump campaign issued a statement saying that Lewandowski is innocent. “He\nwill enter a plea of not guilty and looks forward to his day in court,” the\nstatement said.Read moreA week before the Wisconsin primary, Gov. Scott Walker\nendorsed Ted Cruz for the Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday as the\nTexas senator tries to slow the advance of front-runner Donald Trump.Walker’s\nsupport gives Cruz the heft of a battle-tested statewide political operation.\nWalker survived a 2012 recall election stemming from his fight to curb the\npower of organized labor in Wisconsin. In 2014, Walker won a second term as\ngovernor just as he began running for president.In an interview with a\nMilwaukee conservative radio host, Charlie Sykes, Walker called Cruz a decent\nman who loves his wife and children.“He is not afraid to take on the big-\ngovernment special interests, even sometimes when they’re aligned with our own\nparty,” Walker said.Trump was interviewed on the same program Monday, but did\nnot appear to realize until midway through it that Sykes openly opposes his\ncandidacy.Trump dismissed the expected endorsement on Monday night.Walker’s\nendorsement of Cruz came as no surprise. When he abandoned his own run for\npresident in September, Walker urged GOP rivals to follow suit “so that the\nvoters can focus on a limited number of candidates who can offer a positive,\nconservative alternative to” Trump.Walker and groups that backed him spent\nmore than $32 million on his campaign for president, but dismal poll ratings\ndrove him from the race.Cruz, Trump and Kasich are barnstorming across\nWisconsin this week. At stake in the primary are 44 delegates -- a relatively\nsmall prize, but still important for gauging whether Cruz or Kasich are\ngaining any momentum in their efforts to stop Trump from winning the\nnomination.If Bernie Sanders wants to debate Hillary Clinton before the New\nYork primary, he needs to change his negative tone, a Clinton campaign\nstrategist said Monday.Responding to the Sanders campaign's call to debate in\nthe state, strategist Joel Benenson told CNN that TV ads and radio spots\nreflect a negative turn that Sanders prides himself on avoiding.“This party is\nstrong when we have a good, strong, healthy debate, but the tone of the\ncampaign has become increasingly negative and personal in some places,” he\nsaid on CNN. New York Democratic voters deserve a debate before deciding,\nSanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told news outlets Monday. The back-and-\nforth bounced back to Clinton’s press secretary later when he called Sanders’\nrequest a “stunt” in an interview with CNN. “The Sanders campaign is\nstruggling a bit for attention,” press secretary Brian Fallon said. “The\ndelegate math being what it is, people sort of realize the Sanders campaign\nhas an uphill climb.”\n\n","title":"Donald Trump's campaign manager is charged with battery against reporter - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Ted Cruz says he can make the math work to win the nomination https://t.co/bCCFgN1idV","date":"Wed Mar 30 03:20:05 +0000 2016","favs":12,"id":{"$numberLong":"715015715208708097"},"retweets":24},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1MA6HEs"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc619"},"content":"Like her husband, Carol Bundy has little faith in the federal judicial system.\n“This is going to be won in the court of public opinion,” the mother of 14\ngrown children and the wife of renegade cattleman Cliven Bundy predicted this\nmonth.She was referring to the dozens of indictments recently handed down by\nthe U.S. government against her husband, four of their sons and other armed\nprotesters involved in the January wildlife refuge takeover in Oregon and a\nstandoff near Cliven Bundy's Nevada ranch two years ago.But some of that\npublic opinion has dissolved into threats from Bundy supporters and is now\nbeing investigated by state and federal authorities, possibly leading to more\ncriminal charges.In email, phone messages and Facebook posts, supporters have\nthreatened retaliation for the mass arrests and the death of Robert “LaVoy”\nFinicum, 55, an Arizona rancher and spokesman for the Oregon refuge occupiers\nwho was gunned down by state troopers during a roadside confrontation.The\nmessages target law enforcement officers and government officials, including\nOregon's governor, according to a sampling of threats released last week by\nthe Deschutes County Sheriff's Office. Investigators gathered more than 80\nthreats as part of the office's investigation into the Finicum shooting in\nneighboring Harney County.“We're going to shoot to kill,” said an anonymous\ncaller to Gov. Kate Brown's office on Jan. 27, the day after Finicum was\nkilled on a rural highway north of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, which\noccupiers held for 41 days. Another caller to Brown's office warned, “You\nkilled an unarmed rancher, so now one of you must die, unfortunately.\nGoodbye.”Some messages were profanity-laced, and one sent to a police agency\nasked whether the FBI's roadblock used to stop Finicum and other occupiers was\nillegal. “If this is so,” the sender wrote, “let me know so we can set up road\nblocks and kill [state troopers] and FBI because they stand against what we\nbelieve in.”Other local, state and federal agencies have collected similar\nmessages, including the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which has a long-\nrunning dispute with Cliven Bundy over his Nevada cattle-grazing rights. This\nmonth, he and others — now in jail in Portland facing charges related to the\nOregon refuge takeover — were also charged in Nevada for the 2014 armed\nstandoff sparked by a dispute over Bundy's failure to pay $1 million in\nfederal grazing fees and penalties. Altogether, 26 people have been charged in\nPortland and 19 in Las Vegas, some of them in both cases.The U.S. Fish and\nWildlife Service will spend roughly $4 million to clean, repair and upgrade\nthe Oregon wildlife refuge that was the site of a 41-day armed occupation by\nranchers earlier this year.Fish and Wildlife Director Dan Ashe said he wanted\nthe Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Burns...The U.S. Fish and Wildlife\nService will spend roughly $4 million to clean, repair and upgrade the Oregon\nwildlife refuge that was the site of a 41-day armed occupation by ranchers\nearlier this year.Fish and Wildlife Director Dan Ashe said he wanted the\nMalheur National Wildlife Refuge in Burns...Besides the 69-year-old patriarch,\nfour of Bundy's sons are also in federal custody — Ryan, Melvin, David and\nAmmon, one of the refuge occupation leaders. A threat sent to the BLM said\nthat if Cliven Bundy and others were not released and indictments instead\nissued for federal agents and Gov. Brown, then “I am going to begin returning\nfire!!!!!!”The names of the officers who shot Finicum have not been made\npublic, and officials are collecting the threats as part of a legal effort to\nblock the release of the officers' identities. “Those officers have very real\nthreats against them,” Deschutes County Sheriff L. Shane Nelson said this\nmonth.His office's investigation found that three shots were fired at\nFinicum's pickup after he sped from a traffic stop on a snowy road. Three\nother shots fired by state troopers struck and killed Finicum after he left\nhis vehicle and faced off with them, Nelson said.Bundy supporters who saw a\ngrainy video of the shooting concluded Finicum had been murdered, but the\ninvestigation determined that he was reaching for a gun when he was shot, and\nruled the shooting justified. Two other errant shots may have been fired by\nmembers of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team.An elite FBI hostage rescue team is\nunder investigation after one or more federal agents apparently lied or failed\nto admit that they shot at Oregon occupier Robert “LaVoy” Finicum during a\nfatal showdown in January, officials revealed Tuesday.News of the potentially\nembarrassing investigation...An elite FBI hostage rescue team is under\ninvestigation after one or more federal agents apparently lied or failed to\nadmit that they shot at Oregon occupier Robert “LaVoy” Finicum during a fatal\nshowdown in January, officials revealed Tuesday.News of the potentially\nembarrassing investigation...One of those shots hit the truck, said Nelson,\nand the other apparently went astray. “The question of who fired those shots\nhas not been resolved” in part because agents failed to “disclose their shots\nto our investigators,” he said.Though the FBI agents had denied firing any\nshots, two copper-colored casings, similar to ammunition used by the agency,\nwere seen by a trooper near where the agents had stood. (State police use\nsilver-colored casings.) The U.S. Department of Justice's inspector general is\nnow investigating the agents' actions.Suspicions of an FBI cover-up stoked the\nanger of the anti-government faithful. After Nelson's news conference, one\nwrote to the sheriff claiming it was a case of murder, adding, “All of you\nwill pay on earth or when God judges you.” Another threat stated that\nofficers' lives are now “worth less than a bucket of warm spit.”Facebook\nmessages collected by investigators included threats to kill Harney County\nSheriff Dave Ward and a $1,000 reward offer for the “capture” of those who\nshot Finicum. The Oregonian reported that Facebook pages are also being used\nin an effort to identify the officers who shot Finicum.

Sample became president of USC, the L.A. riots erupted.\nAdministrators and staff were told to leave as smoke billowed on the horizon\nduring those tense days in 1992. But Sample stayed, sleeping on his office\nfloor and keeping company with fearful students in the dining hall.The South\nLos Angeles campus escaped damage, but the nearby violence generated cries to\nmove USC to a less-troubled neighborhood — perhaps somewhere in Orange County.\nInstead Sample doubled-down on his university as an “anchor institution” in\nthe city, launching a massive civic engagement effort and proving himself a\nmaster salesman who boosted the school's prestige and coffers.During 19 years\nas president, Sample catapulted USC from being a school often mocked as the\nUniversity of Second Choice or the University of Spoiled Children into a top\neducational institution and fundraising powerhouse.He died Tuesday at the age\nof 75. No cause of death was released.The sales pitch, so enthusiastic that it\nsounds corny, is delivered with a wry smile and gleaming eye. \"You have\nprobably written your speech, but I wanted to show you this,\" says USC\nPresident Steven B.

Sample. He hands his guest a Time magazine article\ncrowning USC as College of the Year.Disney...“So many of USC's successes, so\nmuch of our university's current stature, can be traced back to Dr. Sample's\ndynamic leadership, keen foresight and extraordinary prudence,” current\nPresident C.L. Max Nikias said.After holding several professorships, Sample\nbecame president of the State University of New York at Buffalo when he was\njust 41. In 1991, he was named USC's 10th president.Under Sample's\nstewardship, USC rose from 51st to 26th in U.S. News \u0026amp; World Report's\nrankings of American universities and the number of its freshman applicants\ntripled. The university also became more selective, with acceptance rates\ndropping from 70% to 24%.Sample also led efforts to give USC a global\npresence. Record numbers of foreign students, particularly from Asia, flocked\nto the university — a trend that has continued under Nikias.While Sample was\nin charge, a USC chemist won a Nobel Prize, the school's first. Sample\ninstituted a ban on alcohol sales at the Coliseum during home football games,\nand cracked down on fraternity partying.When he announced his retirement in\n2009, Sample told The Times that he was proudest of boosting the academic\nquality of the students, achieved partly by trimming the size of the freshman\nclass 25% and enhancing undergraduate course offerings.That focus on\neducation, however, was matched by a fundraising prowess.USC received five\ngifts of at least $100 million during Sample's tenure, and the university's\nendowment grew from $450 million to a pre-recession height of nearly $4\nbillion. The endowment was battered by the recession, dipping to about $3\nbillion when he announced he was stepping down.Recognizing the school's\ntransformation, Time magazine named USC its college of the year for 2000.\nSample told the Chronicle of Higher Education that he had 600,000 copies of\nthe article made.“Every living Trojan got at least two copies,” he joked.\n“Every dead Trojan got at least one.”But the depth of his zeal for the school\nfound striking expression during the tumultuous days of 1992.Joe Hellige, a\npsychology professor at the time of the riots who later served as vice provost\nof academic affairs, recalled that Sample kept a visible presence on campus\nduring the frightening days of the riots.“Most of us found that to be the mark\nof a genuine leader,” said Hellige, now executive vice president and provost\nat Loyola Marymount University. “He understood the importance of the\nuniversity to the city of Los Angeles, but also the importance of Los Angeles\nas a place.”In a letter to the USC community after the city had calmed, Sample\nwrote: “It was not a miracle that USC came through unscathed. Our neighbors\nunderstand that USC is an anchor institution in this city, and they do what\nthey can to help it flourish.”Still, the pressure rose on USC to relocate,\nmuch as Pepperdine had decamped from what was then South-Central for Malibu\nafter the Watts riots in 1965.“I was advised by many people to ‘do a\nPepperdine' … and get the hell out of Los Angeles,” Sample would say.But he\nemphasized his commitment to L.A., and the campus stayed put.At the time,\nSample understood the need to improve USC's relationship with the\nneighborhood. Campus security officers soon were dispatched to patrol not just\nUSC grounds but the community around the school, and thousands of\nundergraduates began volunteering around South L.A.The Rev. Cecil “Chip”\nMurray, former pastor of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church and a\nnoted civic leader, told The Times in 2000: “Steve Sample is what a university\npresident should be. He brightens the corner that he is in, rather than\nlooking for bright lights.”In an address to USC faculty in 2004, Sample again\nstressed his commitment:“When I arrived from Buffalo … many people believed\nthat Los Angeles was a dead city with no future,” Sample said. “The trustees\nand I, however, took a different view. USC … grew up with this city, and we\nplan to continue to be in the heart of this most dynamic and exciting city for\ncenturies to come.”In 2001, about a decade into his tenure, Sample was\ndiagnosed with Parkinson's disease. In a letter informing the university's\nfaculty, he said the condition had given him a tremor in his left hand, but he\ndid not expect it to spell the end of his career.“I have no intention of\nletting Parkinson's stand in the way,” he said.He kept true to his word,\nserving nine more years. Only Rufus B. von KleinSmid, USC's president from\n1921 to 1947, had a longer tenure.Along with his administrative duties, Sample\nco-taught a class each year with Warren Bennis, a professor of business\nadministration. It was called “The Art and Adventure of Leadership,” and\nundergraduates had to apply for the course“They were personally involved with\nall of the students,” said Erin Gielow Matzkin, who took the course the fall\nsemester of her senior year in 1999. She said Sample advised her about her\npostgraduate aspirations, and she heeded his advice to attend USC Gould School\nof Law. “He told me I should go wherever I wanted, but that he thought USC\nwould be a good fit,” she said.“It was so refreshing to get that level of\ninterest and perspective from a professor.... That class changed my life.”When\nhe announced his retirement in 2009, Sample said the university needed “fresh\nleadership.”“I think I'm still pretty high-energy compared to most university\npresidents,” he told The Times. “But I think a new president might bring a lot\nmore energy, and that would be great.”He retired from USC in 2010 at age 69\nbut remained active at the university, serving on the board of trustees.Sample\nwas born in St. Louis on Nov. 29, 1940, and married his college sweetheart,\nKathryn Brunkow, while both were undergraduates at the University of Illinois\nat Urbana-Champaign, where he later earned a doctorate in electrical\nengineering.A specialist in electromagnetic theories, he invented the controls\nand touch pads used in millions of microwave ovens.He is survived by his wife,\ndaughters Michelle Sample Smith and Elizabeth Sample and two\ngrandchildren.**For news in California, follow @LATChrisGoffard and\n@MattHjourno.**_Staff writers Jason Song, Zahira Torres and Carla Rivera\ncontributed to this report.  \n_**ALSO****USC's tuition will top $50,000 for the first time****Report\nrecommends that Cal State faculty receive 5% pay increase****UC schools harm\nlocal students by admitting so many from out of state, audit finds**\n\n","title":"Former USC President Steven B.

But some members of the vast fungi kingdom have been hugely\nbeneficial to humans.Decades ago, scientists discovered that certain species\nof fungi create molecules called secondary metabolites to help combat\nstressful situations. By harvesting these molecules, researchers have been\nable to make new and important drugs that have changed the trajectory of\nmedicine.**See more of our top stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**The most famous\nof these is penicillin, an antibiotic produced by members of the _Penicillium_\ngenus when they are exposed to bacteria. Penicillin's bacteria-fighting\nproperties were discovered by the Scottish pharmacologist Alexander Fleming in\n1928, and the drug is now used throughout the world to fight infectious\ndiseases.Other fungi-produced medicines include the cholesterol-lowering drug\nlovastatin and the anti-fungal griseofluvin. Researchers are also looking into\nwhether other secondary metabolites might also be used to fight cancer,\nosteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease.Scientists are sending four strains of\nfungi to the International Space Station in the hope of finding new medicines\nfor use on Earth.Scientists are sending four strains of fungi to the\nInternational Space Station in the hope of finding new medicines for use on\nEarth.Wang has used genome sequencing to show that _Aspergillus nidulans_, one\nof the most studied fungi, has 40 different drugmaking pathways. However, most\nof them are never \"turned on.\" \"In nature, fungi only make what they need to\nrespond to their environment,\" Wang said. \"These pathways are like a set of\ntools or weapons in their arsenal, and most of the time they are not in\nuse.\"At his lab at USC, Wang and his students grow fungi in 60 different\n\"stressful\" environments, in an effort to coax the organisms to create new\nmedicines that have never been seen before. But the only way to expose fungi\nto the stressors of a space environment is to send them off the planet.To do\nthat, Wang partnered with Kasthuri Venkateswaran, a microbiologist at the Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory in La Cañada Flintridge who studies microbes in space.\nVenkateswaran said NASA has previously sent bacteria and yeast to the\nInternational Space Station, but this is the first time the space agency would\nbe deliberately growing fungi inside the space laboratory.On April 8, four\ndifferent strains of the fungi _Aspergillius nidulans_ will launch aboard a\nFalcon 9 rocket from the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. They are\nscheduled to return to Earth on May 10.The actual experiment will last just\nthree to seven days. One of the benefits of working with this particular fungi\nis that its growth can be controlled by temperature. For most of its time in\nspace, the fungi will be stored at a cool 39.2 degrees Fahrenheit. When the\nexperiment begins, the fungi will be placed in an ideal growth condition of\n98.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Chipping away at the genome of a tiny parasitic\nbacteria, genetic-sequencing trailblazer J.

Craig Venter and colleagues say\nthey’ve synthesized the shortest-known genome known to support life. This man-\nmade set of genetic instructions contains only 473 genes, breaking the record\nheld by the bacteria...At the same time, the same four strains of the fungi\nwill be grown on Earth to serve as a control.The research team, which includes\nUSC School of Pharmacy doctoral students Jillian Romsdahl and Adriana\nBlachowicz, hope to get the fungi that journeyed to space back to the lab for\ntesting by the middle of May. One of the team's hypotheses is that the\nextraterrestrial fungi will produce molecules to protect them from space\nradiation that they do not need to produce when they are living on Earth. \"We\nknow if there is high radiation, they will adapt, but we are not sure what\nthat adaptation will be,\" Wang said. When the space fungi samples return, the\nresearchers will analyze what secondary metabolites they produced, as well as\nwhat genetic regulators or \"switches\" the fungi used to activate the genes\nthat produce those metabolites.

Mark Steven Kirk became the first Republican to meet with\nPresident Obama's pick for the Supreme Court on Tuesday, and had strong words\nfor fellow GOP senators who are blocking the nomination until a new president\nis in the White House.Kirk chatted for about 25 minutes in his Capitol Hill\noffice with Merrick Garland, the 63-year-old chief judge of the U.S. Court of\nAppeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. \"I think we should be doing our\njob,\" Kirk said, noting that Garland is \"one of the most eminent jurists in\nthe country,\" as the two sat beneath wall portraits of Abraham Lincoln and\nconservative former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.\"We need for a\nrational, adult, open-minded consideration of the constitutional process,\"\nKirk said. \"When you just say, 'I'm not going to meet with him,' ... that's\ntoo closed-minded.\"Republican senators have largely adhered to the strategy\nengineered by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) of denying Obama\nanother justice on the court, even though signs of political discomfort are\nbeginning to show as the confirmation battle drags on.Protesters have been\nbadgering Republican senators who are up for re-election this fall, staking\nout their home-state offices and town hall meetings during the spring recess.\nMany are echoing activists' simple refrain: Do your job.At the same time,\nconservatives groups, including Tea Party Patriots, are shoring up the GOP\nsenators, including Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the\nJudiciary Committee, encouraging them to continue the blockade. Other\nconservative organizations are challenging red-state Democratic senators to\njoin the Republicans.Polling shows that while conservative voters back\nMcConnell's strategy, most Americans believe the Senate should at least hold\nhearings to consider the president's nominee, who is considered a moderate\njustice by many measures. The Senate could then vote to confirm or deny\nObama's pick.For Kirk and other senators facing tough re-elections this fall,\nincluding Sen. Kelly Ayotte in New Hampshire and Sen. Pat Toomey in\nPennsylvania, they'll need to win over a broader swath of the voters than just\nthe most conservative ones in their states.Kirk earlier encouraged his\ncolleagues to \"man up\" and vote, but so far only two other Republican senators\nhave said a vote should be taken.Kirk's Democratic challenger, Rep. Tammy\nDuckworth, said Kirk should put more pressure on his colleagues in the Senate.\n\"Sen. Kirk seems to expect extra credit for doing the bare minimum — in this\ncase his job,\" said Duckworth's deputy campaign manager, Matt McGrath.\"Instead\nof going through the motions, Sen. Kirk should show leadership by putting\npressure on McConnell and urge him to give an eminently qualified Illinois\nnative a fair hearing followed by an up-or-down vote.\"A shift among Republican\nsenators is clearly underway, but there does not yet appear to be enough\nmomentum to push GOP leadership to back off the blockade and allow a vote\nbefore a new president is elected.**NEWSLETTER: Get the best from our\npolitical teams delivered daily**As many as 16 Republican senators have now\nsaid they would be willing to meet with Garland — many more than when he was\nfirst nominated to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative icon who\ndied suddenly last month. Many senators, though, said the visit would only be\na courtesy, and that they preferred to leave the vacancy open until after a\nnew president is in office in January 2017.Kirk heaped praise on Garland, even\nthough he stopped short of saying he would vote for him. He suggested, though,\nthat the senators' meetings \"shouldn't be just for nothing.\"\"We should have a\nlong discussion about key issues,\" Kirk said, adding his own interest in\ntesting the limits of federal racketeering statutes to \"attack the big drug\ngangs of Chicago\" after more than 30 shootings over Easter weekend.  The\nvacancy could leave the court ideologically split, 4-4, for the remainder of\nthis term and into the court's next one, affecting decisions on key pending\ncases, including Obama's immigration actions. **For the latest from Congress\nand 2016 campaigns follow @LisaMascaro****For more, go to\nwww.latimes.com/politics.****ALSO****Supreme Court's deadlock on union fees\ncould be the first of many tie votes****Supreme Court battle follows\nRepublican senators to their home states****How far left has Hillary Clinton\nbeen pushed by Bernie Sanders?

There's even a toll\nroad nicknamed Alligator Alley where the 150-million-year-old reptiles can be\nseen lolling alongside the highway.I didn't realize how common they were until\nI visited Florida's Everglades National Park, where I saw them hiding in\ngrasslands, trolling for prey in ponds and snoozing in the sun on park\ntrails.It wasn't always this way: The American alligator nearly disappeared\nfrom the landscape in the 1950s, the victim of hunters and the massive Florida\nhousing boom that robbed them of their habitat. Fortunately, conservationists\nintervened, and the gator became an Endangered Species Act success\nstory.**Read the series: Celebrating our national parks**Of course, this is\nwhat Everglades National Park is all about: conservation. It's a story of life\nstruggling to stay in balance, a place where people have affected the habitat\nand its residents and is now working to protect them.The 1.5-million-acre\npark, third in size in the continental United States (after Death Valley and\nYellowstone national parks), protects one of the most biodiverse areas in the\nworld.Its unique mix of tropical and temperate plants and animals includes\nmore than 700 varieties of plants, 300 bird species and 27 kinds of snakes, as\nwell as endangered species such as the manatee and panther.Yet attacks by\nhumans and nature threaten this giant ecological carnival.That's one of the\nreasons I visited recently: The survival of a host of animals hangs in the\nbalance here, and I wanted to see as many of them as I could.It didn't take\nlong. On my first morning in the park, I spotted a wood stork standing at the\nedge of a pond. The long-legged, 3-foot tall bird is the only member of the\nstork family that breeds in the U.S. Formerly on the endangered list, it was\ndowngraded to threatened in 2014; it looks awkward on land but soars like a\nraptor in the air.Less than an hour later, I saw an American crocodile sunning\nitself on a boat launch near the Flamingo Visitor Center at the far southern\nend of the park. The 1,000-pound creeper glared at me before sliding back into\nthe sea.Touring the Everglades.Touring the Everglades.No other wilderness area\nin the United States is quite like the Everglades; it doesn't have lofty\nmountains, high glaciers or acres of conifers. Instead, visitors find a \"River\nof Grass,\" a name coined by early Native American inhabitants and\nconservationists to describe the wetlands that stretch more than 100 miles\nthrough the south-central part of the state.That river makes it possible for\ncrocs, gators and hundreds of other animals to exist. As a matter of fact,\npark rangers say, virtually every animal here is dependent on its water.\nThat's why Everglades National Park exists; it was the first park created to\nprotect a threatened ecological system. Of all U.S. national parks, it alone\nholds three world designations: International Biosphere Reserve, World\nHeritage site and Wetlands of International Importance.It's also a\nsurprisingly beautiful place encompassing the shallow, pale-blue waters and\nislands of Florida Bay, dense mangrove forests, towering palms, endless\nmarshes and a savanna-like river of grass.I started my wildlife safari in\nMiami, driving 40 miles south to the main park entrance (Ernest F. Coe Visitor\nCenter and Park Headquarters) near Florida City. From there, a park road winds\nsouth to Flamingo at the edge of Florida Bay. Along the way, I found excellent\noverlooks and boardwalk-style trails that penetrated the swamps and marshes.\nIn Flamingo, I hopped on a boat for a look at the marine and bird life.Two\nother park entrances offer additional views of the park. The Shark Valley\nVisitor Center, at the north-central edge of the park, has a two-hour tram\ntour that explores one of the park's major sloughs, with lots of opportunities\nto see birds and gators.

You can reach the park's Gulf Coast entrance\nin Everglades City by way of Southwest Florida International Airport near Fort\nMyers or by U.S. 41, which skirts the park to the north.**Best time to\nvisit**Winter is considered the dry season; there's less rain and animals are\neasier to see because they congregate at watering holes. Also, temperatures\nare cooler, making a visit more pleasant.

The Royal Palm Area is about a mile from the Homestead entrance and\noffers ranger-led walks, camping, canoeing and kayaking and more. The park\nservice says this is the place to go if you have only one hour, and its\nAnhinga Trail is said to be outstanding for seeing wildlife especially wading\nbirds.From the main park road in this area, you can drive 38 miles to the\nFlamingo Visitor Center, the gateway to Florida Bay, which is at the southern\nend of the park and separates the mainland from the Florida Keys. Here you can\ncanoe or kayak, and you're apt to see a crocodile, given that you're in salt\nwater.To see the northern part of the park from a different angle, travel west\nfrom Miami on U.S. 41, heading for Everglades City on the Gulf of Mexico side.\nIt's about 85 miles from Miami, but you can break up the drive about halfway\nby stopping at the Shark Valley Visitor Center. There, you can take a two-hour\ntram ride on a 15-mile trail or rent bicycles.At Everglades City, the Gulf\nCoast Visitor Center is the main access to Ten Thousand Islands, accessible by\nboat tour or canoe. The shallows teem with marine wildlife, especially\nbabies.**Accessibility**Besides accessible visitor centers, the park has many\npaved trails, several of which are less than a mile long.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc624"},"content":"Roscoe’s House of Chicken and Waffles is a Los Angeles culinary institution,\ndishing up its soul food to the likes of Snoop Dogg and Magic Johnson.But now\nthe Long Beach chain is in trouble — its parent company, East Coast Foods\nInc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Friday.The filing came mere\nmonths after the company was ordered to pay $3.2 million to a former employee\nwon a wrongful termination and discrimination lawsuit against the chain.In\nfilings with U.S. Bankruptcy Court in California, East Coast Foods estimated\nthat it has debts between $10 million and $50 million. Its assets, on the\nother hand, total less than $50,000.Lawyers for East Coast Foods did not\nrespond to a request for comment. In court filings, the company did not say\nwhether bankruptcy would affect the day-to-day operations of its seven\nSouthland Roscoe's restaurants.Roscoe's has been dishing up its chicken-and-\nwaffle combos since 1975, along with Southern staples such as grits, biscuits\nand cornbread. In 2011, President Obama made an unannounced stop at the West\nLos Angeles spot when he was in town on a fundraising trip.As befitting an\neatery that started in the Southland, Roscoe’s has also been referenced in\nnumerous films, television and music. The late rapper Notorious B.I.G. name-\nchecks the chain in his song “Going back to Cali.” Samuel L. Jackson’s\ncharacter tempts an underling with a Roscoe’s meal in Quentin Tarantino’s 1997\ncrime drama “Jackie Brown.” Rapper Snoop Dogg took both Larry King and David\nBeckham to the chicken mecca on his reality TV show.But Roscoe’s has recently\nbeen at the center of less welcoming attention.In October, a judge in Los\nAngeles ordered the company to pay $3.2 million to Daniel Beasley, a former\nemployee who claimed that there was systemic racial discrimination at the\nchain. A jury awarded Beasley close to $1.7 million; he was also awarded $1.5\nmillion in attorney’s fees.In the suit, Beasley accused the company of giving\nLatino employees preferential treatment over black workers, including better\nschedules and shifts. Beasley said he was fired in retaliation when he tried\nto change those practices. He became homeless after losing his job, according\nto media reports.In court filings, East Coast Foods listed Beasley as one of\nits largest unsecured creditors.Bankruptcy experts speculated that the Chapter\n11 filing may have been sparked by something beyond the original judgment.“The\njudgment, that’s a big number, but I wouldn’t think that was a big number for\na large restaurant chain,” said Eric Pezold, a partner specializing in\nbankruptcy at Snell \u0026amp; Wilmer who is not involved with the bankruptcy or\nthe Beasley case. He said something else may have occurred “between there and\nnow to precipitate this filing.”Beasley’s attorney, Scott Cummings, said he\nhad hired a lawyer to start the process of collecting on the judgment, which\nRoscoe’s is appealing. Cummings said he was worried that the bankruptcy filing\nwas an attempt to get away from paying what is owed to his client.“It looks\nstrange,” he said. “I’m very concerned that might be what’s going\non.”shan.li@latimes.comTwitter: @ByShanLi\n\n","title":"Parent company of Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles files for bankruptcy protection - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Parent company of Roscoe's House of Chicken and Waffles files for bankruptcy protection https://t.co/v7dShKdXrn https://t.co/Yj6qd6MlHp","date":"Tue Mar 29 21:15:16 +0000 2016","favs":29,"id":{"$numberLong":"714923905224478721"},"retweets":56},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1Th1QcI"}

That ended a heated\nfaceoff that highlighted the growing tensions between law enforcement and the\ntechnology industry.**FULL COVERAGE: Apple's fight with the FBI\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Here's how both sides won and lost:**Winner: Apple**The last thing\nthe iPhone-maker wanted was to set a precedent that allowed law enforcement to\nforce tech companies to undermine their own security. By fighting the FBI's\npush to compel Apple engineers to write software that would circumvent\nFarook's passcode, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook framed his company as taking\na principled fight for privacy in the digital age. With Monday's news, Apple\nkeeps its principles intact and sends a message that it will stand up for\ncustomer security.**Loser: FBI**The agency gambled that the San Bernardino\nterrorist attack, which resulted in the slaughter of 14 people, would swing\npopular opinion and force Apple and other tech firms to cooperate more with\nlaw enforcement when it comes to encryption. That wager failed and the FBI's\ncredibility took a hit when it insisted Apple was the only organization that\ncould unlock Farook's phone -- only to later admit an outside party had\nachieved the feat.****See the most-read stories this hour\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;******Winner: FBI**Forget for a second that this was a clash of ideals\nover privacy and national security. The FBI ultimately succeeded in gaining\naccess to a valuable piece of evidence in a case that represents the worst\nterrorist attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11. Information on the phone could\nhelp identify co-conspirators and answer other open questions about the\nattack. **Loser: Apple**The iPhone was supposed to be a paradigm of security.\nNow, the FBI is sitting on a vulnerability that apparently defeats Apple's\nsecurity measures. That could ultimately hurt Apple's bottom line if consumers\nbegin to take privacy more seriously as a result of the high-profile case.\nMoreover, Apple is probably desperate to know how the FBI cracked Farook's\npasscode. And there's no guarantee -- and perhaps little likelihood -- the\ngovernment will reveal to the company how it did it.**Join the conversation on\nFacebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;****Winner: Apple and FBI**Apple stood firm in the face of\nlegal threats, framing the company as a protector of privacy rights.

The company's business and relationship with\nregulators there would be significantly strained if it was forced to provide\nspecial access for U.S. agents to its hardware. Though China loves the iPhone,\nits leaders are deeply suspicious of American technology and fear they could\nbe accessed by U.S. spies.By cracking Farook's phone, the FBI puts criminals\nand terrorists on notice.

Gen. Kamala\nHarris, the current frontrunner, has not budged from the level of support she\nregistered shortly after entering into the race a year ago, despite spending\nnearly $4 million on her campaign.Harris’ top Democratic rival, U.S. Rep.\nLoretta Sanchez (D-Santa Ana), has shown small gains since the fall in Los\nAngeles County and the Central Valley.

Support for Harris failed to increase even after she\nreceived the endorsement of California Democratic Party in late February.While\nthe candidates have traveled up and down the state for months, mostly\nnetworking with party loyalists and donors, the radio and television ads that\nconsumed previous high-profile, statewide political races have been noticeably\nabsent.

I know Kamala Harris and\nLoretta Sanchez are in it, but I’m not too comfortable with them,” said Jose\nTorres, a Republican property manager from Tustin who took part in the\npoll.Torres, 39, couldn’t name any of the Republicans running for Senate, but\nsaid he plans to study up before the June primary.“It doesn’t take much to\nresearch a few of those candidates,” he said.Marylou Slagle, a Democratic\nhomemaker from Temecula, said she's supporting Harris because she believes she\nhas done a good job as state attorney general and there \"haven't been any\nnasty rumblings about her.\"  Slagle, 62, also acknowledged that she hasn't\nbeen paying much attention to the race or the other candidates, though.“I'm\nreally focused on what’s going on with the presidential race right now,\" she\nsaid.Under the rules of California’s “jungle primary” election, the two\ncandidates who receive the most votes in the June election — regardless of\nparty — will face off in the November election.While Harris and Sanchez have\ntopped the polls in the Senate race for months, the outcome of the June 7\nprimary remains difficult to predict because of the vast pool of undecided\nvoters.The USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times survey on the Senate race found that\n32% of registered voters in California were undecided. Among Republicans and\nindependent voters — those registered as “no party preference” — roughly 40%\nwere undecided.Given that volatility in the electorate, there is still a\nstrong possibility that one of the Republicans in the race could emerge as the\nGOP consensus candidate and edge out Sanchez, said Dan Schnur, who directs\nUSC's Jesse M. Unruh Institute of Politics.If one of the Republicans can pump\n$1 million into a strategic ad campaign targeting loyal GOP voters — or if a\nCalifornia Republican mega-donor such as Charles Munger bankrolls an\nindependent expenditure campaign — that might be enough to squeak out a\nsecond-place finish in the primary, Schnur said.“It’s pretty clear that even a\nvery small amount of money … could end up getting them into a runoff,” he\nsaid.  A freewheeling mega-donor might be the best hope. At the end of 2015,\nSundheim had less than $70,000 in his campaign account, and Del Beccaro just\nunder $40,000, federal election records show.Another wild card will be the\nGOP’s presidential race, which looks like it will barrel into the California\nprimary without a crowned nominee. If other state primaries are an indication,\nRepublican voter turnout could increase 20% to 40%, while Democratic turnout\nmight be below normal.That, too, could give a Republican candidate an edge if\nGOP voters can coalesce behind one candidate before June, Schnur said. If not,\nthe splintered Republican vote might give Sanchez the opening she needs to nab\none of the two spots on the November ballot.Here is the methodology statement\nfor the USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll.Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research,\nin conjunction with American Viewpoint, conducted this survey on behalf of the\nUniversity of Southern California Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and\nSciences and the Los Angeles Times....Here is the methodology statement for\nthe USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll.Greenberg Quinlan Rosner Research, in\nconjunction with American Viewpoint, conducted this survey on behalf of the\nUniversity of Southern California Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and\nSciences and the Los Angeles Times....According to the survey, Harris'\nstrongest support is in the Bay Area, where she served as San Francisco's\ndistrict attorney before being elected attorney general.

He's responsible and\nindustrious, she said, juggling graduate studies and work. His hobbies include\nfishing, hiking and reading.\"He has everything ready. He owns a home,\" she\nsaid in Korean before handing the microphone to her son.He apologized for his\npoor Korean and switched to English. \"I don't know. I guess I'm looking for a\nnice girl who's outgoing, and that's it,\" he said.**Interested in the stories\nshaping California? Sign up for the free Essential California newsletter\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**In the audience, Korean parents filling nine tables each hunched\nover a list, pens and highlighters in hand, with the seriousness of bidders\neyeing a prized work of art. Some scribbled notes; some circled entry No. 647,\nwhich read: \"Son — 30 years old.\" A hushed sense of purpose and the cloying\nscent of air freshener hung in the room.Wearing color-coded and numbered name\ntags — red for daughters, blue for sons — the parents were there to tackle\nwhat one organizer called the biggest social issue facing the Korean immigrant\ncommunity: Young men and women are too busy with their lives and careers to\nstart a family.\"Seek, and ye shall find,\" Simon Jung, the night's emcee, told\nthe crowd, citing Matthew 7:7. \"Do you want a good son-in-law? Then you have\nto seek, you have to find.\"**::**Young people in the U.S. are choosing to\nmarry later and later, many satisfied with dating well into their late 30s and\n40s or living with a significant other without tying the knot. That has been a\nsource of much heartburn for first-generation Korean immigrants, for whom\ngetting their children settled in wedlock is the culmination of their\nobligation as parents.Jae-dong Kim, a gastroenterologist and Catholic deacon,\ncame up with the idea for an event connecting parents with unmarried children\nsix years ago, while marrying off the last of his four offspring.He saw many\nfellow Koreans who were stressed out about their kids' marital prospects but\npowerless to do much about it. A handful of professional marriage consultants\nwere charging exorbitant fees, sometimes in the thousands of dollars, for\nintroductions.\"I realized it was a grave social issue our immigrant society\nneeds to address,\" he said.In April 2010, Kim, Jung and others from their\nchurch started _Chungsil Hongsil_, so named for the blue and red thread used\nin traditional Korean marital rites to symbolize the union between a husband\nand wife.They invited Koreans of all religions and professions and charged a\nfee to cover the costs of renting the space and serving dinner.The result is a\ncross between a business pitch meeting, speed dating and bingo night.Each\nparent, and in a few cases the children themselves, gives a two-minute\nintroduction, laying out the bachelor's or bachelorette's age, profession,\neducation, hobbies, religion, Korean proficiency and anything else that might\nbe of interest.In their day back in Korea, it was typical for parents to\narrange set-up dates for marriage prospects. And in the age of Tinder and\neHarmony, these Korean American parents are taking matters into their own\nhands.**::**Late on a Sunday afternoon earlier this month, the parents arrived\nat the Oxford Palace Hotel in Koreatown, some from as far as Oregon and\nCanada, each clutching a photo of a son, a daughter or both.The event\norganizers assigned each a number between 629 and 677, picking up from where\nthe numbers left off at the last gathering.They mingled awkwardly over a\nbuffet dinner, warily feeling out one another as they waited for the main\nevent to begin. A few repeat attendees, who hadn't found a successful match in\nprevious meetings or had returned to offer up a different offspring, greeted\nthe organizers.At one corner table, three sets of parents and a father\ncompared their children's \"specs,\" as Koreans refer to factors such as\neducation and profession. They exchanged flattery over photos of one another's\nchildren.\"They're so busy studying and getting their degrees. It's all about\ntiming,\" lamented the husband of couple No. 670.\"The smarter ones have a\nharder time at it,\" chimed in father No. 659, wearing two name tags because he\nwas presenting both his son and his daughter.Jung kicked off the night by\nurging parents to be proactive and to make sure to remember the numbers of the\nyoung men or women who piqued their interest. He then turned over the floor to\nthe parents themselves.Mother No. 632, a petite woman dressed smartly in a\nhoundstooth jacket, spoke of how she was losing sleep over her unmarried son\nand daughter, ages 38 and 37.Her daughter, a freelance writer who likes to\nread and do yoga, is \"looking for someone with a clear soul — and she says\nit's OK if his looks are just average,\" she said. Her son, a straight-laced\nbiomedical engineer who doesn't touch alcohol or cigarettes, would like to\nmeet a woman who is pretty and calm.Father No. 635, a balding man with a\nbooming voice, said it was his third time at the gathering. He was looking for\npotential mates for his two sons, 41 and 39, both dentists like him. He had\ngone as far as taking out an ad in the local Koreatown paper in search of\ndaughters-in-law, thus far to no avail.\"They're tall, and much better-looking\nthan their father,\" he said, to laughs. \"But they seem to have high\nstandards.\"Bachelor No. 644, wearing an ill-fitting suit and tie, his hair\nneatly combed, was the first of the night to have shown up in person with his\nmother.The 37-year-old stood smiling sheepishly, slouching with his hands\nfolded in front of him, as his mother introduced him as a loving and\nunderstanding bioengineer with two older sisters. He likes to sing, and he\nfinished the San Diego Marathon, she said.\"Isn't it convenient when the goods\nshow up themselves like this?\" Jung said. \"Let's give him a round of\napplause.\"**::**At the very first meeting six years ago, Patrick C. Park\nshowed up to help out as a volunteer. But as he was listening to the\npresentations, he was particularly impressed by one bachelor. This young man,\nhe thought, would be great for his daughter, so he asked for his contact\ninformation.His daughter, having been raised in the U.S., balked at the idea,\nskeptical of and embarrassed by the parental matchmaking. She eventually\nagreed to give the man a chance, Park recalled. In November, she gave birth to\ntheir first son.Park and his wife have volunteered for every event since then\n— 16 of them so far.\"It's giving an opportunity for good people who want to\ncreate beautiful families to meet each other,\" he said.The organizers don't\nkeep track of successful matches, leaving everything but the initial\nintroduction to the young men and women themselves. But they say they've heard\nof many happy couples whose parents thank them profusely. One pair is getting\nhitched next month.Among those at this month's event who were hoping to become\nanother success story were a mother looking for matches for her fraternal\ntwins — a brother and sister — and a mother who told the story of how she and\nher son, then 6, came to the U.S. with just a suitcase after suffering\n\"heartache\" in Korea.Parent after parent described how in their eyes, each of\ntheir children was precious and nearly perfect — and would make someone very\nhappy.\"I would like for it to be someone who's rich,\" said father No. 671, who\nhas a 34-year-old daughter. \"Not in money, but in heart.

Whipping out photos mid-interaction can lead to awkward moments if you\ndon't like what you see.Don't be discouraged if a parent of someone you're\ninterested in is talking to somebody else — think of your children's future\nand swallow your pride.Kim also advised parents to lie to their kids. Tell\nthem a nice family acquaintance wants to set you up, he said, as the younger\ngeneration may be mortified by the idea of this type of event.Some parents\nmilled about, reluctant to make the first move. Others eagerly flitted from\ntable to table, collecting phone numbers or email addresses.One mother in a\nlavender fur-cuff coat and bright red lipstick searched frantically: \"Are you\n661?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc628"},"content":"Patty Duke, like so many child actors before and after, lived her life in the\npublic eye. That spotlight brought to focus her most private struggles as she\nbecame a powerful advocate for mental illness awareness in addition to being a\ngifted actress. Duke died early Tuesday morning in Coeur d’Alene, Idaho, of\n“sepsis from a ruptured intestine,” according to a statement from her manager.\nShe was 69 years old. In 1963, when she was just 16, she became the youngest\nperson at the time to win an Oscar for supporting actress for her portrayal of\nHelen Keller in “The Miracle Worker,” a role she originated on Broadway. “I\ndon’t think it will change things for me,” the starlet told The Times after\nshe won. “I’m still just one of the kids.”The truth was more complicated.\nDuke’s life was marked with both success and struggle. Her earliest years were\nmarred by an alcoholic father and a violently depressive mother. From the time\nshe was 8, Duke was raised by talent managers John and Ethel Ross. In her\nmemoir “Call Me Anna,” Duke revealed that the Rosses left her little control\nover her career or life and began supplying her with alcohol and prescription\nmedication when she was 13.Undeterred by the challenges of her upbringing,\nDuke continued to find success through her craft. After her Oscar win for “The\nMiracle Worker,” Duke told The Times, “It seems like a dream. I’m still not\nsure if it happened. When they announced it, I just sat there. I couldn’t\nmove.” The actress had already won acclaim for the role onstage. She noted\nthat had she grown taller, she might never have had the opportunity to play\nthe role of the young Keller, who could not see, speak or hear after a\nchildhood illness. Duke said a clause in her contract when she took the role\nin 1959 allowed for the producers to dismiss her if she grew 2 inches. Despite\nher early success in “The Miracle Worker,” Duke’s film career faltered,\nleading her instead to conquer the small screen with her own show. Duke\ndebuted on “The Patty Duke Show” in 1963, in which she played both main\ncharacters Patricia “Patty” Lane, all-American teenager, and Catherine “Cathy”\nLane, her identical cousin from Scotland.  “Patty was very embarrassing to\nme,” the actress told The Times in 2013. “They would write those outrageous\nthings for her to do. I would dive in and do it, but I couldn’t wait to get to\nCathy. She was sensible, and I’d like to think she was classy.” Patty Duke,\nwho died Tuesday at age 69, sat down with The Times' Susan King in 2013 to\ndiscuss TV fave \"The Patty Duke Show\" on the eve of the show's 50th\nanniversary.Fifty years ago this fall, ABC premiered \"The Patty Duke Show,\"\nthe endearing sitcom starring the then-16-year-old as the mischievous...Patty\nDuke, who died Tuesday at age 69, sat down with The Times' Susan King in 2013\nto discuss TV fave \"The Patty Duke Show\" on the eve of the show's 50th\nanniversary.Fifty years ago this fall, ABC premiered \"The Patty Duke Show,\"\nthe endearing sitcom starring the then-16-year-old as the mischievous...The\nshow had a slightly surreal concept and a catchy theme song — “Where Cathy\nadores a minuet / the Ballet Russes and crêpes suzette / our Patty loves to\nrock and roll / a hot dog makes her lose control — what a wild duet!” It also\nboasted such guest stars as Sammy Davis Jr., Peter Lawford, Frankie Avalon,\nSal Mineo and the British pop duo Chad and Jeremy. Duke eventually found peace\nwith her struggle playing TV’s famous cousins, she told The Times in\n2002.“When you walk down the street and a total stranger sings a 40-year-old\ntheme to you, you go, ‘Someone was paying attention.’ I love it! Strangers nod\nand smile or call out, ‘I love you,’ ” Duke said. “What a nice way to go\nthrough life.”Long before celebrities shared their private struggles on talk-\nshow couches and social media feeds, actress Patty Duke broke a Hollywood\ntaboo by speaking publicly about her mental health struggles.Duke, who died\nTuesday morning at age 69, was diagnosed with manic depression (now called\nbipolar...Long before celebrities shared their private struggles on talk-show\ncouches and social media feeds, actress Patty Duke broke a Hollywood taboo by\nspeaking publicly about her mental health struggles.Duke, who died Tuesday\nmorning at age 69, was diagnosed with manic depression (now called\nbipolar...After her stint as Patty and Cathy Lane on television, Duke tried to\ntransition back to film with a controversial performance as Neely O’Hara in\n“Valley of the Dolls,” in which the actress portrayed an alcoholic, drug-\naddled star. Seeing the actress in the role caused severe dissonance for\naudiences and critics alike, even as the film found a cult audience with\ntime.Later, Duke would discover her passion for mental illness awareness\nadvocacy, a quest that rose out of her own diagnosis with bipolar disorder in\n1982. Duke credited medication and therapy for aiding her recovery; she was\nthe first celebrity, via her 1987 autobiography, to make her struggle with\nbipolar disorder public.The actress had said she was grateful for her close\nrelationships with son and “The Lord of the Rings” star Sean Astin, 45, and\nhis actor brother, Mackenzie Astin, 42, despite the rough childhood to which\nshe subjected them before her illness was diagnosed. Her family called her\nAnna Banana. After Sean had his own children, she became Nana Anna Banana. “I\nhad no patience,” she admitted to The Times. “The thing that these kids had\ngoing against them was that you never knew when what was all hunky-dory was\ngoing to fly out the window and you were going to be screamed at and berated\nand either ostracized or made to do some humiliating punishment.” Patty Duke,\nformer child star and Academy Award winner, died on Tuesday. She was 69. She\nmay have been a theater veteran, but Duke never sang or danced on stage until\nStephen Sondheim's \"Follies\" in 2002.

In 1988, Pearce and Duke adopted a son, Kevin, who became\na firefighter.Now her son Sean hopes his mother’s mental health advocacy\ncontinues after her death.“Before the suffering became too great, we talked\nabout how the core mission of her mental health work might continue beyond her\nlife,” Sean said in the introduction to a newly launched Crowdrise campaign in\nhis mother’s honor, the proceeds of which will be used to establish the Patty\nDuke Mental Health Initiative, dedicated to continuing support of mental\nhealth programs. Of his mother, Sean said, “She became a voice for the\nvoiceless, a reassuring presence for the scared, the intimidated and the lost.\nShe was a healer of many souls and a champion for so many in need.”**FROM THE\nARCHIVES: ****Patty Duke looks back on 'The Patty Duke Show'  \n****Patty Duke was a child star on screen, but a late bloomer on stage****Our 1962 review of Patty Duke’s Oscar-winning performance: A ‘Miracle’ Picture?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc629"},"content":"As he stood behind a lectern to announce a brokered deal to raise California's\nminimum wage, Gov. Jerry Brown seemed unfazed by the suggestion that the\nagreement offered a glimpse into his political success. The compromise, Brown\nsaid, was simply a product of knowledge gained from years on the\njob.\"Governing is not about just having some idea, or some slogan, or some\nsound bite,\" he said at Monday's news conference. \"Governing does have its own\nskills.\"Those are skills, it seems, that voters think Brown is putting to good\nuse.A new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll finds Brown — who is entering\nthe sixth year of an unprecedented run as governor — with solid job approval\nnumbers across a wide spectrum of California voters.Overall, 60% of those\npolled approve of how Brown is doing his job as governor. Brown's recent\nshowing is 7 percentage points higher than a similar poll taken late last\nsummer and is tied for his second-highest job approval rating since returning\nto office in 2011.\"He embraces everything the job is supposed to be,\" said Rob\nStutzman, a GOP political strategist who led the campaign of Brown's 2010\ngubernatorial rival, Republican Meg Whitman.See the results of the most recent\nUSC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times statewide public opinion polls about the June 7\npresidential primary and how national and state politicians are viewed in\nCalifornia. See the results of the most recent USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times\nstatewide public opinion polls about the June 7 presidential primary and how\nnational and state politicians are viewed in California. Although it's not\nsurprising the governor wins praise from his own party faithful — 80% of\nDemocrats approve of his job performance in the new survey — Brown's real\nstrength may rest on his ability to placate some of his natural political\nenemies. Twenty-seven percent of Republicans polled say they too approve of\nthe governor's job performance.Even more notable, 19% of registered\nRepublicans who say they plan to vote in June for businessman Donald Trump\nnonetheless approve of how Brown is handling things in Sacramento.Brown's job\napproval rating seems to transcend party lines.In the new poll's subset of\nadults who said that California is headed in the wrong direction, 32% still\napprove of Brown's efforts. Then there are the 35% of those who say that\nillegal immigration is a \"crisis\" but approve of the governor's record on the\njob, which includes substantial new benefits for some of those without legal\nimmigration status.And there's this finding from the new poll: 23% of\nCalifornians who disapprove of how President Obama is doing his job feel just\nfine about Brown.\"He does not behave like a typical politician,\" Stutzman said\nof the governor. \"There's something to it that people find refreshing.\"In the\nstate Capitol, Brown has cultivated the perception that he's the saucer that\ncools the otherwise liberal cup of hot Democratic politics, often clashing\nwith the most progressive factions of his party. Some of his efforts include\nrefusing to restore hundreds of millions of dollars in recession-era cuts to\nsocial services, rejecting efforts to ban oil drilling by hydraulic fracturing\nand vetoing sweeping gun-control proposals. \"He has disappointed me at times\nbecause I have my own view of the world,\" said state Sen. Mark Leno (D-San\nFrancisco), one of the longest-serving legislators. \"But in general, I marvel\nat his thoughtfulness, his comprehensive understanding of very complex issues\nand his political sense of what is doable and what is not.\"It's an admiration\nalso shared by those outside Sacramento.**See the most-read stories this hour\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**\"The thing I've appreciated about Gov. Brown's leadership and legacy\nis that he's as idealistic as they come, but also as pragmatic as they come,\"\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said. \"He holds his cards close to his chest,\nbut he plays them very well for the people of California.\"That kind of\npolitical acumen may be better now than it was in his first iteration as\ngovernor in the 1970s and early 1980s. Even so, Brown faces sizable political\nhurdles before 2016 is over.

In announcing the agreement to reporters, the\ngovernor conceded that his overall success is no doubt linked to the improving\nCalifornia economy since inheriting a $26-billion budget shortfall in 2011.In\nApril 2011, a USC/Los Angeles Times poll put Brown's approval at 44%. In\ncontrast, his job-approval numbers have now been above the 50% mark for more\nthan two years.

Not\nfor the first time. This one, however, stands out from the...In his post,\nMiller recalls the occasion of the photo being taken and the headlines it\nspurred at the time, “Hunk To Chunk,” “Fit To Flab,” but also goes further as\nto share the circumstances surrounding the image.“In 2010, semi-retired from\nacting, I was keeping a low-profile for a number of reasons. First and\nforemost, I was suicidal,” Miller wrote in his post, going on to explain that\nthough it was a matter he’s been comfortable speaking about since, at the\ntime, like so many other victims of depression, he suffered in silence.“I\nconsidered myself damaged goods. … I've struggled with depression since\nchildhood. It's a battle that's cost me time, opportunities, relationships,\nand a thousand sleepless nights,” Miller wrote.In 2010, Miller reports looking\nto anesthetize the pain any way that he could, be it drugs, alcohol, sex or,\nyes, food.“There were stretches when the highlight of my week was a favorite\nmeal and a new episode of ‘Top Chef.’ Sometimes that was enough. Had to\nbe.”Miller’s sentiment is one likely all too familiar to sufferers of\ndepression and, though his first reaction to seeing the post pop up on his\nsocial media feed was one of pain and dismay, he now recognizes the photos for\nwhat they are: evidence of his survival.“Now, when I see that image of me in\nmy red t-shirt, a rare smile on my face, I am reminded of my struggle. My\nendurance and my perseverance in the face of all kinds of demons. Some within.\nSome without. Like a dandelion up through the pavement, I persist. Anyway.\nStill.

What we're making fun of is the fear.\nThe character I play is a homophobe, but she's a homophobe because she's based\nher entire value system on her faith, a thing that's given her an enormous\nsense of purpose, stability and spiritual comfort. When you rely on something\nlike that, and it tells you that anyone who is gay is going to burn in hell,\nyou don't want your son to burn in hell. That's really where Eileen is coming\nfrom. It's not coming from a place of hatred. It's my hope that when people\nsee the show, they'll understand that we're not out to humiliate anyone who is\ncoming from this perspective.**Did you have any reservations about returning\nto the grind of network TV?**None whatsoever. I felt extremely \"hashtag\nblessed,\" man, to have been given another chance to make a living and pay my\nmortgage.**Your parents, Shelley Plimpton and Keith Carradine, are both\nactors. Was show business always a given for you?**It was kind of accidental.\nI was 8 years old. You're not really terribly aware of career decisions at the\nage of 8, but I was a showoff and a pain … and constantly performing. My\nmother and her friend [theater director] Elizabeth Swados were working\ntogether when Liz said, \"Maybe we should put Martha in one of my shows?\" I\nthink my mother sort of felt like, \"Oh, good. It will give her a little focus\nand get her out of my hair for a second.\" We didn't pursue it really\nintensely. My mother was very insistent that I not become famous quickly and\nthat, if I wanted to do this, then I think about myself as an actor rather\nthan as a celebrity.**But you did become quite successful at a young age.**I\nwas lucky. It spoiled me a little. I thought that I would be sort of a\nfabulous leading lady by the time I was 25, and that was not happening at all\nfor so many reasons. If you're working with all these incredible people like\nRon Howard and Sidney Lumet and Marty Ritt, you start to think that you're hot\n... but life's got other plans.I read this really awesome interview with\nWinona Ryder recently where she said that she had gone through a period in her\nlate teens where she was losing parts to me, which I found shocking. When I\nwas that age, I was thinking, \"Why can't I play more lead roles?\" It's just a\nwonderful reminder to let all that go and just be present in your own life or,\nas my friend Kelly likes to say, \"Keep your eye on your own paper.\"**You said\nyou were spoiled. Did you feel like there were fewer opportunities as you\nmatured?**Yes. There were so many fantastic actresses in the '80s who had\nthese unusual, interesting faces and a kind of brio, like Lili Taylor and Mary\nStuart Masterson. It was possible to be a tomboy. We don't have those anymore.\nThat started to go away in the mid-'90s and 2000s. The standards for female\nperformers really started to change. I look like a character actor. Which, by\nthe way, is something I'm extremely grateful for, but I think I had to wake up\nto that. I got to play romantic roles in the '80s, or at least roles that were\ncentral to the plot. That all changed as I got older and tastes changed.\nBecause that changed, there wasn't very much for me to do. That's why I was\ndoing so much in theater, because that just doesn't apply. Women are subjected\nto these cultural trends in a way that men aren't. We're like the canaries in\nthe coal mine.**Outside of your acting work, you founded a non****profit\norganization, A Is For, to defend abortion rights, and have been very\noutspoken on the issue.**The radical Republican obsession with women's bodies\nis sort of a national illness. I mean, these are literally people who just\nwill propose nothing in any other area except for the regulation and\nrestriction of abortion or access to birth control. It seems to be their only\ndesire. … It's, to me, a fundamental reality.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc62d"},"content":"Attorneys who defend many juveniles charged with serious crimes in Los Angeles\nCounty get fewer resources and less oversight than in other large California\ncounties, according to a long-awaited report released Monday.Most youths\ncharged with crimes in L.A. County are represented by deputy public defenders\nif their families can't afford to hire private defense attorneys. When there\nis a potential conflict of interest — for instance, if the public defender's\noffice is already representing another defendant charged in the same case —\nprivate attorneys who contract with the county are appointed. Those lawyers,\nknown as panel attorneys, are paid a flat rate of $340 to $360 per\ncase.Advocates have argued for years that the rate is too low for the amount\nof work required to provide an effective defense, and that children suffer as\na result.The county commissioned researchers at UC Berkeley's Chief Justice\nEarl Warren Institute on Law and Social Policy in 2014 to look into a wide-\nranging set of issues in the county's defense system for minors charged with\ncrimes.The researchers looked at the juvenile defense systems in 10 other\nlarge counties, including Orange, San Diego and San Bernardino, and found that\nLos Angeles is the only one that pays attorneys a flat per-case fee. In other\ncounties, attorneys representing minors accused of crimes were paid a salary\nor hourly rate, or were paid a flat fee that varied based on the type of case\nand how much work was involved.They also found that L.A. was the only county\nsurveyed with no centralized body providing oversight or quality control for\nthe panel attorneys, and the only one that did not give them access to county-\npaid investigators to help them prepare a defense.Public defenders have access\nto investigators through their office, but the private panel attorneys must\nhire their own investigators and pay them out of pocket.The report found panel\nattorneys in L.A. County had higher caseloads than those in other counties.\nThe annual caseload averaged 289, but one attorney handled as many as 661\ncases a year. In Alameda County, panel attorneys handled about 14 cases a\nyear, and in Kern County, the average was 75 to 80.**Interested in the stories\nshaping California? Sign up for the free Essential California newsletter\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**The private panel attorneys are assigned about 28% of juvenile cases\nfiled in L.A. County each year, but handle many of the most serious cases,\nincluding representing the bulk of juveniles who faced potential trial as\nadults. Among those youths, the ones represented by panel attorneys were more\nlikely to end up being transferred to adult court, the researchers found — 26%\ncompared with 13% of those represented by public defenders over the last five\nyears.The researchers found that panel attorneys in those cases \"consulted\nless often with experts, provided less documentation to support the client and\nfiled fewer motions.\"Minors represented by the panel attorneys were also more\noften sent to state or county lockups, the report found.An earlier report on\nthe same issue completed by Loyola Law School made similar findings.Critics\nargued that the Loyola report failed to take into account other factors that\nmight influence case outcomes, such as the history of the juveniles involved\nand the more complex nature of many of the cases assigned to panel\nattorneys.The Berkeley researchers acknowledged, \"It is possible that the\ndifference in outcomes is a result of different resource use and attorney\npractices. It is also possible, however, that the difference in outcomes is a\nresult of different types of clients.\"But Cyn Yamashiro, an attorney and\ncounty probation commission member who headed up the research for the earlier\nreport, said the new research validated his team's findings.\"The problem with\nthe model that L.A. uses is it provides lawyers the exact opposite incentive\nyou would want your lawyer to have if they were working for you,\" he\nsaid.Yamashiro and other advocates argue that the minors who can't be\nrepresented by the public defenders office should go to the county's alternate\npublic defender office, as adults and a small number of juveniles do\nnow.Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas, who originally asked for the review, said\nhe wants to have the county's chief executive look at that and other options\nfor overhauling the juvenile defense system, such as changing the fee\nstructure and asking the county bar association to provide oversight of the\npanel attorneys.\"The need to make sure that justice is done for these\njuveniles is a high priority, and the extent to which they have not been\nadequately served can no longer be tolerated,\" he\nsaid.abby.sewell@latimes.com**Twitter: @sewella****Join the conversation on\nFacebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;****ALSO****What's ahead for bullet train funding?

In many instances, the women told similar stories of being\ndrugged and then assaulted in instances that spanned many years. In most\ncases, statutes of limitation have passed for criminal and civil actions.“I\nwant Bill Cosby in court,\" Dickinson said after the ruling. \"I want him to\nstand under oath.\" Dickinson sued Cosby in May, after he denied her allegation\nthat he drugged and raped her in Lake Tahoe in 1982.“Ms. Dickinson alleges\nthat Mr. Cosby, through his attorney, defamed Ms. Dickinson by issuing a press\nstatement calling her a liar when she publicly accused Mr. Cosby of drugging\nand raping her,” said Dickinson’s attorney Lisa Bloom. “For nine months, Mr.\nCosby has sought to have her case thrown out. Today, Judge Debre Weintraub\nfound that Ms. Dickinson had offered sufficient evidence…” The suit alleges\nthe denial by Cosby's former lawyer, Marty Singer, caused her to feel\nvictimized again in November 2014 Dickinson has said she tried to include the\nstory in a 2002 memoir, \"No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the\nWorld's First Supermodel,\" but her publisher refused. Dickinson said she\nrecalled Cosby getting on top of her and then the next morning awakened to\nfind her pajamas off and semen between her legs.Cosby's legal team sought to\ndismiss the suit, alleging that Dickinson's story about her interactions with\nCosby had changed over the years.Cosby’s legal team can be expected to make\nmore attempts to eliminate the lawsuit. The judge has already ruled that the\nletters Singer sent to journalists warning them against publishing Dickinson’s\nclaims cannot be introduced as evidence, because they are protected legal\ncommunications.Cosby's lawyer Monique Pressley said in a statement that they\nare considering an appeal of the judge’s decision and will continue to seek to\nhave Dickinson's lawsuit dismissed.Cosby also faces criminal charges for the\nalleged sexual assault of a former Temple University coach at his then-\nPhiladelphia home in 2004.

In fact, _all_ the social media posts mentioned in this story have\nsince been deleted. There are now 2 million people following her completely\nempty Instagram page.\"Don't believe the blogs you read .. No one was cheated\non and I'm not a bad person... everyone is hurt and everyone is in a place of\nmisunderstanding.. But as of today, I had no single wish to see tomorrow,\" the\nsinger wrote on social media \"But God saved me for a reason and for that... I\nmust be grateful.. Cuz I'm not in heaven right now for a reason... On that\nnote.. Bye Instagram.\"Kehlani also thanked PartyNextDoor — whose posting of a\nphoto of himself in bed with her had kicked off the cheating rumors in the\nfirst place — for \"saving my life.\"  (\"After all her shenanigans, still got\nthe r\u0026amp;b singer back in my bed,\" he'd written.)The hashtag\n#StayStrongKehlani was trending on Twitter.After months of rumors that they\nwere dating, the singer and the NBA player had made their relationship\nInstagram official in January. But apparently they weren't all the way in\nlove. At least that's what she said early last month in an interview with ILY,\na \"digital magazine about love.\" Irving was making her \"very, very happy\" but\nshe was \"trying not to get too excited or get too crazy about the hype of\neverything.\"Somewhere between then and now, Kehlani and Irving broke up, but\nthey apparently didn't go public with _that_ news. Then up popped the picture\nfrom PartyNextDoor (real name is Jahron Brathwaite) with Kehlani. And so the\nhounds were unleashed.\"Went through a bad breakup and ended up easing into a\nrelationship with a man who was one of my bestfriend. Tho we realized we both\nweren't exactly at a time where we were prepared to do so,\" Kehlani would\nlater explain. \"No I'm not a CHEATER, a THOT, im a BELIEVER IN FOLLOWING YOUR\nHEART and not LYING TO YOURSELF. And in all aspects on everyone's side,\nEVERYONE IS HAPPY AND HONEST AND MATURE. Social media is the ... devil. Go\noutside and play, you have your own lives to live that don't revolve around\n'celebrities' or 'socialites' who are simply trying to live lives just like\nyou.\"She'd been way more enthusiastic about social media before the tide\nturned against her. But as social media giveth, so does social media taketh\naway.\"I'm still very emotional via social media. But, as far as social media,\nI think I've learned to only say things that could possibly be transferable to\nother people in forms of lessons, rather than making it so personal to where\npeople can't relate,\" the singer said in that ILY interview.Kehlani\nacknowledged that it could be difficult sharing a relationship in the realm of\nTwitter and Instagram.\"I think it's hard, because you have to balance dealing\nwith feedback and people trying to interfere and people knowing your business.\nEveryone wants to enjoy and be cute with who they’re with.\"Guess that last bit\ngoes for the guy as well as the girl?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc632"},"content":"Hi, and welcome to another edition of Dodgers Dugout. My name is Houston\nMitchell, and I may be the only person who thought “Batman v Superman: Dawn of\nJustice” was a good movie.**Line drives**Some random thoughts while waiting\nfor the season to begin on Monday:--I’d feel a lot more confident that last\nseason wasn’t a fluke if **Kiké Hernandez **wasn’t six for 40 this\nspring.\\--Manager **Dave Roberts** on **Kenta Maeda**, who has a 1.89 ERA this\nspring: “He's good, if not better, than advertised. His transition, up to his\npoint, has been pretty seamless.\" --There’s a chance **Howie Kendrick** and\n**Yasmani Grandal** could start the season on the disabled list.--In fact, at\nthis point it might be easier for the Dodgers to start listing the players who\naren’t injured instead of those who are.--Right now, they need Hernandez to\nstart at second base and left field, which I think might be difficult for him\nto pull off.--Or, as Hernandez put it while talking about his bruised ribs:\n“Of course, with the 35 other injuries we've had they want to be cautious.\nConsidering that I am everybody's backup.”--The Dodgers could start the season\nwith 10 players on the disabled list, which includes guys like **Brandon\nMcCarthy** and **Brett Anderson**.--**Corey Seager**, 21, will be the youngest\nDodger to start on opening day since **Adrian Beltre**, who was 19 when he\nstarted at third base in 1999.--I get a lot of emails from fans worried about\nSeager. But check out what **Clayton Kershaw** has to say about him: “Last\nyear watching what he did on the field, his at-bats and the way he moved at\nshortstop, you can just tell. His baseball instincts, he just knows what to\ndo. More than the results, it's the approach. He's not intimidated at all…. I\ndidn't do that well in my first year and a half. He's ahead of my career, for\nsure. You know, the expectations can get in your head at times. The problem\nis, people expect him to hit .330 and be the All-Star starter and all that\nstuff. And he very well could be. But if he hits .280 and plays great defense\nand gets on base, that's a great year.” --This is what **Adrian Gonzalez**\nsays about Seager: “You can tell by his composure, the way he has a feel for\nthe game, the way he handles himself in the clubhouse. Obviously, he has\ntalent. You can tell he has the ability to slow the game down and regroup.\"--\nI’m still predicting the Dodgers to finish second to the Giants this season.\nSome of you have written me to pick them to finish fourth, or even last. Which\ntells me some of you haven’t bothered to look at how bad the Rockies and\nPadres will be this season. **The TV deal**So, judging by the emails I got, a\ncouple hundred of you wrote the Dodgers or called Time Warner or your\ncable/satellite provider to complain about not being able to watch the\nDodgers. The responses that you got were infuriating.The Dodgers, in their\ninfinite wisdom, decided to respond with a form letter, taking the side of\nTime Warner Cable and putting the blame on the cable/satellite providers.\nThere are few things worse than sending a form letter, because it sends a\nmessage that you don’t really care what the person writing has to say and that\nyou view all fans as interchangeable. Many of the fans who wrote me and shared\nwith me the form letter response were very unhappy that the Dodgers would\nanswer their question in such a way.Here’s what the Dodgers send you if you\nwrite them:“Thank you for contacting the Los Angeles Dodgers and most of all,\nthank you for your continued support.“We appreciate you taking the time to\nemail and share your concerns with us. The Dodgers do care about their fans\nand we continue to work behind the scenes in hopes of resolving the\nimpasse.“We understand that you are frustrated that you are unable to watch\nDodgers games on TV.  Although your provider has still chosen not to provide\nyou with Dodger baseball, we know that your voice does matter.  In fact, it’s\neven more important than ever that you consistently contact your provider to\nlet them know that it’s critical that they launch SportsNet LA in order to\nkeep your business. You can also call 844-I-NEED-MY (844-463-3369) or visit\nwww.ineedmydodgers.com to voice your demand. “Your comments and support are\ngreatly appreciated, and we welcome your feedback at any time.”Wow, that’s\nreally quite the lame response. And if anyone on the Dodgers is reading this\nand is upset, don’t worry, I’m working behind the scenes to improve my\nattitude about the TV situation.Meanwhile, according to those of you who\ncontacted me about this, if you call Time Warner Cable, it blames the\ncable/satellite providers and if you call your cable/satellite providers, they\nblame Time Warner Cable and the Dodgers.Great world we live in, isn’t it?**And\nfinally****Vin Scully** held a 30-minute Q\u0026amp;A with reporters last week.\nBill Plaschke writes about it here, and there’s a video of the entire Q\u0026amp;A\non top of his column.Have a comment or something you'd like to see in a future\nDodgers newsletter? Email me and follow me on Twitter: @latimeshouston\n\n","title":"Dodgers Dugout: Will anyone on the team not injured please raise your hand? - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Will anyone on the team not injured please raise your hand?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc634"},"content":"As a student at South Pasadena High School, Katherine Uriarte aced six\nAdvanced Placement classes, got top scores on her ACT, served in student\ngovernment and nailed a summer internship at Caltech.It wasn't enough to get\ninto UCLA or UC Berkeley.The daughter of a Mexican immigrant, Uriarte still\nrealized her dream of becoming the first in her family to go to college. She\nis now a freshman at Columbia University in New York City with a full-ride\nscholarship from the Bill \u0026amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. But she said she\nfelt Californians like herself were losing out to a growing tide of students\nfrom other states and countries who want to go to UC schools.“I think they\nshould prioritize California students,” she said.A new state audit agrees. The\nscathing 116-page report released Tuesday accuses the University of California\nof hurting local students by admitting too many out-of-state applicants to its\ncampuses. It recommended stricter entrance requirements for nonresident\nstudents, a cap on their enrollment and more focus on recruiting Californians\n— particularly African Americans, Latinos and other underrepresented\nminorities.University of California President Janet Napolitano denounced the\naudit's conclusions as “disappointingly pre-baked” and “unfair and\nunwarranted.” She said auditors ignored the fact that higher-paying out-of-\nstate students contributed $728 million to UC coffers and allowed the\n10-campus system to accept more Californians in the face of massive budget\ncuts imposed since the 2008 recession.The audit — and reaction to it — raised\nthe stakes in an intense and long-running political controversy: whether the\nincrease in nonresident students to what is widely viewed as the finest public\nuniversity system in the nation has helped or hurt Californians.The audit was\nrequested more than a year ago by Assemblyman Mike Gipson (D-Carson), who has\nwatched with dismay as the enrollment of students from other states and\ncountries has grown to 15.5% of UC's total undergraduate enrollment, up from\nabout 5% eight years ago.The audit found that out-of-state applicants\nbenefited from lowered admission standards, while California students\nincreasingly were turned away from their campus of choice.“The university has\nundermined its commitment to residents in an effort to increase its revenue by\nrecruiting and enrolling nonresidents,” the audit said.“Because of the\nsignificant harm to residents and their families resulting from the\nuniversity's actions, we believe that legislative intervention ... is\nnecessary to ensure that a university education once again becomes attainable\nand affordable for all California residents who are qualified and desire to\nattend,” state auditor Elaine Howle said in a letter released with the\naudit.Gipson said he would immediately work with fellow legislators to push\nfor such actions as placing a cap on nonresident students and a public hearing\non the audit results.“My reaction is utter disgust,” Gipson said. “I'm going\nto use a harsh word, and the word is discrimination. We are disenfranchising\nCalifornia students.”UC officials insist that nonresident students don't\ndisplace Californians. Instead, they say, the nearly $25,000 in additional\ntuition that nonresidents pay each year has allowed UC to enroll thousands\nmore California students than the system could otherwise afford. Tuition and\nfees for out-of-state students totaled $38,108 this academic year, compared\nwith $13,400 for in-state students.Without the extra money from out-of-state\nstudents, Californians could have faced an additional $2,500 in tuition — a\nroughly 20% boost, Napolitano said.Tuition and fees have doubled since the\n2008 recession, but have remained flat — except for one fee increase — for the\nlast five years as part of an agreement between Napolitano and Gov. Jerry\nBrown that sent more than $3 billion in new dollars to the UC system.The\nUniversity of California has hurt local students by admitting so many out-of-\nstate applicants to its campuses and should be reined in with tough\nrestrictions, according to a sharply critical state audit released Tuesday.The\nUniversity of California has hurt local students by admitting so many out-of-\nstate applicants to its campuses and should be reined in with tough\nrestrictions, according to a sharply critical state audit released Tuesday.In\na separate deal, UC agreed to admit 5,000 additional California students for\nthe fall 2016 term in exchange for $25 million more and a continued lid on\ntuition increases.“Providing adequate state funding is the best way to\nincrease the number of California students enrolled at UC,” said a special\nreport on admissions and finances released Tuesday by university officials in\nanticipation of the audit.The report made the case that UC policies\n“overwhelmingly favor” California residents over nonresidents. The system\nguarantees admission to at least one campus for all eligible California\napplicants — those in the top 9% of their high school class who maintained at\nleast a 3.0 grade point average while taking a battery of required classes\nsuch as English and math. No such guarantee is offered to\nnonresidents.Californians are also admitted at higher rates, with 71% accepted\nto at least one campus of their choice compared with 55% for nonresidents.\nAnd, the report said, only Californians enjoy access to three state\nscholarship and grant programs that have helped more than half of UC's\nundergraduates enroll without paying any tuition or fees.UC data show that\nCalifornia undergraduate enrollment increased from 163,773 in fall 2008 to\n167,959 in fall 2015. During the same period, enrollment of out-of-state\nstudents grew from 9,000 to 30,907.Despite that growth, UC officials say their\npercentage of nonresident students is still significantly lower than the 40%\nenrolled at comparable public schools such as the universities of Oregon, Iowa\nand Michigan.Monica Lozano, chairwoman of the UC Board of Regents, said the\naudit was filled with erroneous conclusions. California students have always\ncome first, she said, and the regents will continue expanding access for them.\n“There is no doubt the primary focus and responsibility is for California\nstudents,” she said.Howle, however, said UC officials failed to provide\nevidence for their key claims. They have not shown, for instance, how they\nused the $728 million in nonresident tuition for more California\nstudents.“They never called into question any of the facts.... They just don't\nlike our conclusions,” Howle said. “But our conclusions are based on the\nfacts.”Hans Johnson, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Public Policy\nInstitute of California, said UC's decision to enroll more out-of-state\nstudents in the face of dramatic budget cuts was defensible.But he said he\nfavored reducing their numbers, as they now make up more than 20% of\nundergraduates at the most popular campuses, UCLA and UC Berkeley.With fewer\nnonresident students, he said, more Californians could win admission to their\ntop campus choices. Today, thousands of qualified students who are turned away\nfrom their selected campus are offered a seat at UC Merced, even if they did\nnot apply there.Gipson and others have raised concerns that those referred to\nUC Merced are disproportionately Latino and African American.With fewer out-\nof-state students, UC would need to make up the financial loss with more state\ndollars or higher tuition and fees, Johnson said. In his view, higher tuition\nshould be considered, as long as financial aid for low-income students\nincreases accordingly.The state finance department, however, has said that UC\nalso needs to control its costs. The audit recommends a biennial cost study\nand a review of how to reduce the $13 billion spent on staff salaries in\n2014-15. UC officials said they have reduced costs aggressively and will\ncontinue to seek new ways to do so.Gipson also asked that the audit\ninvestigate UC's progress in equalizing funding per student across campuses.\nAn audit from 2011 found that the four undergraduate campuses with more\nunderrepresented minorities received about $3,600 less per student, on\naverage, than the five campuses with fewer minorities.UC said that campuses\nwith more graduate students and health sciences programs — such as UCLA, UC\nBerkeley and UC Davis — were more costly to run. But officials have revised\ntheir formulas and expect state dollars will be equitably distributed by the\n2016-17 school year.The auditors also found that salaries of campus\nchancellors were low compared with other research universities. But they said\nofficials could have done more to reduce costs before raising tuition or\nadmitting more nonresidents, such as placing employees on furlough, as they\ndid in 2009.Napolitano said UC employees should be lauded for their\n“remarkable feat” in keeping academic quality high despite the intense budget\nchallenges.“We know that out-of-state enrollment is a sensitive point, and it\nshould be,” she said. “But this report is just wrong. It shouldn't overlook\nthe fact that the university continued to increase in-state enrollment and\ncontinued to provide a world-class education with some of the most highly\nranked academic programs in the world and the country.”**For more education\nnews, follow me **@TeresaWatanabe**ALSO****Say goodbye to eighth grade Algebra\n1 and hello to the rise of Common Core math****Report finds flaws in L.A.\nCounty's system for defending children accused of crimes****California\nproposal for state-run retirement plan for private-sector workers moves\nforward**Thirteen female students accused a UC Berkeley sociology professor of\nunwanted sexual advances, including hugs and attempted kisses.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc636"},"content":"Streaming music company SoundCloud has amassed an enormous following while\nmaintaining a roguish status in the growing industry for online tunes. Its 175\nmillion users have been able to access its remixes, covers and mash-ups for\nfree.But now the Berlin firm is joining the mainstream by launching a\nsubscription-based service, in an effort to increase revenue and grow its\naudience beyond the music aficionados and DJs that make up its loyal fan base.\nThe service will add tens of millions of licensed tracks from major label\nartists.The new service, dubbed SoundCloud Go, will, like most rivals, charge\n$9.99 a month for commercial-free access to its library. SoundCloud will offer\na month-long free trial and give users the ability to save songs to their\nphones and tablets. Those who don't pay will still have access to the free\nversion of SoundCloud, which plays ads. SoundCloud is coming late to the\nsubscription model, and will be entering a crowded space. Swedish competitor\nSpotify has attracted 30 million users to its paid version. Apple Music\nlaunched last summer with much fanfare and is still playing catchup with about\n11 million subscribers.It also remains to be seen whether the nascent\nstreaming business can produce profits.SoundCloud co-founder Eric Wahlforss\nacknowledged that the business of streaming music is competitive. Still, he\nargued, the company's vast catalog of songs and its network of \"creators\" set\nSoundCloud apart. Like YouTube, SoundCloud lets users upload their own\ntracks.\"Even though there are a few other players out there, SoundCloud has a\nvery clear place in this space,\" said Wahlforss, who is the company's chief\ntechnology officer. \"One of the things that makes SoundCloud really great is\nthat we have so many creators and so much content that isn't available\nanywhere else.\"The long-anticipated launch comes after years of negotiations\nwith record labels and music publishers, who have not always been friendly to\nthe upstart firm that was founded in 2008. Sony pulled its music from the site\nlast May over royalties, and the British songwriter group PRS for Music\naccused SoundCloud of failing to license its songs (SoundCloud eventually\nsettled with PRS).SoundCloud has long been controversial in the music\nindustry. Labels and artists including Drake and Kanye West have used the\nservice to promote new music, but the companies also have wanted to collect\nroyalties.In 2014, SoundCloud added advertising to its service to generate\nrevenue and compensate rights holders including artists and songwriters.In\norder to gain legitimacy, SoundCloud had to enter complicated licensing deals\nthat would let rights holders collect royalties from the service and let the\nservice's users remix and mash-up copyright-protected work. SoundCloud users\nin the past have been plagued by takedown notices from labels and publishers.\nSoundCloud began to make headway in 2014 when it signed a licensing pact with\nWarner Music Group. The company later hammered out an agreement with Universal\nMusic Group, leaving Sony Music Entertainment as the biggest holdout. Sony and\nSoundCloud announced a deal this month, clearing the way for a subscription\nservice. Wahlforss said the artists and labels will have the freedom to choose\nwhat songs are available on the free version of the service for promotional\npurposes.The expanded SoundCloud will have 125 million tracks, compared with\nthe 30 million offered by established streaming options.

Apple and the Department of Justice\nwere headed for a court battle last week before federal prosecutors made an\neleventh-hour request for a delay, announcing that an outside group may have\nfound a technique to hack the device.The breakthrough came last weekend,\naccording to an anonymous law enforcement official, who would not say how the\ndevice was hacked or what information the government found on Farook's\niPhone.Previously, the FBI had been stonewalled by an update Apple made to its\nencryption practices in September 2014. Farook had enabled an auto-erase\nfeature that would permanently delete all data on the phone after 10\nconsecutive failed attempts to enter the device's password.Data on the phone\nwould be scrambled unless a correct password was entered, and Apple has\nrepeatedly said it would need to create technology to defeat that encryption.\nFarook intentionally disabled the phone's iCloud backup feature six weeks\nbefore the Dec. 2 attacks, according to court documents.**Is the government\nrequired to say how it gained access to the phone?**The FBI is under no\nobligation to tell the public how it defeated Apple's security measures, but\nthe agency could be required to tell the company if the government exploited a\ndefect in the company's security protocols in order to gain access.**See more\nof our top stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**The policy that governs such\ndisclosures is known as the \"Vulnerabilities Equities Process,\" according to\nAndrew Crocker, a staff attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation,  a\ndigital rights advocacy group.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc63a"},"content":"Hillary Clinton has angrily rebuked Bernie Sanders for branding her a\nmoderate. She gives stump speeches that sound so much like his that a\n“Saturday Night Live” parody has Clinton morphing into the 74-year-old\nsocialist as she talks. Progressive activists boast of how far to the left\nthey have pushed her.But what do voters see when they assess Clinton?Pretty\nmuch the same person they did before she entered the race: a candidate in the\nsame ideological space as mainstream Democrats like President Obama. Her rants\nagainst Wall Street, push for massive college tuition subsidies and caution\nabout free trade have done little to change wider voter perceptions of\nClinton’s ideology. Neither have her crusading for gay marriage, unrelenting\ndemand for tough gun control, nor her warnings of putting coal miners out of\nwork.Experts who closely track the public’s impression of Clinton are finding\nthat her fiery, populist talk on the campaign trail that Republicans claim\nwill repel swing voters has yet to do much of that – even as liberal activists\nexpress satisfaction that Clinton has embraced so many of their demands over\nthe last year.**Election 2016 | Live coverage on Trail Guide | Track the\ndelegate race | Sign up for the newsletter  **“People feel they know her and\nhave a long enough history with her,” said Mason Harrison, political director\nof Crowdpac, a Silicon Valley firm that assesses public perceptions of\npresidential candidate ideology by tracking the leanings of millions of\ndonors. “A lot of what candidates say on the campaign trail is cheap talk. I’m\nnot sure people are swayed by it.”Clinton began the race with a relatively\nliberal rating on Crowdpac, but one that was no more to the left of that of\nObama. A year into the campaign? She is at the same place.“Her support base\nhasn’t trended to the left in any meaningful way,” Harrison said. Donald\nTrump, by contrast, has lurched far to the right on the Crowdpac scale.A group\nof 3,000 people surveyed by the Rand Corp. in December rated Clinton as being\nabout as liberal as the average registered Democrat. The group was asked again\njust this month after voting in the contentious primary had gotten underway\nand Clinton had seemed to shift left to regain her footing as Sanders had\nbegun winning states.Voter impressions of her, though, were unchanged. In\nfact, voters even perceived that she had drifted slightly closer to the\ncenter.This did not surprise John Sides, a political science professor at\nGeorge Washington University and coauthor of “The Gamble: Choice and Chance in\nthe 2012 Presidential Election.” The public isn’t and won’t be tracking her\nevery policy shift the way activists might, he said.“Once you get to the\ngeneral election, people who are up for grabs are less attentive than\ncommitted partisans,” he said. “The positions she has taken in this campaign\nplace her to the left of center, but they don’t place her so far from the\ncenter that there is a real substantial risk for a penalty for extremism.”In\nthe last presidential election, Sides said, the average voter’s ideology was\ncloser to that of Republican nominee Mitt Romney than Obama, indicating\ncandidates do not need to be closest to the center of the electorate to win.\nAnd Clinton’s strategy is to rebuild the same coalition of voters that Obama\ndid in both his victories.Nevertheless, a debate is raging among activists\nover whether the primary election has changed Clinton and, if so, whether the\nchanges will stick.After Clinton’s big wins on Super Tuesday, when she racked\nup a delegate lead over Sanders so substantial that she became a prohibitive\nfront-runner in the race, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a liberal\npowerhouse, announced the night was hardly a disappointment for the grass\nroots. After all, group co-founder Adam Green told reporters, Clinton was no\nlonger the centrist candidate she was when the race began. These days,\naccording Green, Clinton more closely resembles the liberal wing’s standard-\nbearer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.To support his argument, Green\noffers a laundry list of positions Clinton has taken: her call to jail rogue\nWall Street bankers, to break up “too big to fail” banks, to expand Social\nSecurity, to make public universities debt-free. He points out how Clinton\nsought to get to the left of Sanders on several of these issues.Clinton has\n“fundamentally shifted the center of gravity in the Democratic Party,” Green\nsaid.As the Bernie Sanders campaign accepts the reality that securing enough\nvotes at this point to win the Democratic nomination outright is impossible,\nit has moved on to a new phase in its long-shot bid for the White House:\nhijack Hillary Clinton’s so-called superdelegates.Sanders advisors are\ntargeting...As the Bernie Sanders campaign accepts the reality that securing\nenough votes at this point to win the Democratic nomination outright is\nimpossible, it has moved on to a new phase in its long-shot bid for the White\nHouse: hijack Hillary Clinton’s so-called superdelegates.Sanders advisors are\ntargeting...Others say that is exactly what Clinton successfully avoided\ndoing, and that wishful progressives are misinterpreting some of her campaign\nrhetoric. Centrists in the party, who argue Clinton’s big delegate lead in the\nprimary is a vote of confidence in their approach, point to all the Sanders\npolicies that Clinton rejected.She is against free college for everybody. She\nis against a European-style, government-provided healthcare system. She is\nagainst reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall restrictions on financial\ninstitutions. Even on trade, Clinton is in a very different place than\nSanders, they note, expressing openness to supporting a renegotiated Pacific\ntrade deal.“There is this myth that the left is perpetuating that Hillary\nClinton has moved sharply left in the primary and is going to be running as a\nSanders liberal in the general election,” said Jon Cowan, president of Third\nWay, a centrist advocacy group that advises Democrats. “It is simply not\ntrue.… She is coming out of the primary as a ‘new-economy Democrat.’”Part of\nthe disagreement stems from the fact that the meaning of “new-economy\nDemocrat” itself has shifted left over the last decade. Some of the key pro-\ngrowth Democrats who helped shape former President Clinton’s economic policies\nsay that the same agenda is no longer sufficient to narrow the growing income\ngap in America, and that it needs to be adjusted to include a larger safety\nnet, more restrictions on Wall Street and trade deals that provide more\nprotections for American workers.It is also an election year in which\ncampaigning on a theme of economic populism is hardly risky. The message\nappeals across party lines and has propelled the candidacy of GOP front-runner\nTrump.“Rhetoric that challenges certain elites like Wall Street banks is\npretty safe,” Sides said. “It is the same rhetoric the tea party used\ntoo.”**Twitter: @evanhalper ****ALSO:****As California primary nears, state\nDemocrats are uniting behind Clinton and against a common enemy:\nTrump****Donald Trump leads in California primary race but threatens a GOP\nfracture****Clinton email probe enters new phase as FBI interviews loom**\n\n","title":"How far left has Hillary Clinton been pushed by Bernie Sanders?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc63b"},"content":"Eighth-grade math is changing: Instead of emphasizing Algebra I where only\nsome students thrive, many schools are placing all students in the same\ngeneral class that covers several concepts.Common Core standards for the\neighth grade call for all students to learn the same general math concepts, a\ndeparture from the push toward Algebra I that middle schools made in the late\n1990s and early 2000s. Common Core is a set of English and math learning\nstandards that most states have adopted, meant to be more rigorous and uniform\nthan states' previous learning goals. ****See the most-read stories this hour\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;****A new study from the Brown Center at the Brookings Institution, a\nnonprofit research group, found that the percentage of students in advanced\nmath classes has decreased, while the share of students in general math has\ngone up.That doesn't mean that the \"general\" classes are less difficult than\nAlgebra I. Instead, they're supposed to include concepts of algebra, geometry\nand statistics. But in his study, author Tom Loveless considered advanced\nclasses to include Algebra I, and general math enrollment to include Common\nCore math classes. That change is even more stark in California since 2013,\nwhen the state got rid of incentives for middle schools to offer Algebra I,\ninstead shifting its focus to Common Core math implementation.Having more\nstudents taking a single, general eighth-grade math course might help solve a\ndifferent problem: the segregation that happens inside schools and between\nclassrooms, when black and Latino students are kept out of high-level\nclasses.Students are still separated into different classes — there are others\nin pre-algebra classes, not shown in the results. And even within Common Core,\nschool districts can implement an \"accelerated pathway\" for high-achieving\nmiddle school students, as L.A. Unified has done.But the shifts tell Loveless\nthat as Common Core gains ground, fewer students are being pushed into\nalgebra.Last year, California's legislature passed a law requiring school\ndistricts to put their high school math placement policy in writing, a\nrecognition that math, particularly algebra, is one of the classes that's most\ndifficult for students to pass, accounting for many dropouts. But recording\nthese policies in high school might be too late, said UCLA education professor\nTyrone Howard.In the 2011-2012 school year, black students were equally\nrepresented in Algebra I in middle school, while Latino students were\nunderrepresented. White and Asian students were overrepresented.By the time\nstudents are learning Algebra II, black students become underrepresented along\nwith Latinos, while white and Asian students still maintain their\noverrepresentation in these classes.This is important for California students\nbecause they need to complete Algebra II or its equivalent to qualify for\nUniversity of California or Cal State University admission, the cheapest and\nhighest-quality four-year college options for state residents. In 2014, a few\nyears after some of those students took -- or missed -- Algebra II, white and\nAsian students were more likely than their Latino, African American and Native\nAmerican counterparts to meet UC and CSU entrance requirements.Beyond math,\nschool districts such as Long Beach Unified and Los Angeles Unified have taken\na stand against the practice of tracking by opening AP classes to all\nstudents. In L.A. Unified, the share of Latino students in AP classes has\nincreased in the last eight years, though Latino and black students are still\nunderrepresented. **Reach Sonali Kohli at Sonali.Kohli@latimes.com or on\nTwitter @Sonali_Kohli.****ALSO****Do out-of-state students hurt Californians'\nchances at UC schools?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc63c"},"content":"A well-planned legal assault on public unions collapsed Tuesday when the\nSupreme Court deadlocked over a California woman’s lawsuit to strike down\nmandatory fees, the strongest evidence yet that Justice Antonin Scalia’s death\nhas stymied the court’s conservatives.The 4-4 split keeps in place a 1970s-era\nrule that authorizes unions to require municipal employees, teachers, college\ninstructors and transit workers to pay a “fair share fee” to help cover the\ncost of collective bargaining.The tie vote, widely expected after Scalia’s\ndeath, nevertheless came as a relief to union officials who feared the\nconservative justices were on the brink of striking down the pro-union law as\na violation of free speech.In another sign Tuesday that the high court\ncontinues to grapple with the vacancy left by Scalia, justices asked for\nadditional briefings in a pending dispute over the Obama administration’s\ncontraceptive mandate under the Affordable Care Act.The request looks to be an\nattempt by the justices to find a compromise in that case, which appeared\nevenly split during oral arguments earlier this month.Tie votes could be a\ntheme this year as justices vote on several major disputes that divide along\nideological lines, including abortion, election districts and immigration.The\nWhite House said the court’s deadlock in the union case underscores the need\nfor the Senate to confirm the president's nominee, Merrick Garland, chief\njudge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to\nreplace Scalia. The Republican-controlled Senate is refusing to act on\nGarland’s nomination, saying the next president should fill the seat.Whether\nhe wants to talk about it or not, Republican Sen. Patrick J. Toomey’s refusal\nto consider President Obama’s nominee for the Supreme Court is following him\nhome for spring break.Even before Toomey pulled up for a breakfast meeting\nwith business leaders in State College, Pa., on Monday,...Whether he wants to\ntalk about it or not, Republican Sen. Patrick J. Toomey’s refusal to consider\nPresident Obama’s nominee for the Supreme Court is following him home for\nspring break.Even before Toomey pulled up for a breakfast meeting with\nbusiness leaders in State College, Pa., on Monday,...“With a Supreme Court\nthat’s not fully staffed, it makes it more likely that situations can arise\nacross the country with different rulings in different courts that aren’t\nresolved by the Supreme Court,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told\nreporters aboard Air Force One.Earlier this month, the court split, 4-4, in a\nnarrow case involving spousal liability and gender discrimination, the first\nsuch vote since Scalia’s death.The deadlock in the union case leaves in place\nmandatory fees allowed by law in California and 22 other mostly Democratic\nstates. Such fees are prohibited in “right to work” states across the South\nand in much of the Midwest.Orange County teacher Rebecca Friedrichs and\nseveral others had sued to overturn the fees, saying they objected being\nforced to support the California Teachers Assn.The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of\nAppeals rejected her suit, citing the 1977 Supreme Court ruling in Abood vs.\nDetroit Board of Education, which had authorized these fair share fees in the\nfirst place. That case held that workers could be required to share in the\ncost of collective bargaining, but they did not have pay for a union’s\npolitical activities.Before Scalia’s death, the court’s five more conservative\njustices had served notice that they were ready to overturn Abood and declare\nsuch forced fees as unconstitutional. The same five justices who in the\nCitizens United case struck down campaign spending limits on free-speech\ngrounds seemed to view the unions fees as a 1st Amendment violation because\nemployees were forced to pay to support a union they opposed.Instead Tuesday,\nthe justices issued a one-line statement saying the 9th Circuit’s ruling is\n“affirmed by an equally divided court.”Labor law scholars said unions would\nhave been crippled if nonmembers had no longer been required to pay anything\nto support the union. “It would have been like a knife in the heart of the\nunions,” said Gary Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark\nUniversity in Massachusetts.The National Education Assn. -- the nation's\nlargest union with 3 million members -- hailed the outcome as a victory. Eric\nHeins, president of the California teachers group, said “wealthy corporate\nspecial interests” had brought the case to “make it harder for working\nfamilies and the middle class to come together, speak up and get ahead. Now\nit’s time for senators to do their job and appoint a successor justice to the\nhighest court in our land.”Presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders agreed\nthat the deadlock “underscores the need to a confirm a Supreme Court nominee\nwho will protect the rights of American workers to collectively bargain for\nfair wages and safe working conditions. The extreme right wing is just one\nconservative Supreme Court justice away from dismantling the rights of public\nsector unions to organize and collectively bargain on behalf of all\nworkers.”Conservatives said they saw no incentive to allow Obama to appoint\nanother left-leaning judge, which would give the court a liberal majority for\nthe first time in generations.Curt Levey, executive director of the\nFreedomWorks Foundation, said that the Supreme Court would shift “dramatically\nto the left with the appointment of Merrick Garland or any other liberal,\n[and] become a rubber stamp not just for the wishes of powerful labor unions,\nbut also for virtually the entire progressive agenda.”Terry Pell, president of\nthe Center for Individual Rights, which helped launch Friedrichs’ lawsuit,\nsaid the group would try to raise the issue again. “We believe this case is\ntoo significant to let a split decision stand, and we will file a petition for\nrehearing with the Supreme Court,” he said.A labor policy expert who supported\nFriedrichs said challengers should now to look to state legislatures to strike\ndown the fees.“With a divided court, thousands of public servants around the\nnation must still financially assist a government union that they disagree\nwith,” said Trey Kovacs, a labor expert with the Competitive Enterprise\nInstitute. “Now it is up to state legislatures to provide public employees\nwith the freedom to choose whether or not to pay for union representation.”In\nthe Obamacare case, the justices said Tuesday that they wanted to hear further\narguments on whether insurance companies may directly provide contraceptives\nto some women without the religious charities and nonprofit organizations that\nemploy them and object to birth control playing any role.Last week, the\njustices sounded evenly divided in a clash between the Obama administration\nand Roman Catholic archbishops over the contraceptive coverage that is now a\nrequired part of all health insurance plans under Obamacare.The administration\nhad previously said that the Catholic charities and other nonprofit religious\ngroups need not pay for this coverage, but that they must formally notify the\ngovernment of their religious objections so insurers can be ordered to provide\nthe contraceptives.But some Catholic leaders objected nonetheless and argued\nthat notifying the government would trigger the coverage and make them\n“complicit in sin,” because they view some forms of the contraceptives as\nabortion.On Tuesday, the justices asked lawyers on both sides to submit a new\nbrief on whether insurance companies could be required by law to provide the\ncontraceptive coverage on their own so that the church-based employer “would\nnot required to submit any separate notice.”The new briefs are due April 12.\nThat suggests the justices still hope to decide the case this term.**On\nTwitter: @DavidGSavage****ALSO****With strong new job approval numbers, Jerry\nBrown chalks up success to 'skills' of governing****California voters still\nundecided on U.S. Senate pick as race is eclipsed by presidential\nshowdown****How far left has Hillary Clinton been pushed by Bernie Sanders?\nLess than you might think**\n\n","title":"Supreme Court's deadlock on union fees could be the first of many tie votes - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Supreme Court evenly split, upholds union dues for teachers https://t.co/lKihLN5d7c","date":"Tue Mar 29 14:12:53 +0000 2016","favs":21,"id":{"$numberLong":"714817608349048832"},"retweets":36},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1Tgp8iT"}

And on Monday, both legislators and the business\ncommunity were waiting to see every line of bill language — as were union\nleaders, who insisted that they're not yet ready to officially cancel two\nseparate November ballot initiatives. They first want to see Brown's signature\non the legislative compromise.The bill language is expected to be vetted in an\nAssembly committee on Wednesday, with formal legislative votes by week's end.\nWe'll be tracking it closely on our Essential Politics news feed.Finally,\nconsider the politics at play: Two separate labor unions were getting geared\nup to campaign for competing statewide ballot initiatives in November. Neither\nof those measures had any mechanism that would taper future wage hikes (the\n$15 level won't be reached until 2022 for most workers) to economic\nconditions.Meanwhile, backers of other fall ballot measures — and it’s going\nto be a long ballot — no doubt are happy there will be one fewer thing to take\nvoter attention away from their issues.**CLINTON, SANDERS TWEET THE CALIFORNIA\nDEAL**As if anyone needed reminding that the California minimum wage deal was\nbig national news, the two Democratic presidential candidates took to Twitter\nto offer their congratulations.But Vermont **Sen. Bernie Sanders** thought\n**Hillary Clinton** was jumping on the bandwagon, as she's only endorsed\nCalifornia's effort and has not joined his call for a $15 an hour federal\nminimum wage.**SPEAKING OF THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE...**No matter how the primary\nshakes out, there is a perception that the Sanders candidacy pushed Clinton\nfurther to the left over the last year. But when Evan Halper dug in, he found\nClinton’s shift is less leftward-leaning than you might think.Halper also\nwrites that Team Sanders has moved on to a new phase in its bid for the White\nHouse: hijack Clinton's so-called superdelegates. Here's the math today:\nClinton has 469 of them in her corner. Sanders has just 29.Meantime, Michael\nMemoli reports that Clinton is adding her voice to growing calls for a vote by\nSenate Republicans on the U.S. Supreme Court nomination of **Judge Merrick\nGarland**.On the Republican side, Memoli further reports that **President\nObama** offered his own take on the question: “Did the media miss the signs on\nDonald Trump?”As always, you can find the latest from the campaign trail on\nTrail Guide and follow @latimespolitics.**CALIFORNIA SENATE RACE\nSTAGNATION?**We've got new numbers this morning from a USC Dornsife/Los\nAngeles Times poll on the U.S. Senate race.And Phil Willon reports that while\n**Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris** remains the solid front-runner, her support among\nvoters has been stuck at about 28% for over a year. And that's even after she\nspent $4 million on her campaign _and_ received the endorsement of the\nCalifornia Democratic Party in February.**BROWN RIDING HIGH IN NEW POLL**We\nalso take a look at the poll results on the governor's job approval numbers.\nThey now stand at 60%, a pretty high mark and part of what’s become a familiar\nstoryline: Brown gets kudos from a broad cross-section of voters.Even 19% of\nthe people who plan to vote for Trump in the June primary think the Democratic\ngovernor is doing a good job.**TODAY'S ESSENTIALS**— Former Republican\npresidential candidate **Sen. Marco Rubio** has asked that his name be removed\nfrom the California’s June 7 presidential primary ballot. The move could\npossibly help Texas **Sen. Ted Cruz** or Ohio **Gov. John Kasich**, since it\nprevents Rubio from receiving any anti-Donald Trump votes.— It’s a boy! Just\ncall him Grandpa Trump.— Drug manufacturers have mounted a vigorous lobbying\ncampaign against a Los Angeles County proposal that would require\npharmaceutical companies to finance a disposal program for unused medications\nand syringes, Abby Sewell reports.— An Assembly Republican wants to allow\ndomestic violence victims to carry concealed weapons on school campuses in\nCalifornia. **Assemblyman James Gallagher** (R-Plumas Lake) has introduced a\nlegislative exception in last year's law that banned weapons on campus.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc63e"},"content":"Let them eat turkey pesto paninis.Or BBQ beef brisket on sourdough sandwiches.\nOr zesty chicken and black bean salads.Starbucks needs no marketing push from\nme, but I'm here to bestow props anyway. The company has taken a leadership\nrole in addressing domestic hunger by announcing that it intends to donate all\nits leftover food to charity.This year, Starbucks aims to provide nearly 5\nmillion meals to food banks nationwide from its roughly 7,600 outlets. Within\nfive years, it says, that figure should rise to 50 million meals\nannually.**Join the conversation on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**\"When we thought about\nour vast store footprint across the U.S. and the impact we could make, it put\na fire under us to figure out how to donate this food instead of throwing it\naway,\" said Jane Maly, brand manager for Starbucks' food division.\"The\nchallenge was finding a way to preserve the food's quality during delivery,\"\nshe said.Here's what all other restaurants, hotels, caterers and other food\nbusiness need to understand: That challenge isn't insurmountable. Nor is the\nquestion of legal liability, which I know from past columns on this topic is\nthe chief concern when it comes to donating prepared food.The federal\ngovernment estimates that more than 48 million Americans live in what are\ncalled food-insecure households. That means hunger is a constant\nworry.Meanwhile, this country throws away up to 35 million tons of food every\nyear, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.In dollar terms, the\nNatural Resources Defense Council puts the wasted-food tab at $165 billion\nannually, or about $2,200 per household.And there's another component: By some\nestimates, about a quarter of the nation's water is squandered on producing\nfood that will end up taking space in landfills.Michael Flood, president of\nthe Los Angeles Regional Food Bank, told me that Starbucks' decision to donate\nleftover food won't solve the country's hunger problem, but it will raise\nawareness among businesses that efforts can be made to get uneaten food to\nthose who need it.\"In that sense, it's a big announcement,\" he said. \"It puts\nout the message that donating food is OK.\"Organizations like Flood's have been\nactive for years putting a dent in food waste. They work primarily with\nmanufacturers and retailers to collect unsold packaged and perishable foods,\nsuch as canned and baked goods.Food banks, in turn, oversee distribution of\nthese goods to affiliated entities such as food pantries, soup kitchens and\nshelters.Flood said Starbucks' donations will be relatively easy to handle.\nBecause we're mainly talking about sandwiches, it won't be difficult to keep\nthem refrigerated until they're ready to be eaten.The most likely scenario,\nFlood said, is that local food pantries and kitchens will deal directly with\nnearby Starbucks outlets, arranging to pick up, transport and serve the\nleftovers.The greater challenge remains hot food served at restaurants,\nweddings, corporate functions and other events.About 1.5 million tons of\nprepared food is thrown out each year in California alone, according to the\nstate Integrated Waste Management Board.Many restaurants and hotels don't\ndonate leftovers to charity because they think they'll be subject to lawsuits\nif someone gets sick. What they often don't know is that the federal Emerson\nGood Samaritan Food Donation Act shields most donors from legal liability.The\ncatch is that the law doesn't protect charities that receive donated food,\nwhich must ensure that any meals served meet all local and state health\nrequirements. Many charities will decline donations of prepared food rather\nthan run the risk of serving potentially unhealthy meals.In April,\nCalifornia's AB 1826 will start taking effect. This is a law aimed at forcing\nbusinesses to divert organic waste, including food waste, away from\nlandfills.Flood and other advocates for the hungry said this represents a\npivotal step toward isolating food waste and thus finding ways to put it to\nuse. At first, that will mostly mean composting. But down the road, it's\nlikely that there will be improved efforts to channel uneaten food to those\nwho need it.\"It's a big deal,\" Flood said.Starbucks gets points for doing its\nshare. Not only is it setting a goal of contributing 100% of leftover food to\ncharity but it gives instant legitimacy to food donations.\"Our hope is by\ntaking this first step, other companies will see the possibility for their\nparticipation and together we will make great strides in combating hunger,\"\nsaid Cliff Burrows, group president of Starbucks U.S. and Americas.I see a\nbusiness opportunity in coordinating pickup and prompt delivery of prepared\nfood to soup kitchens and shelters — with funding, perhaps, from companies\nthat aren't directly involved in the food business but want to help feed the\nhungry.The pitch: Uber for leftovers.Help yourself, entrepreneurs._David\nLazarus' column runs Tuesdays and Fridays.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc63f"},"content":"Federal officials on Monday dropped their legal fight against Apple after\nunlocking the iPhone used by an assailant in last year's San Bernardino terror\nattack, leaving unsettled a vexing debate over privacy and security amid rapid\nadvances in technology.The move comes a week after Justice Department\nofficials put a sudden hold on their demands that Apple assist the FBI with an\nannouncement that an outside group had offered a way to hack into the\niPhone.Aided by the unnamed group, FBI technology experts had been at work\nsince, testing the technique to confirm it could open the iPhone without\njeopardizing its contents.The breakthrough came over the weekend, when the\ninformation stored on the phone was extracted, said a federal law enforcement\nofficial, speaking on condition of anonymity.That legal mess between the FBI\nand Apple over the last two months? The tech world wants to make sure it\ndoesn't happen again.The FBI's declaration Monday that it could hack into an\niPhone without Apple's help -- a device the agency had insisted carried\nsecurity measures only the tech giant could...That legal mess between the FBI\nand Apple over the last two months? The tech world wants to make sure it\ndoesn't happen again.The FBI's declaration Monday that it could hack into an\niPhone without Apple's help -- a device the agency had insisted carried\nsecurity measures only the tech giant could...He declined to say anything\nabout the contents of the phone, other than that FBI agents were reviewing the\nmaterial. The official also remained tight-lipped about the method that was\nused to beat the iPhone's security barriers, as well as the identity of the\ngroup that delivered it to FBI agents. Any speculation about the effect of the\nbreakthrough on other cases involving locked phones would be premature, he\nsaid.The move appeared to end a historic legal showdown that pitted the\ndemands of law enforcement investigating crimes against the rights of\ncompanies to protect their customers' privacy.But it also raises new questions\nfor both sides as well as the tech industry as a whole given that the\ngovernment was able to get past Apple's daunting encryption through some type\nof hack. “Our decision to conclude the litigation was based solely on the fact\nthat, with the recent assistance of a third party, we are now able to unlock\nthat iPhone without compromising any information on the phone,” U.S. Atty.\nEileen Decker said in a statement after prosecutors asked U.S. Magistrate\nJudge Sheri Pym to vacate an order compelling Apple's cooperation.Apple struck\na defiant tone Monday evening, saying in a statement that the “backdoor” into\nits phones sought by prosecutors “would set a dangerous precedent.... This\ncase should never have been brought.”The company also underscored the crucial\nquestions at the heart of the case, urging “a national conversation about our\ncivil liberties, and our collective security and privacy.”In legal briefs and\npublic statements aimed at winning both in court and opinion polls, Apple\nexecutives and their attorneys forcefully opposed Pym's order, which would\nhave compelled the technology giant to engineer a way around security measures\nit had built into the iPhone.Doing so, they said, would amount to creating a\nmaster key for accessing all iPhones, which would quickly become a holy grail\nfor hackers.Prosecutors rebuffed Apple's doomsday scenario, insisting the case\ndealt only with cracking into the iPhone used by Syed Rizwan Farook, who along\nwith his wife carried out the Dec. 2 attack that left 14 dead and many others\nwounded. Justice officials say the assault was an act of terrorism.Despite the\ngovernment's claims, the fight over Farook's iPhone was seen as a test case\nover whether technology companies could be forced to develop computer code to\nassist a criminal investigation. It took on broader implications as well about\nhow far the government could go in forcing companies or individuals into its\nservice.The case revolved around the iPhone 5C issued to Farook for his job as\na San Bernardino County health inspector that was found in his car after a\nshootout with police that left him and his wife dead. Although FBI agents\nmanaged to piece together much about the couple, they wanted to review the\ncontacts, messages and other information on the phone in hopes it would help\nanswer whether the killers had accomplices, among other questions.Worried that\nFarook had activated a security feature making an iPhone inoperable after 10\nfailed attempts to enter a four-digit security code, agents approached Apple\nfor assistance in getting into the device. Until the correct security code is\nentered, Apple's encryption software keeps the contents of the phone\nscrambled.Agents wanted Apple to write a new operating system that would\nbypass the 10-attempt limit on the security code and other security measures.\nWith this done, agents then planned to use a computer program to churn through\nthe 10,000 possible passcodes until they hit upon the right one.When the\nworld's most valuable company refused, Decker looked to Pym. The judge granted\nprosecutors' request for an order forcing Apple to help but delayed making a\nfinal decision until after the two sides had a chance to make their case. The\nevening before a court hearing to decide the matter, Decker's team sprung the\nannouncement about getting help from the outside group.On Monday, David\nBowdich, the FBI's assistant director in charge of the Los Angeles office,\nissued a statement about the analysis of the phone's content.“We promised to\nexplore every investigative avenue in order to learn whether the San\nBernardino suspects were working with others, were targeting others, or\nwhether or not they were supported by others,” he said. “These questions may\nnot be fully resolved, but I am satisfied that we have access to more answers\nthan we did before.”Apple attorneys said last week they will explore legal\noptions to force the FBI to turn over details of the hacking method. They\ndeclined to elaborate Monday.The fact that a way into Farook's iPhone had been\ndiscovered, the attorneys said, underscored the fears the tech giant has\nrepeatedly expressed during its legal fight with the government: that the\ncompany must contend with constant attempts by outside parties to worm past\nApple's security measures.Technology executives and privacy advocates viewed\nthe government's decision to end the case as a fleeting victory. As companies\nmake it increasingly difficult for investigators to access information on\nsmartphones and other devices with heightened encryption and security, they\nexpressed concern that the larger debate over balancing the needs of\ngovernment and private industry remained unresolved.“This case was never about\njust one phone. It was about an unprecedented power grab by the government\nthat was a threat to everyone's security and privacy,” said Alex Abdo, an\nattorney for the American Civil Liberties Union. “Unfortunately, today's news\nappears to be just a delay of an inevitable fight over whether the FBI can\nforce Apple to undermine the security of its own products.”Aaron Levie, chief\nexecutive of online storage  \nprovider Box Inc., said other legal skirmishes on the  \nsame issues will occur until there is “a broader conversation around the\npolicy,  \nregulation and laws in a digital world and what does it mean to have secure\ntechnology.”Apple itself highlighted the difficulty in resolving these\ntensions, saying in its statement Monday that it planned to “continue to  \nhelp law enforcement with their investigations … and we will continue to\nincrease the security of our products as the threats and attacks on our data\nbecome more frequent and more sophisticated.”Stephen Larson, an attorney\nrepresenting the families of several people killed in the attack, said the\nfocus should remain on the victims.“Our concern from Day One has been\nobtaining information of potentially great importance to both law enforcement\nand the victims of terrorism,” Larson wrote in an email to The Times. “For\nthis to have dragged out in court battles would not have served the interests\nof either.” Twitter:@joelrubin \u0026amp; @JamesQueallyLAT \u0026amp; @peard33_Times\nstaff writer Del Wilber contributed to this report._**ALSO****Gunman at U.S.\nCapitol Monday had disrupted Congress before, officials say****Gov.

Nathan\nDeal's decision Monday to veto controversial legislation that looked to expand\nindividuals' and business' rights to deny services to those whose way of life\nconflicts with their religious beliefs.The stakes were high for Georgia....At\nthe same time, conservative legislatures have been moving to limit transgender\nbathroom use and expand exemptions allowing people to deny services that might\nconflict with their religious beliefs.In response, national advocacy groups,\ncelebrities and businesses have threatened boycotts to put pressure on\ngovernors and legislatures to back down from those plans.At least for now,\nthey have claimed victory in Georgia.Lawmakers there passed the Free Exercise\nProtection Act on March 16 with the aim of ensuring that a pastor could not be\nforced to perform a same-sex wedding and that nonprofit faith-based\norganizations could legally refuse to rent or lease property for events they\nfound objectionable.The bill also sought to give such groups the right to fire\nor not hire people whose practices they opposed on religious grounds.The\nlegislation met sustained opposition from major players in the movie and\ntelevision industries, which increasingly have been filming in Georgia because\nof its tax breaks and lower labor costs.Disney and Marvel threatened to stop\nfilm production there if Deal signed the bill into law. Apple, Comcast, Dell,\nTime Warner, Sony Pictures and other companies urged the governor to veto it.\nAt least 40 actors and filmmakers, including Anne Hathaway and Julianne Moore,\njoined the rebellion.When Deal announced that he was vetoing the bill at a\nnews conference Monday, he said he was not just providing a business-friendly\nclimate for job growth in Georgia but also embracing Georgia's image as \"a\nwelcoming state.\"He insisted, however, he was following his own conscience and\nnot succumbing to the outside pressure.\"To those within the business\ncommunity, some of whom — not all, by any stretch — have resorted to threats\nof withdrawing jobs from our state, they should know: I do not respond very\nwell to insults or threats,\" Deal said.The Motion Picture Assn. of America, a\ntrade organization that represents the studios, lauded the veto, releasing a\nstatement that \"we look forward to continuing to work with the governor and\nthe state Legislature to expand and enhance the motion picture and television\nindustry in the state.\"In contrast, North Carolina has stood firm on its\nlegislation.The state law, which was passed in a special session and bans\ncities from passing their own anti-discrimination ordinances, came in response\nto the city of Charlotte's decision to do just that. It also restricts people\nto the bathroom corresponding to the gender on their birth\ncertificates.Opponents of the Charlotte law had repeatedly suggested that\ntransgender women were potential pedophiles, with little evidence.\"You know,\n$42,000 is not going to cover the medical expenses when a pervert walks into a\nbathroom and my little girls are in there,\" said one Republican state senator,\nAndrew Brock.He was alluding to the $42,000 cost of holding a special session,\naccording to the Salisbury Post.The federal lawsuit filed Monday comes from a\ncoalition of advocacy groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union,\nLambda Legal and Equality NC. They are seeking an injunction against the new\nlaw on the grounds that it violates the 14th Amendment as well as Title\nIX.\"North Carolina is going to be a cautionary tale of what happens when the\ngovernment decides to discriminate\" against its own people, said Lambda Legal\nattorney Peter Renn, one of the attorneys on the case. \"Let's be clear: You\nwill be sued if you pass a law like this,\" he said.Payton McGarry, a 20-year-\nold transgender student at the University of North Carolina-Greensboro, said\nhe decided to become a plaintiff in the lawsuit after listening to the\n\"appalling\" way lawmakers described transgender people.When McGarry began\ntransitioning to a boy in high school, the bathroom suddenly became one of his\nbiggest danger zones.**Join the conversation on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**When he\nused the girls' restroom, he was pushed, slapped and screamed at, so he\nstarted avoiding restrooms — to the point that he developed urinary tract\ninfections.\"It took such a toll on my mental well-being to think, 'Hey, could\nthis bathroom be the one where I finally get beaten to a pulp?'\" McGarry said\nin an interview with the Los Angeles Times. He said that he has not faced\ndiscrimination as a transgender man at college.McGarry criticized lawmakers'\nclaims that the bill was passed for the privacy and safety of girls and women\nin restrooms.\"If you want to know what kind of genitals I have, then it's you\ninvading my privacy,\" McGarry said. \"You are trading the safety and well-being\nof transgender people for this perceived threat that doesn't really exist.\"In\nresponse to the lawsuit Monday, the governor's office decried the \"distortion\nof the facts\" by activists and the media.\"The governor will continue to set\nthe record straight on a common sense resolution to local government overreach\nthat imposed new regulations on businesses that intruded into the personal\nlives of our citizens,\" spokesman Graham Wilson said in a statement.Now, both\nsides expect a showdown in court._matt.pearce@latimes.com__Times staff writer\nPearce reported from Los Angeles and special correspondent Jarvie from\nAtlanta.

Authorities believe it was not a\ncoordinated terrorist attack.A passenger who claimed to be wearing an\nexplosive belt took control of Flight MS181 shortly after its takeoff from\nAlexandria's Borg al-Arab Airport, en route to Cairo.He threatened to blow\nhimself up if the pilot did not divert to Larnaca airport in Cyprus, Egyptian\nCivil Aviation Minister Sherif Fatthi said in a news conference on Tuesday.\nThere were at least 55 passengers on the flight; some reports placed the\nnumber on the plane higher, at 80 passengers.On the tarmac in Larnaca, nearly\neveryone on board was released, save for the pilot, copilot, two crew members\nand three passengers. Fatthi declined to name their nationalities.After\nseveral hours, the hijacker, identified as Egyptian national Seif Al-Din\nMustafa, released all remaining hostages. Cypriot news outlets broadcast\nimages of him leaving the plane with his hands above his head.\"Thank God all\nour passengers and crew members are safe, and that was our most important\nconcern,” said Fatthi in an interview after the arrest, adding that the\nhijacking did not qualify as a “terrorist act.”“The information we have now\n[shows] that it was not a professional attack.”The Cypriot Foreign Ministry\ncorroborated the report with a laconic tweet on its official account saying\n“It’s over. The hijacker arrested.”**See more of our top stories on Facebook\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**There were conflicting reports regarding the motive behind the\nhijacking.A Cypriot broadcaster reported that the hijacker demanded the\nrelease of Egyptian female prisoners in Egypt, according to Reuters, while\nothers said he was seeking to meet his estranged ex-wife, now living in\nCyprus.Egypt’s prime minister, Sherif Ismail, seemed equally perplexed.“At\ncertain moments the hijacker was demanding to meet a representative of the\nEuropean Union, in other moments he was demanding to be allowed to leave\nLarnaca Airport, but there were no specific demands.”It was also unclear\nwhether the hijacker actually had a bomb. A Cypriot official speaking on\ncondition of anonymity told the Associated Press that there were no explosives\ninside the belt he was carrying.Egyptian officials said an aircraft would\ndepart from Cairo Airport to Larnaca as soon as possible to return the\npassengers to Egypt.The incident adds to Egypt's tarnished airport security\nrecord.Last October, a Russian Metrojet plane carrying 224 passengers from\nSharm el-Sheikh to St. Petersburg was blown up by Islamic State.

The country's pundits look\nupon him, and as one, they ask a single question: Whose fault is this\nanyway?The answers are surprisingly varied. One of the more popular arguments\nis that Trump is a byproduct of rising...The speech at an event awarding the\nToner Prize for Excellence in Political Reporting, awarded by Syracuse\nUniversity to honor the late New York Times reporter Robin Toner, offered\nObama another opportunity to reflect on the presidential campaign, as he laid\nsome blame on the news industry for what he called the coarsening of the\npolitical debate.Without naming Donald Trump, the political outsider whose\ndomination of the airwaves preceded his amassing of a delegate lead in the GOP\nrace, Obama again expressed dismay at “vulgar rhetoric” often targeting women\nand minorities, and called on journalists to do more to question the\nfeasibility of candidates’ platforms.“A job well done is about more than just\nhanding someone a microphone,” he said, challenging reporters “to probe and to\nquestion and to dig deeper.”Voters would be better served, he said, “if\nbillions of dollars in free media came with serious accountability, especially\nwhen politicians issue unworkable plans or make promises they can’t\nkeep.”Obama acknowledged the pressures on the media industry and journalists\nspecifically in trying to attract readers in the Internet era, but said the\nreaction should not be to “dumb down the news.”A sensational story might get\nmore hits online today, but “won’t stand up to the test of time,” he said.“For\nall the sideshows in a political season, Americans are still hungry for the\ntruth,” Obama argued. “It’s just hard to find. It’s hard to wade through. The\ncurating function has diminished in this smartphone age. [But] people still\nwant to know what’s true.”U.S. President Barack Obama delivers the keynote\naddress at the awards dinner for Syracuse University's Toner Prize for\nExcellence in Political Reporting.U.S. President Barack Obama delivers the\nkeynote address at the awards dinner for Syracuse University's Toner Prize for\nExcellence in Political Reporting.The president also acknowledged some\nshortcomings on his part, saying that although he has not always agreed with\nconstructive criticism of him in the press, he still valued “great\njournalism.”“You should not underestimate the times I’ve read something that\nyou did and I have called somebody up and said, ‘What’s going on here?’” he\nsaid.But while he promised to lead the most transparent White House in\nhistory, a recent Associated Press review found his administration had set a\nrecord for failing to fulfill freedom of information requests.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc644"},"content":"Fifty years ago this week, Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale reported to spring\ntraining. The rest of the Dodgers had already been there for a month.The best\npitchers on the defending World Series champions were widely viewed as\nheretics in the context of their time. There was no free agency, no salary\narbitration, and no power in the players' union.If a player did not like the\nsalary dictated by management, he could stay home. So Koufax and Drysdale did,\nthreatening by their absence to turn the Dodgers from the best team in the\nNational League into an also-ran.In the end, the pitchers got more money. The\nDodgers got back to the World Series. The fans adored their heroes once\nagain.Within a decade, Marvin Miller had organized baseball's players into\nwhat would become the most powerful union in American sports, breaking free of\nrules that bound them to their team until the team let them go.But Miller did\nnot start his job until Koufax and Drysdale were in the second week of their\nholdout, an event often overlooked in the chronicles of baseball's labor\nhistory.\"We've come a very long way,\" Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw said.\n\"We owe a lot to our former players that fought for our rights.\"When Kershaw\nsigned for $215 million two years ago, he chose to stay with the Dodgers.\nKoufax had no choice. The Dodgers aces past and present have become close, and\nKershaw was not surprised to learn that the best pitcher in baseball had been\nwilling to retire if necessary, and had stood up for himself before his union\ncould stand up for him.\"He's the type of guy who knows what's right and would\nfight for it,\" Kershaw said.::In 1966, when Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale held\nout from spring training rather than accept what they considered an unfair\ncontract offer from the Dodgers, the minimum salary for a major league\nbaseball player was $6,000.On March 5, 1966 — with Koufax and Drysdale in the\nsecond week of their...In 1966, when Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale held out\nfrom spring training rather than accept what they considered an unfair\ncontract offer from the Dodgers, the minimum salary for a major league\nbaseball player was $6,000.On March 5, 1966 — with Koufax and Drysdale in the\nsecond week of their...It was Feb. 23, 1966, and The Times splashed the\nheadline across the top of the page: \"Koufax, Drysdale Eye $1 Million\nPact.\"That would be a paltry sum for a player today, when the average major\nleague salary is almost $4 million, but such riches were unheard of 50 years\nago. In 1965, Koufax won 26 games and his second Cy Young Award in three\nyears. He finished second to Willie Mays for the National League most-\nvaluable-player award.The Dodgers paid Koufax $85,000 that season. They paid\n$80,000 to Drysdale, who won 23 games, batted .300 with seven home runs, and\nfinished fifth in the MVP race.For 1966, the Dodgers offered $100,000 to\nKoufax and $85,000 to Drysdale. The San Francisco Giants had signed Mays for\ntwo years, at about $125,000 per year.Koufax and Drysdale, wary of the\nDodgers' playing one pitcher against the other, teamed up and asked for three\nyears at a total of $1 million — split equally, so that each would earn\n$167,000 per year. And they told the Dodgers to talk to their agent, akin to a\nsin at the time.The duo effectively became baseball's first union — a union of\ntwo.\"No one, to my knowledge, had ever thought about two pitchers teaming up,\"\nsaid Vin Scully, the voice of the Dodgers then and now.And what would the\nDodgers have been without Koufax and Drysdale?Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax,\nleft, and catcher John Roseboro celebrate on the field after beating the\nYankees in the 1963 World Series.Dodgers pitcher Sandy Koufax, left, and\ncatcher John Roseboro celebrate on the field after beating the Yankees in the\n1963 World Series.\"Nothing,\" shortstop Maury Wills said. \"We would not have\nwon without them.\"In Florida, the Dodgers went about the business of spring\ntraining. At one point, general manager Buzzie Bavasi gathered photographers\nas he jokingly knelt and prayed in front of the large pictures of Koufax and\nDrysdale hanging above the entrance to the team offices.In California, Koufax\nand Drysdale gathered photographers too, at Paramount Studios, as they signed\na deal to appear in a movie called \"Warning Shot\" — Koufax as a detective,\nDrysdale as a television commentator. They later agreed to appear on a\ntelevision variety show called \"The Hollywood Palace.\"\"Don is expected to sing\nwith his own guitar accompaniment,\" a show spokesman told The Times. \"Koufax\nwill concentrate on humor.\"As the holdout lingered and the season approached,\nScully said, fans took consolation in the absurdity of the Dodgers fielding a\nteam without Koufax and Drysdale.\"In the back of their minds, they thought,\n'It has to end, they're not going to play without those two,'\" Scully said.\n\"That would seem preposterous.\"But public opinion — and media coverage — was\nnot on the side of the pitchers. The Times' initial report on the salary\ndispute tagged Koufax and Drysdale as \"the flinging financiers\" pursuing\n\"their double-barreled raid on the Dodger treasury.\"A March 15, 1966 Times\nreport from spring training called the holdout \"the greatest player revolt in\nthe 77-year history of the Dodgers\" — ignoring or forgetting the heated\nobjections among several Brooklyn players to sharing a clubhouse with Jackie\nRobinson, who broke baseball's color barrier.Koufax declined an interview for\nthis story. In his 1966 autobiography, he said he was discouraged by the\nreception he and Drysdale got from a large segment of the fan base during the\nholdout.\"It was astonishing to me,\" Koufax wrote, \"to learn that there were a\nremarkably large number of American citizens who truly did not believe we had\nthe moral right to quit rather than work at a salary we felt — rightly or\nwrongly — to be less than we deserved. . . . Just take what the nice man wants\nto give you, get into your uniform, and go a fast 25 laps around the\nfield.\"::When the Dodgers opened camp in 1966, Koufax and Drysdale were not\nthe only stars holding out. So was Wills, who had finished third in the NL MVP\nrace — one spot behind Koufax, two spots ahead of Drysdale.That holdout ended\nquickly, in a meeting between Wills and Dodgers owner Walter O'Malley. With\nKoufax and Drysdale holding out too, O'Malley had seen more than enough.\"Mr.\nO'Malley scared me to death, saying I was in cahoots with them,\" Wills said.\n\"He said, 'They might be able to get away with that, but you can't.'\"I got a\nticket right away and went to spring training. He put a contract in front of\nme and I signed it. I didn't even look at it.\"That kind of episode was not\nunusual at the time, said Dick Moss, the first general counsel for the\nplayers' union under Miller. Players skilled in hitting or pitching were not\npermitted to employ an agent skilled in negotiation.\"They had to go in and\ntalk to the general manager about their contracts, alone,\" Moss said.Dodgers\npitcher Don Drysdale poses in action during spring training in March\n1959.Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale poses in action during spring training in\nMarch 1959.\"Players at the time were told they were lucky to be playing\nbaseball. If it wasn't for baseball, they'd be driving trucks. Or, if they\nwere black, they were told they would probably be picking cotton. It was a\nvery primitive time.\"Dollars aside, Koufax was ardent in his belief that\nplayers should be allowed to be represented by agents, and that an arbitration\nprocess should be available to resolve salary disputes.Under the so-called\n\"reserve clause\" in effect at the time, a player was bound to his team for as\nlong as the team liked, with no recourse other than retirement. A player could\nnot threaten to leave for another team.\"The best agent in the world couldn't\nalter the built-in advantage the reserve clause gives the club,\" Koufax wrote.\n\"I was under the impression that everybody in this country is entitled to\nrepresentation.\"In a 1967 first-person account in Sports Illustrated, Bavasi\nexplained why he resisted the concept of player representation.\"If I gave in\nand began negotiating baseball contracts through an agent, then I set a\nprecedent that's going to bring awful pain to general managers for years to\ncome,\" Bavasi wrote, \"because every salary negotiation with every humpty-\ndumpty fourth-string catcher is going to run into months of dickering.\"During\nthe holdout, Bavasi emphasized he would talk with the agent representing\nKoufax and Drysdale but would negotiate only with the players.\"Big mistake,\"\nsaid Peter O'Malley, who followed his father in running the Dodgers. Walter\nO'Malley died in 1979.Peter O'Malley said his father said privately that\nplayers, like management, ought to be entitled to qualified representation.\nO'Malley also said some of Bavasi's more glib comments might have inflamed the\nsituation, hardening positions and ultimately prolonging the holdout.Dodgers\npitcher Sandy Koufax holds up four baseballs a day after he pitched a perfect\ngameto become the first major leaguer to pitch four no–hit games.Dodgers\npitcher Sandy Koufax holds up four baseballs a day after he pitched a perfect\ngameto become the first major leaguer to pitch four no–hit games.\"It never\nshould have happened,\" O'Malley said.::On March 30, 1966, as the Dodgers flew\nwest from Florida, the team plane erupted in applause. Koufax and Drysdale had\nsigned.Koufax got $125,000. Drysdale got $110,000.\"They were worth every penny\nthey got, and more,\" Wills said.Bavasi was less than thrilled.\"When the smoke\nhad cleared, they stood together on the battlefield with $235,000 between\nthem,\" Bavasi wrote, \"and I stood there with a blood-stained cash box.\"Bavasi,\nwho died in 2008, wrote that the holdout \"gimmick\" had worked only because\nKoufax might have been the greatest pitcher of all time.\"Be sure to stick\naround for the fun the next time somebody tries that gimmick,\" Bavasi wrote.\n\"I don't care if the whole infield comes in as a package; the next year the\nwhole infield will be wondering what it is doing playing for the Nankai\nHawks.\"That became the most enduring legacy of the holdout, but not in the way\nBavasi had intended.Two years later, as Miller and Moss negotiated their first\ncollective bargaining agreement, owners wanted protection against players\nteaming up to hold out.Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale winds up his delivery\nagainst the Pittsburgh Pirates during a game at Forbes Field in 1965.Dodgers\npitcher Don Drysdale winds up his delivery against the Pittsburgh Pirates\nduring a game at Forbes Field in 1965.\"That was historic, and new, and\ntroublesome to a lot of people in the industry,\" Peter O'Malley said. \"If two\nof your four starting pitchers can do that, why can't your starting outfield\ndo it?\"The union's response, according to Moss: We'll be happy to agree that\nplayers cannot act in concert with one another, so long as the owners agree to\nthe same thing.The owners did, signing off on the language that two decades\nlater would be used to cite them for collusion in depressing free-agent\nsalaries. In 1990, the owners agreed to settle by paying the players $280\nmillion.\"It came back to bite them,\" Moss said.In the aftermath of the\nholdout, Koufax and Drysdale were not viewed as winners. They were not welcome\nto employ an agent. They did not split the salary difference with the Dodgers.\nThey settled for less. They signed contracts for one year, not three —\nalthough Koufax already had decided to retire after the 1966 season.And, in\nthat 1966 autobiography, Koufax made an admission that appears naive in\nhindsight.\"We were not out to break the reserve clause; we were trying to find\na way to live more comfortably inside it,\" he wrote. \"I think baseball needs\nthe reserve clause; I don't see how it could remain competitive without\nit.\"That was the prevailing view at the time, said Donald Fehr, who joined the\nunion in 1977 and succeeded Miller as its leader in 1985. Fehr stepped down in\n2009 and became executive director of the National Hockey League players'\nunion in 2010.As baseball's owners waged a fierce but ultimately unsuccessful\nfight to keep free agency out of the sport, they warned that the richest teams\nwould buy up all the best players. Bowie Kuhn, the commissioner from 1969-84,\nadmonished players that some teams would go bankrupt, and that the American\nLeague might even go out of business.The apocalypse never came to pass.In the\n15 years preceding the holdout, the New York Yankees won the World Series\nseven times, the Dodgers four times. In the past 15 years, 10 teams have won\nthe World Series, none more than three times.The major leagues have expanded\nto 30 teams, up from 20 at the time of the holdout and 24 at the advent of\nfree agency. The average player salary has jumped from $50,000 at the start of\nfree agency to almost $4 million last season.None of those riches found their\nway to Koufax or Drysdale, who died in 1993. They might have been the most\ndynamic pitching duo in baseball at the time, but they took a risk in bucking\nthe system in a way no one ever had.Dodger pitching greats Don Drysdale and\nSandy Koufax sit in the Giants clubhouse while receiving a visit from one of\nthe 1963 Little League World Series champions from Granada Hills, Calif.Dodger\npitching greats Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax sit in the Giants clubhouse\nwhile receiving a visit from one of the 1963 Little League World Series\nchampions from Granada Hills, Calif.\"It took a lot of courage, a lot of guts\nand a lot of determination to stand up and to do it in a quiet, dignified\nmanner,\" Fehr said. \"And the impression that they left on players was that, if\nyou do that, you can actually achieve success. You're not complete pawns.\nThere are things you can do.\"I think that message — sometimes overtly\ndiscussed, most of the time in the background — was one of the things which\nwas changing players' minds as Marvin came in. They began to organize. They\nbegan to educate players. They began to talk about the system.\"Within a\ndecade, Miller led the players on strike, and led a union charge that resulted\nin the abolition of the reserve clause and the introduction of salary\narbitration and free agency. The players most often associated with the charge\nwere Curt Flood, who unsuccessfully challenged the reserve clause in the\nSupreme Court, and Andy Messersmith, granted free agency by an arbitrator who\nruled the reserve clause should not be perpetual.Fehr recalled that Miller\noften said the \"first key event\" in the players' assertion of labor rights\nought not to be credited to the union.Koufax and Drysdale deserved the\ncredit.\"In terms of the development and enhancement of players' rights, in the\nmodern era, this was the first shot out of the cannon,\" Fehr said. \"And it was\ndone without Marvin and the union.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc646"},"content":"Republican leaders alarmed by the prospect of Donald Trump as their\npresidential nominee have only themselves to blame, Hillary Clinton said\nMonday, seeking to cast the party’s elite as extremists now trying to undercut\nPresident Obama’s constitutional obligation to fill out the Supreme\nCourt.Clinton recalled how the Senate majority leader had once said the\nparty’s primary purpose should be to make Obama a one-term president. She\nnoted that a leading Republican presidential contender, Sen. Ted Cruz of\nTexas, sparked a 2013 government shutdown in his drive to unravel Obama’s\nsignature health law.“What the Republicans have sown with their extremist\ntactics, they are now reaping with Donald Trump’s candidacy,” Clinton\nsaid.Clinton’s comments came in an address on the importance of the Supreme\nCourt as a voting issue, which has taken on greater resonance since the death\nof its conservative anchor, Justice Antonin Scalia.Clinton said Senate\nRepublicans’ refusal to consider Obama’s nominee to replace Scalia, Merrick\nGarland, was “the latest in a long line of actions aimed at disrupting our\ngovernment and undermining our president.”**Election 2016 | Live coverage on\nTrail Guide | Track the delegate race | Sign up for the newsletter  **“These\nthings are connected,” she said. “Once you make the extreme normal, you open\nthe door to even worse.”Clinton argued that the chairman of the Senate\nJudiciary Committee, Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, was ignoring the voices\nof tens of millions of voters who cast ballots for Obama in 2012, and called\non Grassley to schedule confirmation hearings when the Senate returns from its\nrecess.But the fight was larger than just the one seat on the high court,\nClinton added, noting that by election day in November, two other justices\nwill be at least 80 years old.Should a Republican president get to appoint\nmultiple justices, she said, it “could demolish the pillars of the progressive\nmovement,” after a period in which the court already had taken a “dangerous\nturn” by tilting the scales of justice toward the wealthy and powerful.“At its\nbest, the court is a place where the least powerful voices in our society are\nheard and protected,” she said, including those of African Americans “fighting\nfor the right to vote,” or women demanding abortion rights in the face of\n“humiliating laws that would strip that right away.”Clinton’s address, on the\ncampus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, was heavy on policy and\nreflected something of a hybrid strategy – appealing for votes in the state’s\ncompetitive April 5 primary while also laying down markers for the general\nelection fight in the fall.“Conservatives know exactly how high the stakes\nare,” she said, noting how often Republicans have sought to challenge Obama’s\npolicies in the courts. “As scary as it might be, ask yourselves: What kind of\njustice will a President Trump appoint? Or for that matter, what kind of\nattorney general? What kind of lower court judges?”Clinton actually seemed to\npromote another Democrat’s candidacy more than her own, that of former\nDemocratic Sen. Russ Feingold, who is running to win back the Wisconsin seat\nhe lost to incumbent Republican Ron Johnson in the 2010 tea party\nlandslide.She noted that the area where she spoke was demographically similar\nto those in which rival Bernie Sanders has enjoyed strong support, but that\nshe came to Madison nonetheless because she wanted to “compete for every\nvote.”Clinton urged Democrats to understand the high stakes in the election\nthis fall, particularly when it comes to the Supreme Court.As the Bernie\nSanders campaign accepts the reality that securing enough votes at this point\nto win the Democratic nomination outright is impossible, it has moved on to a\nnew phase in its long-shot bid for the White House: hijack Hillary Clinton’s\nso-called superdelegates.Sanders advisors are targeting...As the Bernie\nSanders campaign accepts the reality that securing enough votes at this point\nto win the Democratic nomination outright is impossible, it has moved on to a\nnew phase in its long-shot bid for the White House: hijack Hillary Clinton’s\nso-called superdelegates.Sanders advisors are targeting...“If we’re serious\nabout fighting for progressive causes, we need to focus on the court,” she\nsaid.She did not indicate whether she would renominate Garland if he were not\nconfirmed by the Senate this year, saying only that she would not “second-\nguess” Obama’s decision, one she suggested was influenced by the political\nrealities of divided government.But she did say she would look for judicial\nnominees who had “broader human experience” beyond legal circles, and even\npossibly compile a list of potential choices after the primary.In a statement\nbefore Clinton spoke, Grassley dismissed her address as an effort to distract\nvoters from congressional investigations into her handling of sensitive\nmaterials as secretary of State.The statement also listed outstanding\nquestions that the Judiciary Committee has sought answers to involving\nClinton’s compliance with the Freedom of Information Act and other federal\nrecords laws.Michael Short, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee,\nalso accused Clinton of hypocrisy on the judicial nomination issue, citing her\nopposition to the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito and to\nother lower court nominees of President George W. Bush.“The only reason\nHillary Clinton is calling on Republicans to breach decades of bipartisan\nprecedent of not confirming election year Supreme Court nominees is so she\ncould have a liberal majority on the court to help her carry on President\nObama’s legacy of executive overreach if elected,” Short said.**Follow\n@mikememoli for more news on the 2016 campaign and Supreme\nCourt.****ALSO:****As California primary nears, state Democrats are uniting\nbehind Clinton and against a common enemy: Trump****Donald Trump leads in\nCalifornia primary race but threatens a GOP fracture****Clinton email probe\nenters new phase as FBI interviews loom**\n\n","title":"Hillary Clinton says Republicans have only themselves to blame for Donald Trump - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Hillary Clinton says Republicans have only themselves to blame for Donald Trump https://t.co/pHQt0KfjJN https://t.co/4SHL7K101D","date":"Tue Mar 29 10:05:12 +0000 2016","favs":83,"id":{"$numberLong":"714755278269493249"},"retweets":61},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/22VONjw"}

The tech\nworld wants to make sure it doesn't happen again.The FBI's declaration Monday\nthat it could hack into an iPhone without Apple's help -- a device the agency\nhad insisted carried security measures only the tech giant could defeat -- at\nleast temporarily ends the clash between Washington and Silicon Valley.Though\na momentary reprieve for Apple and its peers, the tech industry's reaction to\nthe FBI's decision contained more warning than celebration.Perhaps with good\nreason: The FBI's move to dismiss legal actions against Apple in the\ninvestigation of the San Bernardino attack does little to settle the heated\nback-and-forth between law enforcement agencies seeking to expand their crime-\nfighting toolbox and tech firms fearful of being compelled to work at the\nbehest of the government, executives and experts said.“This entire experience\nhas shown we need to have much broader conversation around the policy,\nregulation and laws in a digital world and what does it mean to have secure\ntechnology,” Aaron Levie, chief executive of online storage provider Box Inc.,\nsaid in an interview.Federal officials on Monday dropped their legal fight\nagainst Apple after unlocking the iPhone used by an assailant in last year's\nSan Bernardino terror attack, leaving unsettled a vexing debate over privacy\nand security amid rapid advances in technology.The move comes a week after\nJustice Department...Federal officials on Monday dropped their legal fight\nagainst Apple after unlocking the iPhone used by an assailant in last year's\nSan Bernardino terror attack, leaving unsettled a vexing debate over privacy\nand security amid rapid advances in technology.The move comes a week after\nJustice Department...Denelle Dixon-Thayer, chief legal and business officer at\nsoftware firm Mozilla, said in a statement that nothing had changed as far as\nthe \"need to have the broader discussion of what limits should be placed on\nlaw enforcement’s ability to compel assistance from tech companies.\"Since the\nfight between Apple and the FBI became public in early February, cybersecurity\nexperts have repeatedly said that the FBI could find a way into the gunman's\niPhone 5c on its own given enough resources and time.“Software is so huge,\nespecially an operating system, you can never make it 100% secure,\" said Will\nStrafach, who runs software firm Sudo Security Inc. \"Things are just too\ninsecure to argue the only way in is through the manufacturer.\"Now, tech\nofficials have a clear-cut example proving that argument, experts said.“Courts\nthat hear claims that the FBI can’t break into a cellphone will receive those\nclaims more skeptically,\" said Gregory T. Nojeim, senior counsel at the Center\nfor Democracy \u0026amp; Technology. \"Congress will be more hesitant than it\nalready was to enact legislation requiring Apple to build in back door. I\nthink that idea might well be taken off the table now.\"Some members of\nCongress are already seeking to create a National Commission on Digital\nSecurity that would include tech executives, privacy advocates, law\nenforcement officials and academics.Apple said Monday that it \"remains\ncommitted to participating\" in \"a national conversation about our civil\nliberties, and our collective security and privacy.\"Without national consensus\non the limits of law enforcement, disputes like the one in San Bernardino\n\"will literally happen thousands of more times over the next many decades,\"\nLevie said. If anything, the experts and executives said, Monday's news raises\nnew questions about how far law enforcement can go to hack into phones.What's\n\"appropriate\" and what \"should be out of bounds?\" Nojeim said. \"What’s the FBI\ngoing to do with the [hacking technique] that it’s just developed?\"Strafach\ncalled it problematic for Apple that the FBI holds a way to crack security\nmeasures of at least one specific iPhone -- the work device of San Bernardino\nterrorism attack gunman Syed Rizwan Farook. No company wants its device to be\nsusceptible to hacking. But the existence of that flaw is the “lesser of two\nevils” when compared with what could have been a potential judicial order\nforcing Apple to develop and deploy software against its will.Ordering tech\ncompanies into “forced labor” would have been a process the FBI replicated,\nStrafach said. But the agency will have to be more cautious with its new\nhacking technique because unfettered use could end up exposing the details of\nthe method, he said.“The nice thing is by nature it has to be carefully used\nand in situations where it’s absolutely needed,” Strafach said. “If they don’t\nkeep it guarded, it will get out there and Apple will be able to fix it.\"It's\nunclear when, or if, the day will come when most tech security holes are no\nlonger relatively easy to access; Strafach put it at least 20 years away.But\nthe \"broader discussion\" needs to address that as people demand greater\nprotection, experts said.\"The industry isn’t spending money [on improving\nsecurity] and prefers to simply apologize when its products are hacked or\nplead ignorance and blame the users,\" said Vivek Wadhwa, a corporate\ngovernance fellow at Stanford University. \"This must change and we must hold\ntech companies liable for their inferior\nproducts.\"paresh.dave@latimes.comTwitter: @peard33**ALSO****Bernie Sanders has\na plan to hijack Hillary Clinton's superdelegates****Reports of hundreds of\nshots fired draw sheriff, FBI response in Apple Valley****Gov.

They had 100-foot Manila ropes and also\npitons, but only used a couple. They felt their way up. \"They didn't know what\nto expect,\" said Dawson's son, Keith.What worried them most was not knowing\nhow long it would take. \"We didn't want to get caught at night on the face,\"\nGlen Dawson later told The Times. \"We moved right along.\"They hustled up an\narea now known as the Washboard, then ventured the Fresh Air Traverse, which\nrose over a 1,000-foot precipice where Underhill led instead of Dawson. After\nthat, a scramble up a steep chimney and several more walls brought them to the\ntop, where they flopped down long enough for photos.Decades after his famous\nEast Face ascent, Dawson, a member of a prominent L.A. antiquarian bookselling\nfamily, still remembered the moment as a figurative as well as literal high\npoint. \"That day in August in 1931...\" he said, trailing off.Dawson, who was\nshort and wiry, was a natural climber with a low center of gravity who made\nseveral other first ascents in the Sierra while still a teenager.Later, he\nalso led a group that included his brother up the East Buttress of Mt. Whitney\nin 1937 — another first, said friend and Sierra Club mountaineering historian\nBill Oliver.Dawson's climbs helped introduce modern rope techniques to the\nWest and launched a golden age of Sierra climbing, said Bob Cates, history\ncommittee chairman of the Angeles Chapter of the Sierra Club.Born June 3,\n1912, Dawson was the first of four children of Ernest and Sadie Dawson. His\nfather ran Dawson's Books, but was also an outdoor enthusiast who knew John\nMuir and named one of his sons in his honor. Glen Dawson became a lifetime\nmember of the Sierra Club in 1921, and was the organization's longest-tenured\nmember until his death from natural causes at a Pasadena retirement home.He\ngraduated from UCLA with a history degree and became an ardent mountaineer and\nfriend of photographer Ansel Adams. The East Face climb came after Francis\nFarquhar of the Sierra Club organized a course in modern climbing techniques\nwith Underhill, who was then a famous climber.Eichorn, Underhill, Clyde and\nDawson had several firsts behind them when they attempted the face. Dawson\ncontinued climbing for years until the death of a friend in a climbing\naccident, a hard fall and marriage convinced him to quit cold turkey and raise\nhis family, his son said.Dawson earned a Bronze Star in combat in Northern\nItaly with the 10th Mountain Division in World War II, his son said.He joined\nhis father in the bookselling business. Dawson's began on Broadway and\noperated in several more locations before settling in Larchmont. Dawson later\nran the store with his brother Muir, who died in 2005.Dawson served on the\nSierra Club's board until 1951. In later years, he helped compile a history\nfor the group and donated hundreds of photos to its archive.Keith Dawson\ndescribed his father as understated and generous, and shorter than both his\nwife and son. Glen Dawson didn't drink, never smoked, and was very involved in\nactivities at his church, his son said.As for his climbing talents, \"we won't\nsee the likes of him again for sure,\" Oliver said.Dawson's wife, Mary Helen,\ndied in 2002.

At the hearing Monday, Hasan Ikhrata, executive director\nof the Southern California Assn. of Governments, agreed.Though the committee\nmembers — including Frazier — largely expressed support for the project, the\nquestions they asked during the three-hour hearing were more substantive and\ndetailed than any legislative panel has raised in recent years.And rail\nauthority officials, including chairman Dan Richard, were more direct in\nlaying out the project's potential problems.\"There are going to be things that\ngo wrong,\" Richard said. \"There are going to be things that are\nunexpected.\"But he rejected the assertions of critics who say the project has\nbeen compromised so drastically that it bears no resemblance to what voters\napproved in a $9-billion bond measure in 2008.\"We are delivering what the\npublic voted for,\" Richard said.**Interested in the stories shaping\nCalifornia? Sign up for the free Essential California newsletter \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**The\ndependence on cap-and-trade funding, which would supply about half the money\nfor the initial segment, drew the most concern.Frazier questioned whether the\ngreenhouse gas marketplace would actually be shrinking over coming decades,\nwhile the rail authority's planning is based on getting steady $500-million\nannual allotments.The plan calls for issuing bonds against future revenues\nbeyond 2025. But legislative analysts said that future was difficult to\npredict.Depending on economic and technological trends, the number of\ngreenhouse gas credits is expected to decrease over time, but the price of\nthose credits could go up. Frazier asked whether private investors would buy\nbonds based on such uncertainty.The answer from the expert peer review panel\nsuggested California might face higher financing costs and probably would be\nforced to make outright guarantees to investors, difficult issues for a future\nlegislature to consider.The project does not need any immediate legislative\naction. It is moving along — constructing about 118 miles of track in the\nCentral Valley — by virtue of its access to greenhouse gas fees and $3.2\nbillion in federal grants, as well as the voter-approved bonds.But within a\nyear or two, the Legislature will need to extend the fees beyond 2020 and\nauthorize the rail authority to borrow against those future revenues. At the\nsame time, the rail authority will have to figure out whether it can get past\nlitigation that has tied up the bond funds for several years.The new business\nplan also changed a previous commitment to build the initial segment from\nBurbank to the Central Valley. That prompted complaints Monday by\nrepresentatives from both the Inland Empire and the Merced region.Adam Gray, a\nMerced Democrat, said he had been blindsided by the decision that left Merced\nout of the initial segment.\"We owe you and your constituents an apology,\"\nRichard said.Assemblywoman Cheryl Brown (D-San Bernardino) wanted to know what\ngood the project would do for her community, saying that the previous plan at\nleast would have provided jobs in Southern California.And Catharine Baker, a\nBay Area Republican, asked Richard about a Los Angeles Times report Monday\nthat said the lead contractor on the first 29 miles of construction through\nFresno had submitted a list of more than 300 pending change orders that could\nadd hundreds of millions of dollars to the project's cost.Richard said the\nstate already had disclosed those risks to the public. \"Could they result in\ncost increases?

A giant framed Lower Merion High jersey from\nPhiladelphia.The Utah Jazz gave him an unusual bookend to his often incredible\ncareer.He had four airballs against the Jazz as a rookie in a 1997 playoff\ngame. The Lakers shot a major airball Monday in an embarrassing 123-75 loss\nthat tied the largest in their 68-year history.Farewell, Kobe?“What've we got,\n15 wins on the season?” Bryant said, chuckling harshly while searching for the\nright words. “I mean, right? Losing by 48, winning 15 games in a season. It's\nnot like it's something new for us. We've been getting drug all season.”Only\nthis was something new, something worse than all the other losses as the\nLakers (15-59) pinwheel rapidly toward their worst season. They trailed by 53\nand needed some late scoring to even match their 48-point loss to the Clippers\nin March 2014.Rodney Hood, of all people, lit them up for 30 first-half\npoints, only seven fewer than the Lakers. His eight three-pointers in the half\nhad already tied a single-game record for Utah (37-37).In the only pro-Lakers\nnugget, Bryant held Hood scoreless in the second half after switching to guard\nhim, though this was hardly good news to Byron Scott.“It's a damn shame that\nour oldest player has to take the challenge,” the Lakers coach said. “Nobody\nelse wanted to step up and take that challenge. That's a shame that the oldest\nguy on our team, that's leaving this league in eight games, was the one that\nhad to kind of shut him down.”Bryant, 37, didn't provide much of a challenge\non offense, making one of 11 shots for five points. Despite stopping Hood, he\nwas a stunning minus-43 in the plus-minus column.None of the Lakers' young\nplayers did anything. D'Angelo Russell had five points on two-for-11 shooting.\nJulius Randle had two points and one rebound in 24 minutes. Jordan Clarkson\nmade five of 18 shots at Vivint Smart Home Arena.Scott claimed he didn't say a\nword to players after the game. He gave them a message a few minutes later\nthrough reporters.“You've got to show this organization that you deserve to be\nhere, that you understand what wearing that purple and gold is all about,” he\nsaid. “I don't think a lot of guys in that locker room understand that right\nnow.”When Kobe Bryant retires, the Lakers obviously need a new franchise\nplayer.Is the next Bryant already on their roster?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc650"},"content":"Gov. Jerry Brown, lawmakers and leaders of two major labor unions held a news\nconference Monday in Sacramento to unveil details of an agreement that would\nraise California’s minimum wage to $15 an hour. Here’s what we know – and\ndon’t know – about the proposal and the politics behind it.The simple answer\nis that the politics were right. Two different labor unions vowed to put the\nissue on the Nov. 8 statewide ballot, and one of those initiatives officially\nqualified for the ballot last week. The governor and lawmakers have been\nquietly working the last few weeks on a proposal that the unions would find\ngood enough to abandon their ballot plans. Neither of those initiatives would\nhave allowed for temporary pauses in the wage increase, one of Brown’s long-\nstanding objections.It’s important to note that the minimum wage debate is\nalso a key element of the Democratic presidential race as the campaigns arrive\nin California ahead of the June 7 primary. Both Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\nand former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton support raising the federal\nminimum wage, though progressive groups have criticized Clinton for not\nembracing the $15-an-hour level but stopping at support for a $12-an-hour\nnationwide wage.Now that the minimum wage proposal has been formally\nintroduced, both houses of the Legislature could act quickly to approve it and\nsend it to Brown for his signature. An Assembly committee hearing has been\nscheduled for Wednesday, and final legislative action in both houses could\ncome on Thursday.**Follow the action on our Essential Politics news feed\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Probably pretty good. Democrats control both the state Senate and\nstate Assembly by substantial margins and the party has long identified the\nminimum wage as a key issue. State lawmakers approved the last wage increase\nin 2013.That being said, a key question is how many business-aligned Democrats\nraise objections. A sizable portion of the Assembly’s 51 Democrats consider\nthemselves part of what they call the “mod caucus,” a group that has proved\nmore fiscally cautious than their more liberal colleagues. The minimum wage\nlegislation will likely require a simple majority – 41 votes in the 80-seat\nAssembly – to pass. If a substantial number of the “mods” balk, the plan could\nbe in trouble.The odds are generally seen to be stronger in the 40-member\nstate Senate, where the bill would likely need 21 votes in favor. Democrats\nhold 26 seats, and liberal legislators dominate more in the Senate than in the\nAssembly.California’s statewide minimum wage rose to $10 on Jan. 1 and the new\nagreement would trigger further increases over the next six years. Here’s the\nschedule outlined in a document obtained by the Los Angeles Times:For\ncompanies with fewer than 25 workers, the increases would start in 2018 and\nend at $15 an hour in 2023. Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de León said that\nabout 5.6 million workers will benefit from the wage hike. In 2022, the annual\nincome of a person working a full-time, minimum wage job at $15 an hour would\nrise to $31,200. In 2016, the annual income of a person earning $10 an hour in\na full-time job is $20,800.In addition, labor unions successfully won as many\nas three additional paid sick days for their members who work as in-home care\nproviders.Those are exactly why Brown has resisted most plans for a minimum\nwage increase introduced in the Legislature. The tentative agreement allows a\ngovernor to hit the pause button on all of the scheduled increases except the\none in 2017, but would require that governor to show either a decline in\nstatewide job growth or new estimates of state budget deficits.The proposal\nalso makes a concession to small businesses, allowing those with fewer than 26\nworkers an additional year to raise wages. No. Labor unions have spent\nmillions of dollars gathering signatures, and they want to see the final\ndetails of the minimum wage agreement before standing down. The $15 an hour\ninitiative that qualified last week doesn’t have to be formally withdrawn from\nthe ballot until late June.But the deal is widely seen as being far-reaching\nenough to gain the support of the unions, who then wouldn’t have to spend tens\nof millions of dollars on minimum wage political campaigns this fall.\nDemocrats will no doubt applaud that, as it means those unions may then use\nthose campaign dollars for other causes – including a closely watched effort\nto extend temporary income taxes on the most\nwealthy.**_john.myers@latimes.com_****Follow @johnmyers on Twitter, sign up\nfor our daily Essential Politics newsletter and listen to the weekly\nCalifornia Politics Podcast.****ALSO:****Deal reached to raise minimum wage to\n$15****Lawmakers forced to choose: Raise California's minimum wage, or leave\nthe issue to voters****How pay for the lowest wage earners has turned into a\nnational fight****Cities want to raise the minimum wage.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc651"},"content":"California has taken a step closer to becoming the first state to make\nretirement savings accounts a near-universal benefit for workers with a plan\nthat lawmakers hope will help ease an expected massive shortfall in retirement\nsavings.A state board Monday sent a set of recommendations to the Legislature\ncalling for the creation of the California Secure Choice Retirement Plan —\nessentially a 401(k) plan operated by the state and open to private-sector\nworkers whose employers don't offer a retirement savings plan.Employees of any\ncompany with at least five workers would be eligible to participate. That\nwould cover an estimated 6.8 million workers, about a third of California's\nlabor force.The plan calls for eligible workers to be signed up automatically\nby their employers and have 2% to 5% of their wages invested in the plan,\nunless workers opt out.Business groups have questioned whether the plan could\ncost employers or make them liable for investment losses or other problems.\nBut state officials have said the retirement plans would be similar to those\navailable to many private-sector employees and, unlike pension plans for state\nworkers, would not be funded or guaranteed by employers or\ntaxpayers.Retirement savings advocates say the kind of state-run retirement\naccounts being considered by California and a handful of other states could\nhelp millions of Americans — especially lower-income workers, who are the\nleast likely to save — put away at least a small retirement nest egg.\"These\nare plans that would be set up for employees who have nothing,\" said Karen\nFriedman, policy director for the advocacy group Pension Rights Center. \"It's\na way of getting people saving. But we look at them as modest savings plans.\nThey're not a replacement for good, old-fashioned pension plans.\"For young\nworkers who start out saving 5% of their wages, the plan — depending on\ninvestment returns — could ultimately provide about one-third of the money\nthey'll need to get through retirement, according to Overture Financial, a\nconsulting firm that worked on the plan.The National Institute on Retirement\nSecurity estimates that about 45% of private-sector workers are not offered a\nretirement savings plan through their employer. And though workers without an\nemployer-sponsored plan can create individual retirement accounts and other\nsavings plans on their own, AARP estimates that only about 5% of such workers\ndo so. That has led to growing concerns of a looming retirement crisis, as\nlarge numbers of baby boomers move into their retirement years without\ntraditional pensions with fixed monthly payments.**SIGN UP for the free\nCalifornia Inc. business newsletter \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**The Secure Choice Retirement\nPlan has been in the works since 2012, when state Sen. Kevin de León (D-Los\nAngeles) wrote a bill calling for the creation of a board to look into the\nfeasibility of a state-run retirement plan for private workers.At a news\nconference Monday, De León mentioned his aunt, who worked as a housekeeper for\nyears but didn't save for retirement, as representative of the millions of\nCalifornians who don't have enough — or any — savings.\"My aunt had to keep\nworking until her body physically gave out. She relies on me as her 401(k) to\nhelp her through her retirement,\" he said. \"Nearly 50% of middle-income\nworkers are at real risk of sliding into poverty when they can no longer\nwork.\"The Secure Choice Retirement Savings Investment Board created by De\nLeón's earlier bill recommended that the Legislature require employees be\nenrolled in the program automatically, though they could choose not to\nparticipate. The idea is that workers are much more likely to save for\nretirement if that's the path of least resistance.\"It begins to put in the\nminds of many people that savings can be automatic,\" said Blanca Castro of\nAARP, which supports the plan.The board's recommendations will now be\nincorporated into a bill that De León introduced last month. Similar proposals\nare under consideration in Oregon, Illinois, Connecticut and other states,\nthough publicly run retirement plans are not yet open for business in any\nstate.An Obama administration program launched last year, called MyRA, as in\n\"my retirement account,\" also aims to give workers a retirement savings option\nif they don't have a plan through their jobs. But the MyRA program allows\nworkers to save only $15,000 before they have to move their cash into a\nprivate account.De León said he hopes that his bill will pass by July,\nallowing it to become law in January. Still, there are plenty of details to be\nhashed out and the plan could be more than a year away from investing money on\nworkers' behalf.\"We have lot of figuring out to do,\" said Christina Elliott,\nacting executive director of the Secure Choice investment board. \"Clearly we\nwon't be enrolling on Jan. 1, 2017.\"A key issue will be where to park workers'\ncontributions. The board recommended that the retirement plan initially invest\nin U.S. Treasury bonds or other ultra-safe investments while officials study\nwhether other types of securities — mutual funds, for instance — should be\nmade available.There's also the question of how money will be taken from\nworkers' checks and how their investments will be managed.Elliott said the\ngoal is to minimize employers' role in the process. They'll be responsible for\nenrolling workers in the program and deducting money from their checks, then\npassing that money along to the board.The board, in turn, will hire a third-\nparty investment firm — think 401(k) giants Vanguard Group or Fidelity\nInvestments — to manage that money.The state plan could be big business for an\ninvestment manager. Overture Financial estimated that the average worker\neligible for the plan makes about $35,000 a year, and that at least 70% of\neligible workers would participate.If most workers save about 3% of their\nincome, that represents about $5 billion in assets after just the first\nyear.Other questions to be sorted out include whether workers will be able to\ntake money out of the plan before retirement age and how the funds will be\ndistributed once they do retire. \"We don't want folks to save, do a good job,\nbe consistent, then take a big lump sum and go to Vegas,\" De León said.De\nLeón's 2012 bill setting the retirement plan in motion passed along party\nlines and was signed by Gov. Jerry Brown. His new bill incorporating the\nboard's recommendations, SB 1234, will have its first hearing in the Senate\nCommittee on Public Employment and Retirement on April 22.Marc Lifsher, a\nspokesman for California State Treasurer John Chiang, said he is optimistic\nthat the new legislation to enact the plan will also make it through the\nDemocratic-controlled Legislature. \"De León has a lot of clout.

Nearby sat a Home Depot box filled with the belongings he brought to spring training. A career that began as a first-round draft pick in 1993 was coming to an end.\"It's time, and I know it,\" Wright said.After 19 major league seasons with 10 teams, Wright announced his retirement Monday afternoon after he learned he would not make the Dodgers' opening-day roster. He had been a longshot to make the club, but at 41 Wright was compelled to try one more spring.His was among the quirkier careers in recent history. Wright is one of only 10 pitchers ever to start 200 games and relieve in 400 others. His career spanned generations: He gave up his first home run, in 1996, to **Ken Caminiti**, and his last, in 2014, to **Lucas Duda**. He had a career record of 97-130 with a 4.81 earned-run average, yet he endured, year after year.Wright sat out 2015 after Texas released him shortly before opening day. For eight consecutive seasons, from 2005 to 2013, he'd made a team each spring as a nonroster invitee.\"The reason I did it was because I loved the game, and I loved to be on that mound,\" Wright said. \"I wish any baseball fan, any baseball lover, got the opportunity to be on that mound and know what it feels like to stand in front of 50,000 people. I'm starting to cry. Because I loved it that much. I loved it that much.\"Wright informed Manager **Dave Roberts** of his decision Sunday. Roberts gave Wright the chance to address the team Monday.\"It was a great message,\" Roberts said. \"And it was received really well.\"Bill Plaschke and Lindsey Thiry discuss the upcoming Dodgers season from spring training at Camelback Ranch.Bill Plaschke and Lindsey Thiry discuss the upcoming Dodgers season from spring training at Camelback Ranch.Wright said he would miss the chance to play for Roberts. But he realized in the last few weeks that his concentration on the game had drained.\"Sometimes I'd throw a pitch and I'd ask myself, 'Was I even looking at the glove when I threw that pitch?\"' he said. \"My focus and everything has been somewhere else.\"He added, \"It was kind of like one of those movies where you keep seeing flashes of the last 20, 30 years pop up. Different experiences, different people, different stadiums, different times on the mound.\"Wright did not rule out a future in coaching or some other aspect of the game. But he knew his immediate destination: his home near Dallas.\"My plan is to go home and be involved with my family,\" Wright said. \"I've got three beautiful children.

March 28, 2016. (WGN-TV)Emanuel appointed Johnson interim\nsuperintendent after rejecting the three finalists his hand-picked Police\nBoard had sent him.

Cooperate with a federal civil rights\ninvestigation into the use of force. Reform a police department with a history\nof corruption. Deal with some of the nation's most intractable gun and gang\nproblems. And work for a famously demanding mayor now governing in\nthe...Technically, the Police Board has to do another search and forward names\nto Emanuel. The mayor said he is encouraging Johnson to apply this time.\nJohnson, who said he didn't apply last time because interim Supt. John\nEscalante was going for the job, indicated he will apply.That's a strong\nindicator Johnson will be among the new finalists and get the job permanently.\nWhen pressed, however, Emanuel left open the possibility of naming someone\nother than Johnson to the job permanently.The news conference came hours after\nblack and Latino aldermen took a victory lap Monday for the part they played\nin Emanuel's decision to pick a minority Chicago Police Department veteran.\nAldermen were careful not to throw their victory in the mayor's face,\nhowever.The chairmen of the Black and Latino caucuses also painted the work\ntheir groups did together to pressure Emanuel as the beginning of further\ncollaboration as they try to take a more prominent role in shaping city\npolicy.\"We've been talking about that,\" said 6th Ward Alderman Roderick\nSawyer, the Black Caucus chairman, \"and really what the gist of this is about\nis the Latino Caucus, the Black Caucus are continuing to work together toward\ntransformative change in the city of Chicago. Let's be quite honest here. The\ncity is comprised of a majority of black and Latino members. We're the\nmajority. Between the two of us, our two caucuses are the majority on the City\nCouncil.\"\"By working together, great things happen, and I think Eddie\nJohnson's a product of that,\" added 12th Ward Alderman George Cardenas, Latino\nCaucus chairman. \"When you have African Americans and Hispanics working\ntogether and the mayor taking that advice and fleshing that out of the best\ncandidate, how can we not support that? How can we not, jointly, in\ncommunities that are beset by problems and also by the rank and file being in\nlow morale, how can we not join together in that decision that benefits\neveryone in this city?\"Cardenas looked ahead to addressing problems he said\nare particularly pressing in black and Latino neighborhoods.\"You talk about\neconomic inequality, you talk about school inequality, those are real issues\nthat are facing our communities,\" he said. \"And we should be sitting down and\ncarving that out as a topic of discussion so we can move this city forward in\na positive way, and being, obviously, that instrument of change. Because the\nmayor obviously can't do everything on his own, and can't possibly know\neverything that goes on in every corner of the city.\"The duo passed up a\nchance to send a message that they will be dictating terms to Emanuel on\nissues going forward in favor of a softer sell.It's \"not a power play,\" Sawyer\nsaid. \"But just respect our communities. I think the mayor understands that\nand I believe that he will respect that, that we're making sure that the type\nof government that we exist in, which is a strong council, weak mayor form of\ngovernment, that's the government that we exist in, we want to make sure that\nit happens for the benefit of the citizens of the city of Chicago.\"In\npractice, however, the mayor has long been a much more powerful figure in\nChicago government than the 50-member City Council. And the city's black and\nLatino communities historically have had a fraught political relationship,\nshown recently when mayoral challenger Jesus \"Chuy\" Garcia, amid black voters'\ndistrust of Emanuel, lost to the mayor in black-majority wards in their head-\nto-head 2015 election despite Garcia's attempts to build a \"black-brown\ncoalition.\"Sawyer was quick to point out Monday that Emanuel is the one who's\ngoing to be judged based on Johnson's performance.\"I do respect that the mayor\nhas that position, that is the mayor's position,\" Sawyer said. \"He lives or\ndies with his police superintendent just like we live or die with our ward\nsuperintendent, you know. It's that similar situation. We want someone we can\ntrust to be right there in this position, and he needs somebody that he can\ntrust to be in that position.\"Asked whether he believed they pressured Emanuel\ninto his choice, Sawyer demurred.\"I just thought he listened to what we had to\nsay, and I believe he thought the qualities [we sought] made sense, and maybe\nhe picked somebody who fit those qualities. I don't think that we,\nindividually, had any individual say-so in what the mayor did,\" he said.The\nfriendly atmosphere was in evidence as the two aldermen Monday supported\npositions important to the other's caucus.Hispanic aldermen had been upset\nthat Escalante wasn't named as a finalist, and Cardenas said that still\nstings. But he said he has heard positive things about Johnson and the Latino\nCaucus is prepared to back him.Cardenas also made clear, however, that he\nwants to see more Hispanics moving up the ranks to command positions in the\nPolice Department, and Sawyer said he agrees that needs to happen.The mayor's\nselection of Johnson came after members of the council's 17-member Black\nCaucus held a news conference Thursday to say they wanted the mayor to hire a\nblack officer from within the department. The group stopped short of endorsing\nEugene Williams, a finalist for the job who serves as chief of the\ndepartment's Bureau of Support Services — a public hint that some black\naldermen preferred a different African American candidate in the department.\nBut Sawyer on Monday said that Johnson's selection came from the mayor, not\nblack aldermen.Both aldermen Monday questioned the Police Board process that\nproduced as candidates department veteran Williams along with outsiders Cedric\nAlexander, of suburban Atlanta, and Anne Kirkpatrick of Spokane, Wash., all of\nwhom the mayor eventually rejected amid a chorus of skepticism from minorities\non the City Council.\"I really question how do you get somebody from Spokane,\nWash., in those three finalists and not a Hispanic who potentially could have\nbeen from L.A., somebody from a place with some urban commonalities when it\ncomes to the cities,\" Cardenas said._jebyrne@tribpub.com\n__bruthhart@tribpub.com __Twitter @_johnbyrne_\n\n","title":"Emanuel: New top cop Johnson will restore trust and pride in CPD - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Chicago's new top cop will restore trust in embattled department, mayor says https://t.co/YG8zMc1kKo https://t.co/xhSK59qX0l","date":"Tue Mar 29 02:40:06 +0000 2016","favs":34,"id":{"$numberLong":"714643266499702785"},"retweets":30},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1XZovcT"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc659"},"content":"The ongoing debate over tipping, service charges and the minimum wage for\nrestaurant employees has been a much talked about subject in the Los Angeles\ndining scene for quite some time now. But the issue came to a head Thursday\nwhen the state Legislature approved a plan to increase the minimum wage in\nCalifornia from $10 an hour to $10.50 next year and incrementally to $15 an\nhour by 2022. According to a document obtained by The Times, businesses with\nfewer than 25 employees would have an extra year to comply with the $15 an\nhour rate. What does this mean for restaurant owners and diners? Here's a look\nat the facts. **How will this affect tipping?** Restaurants in California are\nnot allowed to count an employee's tip credit toward overall wages. So servers\nand other front-of-the-house employees who receive tips will continue to\nreceive tips, as well as the increase in their hourly pay. This could further\nwiden the pay gap between front-of-house employees and those back-of-house\nworkers who generally do not receive tips. **Will dinner be more expensive?\n**In Los Angeles, the Bel-Air Bar + Grill announced it will increase menu\nprices, eliminate tipping and increase employee wages. It \"allows us to offer\nour entire staff a fair, living wage,\" the restaurant said in a recent Times\narticle. And in Culver City, Bar Nine coffee shop and roaster has eliminated\ntipping and increased the price of most drinks by 50 cents. Nationally, some\nrestaurants are doing away with tipping and adopting an all-inclusive model to\nprovide higher wages for employees. Among them is New York-based chef Danny\nMeyer (Shake Shack, Gramercy Tavern). He raised menu prices to compensate for\nthe employee pay increase. In a recent essay, Evan Kleiman, who ran Angeli\nCaffe in Los Angeles for 27 years and is the longtime host of KCRW's \"Good\nFood,\" advocated for doing away with tipping in favor of all-inclusive\npricing.A deal that would raise California's minimum wage to $15 an hour was\nmet with a mixture of joy and anxiety across the state Sunday.Some workers and\nlabor officials hailed it as a breakthrough in providing higher-wage jobs in\nfields where it's a struggle to make ends meet. But some business owners\nfeared...A deal that would raise California's minimum wage to $15 an hour was\nmet with a mixture of joy and anxiety across the state Sunday.Some workers and\nlabor officials hailed it as a breakthrough in providing higher-wage jobs in\nfields where it's a struggle to make ends meet. But some business owners\nfeared...**What about service charges?** Some Los Angeles restaurants,\nincluding Jon \u0026amp; Vinny's, Trois Mec and Petit Trois, have implemented\nmandatory service charges. Employers own the revenue generated from this\ncharge and are not required to share it with employees. Most restaurants with\na service charge will make clear on the customer bill where the revenue from\nthe service charge will go. Diners are free to leave tips on top of the\nservice charge, or not. This led to confusion at Andy Ricker's Pok Pok in\nChinatown, where customers ended up mistaking the charge for the total tip or\nnot leaving as much as they normally would. Ricker eventually eliminated the\n5% service charge.  Why do we tip?The American practice of tipping used to not\nbe so American. Several histories of tipping trace it back to a practice\nadapted from Europeans, whose own history of tipping goes back to at least\nTudor England, when overnight guests would leave a small gratuity (or vails)\nfor the house...Why do we tip?The American practice of tipping used to not be\nso American. Several histories of tipping trace it back to a practice adapted\nfrom Europeans, whose own history of tipping goes back to at least Tudor\nEngland, when overnight guests would leave a small gratuity (or vails) for the\nhouse...**How is this working elsewhere?** In New York City, the minimum wage\nwill increase to $15 by 2018. Seattle has already increased its minimum wage\nfrom $9.50 to $11 an hour, and businesses with 500 or more employees will need\nto further increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour by next year.  In San\nFrancisco, the minimum wage has been increased from $11.05% to $12.25 and will\nreach $15 an hour by 2018.  In some of these cities, it's too early to tell\nhow the wage increase will affect jobs and restaurant prices. But in Seattle,\nthere are reports of restaurants raising prices by more than 20%. Ivar's\nSalmon House in Seattle decided to start paying its employees $15 an hour\nahead of the required time frame and has already raised its prices by 21%. A\nreport by the American Action Forum, a group that identifies itself as a\n\"center-right\" policy institute, suggests growth in the rate of restaurant\nemployment in cities that raised their minimum wage last year is down when\ncompared to other cities in the same state.

In the Senate, the same goes for 49 of 81 members.Moreover,\nthe data do not include any possible repercussions for the newest bombshell in\nthe “Lava Jato,” or “Car Wash,” federal corruption probe. Brazil’s largest\nconstruction firm, Odebrecht, announced it would fully cooperate with\ninvestigation, and on March 23 the Brazilian Federal Police released a\nspreadsheet appearing to list payments from the company, whose CEO is\ncurrently jailed, to more than 200 politicians.It’s not yet clear what the\nlegal consequences of this will be, says Transparencia. The group continues to\nupdate its database.Rousseff herself, on the other hand, has never been\nformally investigated or accused of corruption, though she is enormously\nunpopular and blamed politically for the country’s deep recessions. She was\nhead of the board of directors at Petrobras, the state-run oil company, when\nit was involved in the kickback scheme investigators recently uncovered in the\nCar Wash probe.But to remove her from office, lawmakers are relying on the\naccusation that she broke budgetary rules to hide the size of the deficit, and\nthey assert this is an impeachable offense.The impeachment process was\nrecently accelerated by Eduardo Cunha, speaker of the lower house in Congress,\nthe Chamber of Deputies.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc65c"},"content":"Given that the Porter Ranch gas leak ranks as the worst such leak in U.S.\nhistory, with the potential to measurably damage the climate, and forcing\nthousands of families out of their homes, you'll be glad to know that Debra L.\nReed, chairman and CEO of the gas company's parent firm, Sempra Energy, has\nbeen docked part of her pay because of the episode.But you may be appalled to\nhear that her penalty comes to all of $130,000, and that she's still getting a\n$3.17-million bonus. That's the largest bonus she's received since becoming\nCEO of Sempra in 2011 and adding the title of chairman in 2012, according to\nthe company's proxy statement, dated last Friday. It brings her total\ncompensation for 2015 to $16.1 million, meaning that her executive penalty for\npresiding over an elemental corporate fiasco comes to about eight tenths of 1%\nof her pay. Others on Reed's management team also have been docked, according\nto the proxy. They are President Mark A. Snell, Executive V.P Steven D. Davis,\nCFO Joseph A. Householder and General Counsel Martha B. Wyrsch. Altogether,\nthey're being deprived of about $157,000, but they're still getting about $3.9\nmillion in bonuses, combined.If you're looking for evidence that American\ncorporate executives are a truly privileged class, look no further.\"This sends\nout a signal that as long as the dollars are there, the impact on people,\nhomes and the environment doesn't matter,\" Paula Cracium, president of the\nPorter Ranch Neighborhood Council, told me. \"That's not the signal we need to\nsend to executives who have so much power.\"She's not alone in coming to that\nconclusion. \"It’s an outrageous abdication of responsibility from the board\nand sends the worst possible message to the CEO, executives, investors and\nregulators about the company’s ability to minimize risk,\" Nell Minow, vice\nchair of ValueEdge Advisors, a corporate governance consulting firm, says of\nthe Sempra board's compensation decision.  The Porter Ranch gas leak is a\ndisaster of major proportions, any way you look at it. The nearly four-month\nleak -- it was discovered on Oct. 23 and not capped until Feb. 18 -- released\nroughly 100,000 tons of methane, effectively doubling the methane emissions\nrate of the entire Los Angeles Basin. Environmental expert Stephen Conley of\nUC Davis called it the biggest source of such pollution of the year and\n\"definitely a monster.\"Nor was it entirely a surprise to Southern California\nGas Co. As my colleague Paige St. John has reported, the utility knew that\nwells in its storage fields, including the Aliso Canyon facility near Porter\nRanch, were deteriorating and had been leaking more frequently since 2008. The\nwells posed a risk of \"uncontrolled\" failure, the utility told regulators in a\n2014 request for a rate hike to test and replace failing wells. The request\nhasn't been approved by the Public Utilities Commission, but the PUC's\nposition is that SoCal Gas should have been fixing the problem without waiting\nfor the rate hike.The disaster poses major risks to Sempra. Already, 83\nlawsuits have been filed against SoCal Gas, with many more possible. The\ncompany acknowledges that SoCal Gas \"also may incur significant liabilities\nfor fines, penalties, damages and greenhouse gas mitigation activities as a\nresult of this incident, some or a significant portion of which may not be\nrecoverable through insurance.\" The company also faces regulatory fines and\npenalties, and even a criminal complaint from the Los Angeles County district\nattorney. The health consequences for thousands of residents are unclear.\nLegally speaking, the leak is a black hole that could suck Reed's operational\nrecord into the void.The position of the Sempra board of directors, on the\nother hand, is that the Porter Ranch disaster is a \"safety [and] customer\nsatisfaction\" issue warranting minimal penalties for the executives who\npresided over it. The board's discussion of its compensation policies is a\npure distillation of the reality that corporate executives can collect huge\nraises despite underperformance in key areas.How does this happen? It's the\nresult of a daisy-chain culture among corporate executives who sit on each\nothers' boards and judge each others' performance in a near-vacuum. Among the\nfive members of the Sempra board's compensation committee are three ex-\ncorporate CEOs; Reed herself is a board member of Caterpillar Inc., where\nshe's a member of the compensation committee, and of Halliburton Co. (Does\nthis leave her enough time to run Sempra?)What plainly was most important to\nthe Sempra board was the company's bottom line: In 2015, the holding company's\nnet income reached $1.35 billion on revenue of $10.2 billion, a gain of 16% in\nprofit over 2014. But the stock declined about 16% on the year, more than some\nutility stock benchmarks, with a late-year slide beginning soon after the leak\nwas discovered.As far as the compensation committee was concerned, Reed met\nher goals for 2015 -- Sempra exceeded the company's 2015 earnings guidance,\ncompleted some solar projects and filed its rate applications for the next\nthree years with the PUC, and installed 4.5 million \"smart meters\" for SoCal\nGas customers. Yet the board's deliberations seemed to minimize the Porter\nRanch leak. That suggests that safety and customer satisfaction is not even\nsecondary as a consideration of Reed's performance -- these factors are not\neven mentioned among the CEO's seven goals for 2015. Yet the leak was the\ndefining event in the year's performance. One would think that operating\nsafely is Job One at a gas utility and a major debacle that lands in the\nrecord books would be a major black mark for corporate management.But that\ndoesn't seem to be the case.Sempra's defense is that Reed's compensation goals\nwere set in 2014, and the Porter Ranch leak wasn't discovered until more than\nnine months into the year. Company spokesman Doug Kline implies that more\naction could be taken on Reed's compensation once all the facts are in, but\n\"the ... investigation is still under way.\"That's certainly giving Reed and\nher management team the benefit of the doubt. Nothing stopped the compensation\ncommittee from putting Reed's bonus on hold until the investigation was\ncomplete, especially since there's evidence that knowledge of the problems\nwith SoCal Gas's storage infrastructure grew under her watch, as did the\nfailure to take prompt and decisive action. The Sempra board's attitude of\nwait-and-see is a dereliction of its duty to set proper standards for its CEO\nand chairman, and to hold her to it. If the directors don't understand that,\nwhy are they on the board?**Keep up to date with Michael Hiltzik.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc65d"},"content":"Gov. Jerry Brown on Monday sent the Legislature a proposal to boost the\nstate's minimum wage, defending the idea of $15 hourly pay as one that\nfurthers economic equality and one that he hopes other states will follow.“I'm\nhoping that what happens in California will not stay in California, but spread\nall across the country,” Brown said a news conference at the state Capitol,\nsurrounded by Democrats and labor union leaders. “It's a matter of economic\njustice. It makes sense.”The governor's plan, crafted through weeks of private\nnegotiations among a small group of lawmakers and labor officials, increases\nthe current $10 statewide minimum wage by 50 cents on Jan. 1 to $10.50 an\nhour. From there, it would rise to $11 in 2018 and subsequent dollar-a-year\nincreases ending at $15 on Jan. 1, 2022. Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de\nLeón (D-Los Angeles) said 5.6 million people, or one in three California\nworkers, would get a raise. The measure, which is expected to win approval in\nboth chambers of the Democratic-controlled Legislature, would not change any\nlocal laws providing for higher wages, such as those in the city of Los\nAngeles and L.A. County.The brokered deal, now on an expedited timetable for a\nvote before the end of the week, is expected to cancel two separate labor-\nsponsored efforts to place a wage increase initiative on the November ballot.\nThe phased series of increases in the minimum wage is on a slower timetable\nthan union leaders had proposed in their ballot measure efforts, but they said\nthe agreement represents real progress.Business leaders complained they were\nshut out of the negotiations and predicted that increasing the minimum wage\nwould force businesses to raise prices.“Everyone wants higher wages for folks,\nbut if you can only raise prices so much ... you're going to be forced to cut\nhours, cut employees, change your business model and frankly, automate,” said\nRuben Gonzalez, senior advisor for strategic affairs at the Los Angeles Area\nChamber of Commerce.The agreement, first reported by The Times on Saturday,\nwould reinforce California's position as having the highest minimum wage of\nany state. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour and was last increased\nin 2009. States can exceed the federal minimum but cannot go below it.“This\nagreement puts a better future in the grasp of average Californians,” said\nLaphonza Butler, president of the statewide council of the Service Employees\nInternational Union.For Brown, the deal represents an admission that one or\nboth of the ballot measures had a good chance of passing — even though they\noffered no respite in economic downturns. The governor signed the last\nstatewide increase in 2013, but had suggested any additional increases would\nbe a significant burden on the state as the employer of low-wage care workers\nfor the disabled.Brown had also previously rejected demands to “index” the\nminimum wage — linking future automatic increases to the rate of inflation.\nUnder this proposal, starting in 2024, the wage would go up to reflect\nincreases in the Consumer Price Index, but by no more than 3.5% in a given\nyear.Even so, Brown did insist on including ways to stop wage increases if the\neconomy falters. The agreement allows for a temporary pause in the first few\nyears of boosted salaries if California's unemployment rate rises or if a\ndeficit is projected in future state budgets.The plan raises the wage “in a\nway that takes into account the vagaries of the capitalistic economy,” Brown\nsaid. “This thing is the result of a lot of thinking.”Key to its passage may\nbe the backing of business-friendly Democrats in the Assembly who have spiked\nbig Brown-supported measures in the past, including a major effort last year\nto reduce the state's use of oil and gas as part of a broad climate change\nbill.Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon (D-Paramount) said that during a brief\nclosed-door meeting Monday afternoon, his colleagues questioned many aspects\nof the plan, including the cost-of-living increases and difficulties that\nnonprofits might have complying with the new rules, given their financial\nmodels.He said a few moderate Democrats already have committed their support,\nbut declined to name them. “There does seem to be significant support,” Rendon\nsaid.Assemblyman Jim Cooper (D-Elk Grove), a leader of the business-aligned\nDemocrats, was undecided on the proposal Monday. He said members were\nconcerned about any unintended consequences and its possible effect on\nnonprofits.Similarly, Assemblyman Ken Cooley (D-Rancho Cordova) said he needed\nto see the actual language of the bill before he could decide whether to\nsupport it. He said he had never previously backed a minimum wage deal that\nincluded automatic cost-of-living increases.“I'm just trying to understand\npersonally how the pieces fit together,” he said.Rendon, who supports the\ndeal, said the plan will have its first hearing in the Assembly Appropriations\nCommittee on Wednesday.News of the minimum wage agreement is already\nreverberating across the United States, with both Democratic presidential\ncandidates Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders hailing the deal\nMonday.“There are absolutely going to be national implications,” said Chris\nTilly, director of the UCLA Institute for Research on Labor and Employment. “I\nexpect other states to follow suit, and I expect pressure to build for a\nfederal minimum wage increase.”He said New York will probably be the next\nstate to jump in on $15 hourly minimum wage legislation, based on the state's\n“rivalry” with California for being “forward-thinking.” New York is\nconsidering a minimum wage increase proposal ahead of an April 1 budget\ndeadline.The governor told reporters that his weekslong talks with legislators\nand labor leaders were sparked by the “specter” of the initiatives that were\nheaded to the fall ballot.A coalition of business groups that formed a\ncampaign committee to oppose a statewide $15 minimum wage ballot initiative\nsaid the proposed deal was “overreaching.” The committee includes groups such\nas the California Restaurant Assn., the L.A. Area Chamber of Commerce, the\nCalifornia Hotel and Lodging Assn. and the California Retailers Assn.A deal\nthat would raise California's minimum wage to $15 an hour was met with a\nmixture of joy and anxiety across the state Sunday.Some workers and labor\nofficials hailed it as a breakthrough in providing higher-wage jobs in fields\nwhere it's a struggle to make ends meet. But some business owners feared...A\ndeal that would raise California's minimum wage to $15 an hour was met with a\nmixture of joy and anxiety across the state Sunday.Some workers and labor\nofficials hailed it as a breakthrough in providing higher-wage jobs in fields\nwhere it's a struggle to make ends meet. But some business owners\nfeared...“While voters may favor a reasonable minimum wage increase, $15 turns\nthose numbers on their head,” the California Consumers Against Higher Prices\ncoalition said in a statement.Gonzalez of the local chamber complained that\nbusiness was left out of the talks. “What it comes down to is we had some\nlate-night deal brokered, unknown, not necessarily all stakeholders in the\nroom,” he said.He added that because service industries have small margins, it\nwould be difficult for them to absorb the cost of a large minimum wage\nincrease.Tom Scott, state executive director of the National Federation of\nIndependent Business California, said there has been a frustrating “lack of\ninformation” about the deal, which broke over the Easter holiday weekend.The\nlegislative wage proposal makes one concession to small businesses, by\nallowing those with fewer than 26 workers an additional year to raise wages.\nThe $15-an-hour minimum wage wouldn't apply to those employers until Jan. 1,\n2023.As part of the deal, labor unions successfully won as many as three\nadditional paid sick days for their members who work as in-home care\nproviders. Although the agreement allows some possible delays in the rollout\nof those extra sick days, it represents a significant victory for the unions\nin their negotiations with Brown and legislative leaders.But the effect of the\nminimum wage raise will go much further. The Capitol news conference\nannouncing the deal included a fast-food minimum wage worker, Holly Dias of\nHumboldt County, who said the boost in her take-home pay would help her raise\nher 5-month-old son.“I just want to say thank you,” she said tearfully,\ngetting a hug from Brown as she walked away from the podium. _Samantha\nMasunaga contributed to this report._**Follow @johnmyers and @dillonliam on\nTwitter, sign up for our daily Essential Politics newsletter and listen to the\nweekly California Politics Podcast****ALSO****Your voices: What do you think\nabout the minimum wage proposal?****Will the wage hike pass the Legislature?\nThis and other key questions ...****Deal reached to raise minimum wage to\n$15****Lawmakers forced to choose: Raise California's minimum wage, or leave\nthe issue to voters****How pay for the lowest wage earners has turned into a\nnational fight****Cities want to raise the minimum wage.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc65e"},"content":"Warner Bros.' flag-planting franchise starter \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of\nJustice\" was either the most anticipated movie of the year or one of the most\ndreaded.The idea of seeing DC Comics' \"trinity\" of characters — Batman,\nSuperman and Wonder Woman — on the screen together is certainly a thing pop-\nculture dreams are made of. And audiences clearly want a piece of that dream:\n\"BvS\" grossed $170.1 million its first weekend in theaters, a record-breaking\nopening for a March film and the sixth-largest domestic opening ever.Critics,\nhowever, have teed off on the film: An increasingly rare few, like The Times'\nKenneth Turan, were positive on director Zack Snyder's film, but others were\nfar less so. (Rotten Tomatoes, which aggregates critical response, has it at\n29% — in comparison, Marvel's \"The Avengers\" from 2012 holds a 92% rating.)\nThe dominant theme from the negative responses is that Snyder's take on the DC\nComics Extended Universe, introduced in his \"Man of Steel\" in 2013, is\nunrelentingly dark, pummeling, brutal.It raises the question: How much\ndarkness do audiences want? And has Warner Bros. painted itself into a tonal\ncorner, where everything feels like the inside of a goth kid's journal?Of\ncourse, visiting Gotham City is supposed to be a bleak affair. It is, as well\nestablished by DC Comics, the embodiment of urban blight, a city where the sun\nnever shines, no matter what time it is. It's the kind of city that would give\nbirth to a hero like Batman — dark, twisted, born of murder and mayhem,\npossibly insane. It is also inherently cinematic, which helps explain why\nChristopher Nolan — a filmmaker steeped in noir sensibilities — was drawn to\nit. Nolan's hyper-real Batman trilogy — \"Batman Begins,\" \"The Dark Knight\" and\n\"The Dark Knight Rises \" — is the most successful collection of comic book\nmovies Warner Bros. has ever made, grossing $2.6 billion worldwide.When Warner\nBros. decided to relaunch Superman — the universally acknowledged first\nsuperhero, the big blue schoolboy who stands for truth, justice and the\nAmerican Way — it turned to Nolan, as he clearly had the Midas touch.\nUnderstandably tired of putting heroes through their paces, Nolan agreed to\nexecutive produce the movie that would become 2013's \"Man of Steel\" and help\nguide the filmmaker who would ultimately end up directing it: Snyder, who\nbroke through with 2004's \"Dawn of the Dead,\" broke big with 2006's \"300,\"\nand, some would say, fell flat with 2009's \"Watchmen\" and 2011's \"Sucker\nPunch.\" But Warner Bros. likes Snyder, and with Nolan as a tonal godfather,\nthe studio let him loose on Metropolis.Unlike Gotham, though, Metropolis is\nsupposed to be a gleaming city of glass and steel and hope, and its hero — an\nimmigrant from another world, raised in the bosom of America by the salt of\nthe Kansas earth and in Metropolis to work for its greatest newspaper — is a\nsymbol for the potential of humanity. Superman is supposed to be the best of\nus, because he believes in the best in us.But to give us a Superman that might\nactually exist in our world, much like the Batman that had to wrestle with\nthings like gravity, slipped discs and hostile takeovers, Snyder and Nolan\ngave us a Man of Steel who seemed to be OK with being party to the destruction\nof both Smallville and Metropolis.Henry Cavill's Clark Kent was raised by\nparents who taught him to hide his gifts, even if lives were at stake, rather\nthan expose himself to the world. Snyder gave us a Superman that would kill.\n(He also, in \"Batman v Superman,\" offers us a Dark Knight who has no problem\nwith branding some of his victims with a hot iron and riddling others with\nbullets, a thing the comic book version of Batman would never do.)Watch the\ntrailer for \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice.\"Watch the trailer for \"Batman\nv Superman: Dawn of Justice.\"After Marvel conquered the world with its\ncinematic universe — which began with 2008's \"Iron Man\" and a dozen movies\nlater, has grossed $9 billion worldwide — DC and Warner Bros. decided they\nneeded their own Avengers-like franchise and wanted Snyder, whose \"Man of\nSteel\" grossed $668 million worldwide, to make it for them. Hence \"Batman v\nSuperman: Dawn of Justice,\" the \"justice\" being a not-at-all subtle nod to\nDC's Justice League, the superhero team that consists of Superman, Batman,\nWonder Woman, the Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg.Judging by the tone of \"Batman v\nSuperman,\" each of these films will likely have the same apocalyptic, almost\nfunereal feel.In contrast, the tone of Marvel movies is \"fun,\" which is what\nallows it to make World War II romps (\"Captain America: The First Avenger\"),\nheist comedies (\"Ant-Man\"), conspiracy thrillers (\"Captain America: The Winter\nSoldier\"), space operas (\"Guardians of the Galaxy\") and episodes of \"The\nRockford Files\" with more explosions (\"Iron Man 3\"). Marvel has built a\nframework in which anything can happen and audiences won't blink.Warner Bros.'\nframework posits that only real things can happen. Its tone is \"gravitas,\"\nwhich means that no hero can crack a joke; the only smiles to be seen take\nplace either before or after punching someone or something in the face. The\nrare shaft of sunlight is spotted during a daytime funeral.While \"Batman v\nSuperman\" the film is currently battling it out at the box office, the real\nquestion of who would win in this prizefight of superhero heavyweights is also\nbeing debated by comic book fanatics, cosplay enthusiasts, and the pop culture\nelite at the 2016 WonderCon. We headed over...While \"Batman v Superman\" the\nfilm is currently battling it out at the box office, the real question of who\nwould win in this prizefight of superhero heavyweights is also being debated\nby comic book fanatics, cosplay enthusiasts, and the pop culture elite at the\n2016 WonderCon. We headed over...That's also something of a stark contrast\nfrom DC's own television universe, where \"The Flash\" — which mixes its angst\nwith levity, its heartbreak with heartfelt — is the CW's highest-rated show.\nAnd CBS' \"Supergirl\" is treating Superman's cousin the way the new movies seem\ndisinclined to.During the press siege for \"Batman v Superman,\" Snyder was\nasked why TV's Flash, Grant Gustin, wasn't right for the superhero universe\nhe's building (Snyder will soon start shooting the two-part \"Justice League\"),\nand the filmmaker talked about how he didn't think the Flash was a good fit,\nthat the tone was \"not our world.\"\"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\" is a\nhit, no two ways about it. And to be fair, Warner Bros. was committed to its\nambitious movie plan (\"Batman v Superman,\" August's \"Suicide Squad,\" 2017's\n\"Wonder Woman\" and \"The Justice League Part One,\" 2018's \"The Flash\" and\n\"Aquaman,\" 2019's \"Shazam!\" and \"Justice League Part Two,\" and 2020's \"Cyborg\"\nand \"Green Lantern\") before \"BvS\" even hit theaters. We are in a superhero-\nmovie arms race, and Warner Bros. needs to field its army.But if your army is\nall infantry, or all snipers, or all tanks, you'll lose the war. And Warner\nBros. seems to be betting victory on a roll of the dice where every side has\nthe same number on it.**MORE:****'Batman v Superman' breaks a box-office\nrecord for best pre-summer debut****Here come virtual-reality headsets — are\nthey game changers?****Anti-gay bill pits Georgia's conservative values\nagainst Hollywood's inclusivity — much like the nation's political\ndivide****What Wonder Woman experts had to say about 'Batman v Superman's'\nDiana Prince****DC bets big on Rebirth: A re-centering of characters, and the\nJoker's real name**\n\n","title":"Analysis: In the superhero movie arms race, has Warner Bros. created too bleak a world in 'Batman v Superman'? - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Has Warner Bros. created too bleak a world for a sequel in \"Batman v Superman\" https://t.co/rX4Tm5TWWQ ? https://t.co/SQFILXYqSw","date":"Mon Mar 28 23:25:05 +0000 2016","favs":57,"id":{"$numberLong":"714594187652546560"},"retweets":38},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/21OYGwQ"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc660"},"content":"About 80% of the artifacts in Palmyra appear to be largely intact after the\nancient city's recapture from Islamic State militants, a jubilant Syrian\nofficial said Monday, and he estimated that restoration work could be done in\nfive years.The optimistic assessment came one day after the extremist group\nwas driven from the city and Syrian officials were able to get their first\nlook at the damage.“I had tears in my eyes. ... I expected destruction and all\nthe columns to be on the ground, but thank God the damage is the same as it\nwas last summer,” said Dr. Maamoun Abdelkarim, the Syrian government’s\nantiquities director, in a phone interview from the Syrian capital of\nDamascus.“The straight street, the baths, the fences of the two temples. ...\nThere is damage, yes, but the panoramic view that tourists know of Palmyra\nremains,” continued Abdelkarim, referring to Palmyra’s spectacular colonnaded\nstreets and other ruins that earned it the moniker the Bride of the\nDesert.Islamic State militants, who had taken Palmyra in a blitz assault last\nMay, were routed after a grueling, weeks-long offensive that saw Syrian\ngovernment troops backed by Russian warplanes and special forces units pound\ntheir way into the city, encircling the extremists before forcing them to\nwithdraw to the eastern desert region of the country.During its occupation of\nthe city, Islamic State destroyed some of Palmyra’s most distinctive\nmonuments, including the famous Arch of Triumph, the temple of Baalshamin and\nthe temple of Bal, bragging about the vandalism in photo collections uploaded\nto social media.The group continued its war against the city’s heritage by\nbeheading and crucifying Khaled Asaad, an octogenarian and retired director of\nPalmyra’s museum.It also did a brisk trade in antiquities small enough to be\nsmuggled into neighboring countries and even selling permissions for illegal\nexcavation work to the area’s residents.Palmyra is an ancient oasis that was\nan important stop for caravans carrying goods between China, India, Persia and\nthe Roman Empire. The wanton destruction of some of its most spectacular\nmonuments, most of them dating to the 1st and 2nd centuries, horrified\nhistorians and archaeologists around the world.This photo released on Sunday\nby the Syrian official news agency SANA shows damaged statues at the Palmyra\nMuseum in Palmyra, Syria.This photo released on Sunday by the Syrian official\nnews agency SANA shows damaged statues at the Palmyra Museum in Palmyra,\nSyria.Yet fears about the destruction of other monuments proved unfounded.For\ninstance, Abdelkarim said, a 15-ton statue dating to the 1st century and known\nas the Lion of Al-Lat, thought to have been the first major monument\nobliterated by the Islamic State, could be restored.“It is still in the garden\nof the museum, but they [the militants] pushed it on its back. The damage to\nthis masterpiece was not as disastrous as we thought,” explained Abdelkarim, a\nnoticeable tone of happiness in his voice.Abdelkarim added that his colleagues\nfrom the Museums and Antiquities Directorate who had spent Sunday assessing\nthe site would soon be returning to Damascus and another team sent to examine\nPalmyra’s museum, where the extremists perpetrated some of the worst\ndamage.Images inside the museum published by Russian media outlets showed\ndisplay shelves bereft of the busts and smaller items they once displayed.\nBigger busts and reliefs had their faces crudely chiseled out, with their\nbodies and the associated columns strewn on the floor.But even here there was\ncause for celebration.“At least these items weren’t pulverized, and only their\nfaces were destroyed – which we can also restore,” Abdelkarim said.“It's as if\nsomeone has a burned face: We did not lose the man, but we lost the beauty of\nthe face. It will not return to what it used to be, but we did not lose the\nperson.”Islamic State considers statues depicting faces as pagan icons that\nviolate its strict interpretation of Islamic law.Asked why Islamic State had\nnot razed the city, Abdelkarim surmised that it was in deference to local\nresidents. “I think they understood that if they continued destroying temples\nor the theater, there would be an uprising against them,” he said.A general\nview taken on Sunday shows part of the ancient city of Palmyra with the\ncitadel in the background.A general view taken on Sunday shows part of the\nancient city of Palmyra with the citadel in the background.A fuller evaluation\nof the site was not possible while de-mining operations continued in the area\nto remove explosive devices left behind by the militants.Bomb-disposal crews\nwould be assisted by Russian engineers and robots, according to the head of\nthe Russian general staff, Valery Gerasimov. He said the capture of the city\nhad “strategic importance in the fight against terrorism in Syria,” according\nto the Russian English-language broadcaster Russia Today.Once the antiquities\nassessment is complete, the results will be sent to UNESCO, which, Abdelkarim\nsaid, has already thrown its full support behind the restoration efforts.\nPalmyra is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Acccording to the U.N. agency, Russia\nwill send experts from the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg to assist with\nrepair work.Abdelkarim described the work as including cleaning, restoration\nof the 13th century Palmyra castle and reconstruction of the city’s two\nancient temples. “We will hopefully need five years, no more,” he said.But\nsome experts cast doubt that the site could be fixed in such a short time.“The\nbiggest challenge is documentation. The Syrians’ ability to restore these\nartifacts depends on the documentation they had beforehand, before it was\ndestroyed,” Tammam Khasawneh, a museum environment specialist at the Jordan\nMuseum in Amman, said in an interview.“The temple of Bel; we’re lucky because\nit’s well known. But there might be a smaller temple that is not so well\nstudied. We wouldn't know what the decorations were because it was not well\ndocumented. Then it’s extremely difficult to bring things back to how they\nwere,” he said.Khasawneh added that the fighting could have damaged the site,\neven if the Syrian army avoided firing directly at the artifacts.“Vibrations\nfrom bombs and shells can be felt miles away,” he said. Smoke from ordnance\ncould create an acid residue that could eat away the stone ruins, he added.\n“We’re talking about something that is 2,500 to 3,000 years old. ... Imagine\nhow fragile these things are.”Complicating any restoration effort will be the\ncontinuing battle for control of the country. International organizations may\nnot be able to send experts to help, he said.Khasawneh estimated that the\nrestoration process could take 25 to 30 years and would never fully restore\nall that was lost.“The sad and painful confession is that we won’t be able to\nbring things back to what they were. If we can do 15-20%, then that is\nsomething,” he said._Bulos is a special correspondent._\n\n","title":"Most of Palmyra's ancient treasures appear to have survived Islamic State vandalism - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Most of Palmyra's ancient treasures appear to have survived Islamic State vandalism https://t.co/j4W4mbkgGk https://t.co/TCxAH9TZ2Y","date":"Mon Mar 28 22:55:06 +0000 2016","favs":89,"id":{"$numberLong":"714586642150002688"},"retweets":121},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/22IA3rG"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc661"},"content":"When it comes to impressing potential dates, a little change in posture might\nmake the difference between a swipe right and a swipe left. A new study led by\na UC Berkeley researcher finds that, when all you’ve got is a moment, people\nwho use more expansive, dominant gestures are the ones most likely to earn a\nsecond look.The findings, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy\nof Sciences, show that for the postures of both men and women, bigger is often\nbetter – and offer some insight into why those gestures are so attractive.In\nall stages of romance, body language does a lot of the talking. Positive\nfacial expressions like smiling and laughing do double duty – they signal that\nsomeone is feeling close to another person and they also make that other\nperson feel closer in return. Previous research has shown that between\ncommitted partners, gestures like nodding, smiling and leaning forward are\nlinked to those partners’ self-reported feelings of love.But in the fast-paced\nworld of speed-dating and dating apps like Tinder, first impressions are\nextremely brief, over with the swipe of a thumb. Still, humans are apparently\nquite good at making judgments on a potential mate in a fraction of a\nsecond.“Physical features, such as pupil size, gaze directionality, eye color,\nfacial symmetry, and nonverbal displays, are encoded by human minds in as\nlittle as 39 ms,” the researchers pointed out. “Some of these cues (i.e., a\ndirect vs. an averted gaze) influence decisions to pursue or pass over a\npotential romantic partner when rapidly observing photographs of models in a\ncomputer task.”They say to kill a rattlesnake, just shoot in its general\ndirection and it'll intercept the bullet, inadvertently killing itself.The\nlunging movements of rattlesnakes and other vipers have been described as\n\"lightning fast\" and the \"fastest strike on the planet.\" The G forces they\nemploy to capture...They say to kill a rattlesnake, just shoot in its general\ndirection and it'll intercept the bullet, inadvertently killing itself.The\nlunging movements of rattlesnakes and other vipers have been described as\n\"lightning fast\" and the \"fastest strike on the planet.\" The G forces they\nemploy to capture...To find out whether such gestures made a difference in a\nperson’s attractiveness in fleeting encounters in real life, a team of\nresearchers led out of UC Berkeley studied 144 four-minute dates that were\nrecorded at a speed-dating event on the Northwestern University campus in\n2007.Trained raters watched video of each person (without sound, unless they\nwere rating laughs) and ranked how expansive or closed their behaviors were.\nAn expansive posture might involve a stretched torso, open arms and a\nspreading out of the body to take up more space. They also looked at\n\"affiliation clues\" – how much they smiled, laughed and nodded. Then the\nscientists compared those ratings to the responses from each person’s date.\nWould the date want to see that person again?Ask Alan Stern to name the most\nsurprising thing learned from NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, and he'll\ntell you to rephrase the question.“A better question would be, ‘What isn't\npuzzling or mysterious?’ Because that's a much shorter list,” said Stern, the\nplanetary scientist in charge of...Ask Alan Stern to name the most surprising\nthing learned from NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, and he'll tell you to\nrephrase the question.“A better question would be, ‘What isn't puzzling or\nmysterious?’ Because that's a much shorter list,” said Stern, the planetary\nscientist in charge of...The researchers found that the more expansive the\nposture, the more likely the date was to want to go out with him or her. The\npattern was true for both men and women, and it held up when the researchers\ntested a popular GPS-based dating app to see how users responded as they\nflipped through photos. Photos of people in more expansive postures – leaning\nback, spreading out, opening the arms – earned more interest than those in\ncontracted postures, with the arms pulled in, taking up little space.  That’s\nlikely to be because expansive postures can signal both dominance and\nopenness. Dominance usually comes with access to more resources – an\nattractive quality in a mate – and openness signals a higher likelihood of\ngetting said mate.“In a dating world in which success sometimes is determined\nby a split-second decision rendered after a brief interaction or exposure to a\nstatic photograph, single persons have very little time to make a good\nimpression,” the authors wrote. “Our research suggests that a nonverbal\ndominance display increases a person’s chances of being selected as a\npotential mate.”That’s true not just in humans, but across the animal kingdom,\nthe study authors note:“These expansive, inviting (i.e., open) displays are a\nwell-documented characteristic of many mating displays in which a rump or\nother genitalia are openly exposed,” the authors wrote. “Other examples\ninclude peacocks, which attract peahens by expansively fanning their tail\nfeathers, and male gorillas, which occupy more space to flaunt their\nphysicality by kicking and running in a sideways manner. Aside from commanding\nattention, such expansive displays — similar to those in humans — signal\ndominance and power within the hierarchically organized animal\nkingdom.”**Follow @aminawrite on Twitter for more science news and \"like\" Los\nAngeles Times Science \u0026amp; Health on Facebook.**\n\n","title":"To maximize speed-dating success, uncross those arms and take up space - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"A change in posture might make the difference between a swipe right and a swipe left. https://t.co/qq48TCCfPR https://t.co/MmnN9F08x2","date":"Mon Mar 28 22:40:08 +0000 2016","favs":19,"id":{"$numberLong":"714582875715280896"},"retweets":12},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1ZHb5Un"}

After an argument, Dawson drew a\nweapon and pointed it at officers, said the official, who was not authorized\nto speak publicly on the matter.At least one officer opened fire, shooting the\nsuspect, said Capitol Police Chief Matthew Verderosa. A weapon was recovered\nat the scene, he added.Dawson was taken to a hospital for treatment.  A female\nbystander, age 35 to 45, was hospitalized with what Verderosa called minor\ninjuries from the incident.Dawson's motives remain unclear. Verderosa did not\nidentify Dawson by name during a news briefing outside the Capitol, but said\nthe suspect was known to Capitol Police.“We believe this is an act of a single\nperson who has frequented the Capitol grounds before,” Verderosa said. “There\nis no reason to believe this is anything more than a criminal act.”Tourists\nare directed away from the U.S. Capitol.Tourists are directed away from the\nU.S. Capitol.Dawson’s identity was confirmed by a federal law enforcement\nofficial who was not authorized to speak about the investigation.In October,\nDawson reportedly shouted from a House balcony that he was a “prophet of\nGod.”After the October incident, Dawson was charged in D.C. Superior Court\nwith unlawful conduct on Capitol grounds and assault on a police officer,\naccording to court records. He pleaded not guilty and was released on the\ncondition that he stay away from the Capitol grounds. Dawson failed to appear\nin court on Nov. 19, records show, and a bench warrant was issued for his\narrest.Verderosa said the building’s security precautions prevented the\nsuspect from entering.“It appears the screening process worked the way it’s\nsupposed to,” he said. Police also located and seized the suspect’s car on the\nCapitol grounds, he said.The 2:40 p.m. EDT shooting briefly shut down the\nCapitol as police told panicked visitors and staff to take immediate shelter\nand close, lock and stay away from doors.“Due to police activity, Capitol\nPolice have issued a shelter in place for the Capitol complex. Please stay in\nyour designated area,” the Senate sergeant at arms said in a tweet during the\nshutdown.By 3:40 p.m. EDT, the Capitol reopened. It will reopen for visitors\non Tuesday.Though House and Senate lawmakers are away on recess, the Capitol\nremains a popular draw for tourists and school groups visiting in spring at\nthe peak of cherry blossom season.Joe and Leslie Stephenson, who are visiting\nfrom the San Diego area with their two small children, were at the National\nAir and Space Museum when they suddenly saw people fleeing the Capitol\ncomplex.\"They were out of breath and really shaken up,\" said Leslie\nStephenson, a nurse.\"These kinds of things happen,'' said Joe Stephenson,\nadding that the family still hoped to tour the Capitol during their trip. \"I\ndon't want to live in fear.\"The visitor center is a vast underground complex\nbeneath the Capitol where visitors line up for tours. The multi-level space\nincludes a cafeteria, gift shops and official meeting rooms for lawmakers.\nMany news conferences are held there.Those visiting the Capitol must go\nthrough metal-detector screening as they enter the visitor center, but lines\noften form outside the complex.The visitor center was built in part as a\nresponse to the 1998 shooting deaths of two Capitol Police officers by a man\nwith mental problems. Previously, tourists entered through the same doors used\nby lawmakers and staff.In a separate incident about the same time Monday, the\nSecret Service temporarily closed the north and south fence lines of the White\nHouse after observing a ticketed member of the public attending the annual\nEaster Egg Roll attempting to move a temporary security barrier, a spokesman\nsaid.

Initially, those staffers\ncanvassed the neighborhood for support. Perry said he hasn't asked Combs to\ndonate his money to the school, and the musician's day-to-day involvement is\nstill to be determined.Teachers are called illuminators because they're more\nthan just instructors, said Capital Prep Harlem Principal Danita Jones.“What I\ndid as a teacher was not what illuminators do,\" Jones said. “Illuminators\nliterally ... coparent.”That level of involvement includes calling parents\nevery two weeks, setting aside time each day to check in on students' social-\nemotional needs, helping them identify and solve community problems, and\ngetting them to a four-year college.Students are expected not only to complete\ncollege, but to understand the importance of helping their communities. One\nstudent in Hartford created a program that provides students with a backpack\nfilled with food for the weekend if they didn't have enough at home, Jones\nsaid.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc665"},"content":"Federal appeals court Judge Alex Kozinski, an outspoken critic of prosecutors\nwho commit misconduct, took on a California criminal defense lawyer Monday for\nbeing “a hazard to clients”  and “a menace to the profession and to the\ncourts.”A three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found\nthat Bakersfield lawyer Gregory H. Mitts was grossly negligent in his\nrepresentation of Rowan Brooks, an inmate challenging his murder\nconviction.The court said Mitts filed Brooks' appeal late and then failed to\nrespond to a court order asking for an explanation. Mitts also failed to\ninform his client of the order, despite persistent inquiries from Brooks, the\ncourt said.“Mitts’ behavior was not mere negligence, but rather virtual\nabandonment -- ‘neglect so gross that it is inexcusable,’” the panel said.The\n9th Circuit ordered the district court to reconsider the case.In a\nconcurrence, Kozinski, a Reagan appointee, made a veiled appeal to the\nCalifornia bar to discipline the defense lawyer.“Mitts’ actions consumed\ncountless hours of this court’s and the district court’s time in dealing with\nhis obstinate incompetence,” Kozinski wrote.“If Mitts was so lackadaisical in\nBrooks’s case, we can only imagine what problems he’s caused, or is likely to\ncause, other clients,” the judge continued. “Potential clients, who will put\ntheir lives in Mitts’ hands, as Brooks did, are entitled to know that this\nlawyer ignores client inquiries, misses jurisdictional deadlines and does not\nown up to his mistakes.”Kozinski said he was unaware of any disciplinary\naction pending against Mitts.“The State Bar of California may not yet be aware\nof Mitts’ behavior,” Kozinski wrote. “Perhaps now it will be.”Kozinski has\nlong called for courts to publish the names of errant prosecutors and defense\nattorneys so lawyer disciplinary organizations will be alerted.Mitts could not\nbe reached for comment.On his website, Mitts said he had been practicing in\nKern County since 1977 and asserted that he had received certificates from the\nBakersfield Californian for being “Best Attorney” in 2005 and “Favorite\nAttorney” in 2006.“When you are in trouble with law enforcement, you want an\nattorney that you can rely upon and who you feel really cares about you and\nyour case,” Mitts wrote on his site. \"I am that kind of attorney.”State bar\nrecords show Mitts has never been publicly disciplined but was suspended in\n2001 for failing to pay his bar dues and to take required continuing legal\neducation courses.Brooks was convicted of killing his wife, Stella Fern Fox,\nin 2004. At the time, Brooks was having an affair with another woman, whom he\nmarried after Fox’s death.**Twitter:  @mauradolan****ALSO****California's $15\nminimum wage gamble brings risks and potential rewards****Doubts about bullet\ntrain rising in Southern California****Report recommends that Cal State\nfaculty receive 5% pay increase**\n\n","title":"9th Circuit rips criminal defense attorney - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Federal judge rips criminal defense attorney as \"hazard\" and \"menace to the profession and to the courts.\" https://t.co/UPW0TCL2nt","date":"Mon Mar 28 21:50:10 +0000 2016","favs":16,"id":{"$numberLong":"714570302827659269"},"retweets":27},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1qc2VqG"}

Rising prices.That's the landscape for much\nof the Southern California housing market as the spring selling season gets\nunderway. Competition is as fierce, or even greater, than last year in many\ncorners of the Southland, and would-be buyers can expect a pitched battle if\nthey want to close a deal, real estate agents say.The frenzied start has been\ndriven by a dearth of homes for sale, low mortgage rates and steady job\ngrowth. Homes are selling faster than a year earlier, with more of them going\nfor above the list price, data from online brokerage Redfin show.\"Be ready to\nwrite the offer on the Realtor's car,\" mortgage broker Jeff Lazerson\nsaid.Another sign of the market's strength came this month when data provider\nCoreLogic reported that sales in February jumped 9% from a year earlier. The\nmedian price, meanwhile, climbed 3.7% — the 47th straight month it's\nrisen.Lazerson said his clients in Los Angeles and Orange counties are putting\nan average of five offers on a house before they're successful. And he's\nseeing more demand from first-time home buyers, as well as those who want to\nupgrade to a bigger home.\"The market seems to be healthy again on all levels,\"\nhe said.Real estate agent Heather Presha has seen the craziness firsthand.With\nfew homes for sale in the Leimert Park neighborhood where she works, buyers\nare flooding open houses that pop up. Many are coming from the Westside, no\nlonger able to afford a home near the ocean as prices have steadily risen\nacross the region.The added demand is pushing values higher in the South L.A.\nneighborhood filled with old Spanish-style homes.Pat Douglas, another agent in\nLeimert Park, put it this way: \"Anything good that is on the market is going\nquick with multiple offers.\"In Los Angeles County, there was a 4.9-month\nsupply of homes for sale in February compared with a 5.2-month supply a year\nearlier — meaning no homes would be on the market after that time period if\nsales continued at their current pace and no new listings emerged, according\nto the California Assn. of Realtors. Orange County saw a similar trend.The\nRealtors consider a six- to seven-month supply a market that favors neither\nbuyers nor sellers.\"The inventory issue is why price growth is strong,\" said\nRedfin chief economist Nela Richardson.Recently there's been a healthy jump in\nlistings, Richardson said, but it's unclear if the trend will hold.If it does,\nhouse hunters such as Abigail Lee and her husband, Ray, would be overjoyed.The\ncouple are looking for a home under $2 million, but they've found little\nsuitable near a good public school. They've put in only two offers in the\nroughly six months they've been looking — and were unsuccessful both\ntimes.**SIGN UP for the free California Inc. business newsletter\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**This month, Lee, 32, went to a packed open house for a four-bedroom\nhouse in north Redondo Beach. It was so busy that the real estate agent ran\nout of fliers. She put in an offer for more than the $1-million asking price\nbut lost. Instead, the home went into escrow to another buyer, less than a\nweek after it was listed for sale.In such a hot market, would-be sellers are\nconflicted about whether to cash in now or wait for prices to rise further.\nSome have begun to question how long the hot market can last.\"They think we\nare due for a correction,\" said Nikki Hochstein, an agent who specializes in\nthe Westside and is helping the Lees find a home.Home values are expected to\nclimb this year, given low mortgage rates and job growth. But for many people,\nwages aren't rising fast enough, so economists predict prices will increase\nless than in previous years as families increasingly struggle to afford a\nhome.February's data were in line with those expectations, even though signs\nhad emerged in recent months that price gains were once again accelerating.\nThe 3.7% increase was the smallest since last spring.On a recent Sunday, about\n150 people flocked to a three-bedroom condo in West L.A. for an open house,\nagent Tregg Rustad said.Among the interested buyers were Sameena Shaikh, a\nmedical researcher, and her husband, Muddassar, who works as a software\nengineer in Santa Monica.The couple have been searching for a home for about a\nyear but haven't pulled the trigger. In that time, they've seen prices rise\nand now fear mortgage rates will jump. As they surveyed the packed open house\nthey vowed to be less picky.\"We don't want to make the same mistake,\" Sameena\nsaid.Muddassar explained their new tactic: \"Let's just buy something.\"Not\neverywhere in Southern California is red hot, however.Pegi DiRienzo, a Teles\nProperties agent, said the market has slowed in the corner of Irvine in which\nshe specializes.There are fewer buyers from China than last year, given\ntroubles in that country's economy, DiRienzo said. A flood of new homes have\nalso come on the market near the city's Great Park. And buyers are\nincreasingly flocking to those, rather than older houses in the Turtle Rock\nneighborhood near UC Irvine.\"It's going to take a little longer this year to\nsell properties,\" DiRienzo said.The ultra-luxury market — $10 million and\nabove — has also floundered as international buyers pull back while the\neconomies in their home countries weaken and the U.S. dollar strengthens, said\nNick Segal, chief executive of the Partners Trust brokerage in Beverly\nHills.\"A fair number of these purchases 12 months ago were aspirational luxury\npurchases: 'I now own a home in Los Angeles and it's my fourth residence,'\" he\nsaid. \"Those buyers have dried up.\"But those are exceptions.\"The demand is\ngood,\" said Carey Chenoski, an agent who specializes in the Redlands area.\n\"Things are moving quickly.\"andrew.khouri@latimes.com**Twitter:\n@khouriandrew****ALSO****China's Anbang ups its bid for Starwood Hotels; offer\ntops $15 billion****Years after the Great Recession, Chicago-area homeowners\nare still trying to recover****Board has no right to bill owner for costs of\nfighting lawsuit filed against it by a tenant**\n\n","title":"Southern California home buyers face fierce competition and tight inventory this spring - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Looking to buy in SoCal?

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc66a"},"content":"California is poised to launch a great experiment in practical economics by\nraising the statewide minimum wage to $15 an hour through 2022. The proposal,\nhammered out over the weekend by Gov. Jerry Brown and labor organizations,\nwould raise the rate from $10 an hour to $10.50 on Jan. 1, 2017, with a\n50-cent increase in 2018, further $1-per-year increases through 2022, and\ninflation-indexed increases after that. Businesses with fewer than 26\nemployees would have until 2023 to hit $15.The deal still must be approved by\nthe Legislature, and the battle there may be bruising, with stiff opposition\ncoming from business ownership groups; indeed, the unions' desire to avoid a\ncostly battle over a proposed ballot measure raising the minimum wage\nmotivated the negotiations.Two factors make California's plan such a\npioneering step: the size of the increase and the size of the state. About\n600,000 of California's 1.6 million manufacturing workers earn less than $15\nan hour today, estimates Adam Ozimek of Moody's Analytics. That's by far the\nlargest block of affected manufacturing workers, and it's potentially a key\nmetric because it points to how the size of California's proposed increase\nreaches out to different employment sectors than a smaller increase\nwould.\"Lifting the minimum wage to $15 an hour would not just be\nquantitatively larger than previous U.S. experience, but qualitatively\ndifferent,\" Ozimek observed in September. Leisure and hospitality workers --\nthose most commonly thought to occupy the lowest rung of income -- \"make up\n54% of the workers who make less than $8 an hour, but only 34% of those making\nless than $15 an hour.\" Critics of the plan are sure to use these figures as\nan indication of which jobs are most threatened by the $15 minimum.First out\nof the box with an opposition manifesto Monday was the California chapter of\nthe National Federation of Independent Business, which styles itself \"the\nvoice of small business\" but actually is associated with big restaurant\nfranchisers and organizations connected with the Koch brothers. The group has\nbeen in the forefront of opposition to paid family leave and the Affordable\nCare Act; its lawsuit to overturn Obamacare led to the landmark 2012 Supreme\nCourt ruling upholding the law. The NFIB called the California deal \"reckless\"\nand observed, that \"small businesses in California are still struggling to\ncope with the 25% minimum wage hike over just the past two years.\" This is a\nhuge exaggeration: California's minimum wage increased to $10 this year after\nbeing raised to $9 on July 1, 2014, and to $8 on Jan. 1, 2008; the proper math\nwould place the increase at 25% over _eight_ years, or 11.1% over the last\nyear and a half. That still leaves the question of whether the increase to $15\nis warranted. Let's break it down. The most important rationale for increasing\nthe minimum wage is that it has fallen in value since reaching a peak, in\ninflation-adjusted terms, in 1968. The federal minimum wage of $1.60 that year\nwould be worth $10.90 now, far more than today's federal minimum of $7.25.\nThat provides some context to proposals from the Obama White House and\ncongressional Democrats to raise the federal minimum to anywhere from $10.10\nto $12 an hour through the end of this decade. (The federal minimum wage\ngoverns only in the 21 states that haven't set higher minimums by state law.)\nInflation obviously will continue to eat away at the minimum wage; if the low-\ninflation levels of the last six years continue through the next six,\nCalifornia's proposed $15 minimum in 2022 would be worth only about $13.79 in\ntoday's buying power.****See the most-read stories this hour \u0026gt;\u0026gt;****Those\nproposals also would leave the federal minimum wage well below the level it\nwould have reached if it tracked increases in U.S. productivity or real\naverage wages for rank-and-file workers, according to the Economic Policy\nInstitute, which is associated with labor organizations and other progressive\ngroups. That's important -- productivity gains drive economic growth and the\noverall standard of living; the disconnection between average hourly\ncompensation and productivity, which began in the early 1970s, is widely\nconsidered to be an underlying cause of increasing economic inequality in the\nU.S. While income generally has flowed away from labor and toward shareholders\nduring this period, minimum wage workers fall further behind. That brings us\nto the question of who constitutes the minimum-wage-earning class. Here's\nwhere myth and reality about the minimum wage come into stark contrast. The\npopular image of the minimum wage employee is a teenager flipping burgers or\ntending a fast-food counter as stop-gap employment to bigger and better\nthings, whether college or a career path. Increasingly, that's not so. The\nminimum-wage culture has risen in age, widened in terms of educational\nattainment, and spread to occupations well beyond fast food. Minimum wage\nworkers today comprise hotel housekeepers and home healthcare workersOnly\nabout 12.5% are those proverbial teenagers; in fact, more than a third are\naged 30-54, which are family-raising years, signifying that a substantial\nnumber are engaged in long-term employment. Over the last three decades,\naccording to a survey by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, the\nshare of all low-wage workers who have attended or graduated from college has\nrisen to 43.2% (in 2011) from 25.2% (as of 1979). The share of those without a\nhigh school diploma shrank to less than 20% from nearly 40% in that time\nframe.For many workers, the minimum wage has become less of a transitional\nphase than ever. As Ben Casselman of fivethirtyeight.com reported last year,\nin the mid-1990s \"only 1 in 5 minimum-wage workers was still earning minimum\nwage a year later. Today, that number is nearly 1 in 3\" This implies that many\nemployers have become hooked on the minimum wage: why give workers a raise, as\nlong as they have no bargaining power? That's a reflection both of continuing\nslack in the labor market and the decline of unions in the private sector.One\nother important factor in judging whether a $15 minimum wage is justified is\nhow it corresponds to the cost of living. This is key, because $15 an hour can\nfund a relatively comfortable existence (though obviously not a lavish one) in\nsome places while keeping its earners at or even below the poverty line in\nothers. As I reported last year, after the Los Angeles City Council raised the\nminimum wage to $15 by 2020, the cost of living in L.A. is about 40% higher\nthan the U.S. average, according to figures from the Council for Community and\nEconomic Research. As fivethirtyeight's Casselman calculated, the nation's\nbest city for minimum wage employees was Columbus, Ohio, where the statutory\nminimum of $8.10 is worth $8.91, adjusted to the national average cost of\nliving.In terms of local buying power, $15 doesn't go nearly as far in L.A.\nthan in Columbus (where it's worth $23.03, according to the CCER's figures),\nChicago ($17.96) or Detroit ($21.83), though it goes further than in Manhattan\n(a mere $9.24). This complicates judgments about whether a $15 minimum wage is\n\"too high.\" Relative to what?All these considerations still leave us with the\nissue of what the minimum wage should be** **\\-- or more specifically, what\nare the chances that a raise to $15 through 2022 will provoke an exodus of\njobs from California.For decades, economists have searched for signs that\nhigher minimum wages cost jobs, largely without success. Even studies that\nhave forecast job losses find that those are minimal compared with the gains\nin income to the minimum wage class overall, and especially to low-wage\nworkers generally, whose pay is likely to be pushed up as the minimum rises.\nPerhaps the most notable such studies came from the Congressional Budget\nOffice, which examined the likely effects of an increase in the federal\nminimum to $10.10 by 2020.That option would lead to the loss of 500,000 jobs,\nthe CBO projected (within a range of zero to 1 million workers). But vastly\nmore, 16.5 million workers, including those earning just above the minimum,\nwould end up with higher pay. About 900,000 people would move above the\npoverty line. Families whose income was below the poverty line would gain a\ntotal of $5 billion, those with income up to three times the poverty threshold\nwould gain $12 billion. Overall income in the real economy would expand by a\nnet $2 billion. Would this be a good deal? It depends on whether you focus on\nthe 500,000 potential losers or the 16.5 million gainers. What's important\nabout this study and many more like it is that they don't measure the impact\nof an increase on the scale California is contemplating. This is a fair point,\nand underscores that the state's initiative, if it happens, would be very much\nan experiment. If it goes wrong, as some commentators have observed, the\nvictims are likely to be the poorest of the poor, many of whom already are out\nof the reach of any economic safety net as it is. If it goes right, however,\nCalifornia could establish a redefinition of \"low income\" that begins to\nredress the long imbalance of economic power in the U.S. Income would flow,\nincrementally, from business owners and customers toward the people who\nperform the most menial and unrewarding work in the economy. Is that a bad\nthing?The powers that be have been performing experiments on the U.S. economy\nfor several decades now. For example, there was the experiment in tax-cutting\nfor the wealthy that began with the Reagan-era \"trickle-down\" theory and the\nLaffer Curve. There was the experiment in debt-funded military adventurism\nlaunched by the George W. Bush administration. There are the experiments in\nprivatization of public services that have swept state legislatures coast to\ncoast. These experiments have proved to be disastrous for huge groups of\nAmericans, especially the middle class. They've suppressed economic growth.\nThey've saddled us with enormous debts that are being laid on the shoulders of\nthe neediest, including Social Security and Medicare recipients. They've led\nto the impoverishment of public universities, soaring college tuition and\nmushrooming student debts.Most of all, they've led to the very phenomenon of\nstagnant wages for the middle and working classes that the campaigns for\nhigher minimum wages seek to address. Those experiments have failed, but maybe\nit's time to try one that starts at the bottom of the income ladder and seeks\nto find if gains there will trickle up.**Keep up to date with Michael Hiltzik.\nFollow @hiltzikm on Twitter, see his Facebook page, or email\nmichael.hiltzik@latimes.com****Return to Michael Hiltzik's blog.****ALSO\n****Op-Ed: A minimum wage hike is the wrong fix****Will the $15 minimum wage\npass California's Legislature?

He was never suspended for\npassing the NBA-imposed limit of 16 but definitely pressed his luck.The\nkinder, less-confrontational Bryant has a clean ledger going into the final\nturn of his career. He picked up a technical foul in December but it was\nquickly rescinded by the league.

He is being paid $15.6 million this season.Quite\nsimply, he's a defensive-minded big man stuck in the league's trend toward\nsmall ball.There were only a few \"legit centers,\" Scott said, listing **Marc\nGasol **of the Memphis Grizzlies, **Dwight Howard** of the Houston Rockets and\n**DeAndre Jordan **of the Clippers.\"There's not a ton of them that are in the\nleague anymore,\" he said. \"It's kind of hurt Roy from that aspect.

Bidding will start at $750\nfor each of the letters, all of which are signed by Lee.In another letter\nwritten to the Leapards, Lee complains about fans invading her privacy. \"There\nhas evolved a new holiday sport in Monroeville, that of people bringing their\nvisiting relatives to look at me. There is so little in the way of\nentertainment, looking at Harper Lee is something to do.\"Monroeville, Ala.,\nwas Lee's hometown.

Both sides say it's about\nvalues.Georgia lawmakers...After Disney’s boycott threat, other show business\nfirms — including Netflix and Weinstein Co. — had also said they would stop\nmaking films and TV shows in the Peach State. Media giants including Time\nWarner and Viacom also decried the bill.Ric Reitz, president of SAG-AFTRA in\nAtlanta, said Georgia’s film business community was experiencing a “sense of\nrelief” over news of Deal’s veto.“I think the governor showed a lot of courage\nand conviction today with his announcement,” he said. “Don’t discount the fact\nthat Georgia is always trying to find the right solution. It may not always be\neasy and it certainly isn’t unanimous.”When reached for comment Monday, a\nhandful of other major entertainment companies, including Warner Bros., 20th\nCentury Fox and Universal Pictures, referred The Times to the Motion Picture\nAssn. of America, a trade organization that represents the studios.In a\nstatement, Vans Stevenson, the MPAA's senior vice president for state\ngovernment affairs, lauded Deal's veto of the measure, saying it “would have\nlegitimized discrimination based on sexual orientation.”It wasn't just\nHollywood companies that were critical of the Free Exercise Protection Act.\nApple, Turner, Unilever, Hilton and Yelp also opposed the legislation, along\nwith Atlanta's three professional sports teams.The Free Exercise Protection\nAct would have protected faith-based entities from providing services, such as\nperforming gay marriages, contrary to their beliefs. Supporters of the bill\nsaid it would've safeguarded religious freedoms and protected institutions\nfrom hiring people whose practices or beliefs they oppose.Efforts by Georgia\nto transform itself into the “Hollywood of the South” have paid dividends in\nrecent years. In Georgia’s last fiscal year ended June 30, 248 films went into\nproduction there, generating spending of more than $1.7 billion — up from\n$132.5 million in 2007. Currently, the movies “Fast and Furious 8” and\n“Baywatch” are shooting in the state.Julie Plec, the creator of the CW’s\n“Vampire Diaries” and “‘The Originals” — both of which shoot in Atlanta — said\nthat the comments Deal made at a news conference Monday resonated with her.\nAnnouncing his veto, Deal told reporters that the legislation did not reflect\nGeorgia’s character as a “welcoming state.”“I feel like what [Deal] said was\nthat he made a decision based on his own sense of self and human decency and I\ncompletely support that message and I’m glad he didn’t take too long to get it\nout there,” said Plec, who splits her time between Atlanta and L.A.The Human\nRights Campaign, an LGBT civil rights advocacy group, said Monday that Deal\n“set an example for other elected officials to follow” by vetoing the\nmeasure.Hollywood heavyweights such as Anne Hathaway, Rob Reiner and Harvey\nWeinstein signed a letter by the group last week demanding that the governor\nveto the bill.“Our message to Governor Nathan Deal was loud and clear: this\ndeplorable legislation was bad for his constituents, bad for business, and bad\nfor Georgia’s future,” said Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin in\nthe statement released Monday.Film producer Bill Mechanic, the former chief\nexecutive of Fox Filmed Entertainment, said Hollywood appeared to play a\npivotal role in swaying a legislative battle.“There is a lot of production in\nGeorgia and discrimination reaches into the Hollywood community very deeply,”\nhe said.Georgia, far from the only front where the battle between “religious\nfreedom” and gay rights is being waged, is the latest state to reach a\nresolution on the matter.South Dakota’s legislature attempted to pass a bill\nin February that regulated bathroom use by “chromosomes and anatomy,” thereby\nblocking transgender individuals from using facilities that suit their\nidentities, only to have the measure struck down by Gov. Dennis Daugaard after\na significant national outcry.On Monday, a spokeswoman for Louisiana Gov. John\nBel Edwards said that he planned to rescind a 2015 executive order from former\nGov. Bobby Jindal that allowed businesses and government agencies to refuse\nservices to gay people. Shauna Sanford, the governor’s press secretary, said\nEdwards would rescind the “religious liberty” order in the “near future.” Like\nGeorgia, Louisiana is a major hub for film and TV production.In North\nCarolina, Gov. Pat McCrory signed a contentious bill into law last week that\nprevented cities and towns from passing local anti-discrimination ordinances,\nlargely in reaction to a measure passed in Charlotte in February that looked\nto provide protection for transgender individuals' restroom choice.LGBT-rights\ngroups filed a federal lawsuit challenging the new North Carolina law, calling\nit discriminatory and said it singles out LGBT people for “disfavored\ntreatment.”daniel.miller@latimes.comlibby.hill@latimes.comTimes staff writer\nYvonne Villarreal contributed to this report.\n\n","title":"Georgia Governor 'set an example for other elected officials to follow,' the Human Rights Campaign says - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Georgia governor \"set an example for other elected officials,\" Human Rights Campaign says https://t.co/urXMQhhCwz https://t.co/xBed8est7k","date":"Mon Mar 28 19:10:09 +0000 2016","favs":33,"id":{"$numberLong":"714530030752243712"},"retweets":25},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1pFMhPD"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc671"},"content":"The brakes have officially been released on the virtual-reality era.This week,\nOculus' $599 Rift headsets begin arriving on the doorsteps of consumers who\npre-ordered the device in January. Two more high-end VR headsets are on the\nway, one from HTC and another from Sony, designed to work with the company's\nPlayStation 4 home video game console.And it's been hard to miss Samsung's\ncommercials for its midlevel, Oculus-powered Gear VR headset, endorsed by\nrapper Lil Wayne and compatible with some of its mobile devices. Then there's\nthe low-cost Google Cardboard, which works with most any smartphone.The race\nis on.History will view the release of the Rift and other VR headsets as more\nimportant than the launch of the iPhone, according to Tim Sweeney, founder of\nEpic Games, best known for creating popular back-end software that drives many\nvideo games.But just how successful VR will be in 2016 is a matter of debate.\nAt the recent Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, the industry's\nlargest professional gathering, designer Jesse Schell theorized that 8 million\ntop-level VR headsets will be sold by the end of 2017.Maybe half that figure\nis more realistic, says J.P. Gownder, an analyst at Forrester Research. It's\nbeen estimated that just 12 million to 13 million computers worldwide can\nactually run the technology.Other industry watchers steer the conversation\naway from numbers and toward impact and an influential audience. Jason Rubin,\nwho helps lead game development at Oculus, notes that initial VR efforts\ntarget technophiles and serious gamers rather than the mass market.The latest\nrevolution in gaming may not be something related to in-home consoles or the\nmuch-hyped Google Glass. It may well come from a 20-year-old former journalism\nstudent who left Cal State Long Beach to focus on a longtime buzzword whose\nday may finally have come: virtual reality.The idea...The latest revolution in\ngaming may not be something related to in-home consoles or the much-hyped\nGoogle Glass. It may well come from a 20-year-old former journalism student\nwho left Cal State Long Beach to focus on a longtime buzzword whose day may\nfinally have come: virtual reality.The idea...\"There is a very large number of\npeople who really like games and who really like graphics and who really like\ncutting-edge technology,\" he said. \"That's our audience this year and next\nyear.\"The pitch: The Rift will redefine mass media, conjuring worlds users can\nstep into rather than passively view. \"We've created a theme park,\" said\nRubin.Proponents of VR speak longingly of a world in which headsets are as\nlight and easy to wear as a pair of glasses. VR, they say, will alter\neverything from how we shop to how we view family photos to how we ride roller\ncoasters.Today, that's not quite the reality. The Rift requires an expensive,\nhigh-end PC, one that must be tethered to via a cord, and its headset\ncompletely shuts off wearers from the world around them.So before virtual\nreality changes the way we live, it will first have to change the way we\ngame.And when it comes to game design, get ready for the most approachable and\nuntested time yet for the still-maturing medium.

But in VR, excitement and adventure can lead to motion sickness.\nDevelopers say this glitch is an opportunity to create a new medium from the\nground up — one dependent upon new forms of interaction.\"Of all the major\ngames developed outside of VR, very few of them have any real possibility of\nworking in VR,\" said Epic Games' Sweeney. Epic's software the Unreal Engine\ndrives many VR and non-VR experiences.Though the market is relatively\nunproven, the public at least seems interested. Earlier this year, Google\nannounced on its blog that it has shipped more than 5 million of its Cardboard\nviewers.\"It's going to be a real revolution,\" said Sweeney. \"It's going to be\na bigger one than the personal computer or the smartphone revolution. It's the\nfirst medium that has any potential of making you feel like you're somewhere\nelse. We've gotten pretty good at drawing images of other places on screen,\nbut immersing you in it is a completely new thing.\"One we haven't quite\nfigured out.Adam Orth, whose Santa Monica-based Three One Zero will release\nthe tense, lost-in-space game \"Adr1ft\" for the Rift, admits that navigating\nthe new medium was all something of an experiment.\"We didn't know anything.

Video-game powerhouse Nintendo even released a device, the Virtual\nBoy, a clumsy, tripod-looking contraption in which games were confined to red\nand black tones. It came and went quicker than it could become a punch\nline.The Rift, advocates say, is a different story.Before Oculus, maker of the\nRift, was acquired for about $2 billion in 2014 by Facebook, the company was\nessentially the vision of Palmer Luckey. The home-schooled Long Beach native,\nwho briefly studied journalism at Cal State Long Beach, spent his teen years\nbuilding sometimes dangerous experiments — a coil gun here, a laser there.His\nhobbies were funded by fixing mobile phones. Luckey in 2013 told The Times\nthat when he was 16 he pulled in at least $36,000 by repairing iPhones and\nselling unlocked phones on Internet message boards for $700 apiece. And while\nhe dreamed of being a tech journalist, Luckey in 2012 turned to crowd-funding\nsite Kickstarter in the hopes of selling do-it-yourself VR kits.Initial Rifts\nwere essentially held together with duct tape and glue.At this year’s\nCoachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April, festivalgoers will have\naccess far beyond the the polo field or swanky VIP areas, thanks to a virtual\nreality experience.Festival organizers have announced a partnership with\nVantage.tv that will offer fans “unprecedented access”...At this year’s\nCoachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April, festivalgoers will have\naccess far beyond the the polo field or swanky VIP areas, thanks to a virtual\nreality experience.Festival organizers have announced a partnership with\nVantage.tv that will offer fans “unprecedented access”...Still, the Rift early\non distinguished itself by taking advantage of gains made by the mobile\nindustry, helping to make the technology relatively affordable. Software is\nalso now powerful enough to correct for lens distortion, and motion-control\nadvancements better allow for head tracking and cut down on delays in response\ntime, meaning the images on the Rift screen move with the tilt of the player's\nhead.To step into the Rift game \"Lucky's Tale\" is akin to being transported to\na world that's part \"Super Mario Bros.\" and part \"Looney Tunes.\" A bright,\nfantastical forest-lined universe is laid before the player, who towers over\nthe landscape like the puppeteer of a live-action board game.More important,\n\"Lucky's Tale\" is simple, doing away with complex control schemes that have\nmade PC and console video games impenetrable to those not already in the know.\nOur guide through the game, an adorable fox named Lucky, walks and jumps at\nlargely a leisurely pace, and the camera is the player's head.\"Lucky's Tale\"\nis the creation of Paul Bettner, chief executive of McKinney, Texas-based\nPlayful Corp. and a game designer best known as a principal architect of\niPhone smash \"Words With Friends.\" Bettner left mobile for VR, and he says\nhe's not returning.\"It's more a question of how fast the acceleration will\nhappen,\" he said, \"and not a question of will we go back into a phase where\npeople say, 'That was neat. What's the next thing?' This is the beginning of\nsomething that will not go backward.\"And those who don't buy in this year may\nsoon find VR to be relatively inescapable.To those who doubt we are on the eve\nof a new virtual reality era, Palmer Luckey, the 23-year-old founder of Oculus\nand inventor of the Rift headset, had one message at this week's Game\nDevelopers Conference: “You're going to have to eat your words.”There was no\nmistaking that VR was the darling...To those who doubt we are on the eve of a\nnew virtual reality era, Palmer Luckey, the 23-year-old founder of Oculus and\ninventor of the Rift headset, had one message at this week's Game Developers\nConference: “You're going to have to eat your words.”There was no mistaking\nthat VR was the darling...Six Flags Magic Mountain will on April 21 open to\nthe public a VR makeover of its Revolution coaster.

There's always an element of hype that can get out of scale with\nreality. That will be a matter of somebody saying, 'Well, we expected it to\nsee this many millions, and it sold this many millions.'

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc672"},"content":"Warren Buffett said it, famously, best: Price is what you pay; value is what\nyou get.His words apply to buying airline tickets because low fares often come\nat a price. Here are some things to consider when you're hunting for a\nfare:**Connections**I've seen fares to Asia for hundreds less if you go by way\nof Atlanta, where the connection time is 34 minutes. A two-hour connection\nwill cost more but is infinitely more sensible, especially when you consider\nthat Atlanta consistently tops the traffic totals in the Airports Council\nInternational world report as the busiest in the world. It served 96.1 million\npassengers in 2014, the most current stats available.Sometimes the connection\non a low fare requires an overnight stay in Houston, Miami or Shanghai, at the\npassenger's expense. Sometimes this is a good thing if you think of it as \"two\ncities for the price of one,\" and you actually want to spend 24 hours in a\nparticular place. But if you don't have a cousin or friend to stay with for\nfree, it can add considerably to your real cost.Sometimes the lowest fares\ninvolve two or even three connections, so a nonstop flight might be more but a\nmuch better value. If you miss a connection, you might not continue your\njourney for hours or days later.**Time of day, time of week**The lowest fares\nare frequently only available on red-eye flights or 5 a.m. departures, perhaps\nfrom an airport that requires a long drive from home. To make the trip work,\nyou might have to stay overnight at the airport before your departure.The\nlowest fares are usually available for travel only on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and\nSaturdays. If that fits your schedule, great.**Seasonality**A $500 flight to\nEurope in winter is not the same thing as a $500 flight to Europe in the\nsummer, if, indeed, you can find a fare that low. A low winter fare is not the\nsame \"value\" as the same price in summer if great weather and more hours of\ndaylight are part of the allure.**Equipment**Airlines know that many\npassengers prefer flying on snazzy new planes such as the Dreamliner or A380,\nwhich have up-to-date entertainment systems, quieter cabins, electric outlets\nand Wi-Fi, and they're willing to pay more for a better experience.If you're a\nself-contained traveler who can entertain himself and has battery backup, a\nlesser plane may offer savings.**Airline**The lowest fares are often on\nairlines whose reputations for customer service aren't always stellar. There's\na reason it costs less to fly to Zurich on Aeroflot or Ryanair than on\nSwiss.**Seats**If you wait for the lowest fare, the only seats available may\nbe middle seats near the lavatory. Buying a fare earlier before departure\noften gives you a better selection of aisle and window seats, but be aware\nthat you sometimes must pay for those better\nspots.**Refundability/changeability**Delta sells some fares that cannot be\nchanged or refunded under any circumstances. These fares might be $40 or $50\nless than fares that can be changed. American and United are following suit.\nAlthough it costs to change a ticket, at least you might get something back if\nyou need to cancel. These fares often require a fee to select a\nseat.**Fees**Southwest Airlines might have a slightly higher fare, but there\nare no fees for checking bags, and if you cancel or change you get to use the\nvalue of the ticket on another trip without paying a penalty or fee.Spirit\nlets you carry on a purse or a small backpack. But a sample booking for an\nApril 7 flight to Cancún, Mexico, shows that its standard carry-on bag fee,\npaid at the time of booking, is $35. Before online check-in, that climbs to\n$40. During online check-in, it goes to $45. At the airport it's $55. At the\ngate it's $100. Checked bags follow a similar (and, in some cases, slightly\nless expensive) schedule.Go to your carrier's website to read about its fees\nfor bags, changes, food and more._travel@latimes.com_\n\n","title":"Why paying more for airfare sometimes makes sense - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Why paying more for airfare sometimes makes sense https://t.co/IisR5MhFkL","date":"Mon Mar 28 18:35:09 +0000 2016","favs":14,"id":{"$numberLong":"714521223682764801"},"retweets":14},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1UxbWrs"}

But in a major concession to\nits limited funding, the plan now calls for a cheaper segment that would run\nfrom San Jose to the Central Valley by 2025.By the time that initial segment\nis built, all the existing funds would be exhausted, leaving uncertainty about\nhow and when the line would ever cross the geologically complex mountains of\nSouthern California.**NEWSLETTER: Get essential California headlines delivered\ndaily \u0026gt;\u0026gt; **The lack of specificity is stirring some deep concerns among\nlegislative analysts and Southern California’s political leadership, reflected\nin Ikhrata’s position. Ikhrata is scheduled to testify at an Assembly\noversight hearing Monday and says he will deliver a message that there are\nstill too many unknowns in the plan.“You can’t say you can do something\nwithout saying how you are going to pay for it,” he said in an interview.\n“This is a must.

The $64-billion mega-\nproject has been funded so far by a $9-billion bond, $3.2 billion in federal\ngrants and about $500 million a year in greenhouse gas fees, all of which\nleave a shortfall estimated at $43.5 billion, an amount that would be\ndifficult or impossible to find in the short term.The association of\ngovernments has played a key role in representing the region at the rail\nauthority, signing a 2013 memorandum of understanding that provided for about\n$1 billion of investment in Southern California’s transit systems to prepare\nfor the future bullet train. The deal put Southern California on a near-equal\nfooting with the Bay Area, which received money to electrify its Caltrain\ncommuter system.But the larger questions remain about the project’s ability to\ndeliver a system that would connect Los Angeles and San Francisco in 2 hours\nand 40 minutes, which is required under the 2008 bond act that voters\napproved. In the earlier plan, the rationale for starting in Southern\nCalifornia was based on the region’s larger population and the gap in\npassenger rail service that now exists between Bakersfield and Palmdale over\nthe Tehachapi Mountains.Rail authority chief Dan Richard said in a recent\ninterview that closing the rail gap remains important, but the state simply\ndid not have the estimated $31 billion it would take to build in the south.\nThe northern alternative would cost $21 billion and allow the state to build\nan operating system, theoretically with the funding it already has.“We\nunderstand that high-speed rail wants to start in the north,” Ikhrata said.\n“We understand that logic. Having said that, this system will only be valuable\nif this connects San Francisco to Los Angeles.”The statement reflects a\ncontinued belief that starting the system in the south remains the most\nlogical approach and some nervousness that the region could be left behind,\ndespite Richard’s often repeated assurances that it won’t be.“The most\nimportant segment is from Bakersfield to Palmdale, because there isn’t any\nrail connection,” Ikhrata said. “That gap must be closed and the business plan\nmust be clear how they are going to close it. If they build a system that\nfails to connect Los Angeles, this will be the biggest failure of an\ninfrastructure project we have ever had in the state of California. It will be\nsad for future generations.”A central political reality of the bullet train\nproject is that its main supporters are from Northern California, led by Gov.\nJerry Brown. Ikhrata said the project does not have enough support among key\nleaders in the Los Angeles region.“You don’t find advocates because the story\nhas changed so many times,” he said. “They are getting antsy. They are playing\nalong.”There also remains crucial questions about how the future bullet train\nsystem will actually be constructed and how it will operate in Southern\nCalifornia, which Ikhrata believes needs to be addressed sooner rather than\nlater.“We are still where we started,” he said.**Join the conversation on\nFacebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Ikhrata said the business plan now envisions using shared\ntrack throughout much of Southern California, though exactly what that means\nis unclear. In earlier planning, the state rail authority had planned to share\ntrack with Metrolink commuter trains and freight trains between Los Angeles\nand Anaheim. In the previous plan, the system would have had dedicated\nexclusive track between Los Angeles’ Union Station and Palmdale.But Ikhrata\nsaid the blended system would now include the section between Union Station\nand Palmdale.If so, it could affect the top speeds of the trains. Under past\nplans, the rail authority said the trains would operate at the full 220 mph\nbetween Bakersfield and Los Angeles. But a blended system could result in\nlower planned speeds, as it has in the Bay Area.**ALSO****High winds, cooler\ntemperatures expected across Southern California****California's $15 minimum\nwage gamble brings risks and potential rewards****Pharmaceutical industry is\nlobbying hard against an L.A.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc677"},"content":"To avert a strike at the nation’s largest public university system, California\nState University administrators should grant faculty members the 5% pay raise\ntheir union has been demanding for nearly a year, an independent mediator said\nMonday.The recommendation isn’t binding. But it does increase the odds that\n26,000 professors, lecturers, librarians, counselors and coaches will strike\nnext month if university administrators keep insisting they can only afford to\noffer a 2% raise, said California Faculty Assn. President Jennifer Eagan.“If\nwe had faculty that were on the fence, I think this will drive folks to the\npicket lines and make them brave,” said Eagan, a professor of philosophy and\npublic administration at Cal State East Bay.The faculty union has already\napproved a strike for April 13 to 15, April 18 and April 19.Rebecca Cummings,\nan English lecturer at Cal State Long Beach, said she is ready to go.“If any\nof my colleagues needed a further nudge, I hope this report does the trick,”\nCummings said. “I'm pretty fired up, myself. I’ll be out there every day.”Cal\nState Chancellor Timothy P. White said he would discuss the mediator’s report\nwith trustees next week. Officials have pledged to keep the 23-campus system\nopen during a strike, but White acknowledged that any work stoppage would be\nproblematic.“The only people who are going to get hurt are students,” he said.\n“We pride ourselves on being focused on student success; to stop services for\nthem is not in their best interest.”The report was prepared by Bonnie Prouty\nCastrey, a specialist in conflict resolution, after negotiations between\nfaculty and administrators reached an impasse last summer.Both sides had\npresented Castrey with evidence supporting their positions. In siding with the\nunion, she noted that educators’ pay had stagnated during the recession and\n“the faculty are still suffering from structural salary issues as well as the\nlack of substantial salary increases.”In addition to a general 5% raise,\nCastrey also recommended that some faculty receive additional increases based\non their length of service and other factors.All this would cost the Cal State\nsystem about $102 million a year, White said.In addition, contracts in place\nwith other unions would require administrators to grant raises to members of\nother bargaining units, White said.Administrators have set aside only $33\nmillion for a 2% faculty raise, White said. Paying any more this fiscal year\nis a “non-starter” because it would mean taking money from programs to boost\ntechnology on campuses and improve graduation rates by increasing the number\nof professors and counselors.“I cannot spend money I do not have,” White said.\n“That would be irresponsible.”The system has an annual operating budget of\nnearly $5.8 billion. The new fiscal year begins July 1.An accounting professor\nfrom Eastern Michigan University who analyzed the Cal State budget on behalf\nof the faculty union found that the system had about $500 million in excess\ncash flow in 2015 and more than $2 billion in reserves. Cal State\nadministrators have disputed those figures.Eagan said administrators have\ntried to use the $33 million set aside for the 2% pay increase as a bargaining\nchip and could have set aside more funding for raises earlier in the\nyear.“They should have bargained with us and then set their budget, not the\nother way around,” she said.In her report, Castrey also suggested both sides\nwork together to lobby lawmakers for more Cal State funding. White said he was\neager to give that a try.“I look forward to working with union leadership to\nadvocate for our students,” he said. **Follow @byjsong on Twitter****MORE\nEDUCATION NEWS****Court may help Corinthian students win relief****UC regents\nsay anti-Semitism has 'no place' on campus but reject blanket censure of anti-\nZionism****At UC Berkeley, promises of a crackdown on sexual misconduct are\nmet with skepticism by students**\n\n","title":"Key report due on Cal State salary impasse - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Report recommends that Cal State faculty receive 5% pay increase to avoid strike https://t.co/N3TWJL5Jmv https://t.co/pZYybJehbT","date":"Mon Mar 28 17:05:11 +0000 2016","favs":39,"id":{"$numberLong":"714498580623532033"},"retweets":50},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1UwSLxX"}

Pat\nMcCrory last week. The GOP-controlled legislature passed the law in response\nto a broad Charlotte ordinance that allowed transgender people to use the\nrestroom aligned with their gender identity. The new state law also prevents\nall cities and counties from extending protections to cover sexual orientation\nand gender identity at restaurants, hotels and stores.\"By singling out LGBT\npeople for disfavored treatment and explicitly writing discrimination against\ntransgender people into state law, [the new law] violates the most basic\nguarantees of equal treatment and the U.S. Constitution,\" the lawsuit\nsaid.**See the most-read stories this hour \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**With the law, North\nCarolina became the first state to require public school and university\nstudents to use only those bathrooms that match their gender on their birth\ncertificates, according to the National Conference on State\nLegislatures.Advocates for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender rights say\nstate legislators demonized them with bogus claims about bathroom risks.\nSupporters say the new law protects all people from having to share bathrooms\nwith people who make them feel unsafe.Two transgender people, a lesbian law\nprofessor and several civil liberties groups sued.Lawsuit defendants include\nMcCrory and the University of North Carolina system, where one plaintiff works\nand another attends college. The system's 17 campuses also must comply with\nthe law.Another defendant is Attorney General Roy Cooper, a Democrat who has\ncriticized the law and wants it repealed.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc679"},"content":"Some five million white-collar workers who don't currently get paid when they\nwork overtime could be in line for protection. But if the Obama administration\ndoesn't get cracking, it could lose the moment. Under the 1938 Fair Labor\nStandards Act, federal regulations governing overtime for hourly workers are\npretty straightforward. If you work more than 40 hours in a week, you must be\npaid time and a half your regular rate for those extra hours. But salaried\nworkers are covered by different rules, and overtime protections disappear for\nmany managers or administrative staff under an exemption designed to recognize\nthe different nature of office work compared with production or other blue-\ncollar jobs.A key factor in determining whether salaried workers qualify for\novertime protection is how much they earn. As it now stands, most salaried\nworkers who have some managerial or administrative responsibilities and make\nmore than $23,360 a year can be required to work extra hours without being\npaid overtime. But that cut-off was set in 2004 and is now $940 below the\nfederal poverty line for a family of four. Hardly what most people would\nconsider a management-level salary.The federal Department of Labor has\nproposed changing the threshold so that it is no longer a set dollar amount\nthat is regularly eroded by inflation. Instead, it would be pegged to the top\nof the 40th percentile of weekly earnings nationally for salaried workers —\nestimated this year to be $970 a week, or $50,440 annually.In Silicon Valley\nand Silicon Beach, high-tech companies help drive the California economy by\npaying high salaries to driven, talented employees whose productivity more\nthan compensates for their high pay. But California's public schools are stuck\nin the old mode of paying modest salaries for modest...In Silicon Valley and\nSilicon Beach, high-tech companies help drive the California economy by paying\nhigh salaries to driven, talented employees whose productivity more than\ncompensates for their high pay. But California's public schools are stuck in\nthe old mode of paying modest salaries for modest...The problem with the\ncurrent low salary threshold is that as wages have risen, people who ought to\nbe receiving overtime protection have lost it. The new rule is part of a\nbroader effort by the Obama administration to use regulations and executive\nactions governing federal employees and contractors to improve wages and\nworking conditions. That's an imperfect solution for a laudable goal, but\nfaced with a recalcitrant Republican Congress, that's about the only avenue\nthe president has.Business advocates oppose the new overtime rule because they\nsay it will increase companies' labor costs, and their allies in Congress have\nintroduced an objectionable (and we hope unsuccessful) bill that would bar the\nLabor Department's new definitions, arguing that to do so would limit work\nsite flexibility, reduce workers' opportunities for advancement and lead to\njob losses. That's disingenuous at best. As salaries have increased with\ninflation, employers have reaped the windfall from the outdated exemption\nlevel, and updating the threshold just means bosses will have to start paying\nemployees for extra work the companies have been getting for free. Thanks to\nthe arcane rules of governance, the Labor Department's proposed overtime rule\nfaces a ticking clock. The department last week sent the new rule, which has\nalready gone through a public comment period, to the Office of Management and\nBudget's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for final approval,\nwhich is supposed take no more than 90 days. Once OMB approves the measure,\nand the Labor Department publishes it in the Federal Register, Congress gets a\nchance under the Congressional Review Act to override the new rule within 60\nlegislative days. Like any other congressional act, such an override is\nsubject to presidential veto.This is where the calendar, and the November\nelection, come into play, and where the opportunity to take this reasonable\nstep could be lost. According to the Congressional Research Service, any new\nrules published after mid-May that are subsequently blocked by Congressional\naction will likely go to the desk of the next president for signature or veto.\nWe suspect that if Congress were to override the rule, a President Clinton or\nSanders would veto such a measure and let the new rule stand. It's hard to\nimagine, though, that any of the current Republican contenders would defend\nworkers' right to overtime pay over such strong business lobby opposition.The\nnew rule is an important restoration of overtime protections. OMB should move\nwith all reasonable haste to approve it in time to ensure that if the\nRepublican Congress tries to kill it, Obama would still be in office to defend\nit.**Follow the Opinion section on Twitter ****@latimesopinion**** and\n****Facebook****MORE FROM OPINION****Robots are coming for your job****Off-\nshore oil drilling in the Arctic is still far too risky****Obama's record on\nforeign policy is incomplete**\n\n","title":"Who should be entitled to overtime pay and who shouldn't? - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Who should be entitled to overtime pay and who shouldn't? https://t.co/tDts5A8Qk9 https://t.co/alHDV57aA2","date":"Mon Mar 28 16:35:14 +0000 2016","favs":17,"id":{"$numberLong":"714491045262835712"},"retweets":24},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1MHEW7F"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc67b"},"content":"Georgia’s “religious liberty” bill drew Hollywood criticism and threats of\nboycotts  before the state's governor vetoed the legislation. Georgia is far\nfrom the first state to face intense criticism for controversial legislation\ninvolving religious freedoms and protections (or lack thereof) for LGBT\npeople. Over the years, several states have seen similar controversies arise\nover their own state legislation and have opted to resolve the situations in a\nvariety of ways.In Arizona, legislators hoped to pass **SB 1062**, a measure\ngiving businesses the right to assert that their religious beliefs superseded\nthe necessity to provide service to gay and lesbian customers. Critics of the\nbill argued that the language would allow discrimination against any group of\nindividuals for any religious reason.**Result**: Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed the\nbill on Feb. 26, 2014**Fallout:** It’s likely that Brewer’s ultimate decision\nto veto was affected by the NFL’s warning that it was “following the issue”\nbrewing in Arizona as it unfolded, just a year before the state was due to\nhost Super Bowl XLIX. Arizona had been previously spurned by the NFL when, in\n1990, the state failed to pass a Martin Luther King Jr. Day ballot measure and\nthe league subsequently moved Super Bowl XXVII from Tempe, Ariz., to Pasadena.\nDelta Air Lines, the MLB and George Takei were also noted critics of SB\n1062.Arkansas hoped to pass **HB 1228** in order to increase “judicial\nscrutiny” in cases involving religious beliefs, an attempt to fight back\nagainst the legalization of same-sex marriage. Critics of the bill saw it as a\nmove toward legalized discrimination of LGBT individuals.**Result:** Gov. Asa\nHutchinson refused to sign the bill as written. The legislature then submitted\ncompromise SB 975, a revised version of the bill that looks to more closely\nmirror federal law, revising the bill to address only government actions, not\nbusinesses or individuals, yet lacked language for anti-discrimination, that\nwas passed immediately into law on April 2, 2015.**Fallout: **The state faced\nmuch criticism for the bill, likely spurring Hutchinson to seek a modified\nversion. Apple, Yelp and, perhaps most significantly, Arkansas-based super-\nretailer Wal-Mart all registered public disappointment in HB 1228.Georgia\nlegislators aimed to turn into law **HB 757**, which would legalize pastors’\nrights to refuse to perform same-sex marriages and allow businesses to deny\nservice to individuals whose lifestyles conflict with their religious\nbeliefs.**Result:** _Vetoed._ Georgia’s legislature approved the bill on March\n17, 2016, leaving the matter in the hands of Gov. Nathan Deal. Deal vetoed the\nbill on March 28, saying he could \"find no examples that any of the things\nthis bill seeks to protect us against have ever occurred in\nGeorgia.\"**Fallout: **Reactions to the Georgia legislation have been intense,\nwith the Human Rights Campaign sending a petition to Deal on March 24 urging\nhim not to sign the law, including the signatures of such Hollywood luminaries\nas Harvey and Bob Weinstein, Aaron Sorkin, Kathleen Kennedy, Ryan Murphy and\nDiablo Cody. At least 248 film and TV productions were shot in Georgia last\nyear, pumping $1.7 billion into the state, meaning a widespread boycott would\nbe deeply costly for the state.Beyond just the petition, entertainment\nmonoliths such as Viacom, AMC, Time Warner, Disney, Marvel and 21st Century\nFox have promised to pull productions from the state should HB 757 be\nlegalized.Disapproval has also been registered from Coca-Cola and Delta, both\nof whom have headquarters in Atlanta, as well as Google, which also has major\noffices in the city.And if the threat from Hollywood weren’t enough, Georgia\nhas also been put on notice by the NFL, which raised a similar specter in\nArizona in 2014, saying that passage of the law would take Atlanta’s Mercedes-\nBenz Stadium, opening in 2017, out of consideration for Super Bowl hosting\nduties. Further, the College Football Playoff National Championship and SEC,\nboth of whom have arrangements with the new stadium for future events,\nregistered that they would be closely monitoring Georgia’s decision in these\nlegal matters and will be evaluating accordingly.In North Carolina, state\nlawmakers looked to make **HB 2 **a law in order to prevent cities and\ncounties from making their own rules with regard to anti-discrimination,\nspurred in large part by expansive anti-discrimination measures passed by\nCharlotte in February. Charlotte’s new laws looked to protect transgender\nindividuals who sought to use restrooms in alignment with their gender\nidentity, a move that North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory called a “breach of\nbasic privacy and etiquette.”**Result:** McCrory signed the bill on March 23,\n2016.**Fallout: **North Carolina’s decision has spawned much criticism from\ncorporations and individuals alike, with director-producer Rob Reiner vowing\nto not film in the state while the law stands and the NBA, scheduled to host\nits All-Star Game in Charlotte in 2017, is looking into what effect the new\nlaw will have on their ability to maintain those plans.

Metro is building several\nnew rail lines, and the state's bullet train is planned to come into the\ncity.Here is a look back at the last golden age of rail.**La Grande\nStation**Railroad passengers crowd at Santa Fe terminus, La Grande Station, at\nSecond Street and Santa Fe Avenue, circa 1910. The depot was built in 1893 and\nno longer stands. Railroad passengers crowd at Santa Fe terminus, La Grande\nStation, at Second Street and Santa Fe Avenue, circa 1910. The depot was built\nin 1893 and no longer stands. The Moorish-style La Grande Station opened July\n29, 1893, at 2nd Street and Santa Fe Avenue. In addition to its exotic\narchitecture, La Grande Station featured lush gardens and, later, a Harvey\nHouse restaurant.In the 1920s, summer discount tickets by all railroads\nbrought a major influx of tourists to Los Angeles. During the 1924 influx, the\nAtchison, Topeka and Santa Fe depot at Le Grande Station was featured in the\nMay 19, 1924, edition of the Los Angeles Times:Wide-eyed and wondering, the\nvanguard of the great army of summer tourists that will make their way across\nthe plains of the Middle West and over the Rockies for the next few months\narrived in Los Angeles yesterday.Beginning at 7:30 o'clock yesterday morning,\nthe three great trans-continental railroads into Los Angeles began pouring\ntourists into the city by the trainload. The climax to the day's influx came\nearly in the afternoon when the Golden State Limited on the Southern Pacific\nand the California Limited on the Santa Fe unloaded about 620 passengers. The\nLos Angeles Limited on the Union Pacific came in with two sections. The last\nof the day's travelers from the East got in shortly before 9 o'clock last\nnight. The day's total reached more than 1,200 passengers.…Accustomed as Los\nAngeles is to having tourists come in from the East, the arrival of the first\nof the season's sight-seers brought great crowds down to the railroad\nstations. At the Santa Fe depot it was estimated that 1,500 persons were on\nhand to meet three sections of the limited. And they weren't all there to meet\nfriends or relatives either.Long before the train time at the Santa Fe the\ncrowd of welcomers began to muster. By the time the big iron horses were\ndragging their human cargoes through the outlimits of Los Angeles, private\ncars were parked up and down the street for two blocks in front of the\nstation. A regular battalion of taxi drivers were ready to \"do their stuff.\"\nOut in the train sheds the red caps and their wagons were deployed\nstrategically to handle the baggage of the newcomers.A great throng of persons\nstood in the friendly shade of the depot, and train employees, according to\none of the company statisticians who carried an adding machine slung on a\nstrap over his shoulder, told 1,200 persons 2,400 times [... ] the first\nsection of the limited would arrive on time on track No. ...The clanging of a\nbell growing louder, the crowd begins to crane its collective neck, the little\ngirl clutching a bunch of California roses begins to jump up and down with\nhysterical anticipation, and around the curve there looms the engineer of the\nfirst section, [the] engineer nearly fell out of the cab when he saw the crowd\nat the depot. Regaining his self-composure, however, he saved the day by\nbringing his mount to a halt with a great hissing of air and the proverbial\ngrinding of the brakes. …--And it wasn't just the influx of visitors to\nSouthern California; the discounted tickets worked in reverse. On May 23,\n1924, The Times reported that \"eastbound trains pulled out of Los Angeles\nstations yesterday carrying capacity loads. Approximately 6,500 Southern\nCalifornians bound eastward on vacation trips were said to be aboard.\"The dome\non La Grande Station was removed in 1933 after being damaged in the Long Beach\nearthquake. With the opening of Union Station in 1939, La Grande was closed.\nThe building was torn down in 1946.**Central Station**Crowds of outbound\ntravelers at Central Station in Los Angeles on July 3, 1937.

This photo was published in\nthe July 4, 1937 Los Angeles Times.In 1914, Southern Pacific began\nconstruction of Central Station — at 5th Street and Central Avenue — to\nreplace the neighboring Arcade Station. The incomplete Central Station opened\nto passengers on Dec. 1, 1914.Central Station was dedicated on June 12, 1915.\nThe next morning's Times reported:Another milestone was turned last evening on\nthe trail of the city's progress when the Southern Pacific's new $750,000\npassenger terminal was formally dedicated to the use of the public.The\nexercises were held, with 1,000 people participating in the commodious\nconcourse of the new station, which had been turned into a bower of flowers\nand potted plants for the occasion. …The new station is the most expensive\nwest of Kansas City, and for the number of persons handled, the most expensive\nin the United States. It adjoins the site of the old Arcade, which was opened\nFebruary 25, 1889, and was operated until November 30, 1914, when the ticket\noffice was moved from it into the baggage room of the new station, pending its\ncompletion. Previous to the occupancy of the Arcade station, Southern Pacific\ntrains were run into the River Station, which is still in existence.Embodying\nmany novel time-saving details, the new station is 572 feet long, facing\nCentral Avenue, with the main entrance almost exactly on the line of Fifth\nStreet. The concourse is 280 feet long by eighty wide and about fifty feet in\nheight. One wing of the station houses the baggage-room; the other a\nrestaurant that is as fine as any in the West. The second story of one wing is\noccupied by the division offices; the other is unoccupied.Everything about the\nnew station, from the steel used in the frame of the concourse to the one-ton\nchandeliers, fourteen in number, that light it, was fabricated in Los Angeles.\nGround for the new station was broken March 28, 1914, and the station was\npronounced finished yesterday.The ten passenger tracks, which are protected by\nfour concrete umbrella sheds, each 780 feet long, are reached by subway from\nthe passenger concourse, while egress is also through a subway. In this way,\nno passenger is forced to cross a track in getting either to or from a train.\nBy an arrangement of passageways, two or three trains may be served at once,\nwithout confusion to passengers.Among the outside details is parking space\nthat will accommodate 250 automobiles, special trackage for fourteen private\ncars, with steam heat and telephone connections, and restricted loading space\nfor baggage and express. …--After a 1924 fire that destroyed the Los Angeles\ndepot, Union Pacific moved its passenger operations into Central Station. In\n1939, the Southern Pacific, Union Pacific and Santa Fe railroads all moved\ntheir passenger service to the new Union Station. Central Station was torn\ndown in 1956.**Union Station**Los Angeles' Union Station is the landmark train\ndepot that remains standing. The architectural icon celebrated its 75th\nanniversary in 2014. On May 3, 1939, an estimated 500,000 people attended the\nstation's dedication and parade.In a front-page story in The Times on May 4,\n1939, columnist Ed Ainsworth reported on the Union Station\nfestivities:Everybody but Casey Jones was down at the new depot yesterday.And\nCasey was dead!It was just like the 5 o'clock flyer highballing through \"on\ntime.\" Nobody was surprised. But, boy, wasn't she a beauty!After all, it\nwasn't exactly an $11,000,000 Union Station with a highfaluting name that Los\nAngeles was dedicating. It was folks from 10,000 little towns all going down\nto their own little depots in Memory Town to listen to the whistle toot and to\nhear that great big bell.Of course they had scads of railroad presidents\ncluttering up the place. They had millionaires and fellows with private\nrailroad cars. They had Governors and Mayors and brass hats in droves.Yet it\nwas really just the people of America — from all the 48 States — who really\ndrove the spike that nailed down a chunk of history on Alameda St. yesterday\nnoon.Nobody really could have been expected to be surprised. The rumor had got\naround that there was a big new palace of transportation down there by the old\nLos Angeles River just waiting to be dedicated.But, surprise or no surprise,\n500,000 persons more or less jammed and pushed and fought along Alameda St.\nfor many, many blocks to see a dream come right before their eyes.They knew\nthe Southern Pacific, the Santa Fe and the Union Pacific railroads had united\nand built that handsome Spanish structure with the tower and the olive trees\nand the padded seats and the loudspeaker system and all the rest. They knew it\nwas going to introduce the world to Los Angeles and the Old Plaza. But they\nstill wanted to be there to see it happen. They wanted to see the past come\nboiling up like the smoke out of the funnel stacks of the old wood-burning\nengines.And to see it they hung in trees.

They\nmade basketball fun to play, entertaining to watch and compelling to analyze\nwith their special style of dunks, three-point shots and unselfish passes.\nThere will be a continuing discussion about where the Huskies rank among the\ngreatest teams in Southern California history, but there won't be any debate\nthat their chemistry was second to none.Even when Chino Hills fell behind by\n10 points in the first quarter in Saturday night's CIF Open Division state\nchampionship game against Concord De La Salle at Sleep Train Arena, there was\nno panic. This was not going to be Kentucky vs. Wisconsin. At halftime, still\ntrailing by two points, the Huskies simply turned to their leader, point guard\nLonzo Ball, who reminded everyone to settle down and play their style.The\nresulting final 16 minutes of a 70-50 victory was pure Chino Hills. There were\ndunks, no-look passes, steals and just crazy plays that put smiles on the\nfaces of fans and even cynical sportswriters.Seeing it all unfold was Chino\nHills Coach Steve Baik, who placed immeasurable trust in his players.\"We knew\nwhen the season started we had a chance to do something like this,\" he said.\n\"So we said 'Let's go for it. Let's schedule the best teams we can find. Let's\ntravel all over and get the best competition we can.' I'm more relieved than\nanything for it to come to this. As we got closer and closer to this game the\npressure kept building and building. You always worry about having that one\ngame where everything goes wrong.\"The first sign of a season to remember came\nin the summer debut of then-13-year-old LaMelo Ball. Fresh from graduating\nmiddle school, he was immediately put into the starting lineup to play\nalongside brothers Lonzo and LiAngelo and scored 27 points in a 98-51 win over\nPasadena Muir last June.Everyone owes a debt of gratitude to LaVar and Tina\nBall. They didn't play the game that lots of parents are playing — holding\nback kids for sports reasons so they can enter high school a year older and a\nyear stronger than some peers. They wanted LaMelo to play with his brothers\nand let him rise or fall on his own merits. And what a decision it was.It was\nhalftime Saturday night in the CIF Open Division state championship boys'\nbasketball game. Unbeaten Chino Hills trailed Concord De La Salle by two\npoints.

Unbeaten Chino Hills trailed Concord De La Salle by two\npoints. Lonzo Ball, the national player of the year, sat in a chair looking\nout onto the court at Sleep Train Arena with a steely gaze on his...There have\nbeen great families of three basketball-playing sons — the Holidays, the\nHamiltons and now the Balls. But only the Ball brothers got to play together\non the same team.\"It's great to all be playing together and to accomplish this\ngoal together,\" Lonzo Ball said. \"It's what we set out to do at the beginning\nof the season, and we did it.\"Chino Hills was so dominant that in eight\nplayoff games, the closest any opponent came was 20 points. There was a\n48-point victory over Santa Ana Mater Dei. The Huskies exceeded 100 points in\n18 games this season, tying the state record.The development of 6-foot-9\nfreshman Onyeka Okongwu and the play of 6-5 Eli Scott helped pave the way for\nan unbeaten season. Okongwu's shot-blocking skills were breathtaking in the\nfinal month of the season. Scott's rebounding and dunks let everyone know he\nwas a college player in the making.For me, there are two memories I'll never\nforget — a pretzel jar and a big yawn.Sitting at the podium of the Honda\nCenter after the Southern Section Open Division championship game, LaMelo Ball\ngrabbed a large pretzel jar and started eating its contents as reporters\nwaited to ask questions. You could see he really was 14 years old.Whether it's\nthe all-around play of 6-foot-6 Lonzo Ball; the dunks of 6-5 Eli Scott; the\nblocked shots of 6-9 freshman Onyeka Okongwu; the bank shots of 6-6 LiAngelo\nBall; or the Steph Curry threes from 5-10 freshman LaMelo Ball, unbeaten Chino\nHills High has been providing an unprecedented brand...Whether it's the all-\naround play of 6-foot-6 Lonzo Ball; the dunks of 6-5 Eli Scott; the blocked\nshots of 6-9 freshman Onyeka Okongwu; the bank shots of 6-6 LiAngelo Ball; or\nthe Steph Curry threes from 5-10 freshman LaMelo Ball, unbeaten Chino Hills\nHigh has been providing an unprecedented brand...And then Saturday night, as\nthousands of fans waited to see whether Chino Hills could finish an unbeaten\nseason by winning in an NBA arena, LaMelo unleashed a big yawn standing next\nto his brothers during player introductions. When has anyone so young acted so\ncool? It was no act. Big games and big moments have become second nature to\nhim, learned from playing in the backyard against his brothers.Lonzo is moving\non to UCLA, but seeing LaMelo grow and mature over the next three years is\ngoing to be quite a sight. Chino Hills has four starters back.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc67e"},"content":"Amid mounting pressure from multinational corporations, Georgia Gov. Nathan\nDeal on Monday announced his plan to veto a contentious bill framed as\nprotecting religious freedom but that critics warned would lead to anti-gay\ndiscrimination.The bill, dubbed the Free Exercise Protection Act, would have\ngiven faith-based organizations in Georgia more leeway to deny services to\ngay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people. Supporters said the measure was\nmeant to protect religious freedom, while critics described it as \"deplorable\"\nand \"divisive.”“I do not think we have to discriminate against anyone to\nprotect the faith-based community in Georgia, of which I and my family have\nbeen a part for all of our lives,” Deal said at a press conference at the\nstate Capitol.The Republican, a devout Baptist, said he had examined the\nprotections that House Bill 757 proposed to offer the faith-based community.\n“I can find no examples of any of those circumstances occurring in our state,\"\nhe said.In vetoing the bill, Deal argued, he was not just providing a\nbusiness-friendly climate for job growth in Georgia. “I believe it is about\nthe character of our state and the character of our people. Georgia is a\nwelcoming state. It is full of loving, kind and generous people.”“Our people\nwork side by side without regard to the color of our skin, or the religion we\nadhere to,” he added. “We are working to make life better for our families and\nour communities. That is the character of Georgia.”The bill, which lawmakers\ntweaked and amended over the course of the legislative session, declared that\nno pastor could be forced to perform a same-sex wedding. It also grants\nnonprofit faith-based organizations the right to reject granting permission\n“to rent, lease, or otherwise grant permission for property to be used by\nanother person for an event which is objectionable” to that organization.Such\ngroups would also have the right to fire or not hire a person “whose religious\nbeliefs or practices or lack of either” run counter to the organization’s\nreligious beliefs.House Bill 547, Deal said, contained language that caused\nhim “some concern” that it “may in fact encourage or allow discrimination that\nis sanctioned by the state.” Freedom of religion, he argued, was best left to\nthe U.S. Constitution.Deal stressed that his veto was not meant to disparage\nlegislators’ motivations. Many, he noted, had sought to compromise as the bill\npassed through the House and Senate.“Their efforts to purge this bill of any\npossibility that it would allow or encourage discrimination illustrates how\ndifficult it is to legislate on something that is best left to the broad\nprotections of the 1st Amendment of our United States Constitution,” he\nnoted.Hollywood's threat to boycott production in Georgia over proposed anti-\ngay legislation is a collision of politics, culture and economics that\nreflects the divisive lines between conservatives and liberals playing out in\nthe race for the White House. Both sides say it's about values.Georgia\nlawmakers...Hollywood's threat to boycott production in Georgia over proposed\nanti-gay legislation is a collision of politics, culture and economics that\nreflects the divisive lines between conservatives and liberals playing out in\nthe race for the White House. Both sides say it's about values.Georgia\nlawmakers...Since the bill was passed March 16, it has met sustained\nopposition from major players in the entertainment industries. Disney and\nMarvel threatened to stop film production in Georgia if Deal signed the bill\ninto law. Various other corporations — including Apple, Comcast, Dell, Time\nWarner and Sony Pictures — urged the governor to veto.Deal, however, insisted\nhe had tried to ignore the pressure from businesses and act according to his\nown conscience. “To those within the business community, some of whom - not\nall, by any stretch – have resorted to threats of withdrawing jobs from our\nstate, they should know: I do not respond very well to insults or threats,\" he\nsaid. \"The people of Georgia deserve a leader who will make sound judgments\nbased on solid reasons that are not enflamed by emotion. And that is what I\nintend and have tried to do.”Gay and transgender rights supporters wasted\nlittle time in challenging a new North Carolina law, filing a federal lawsuit\nMonday that called it discriminatory and said it singles out LGBT people for\n\"disfavored treatment.\"The law, which has also drawn strong opposition from\nmajor corporations...Gay and transgender rights supporters wasted little time\nin challenging a new North Carolina law, filing a federal lawsuit Monday that\ncalled it discriminatory and said it singles out LGBT people for \"disfavored\ntreatment.\"The law, which has also drawn strong opposition from major\ncorporations...The veto did not come as a surprise. Earlier this year, the\ngovernor urged fellow Republicans to compromise, warning he would not sign a\nbill that allowed discrimination.“I hope that we can all just take a deep\nbreath, recognize that the world is changing around us, and recognize that it\nis important that we protect fundamental religious beliefs,” he told the\nAtlanta Journal-Constitution. “But we don’t have to discriminate against other\npeople in order to do that.”Still, Deal’s veto is likely to enrage\nconservative religious lawmakers who have unsuccessfully sought to strengthen\nwhat they consider religious protections in Georgia for the last three years.\nLast year’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage only\nfortified their resolve.Already, leading Republicans have vowed to revive the\nmeasure next year.“Vetoing the bill does not end the debate,” said Georgia\nstate Sen. Joshua McKoon, a leading advocate for such legislation. “This will\nonly intensify the debate and intensify efforts to move a bill forward.”The\nlast great LGBT rights battle was fought over marriage. The next one might be\nover bathrooms, whether activists like it or not.Across the country, LGBT\nadvocates and conservatives are battling over transgender nondiscrimination\nlaws that have again and again turned into single-issue showdowns...The last\ngreat LGBT rights battle was fought over marriage. The next one might be over\nbathrooms, whether activists like it or not.Across the country, LGBT advocates\nand conservatives are battling over transgender nondiscrimination laws that\nhave again and again turned into single-issue showdowns...McKoon has long\nquestioned how “inclusive” critics of religious freedom legislation are,\narguing their definition of inclusion does not extend to people of religious\nfaith.“I don’t think it’s inclusive to try to prevent a policy that tries to\nensure governments are not going to punish people according to their religious\nbeliefs,” he said. “To me, that’s not inclusive.”A veto, McKoon said, sent a\nstrong message to voters that their representatives in the Legislature are not\nin control. “I believe the people who ought to be in the driver’s seat are the\nvoters,” he said. “If we get to a place where businesses can sort of rattle\ntheir sabers and say, ‘We're going to leave town if you pass this law,’ then\nwe’ve gotten to a whole new layer in terms of the influence of money and\npolitics,\" he continued. \"If we get to that point in Georgia, we would be\nbetter off saving the public the expense of elections and just auctioning off\nseats in the legislature to various Fortune 500 companies.”Deal's decision to\nveto was welcomed by gay-rights groups. “Gov. Deal’s veto of HB 757 represents\na tremendous victory not just for LGBT people, but for everyone who believes\nthat fairness and equality under the law are hallmarks of our nation,” said\nMatt McTighe, executive director of Freedom for All Americans, in a statement.\n“HB 757, like so many similar bills, gambled Georgia’s economy, reputation and\nthe livelihood of so many of its residents – all for the sake of advancing\ndiscrimination. We thank Gov. Deal for doing the right thing.”Jeff Graham,\nexecutive director of Georgia Equality, thanked Deal for \"doing the right\nthing and rejecting this dangerous bill.\" The veto, he said in a statement,\nwould protect Georgia's economy and its brand.But he added that the state\nstill needs to go further to protect its gay and lesbian communities. “Our\nwork is far from over,\" he said. \"The dialogue over HB 757 offered a profound\nreminder that LGBT people still are not covered by any state-level\nnondiscrimination laws. While we’re enjoying today’s hard-fought victory,\nwe’ll continue working to ensure every single Georgian is protected from\ndiscrimination.\"**ALSO****Disney threatens to stop filming in Georgia if anti-\ngay bill becomes law****LGBT-rights groups file federal lawsuit over new North\nCarolina anti-discrimination law****Some call it religious freedom, others\ncall it anti-gay.

The tankers have sourced water from\nsurrounding areas, including Dongargaon, prompting opposition from residents\nof rural communities who say they too are suffering from scarcity and should\nnot be giving their water to others.When tankers first came to fill up at\nDongargaon, residents attacked the trucks, prompting Latur officials to deploy\npolice to secure the water delivery. After brawls also broke out at water\ndistribution points elsewhere in Maharashtra state, authorities in Latur this\nmonth took the rare step of imposing a curfew barring people from gathering\naround water collection sites in the city.Latur is in the middle of a parched\nfarming region known as Marathwada that has been reeling under a four-year\ndrought so severe that hundreds of farmers have committed suicide just in the\nlast few months. Officials say about 30 people have died in the region this\nyear trying to collect water, including two girls who drowned in wells.Last\nmonth, residents in Latur swarmed an incoming water tanker. Umesh Gaikwad, 39,\nwho had been appointed by city administrators to help manage the water\ndelivery, suffered cardiac arrest while trying to pacify the mob.

Five years later, in 2015's fourth quarter, the\npercentage of underwater homeowners was nearly 17%, topped only by the 22% of\nhomeowners in Miami and 21% in Las Vegas-Henderson, Nev.**See more of our top\nstories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Although the median prices of homes in suburbs\nacross the Chicago region continue to be below the inflation-adjusted prices\nthey commanded pre-crash — even in tony Winnetka, the median home sold for 29%\nless last year than in 2005 — a map of house price changes over the last\ndecade tracks closely with racial boundaries and shows that residents of blue-\ncollar suburbs who were less equipped to absorb such a huge hit to their\nwealth are the worst affected.The question for many in these towns is no\nlonger when they will recover, but if they ever will.Cook County's top 10\ntowns for foreclosures are all in the south suburbs, according to data\ncompiled by the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University. Residents\non a typical block in middle-class towns such as Matteson, Country Club Hills\nand Richton Park can expect one of their neighbors to be in foreclosure,\nbecause about 1 in 30 homes was in foreclosure as recently as 2014.In a\nhandful of the county's poorest towns — Harvey, Ford Heights, Phoenix,\nRiverdale, Robbins and Sauk Village — more homeowners are foreclosed upon than\nobtain new mortgages, a surefire recipe for vacant homes, declining tax bases\nand blight.Only in one Chicago-area town, Lisle, have inflation-adjusted\nprices risen modestly back above their pre-recession prices, to $261,000.\"The\nhousing market is a good reflection of the uneven recovery of the economy\noverall,\" and may help explain why consumer confidence lags so far behind\nother economic indicators, said Geoff Smith, executive director of the\nInstitute for Housing Studies at DePaul University.Though boom times have\nreturned to a handful of hip Chicago neighborhoods and well-to-do suburbs that\nwere not so badly affected, \"a good half to two-thirds of the housing market\nis still trying to get back to where it was, and a third is still at pre-2000\nprices,\" Smith said.Given how much of most homeowners' wealth is tied up in\ntheir homes, that's a serious brake on the Illinois economy. But without some\nwidespread principal reduction program for underwater homeowners of the type\nbeing considered in a more limited form by mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae\nand Freddie Mac, Smith said, recovery will take a \"a lot of patience\" and \"is\nnot necessarily realistic for a lot of neighborhoods.\"John Petruszak,\nexecutive director of the South Suburban Housing Center, which helps\nhomeowners with distressed mortgages, said that recovery in largely African\nAmerican south suburbs \"is going to take a long time,\" and that some form of\ndebt forgiveness or other assistance for struggling homeowners is\nneeded.\"Everybody seems to think we've recovered from the housing crisis, but\nfor many communities of color that's not the case,\" Petruszak said.As for the\nVershers, the couple have friends who walked away from mortgages that no\nlonger made sense, but Mitchell Versher said that wasn't his style, and that\nif his wife hadn't suffered a couple of layoffs, or if they were able to\nrenegotiate their debt again, he'd have liked to stay put.Still, he and his\nwife expect ultimately to be forced from their home.

If claims submitted after those contracts were signed send\ncosts above budget, they will call into question the rail authority's cost\nprojections for the full system.The contractor team on the first segment has\nsent the rail authority a log that includes more than 300 pending change\norders and notices, about 200 of which do not yet include cost estimates. The\nteam, led by Sylmar-based Tutor Perini, won a $1-billion contract in 2013 for\nthe first segment. The Times obtained a copy of the log dated last November\nand a subsequent update in January.Asked about the notices, state officials\nsaid the documents are not yet official claims or demands, and should not be\nconsidered final.\"The fact that the contractor will submit change orders or\nclaims to us is really just the start of the process,\" rail authority Chairman\nDan Richard said in an interview. \"It is not a self-executing process.\"**See\nmore of our top stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**The requests will be audited by\nthe authority to see \"if the costs they claim really did happen,\" Richard\nsaid. \"After that there will be the process of what really caused those and\nwho has the responsibility.\"He noted that the process also works in the other\ndirection. \"We will have claims against the contractor for not being ready to\ndo things they should have been ready to do.\"Ron Tutor, chief executive of\nTutor Perini, did not return a call requesting comment.The rail authority has\napproved about $14 million in change orders, and the logs from Tutor Perini\ninclude an additional $51.7 million that the company has estimated.Among the\nunpriced change orders is a potentially large claim Tutor Perini is preparing\nagainst the state for project delays. The firm cited the state's failure to\ndeliver land parcels over a two-year period after the contract was awarded.The\nstate had virtually none of the land acquired in 2013 when it awarded the\nTutor Perini contract, and limited construction did not begin until July\n2015.Tutor Perini believes the state owes it $65 million for a 17-month delay,\naccording to company documents obtained by The Times. A second delay of seven\nmonths could be priced at $30 million, according to experts who have looked at\nthe computations.Rail authority spokeswoman Lisa Marie Alley said the\nauthority has not received a formal claim from Tutor Perini about the\ndelays.It will take time for the state and contractors to decide on the costs\nof change orders. But construction industry experts who reviewed the logs said\nthose changes could be costly. Several estimated they could exceed $400\nmillion on the initial contract.They based their estimates on the large volume\nof change orders, lengthy delays and the significant revisions of the original\nplans.**NEWSLETTER: Get the day's top headlines from Times Editor Davan\nMaharaj \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**\"If you award a contract and promise to make the land\navailable and it isn't there, it can have consequences,\" said William Ibbs, a\nUC Berkeley civil engineering professor who has consulted on high-speed rail\nprojects around the world. \"Delay claims occur all the time.\"The Tutor Perini\ncomputed costs include idle-equipment charges, overhead, higher prices for\nmaterials and additional insurance, among other items. The company parked\ndozens of pieces of heavy construction equipment in yards near the Fresno\nproject.The rail authority has set aside a $160-million contingency fund for\npotential cost overruns on the segment, which, including work by utilities, is\nestimated to cost $1.2 billion to $1.8 billion.But project chief Gary Griggs\nof Parsons Brinckerhoff, the state's lead consultant, last month warned the\nauthority board that it might have to increase that contingency fund by an\nadditional $150 million.In addition to problems raised by Tutor, potential\ncosts have risen for utilities, highway relocations and freight railroad\nissues.The California rail authority’s failure to identify a source of funding\nto connect Los Angeles to the future bullet train system is not acceptable,\nsaid Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of\nGovernments.Until the high-speed rail authority released a new draft\nbusiness...The California rail authority’s failure to identify a source of\nfunding to connect Los Angeles to the future bullet train system is not\nacceptable, said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California\nAssn. of Governments.Until the high-speed rail authority released a new draft\nbusiness...This month, a report by rail authority staff warned that a\n$150-million cost increase was projected for just two companies,\ncommunications giant AT\u0026amp;T and utility provider PG\u0026amp;E.Alley said the\nincreased costs relate to design issues and \"a better understanding of utility\nimpacts.\" Part of the problem involves what construction managers call\n\"unexpected conditions,\" in which the lines are not where blueprints show.\"The\nstate did research with PG\u0026amp;E to find gas and electrical locations, but\nthose lines are not always where you think they are or as deep as you think\nthey are,\" said Fresno public works director Scott Mozier. Fresno has no\ndirect role in the matter, except handling its own water and sewer\npipes.Railroads are discussing tens of millions of dollars in compensation for\nimpacts on their operations, including relocation of their tracks, barriers\nseparating their lines from future bullet train tracks and other uses of their\nproperty.The two freight railroads did not respond to requests for comment.One\nof the major unpriced change orders on the Tutor Perini log involves the\nrelocation of a one-mile stretch of Golden State Avenue in Fresno, a major\nnorth-south four-lane highway.The contract originally would move the road by\nabout 25 feet, but business owners protested to Fresno Mayor Ashley\nSwearengin, saying it would damage their operations. Swearengin negotiated a\nnew plan to relocate the highway by about 400 feet around the back of the\nbusinesses, said Mozier, the public works director.The work includes\nrelocating a flood retention basin, moving utilities, gutters and much more,\nat a cost likely to get into the high tens of millions of dollars, according\nto one engineer close to the project. Alley said the agency is negotiating a\nprice for the change and would not speculate about the cost.\"This change was\nimportant to us because [it] resulted in fewer impacts to property owners,\nwhich is a key element of this program,\" Alley said.The Golden State\nrealignment concerns some Fresno leaders, though the project still has the\nstrong support of Swearengin.\"Right here in the first mile in Fresno, you have\na major change,\" said Steve Brandau, a city councilman whose district includes\nthe realignment section. \"How many times is this going to happen by the time\nthey get to Los Angeles?\"Brandau said he is worried that Fresno could be left\ntorn up if the project stumbles, adding that rail authority officials\nroutinely disregard his requests for information on construction plans in his\nown district.Lawson Rock \u0026amp; Oil Inc., the state's largest hauler of crude\noil, has a large truck yard on Golden State Boulevard that was among the\naffected businesses. Owner John Lawson, a member of the Fresno County planning\ncommission and a former member of the California Transportation Commission,\nsaid the rail authority made a major error in awarding the Tutor Perini\ncontract when it had such little property in hand.\"When they awarded Tutor the\ncontract, the state owned three or four pieces of property,\" Lawson said.\n\"That was pretty stupid. If they can build this for [$64 billion] like the\nliars say, I say build it. But when it gets to $150 billion they are going to\nbe in deep trouble.\"Higher costs for the first 29 miles could be just part of\nbroader increases affecting the entire 118 miles of construction in the\nCentral Valley.A detailed analysis of the bullet train project by Elizabeth\nAlexis, a private investment manager and cofounder of a Bay Area group\ncritical of the project, asserts that the Central Valley construction segment\nfrom Madera to near Bakersfield is now about $1.2 billion above the 2012\nbudget of $5.8 billion — a 21% jump. A spreadsheet that details the changes\nwas submitted to the Legislature and the rail authority.\"Their plans change\nall the time, so it is hard to track on an apples-to-apples basis how their\ncosts have changed,\" she said. \"None of their documents allow this direct\ncomparison.\"In a report this month, the Legislative Analyst's Office concluded\nthat the amount, schedule and cost of work in the Central Valley have changed\nover time, making it \"difficult to determine how well the high speed rail\nauthority is adhering to the budget for that\nsegment.\"_ralph.vartabedian@latimes.com_**ALSO****News of a minimum wage hike\ndeal in California is met with relief -- and anxious\narithmetic****Pharmaceutical industry is lobbying hard against an L.A.

Here are some story lines I don't want you to miss today.****TOP STORIES****Sorry, 'None of the Above' Isn't Running**The latest USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times poll has some great details about how California voters view the presidential candidates. In terms of front-runners, we're in a land of disenchantment: 45% view Hillary Clinton unfavorably, while three-quarters feel that way about Donald Trump. On the Democratic side, most of Bernie Sanders' supporters here say they expect Clinton will be elected president and they're largely OK with that. As for the Republicans, the divide between supporters of Trump and Ted Cruz is wider. And in a hypothetical general election? Clinton wins the Golden State easily, even when pitted against John Kasich.**Minimum Wage, Maximum Anxiety**Lawmakers and unions have reached a tentative deal that would increase California's minimum wage to $10.50 an hour next year and then gradually to $15 by 2022. It could be approved as early as this week. But the news is making employers and employees wonder how the higher wage would affect them. Read on to see why both sides are making some nervous calculations. **An Easter Sunday Bombing**It was supposed to be a pleasant evening in a public park in Lahore, Pakistan -- an Easter Sunday escape for families in a country with just a tiny Christian minority. Then, a suicide bomber set off an explosives vest, killing scores and wounding hundreds, most of them women and children. A splinter group of the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility and said it was aimed at Christians celebrating Easter.**The Retaking of Palmyra, Jewel of the Desert**After the ancient city of Palmyra fell into Islamic State hands in May, militants sparked outrage when they blew up archaeological treasures and beheaded the retired director of the city’s antiquities museum. On Sunday, Syrian government forces regained control of what had become a powerful symbol in the conflict. It was also one of the clearest indications yet that the tide is turning against the extremist group in the six months since Russia began providing military support. What's left of the city's treasures? We should find out soon. **Virtual Reality: You Can Goggle It**With the ringing of a doorbell by a delivery person, the era of virtual reality at home is here this week -- at least for those early adopters who preordered Oculus' $599 Rift.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc686"},"content":"The messages from the expectant mothers in Brazil resonate with\ndesperation.“I'm thinking of doing the worst,” one woman wrote when her order\nfor abortion medication failed to arrive. “I really need help. I can no longer\neat, and I cry all the time.”The messages were sent to an international\nadvocacy group that had been providing abortion-inducing drugs free of charge\nto expectant mothers who fear that the Zika virus could cause severe birth\ndefects.**Join the conversation on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Now, however, the group\nhas temporarily suspended its operations in the country because Brazilian\nauthorities have confiscated the drugs in the mail. Abortion is prohibited in\nmost instances in Brazil, and the drugs are illegal.“It's not fair to tell\nwomen they are going to get a package, and it will not arrive to them,” said\nLeticia Zenevich, a spokeswoman for the advocacy group, Women on Web. “It's\nvery tragic.”As the Zika virus, which has been linked to birth defects,\nspreads across Latin America, the demand for abortions is increasing in\ncountries where there are few legal avenues to obtain one.“It has made the\nissue more salient and has highlighted the cruelty behind some of these\nrestrictive abortion...As the Zika virus, which has been linked to birth\ndefects, spreads across Latin America, the demand for abortions is increasing\nin countries where there are few legal avenues to obtain one.“It has made the\nissue more salient and has highlighted the cruelty behind some of these\nrestrictive abortion...Even in the face of the Zika virus, providing\npregnancy-ending alternatives to women in a country where abortion is in most\ncases illegal is proving to be nearly impossible, Zenevich said.Women on Web,\na Canadian group that is based in the Netherlands and operates worldwide, said\nin February that it had sent “dozens of packages” to women in Brazil but only\ntwo packages had arrived. The rest were apparently seized. The packages\nprovided by Women on Web contained misoprostol and mifepristone, which can end\na pregnancy.Authorities acknowledge that they are confiscating abortion drugs\nsent in the mail because the medicines are banned in Brazil.The Brazilian\nHealth Surveillance Agency said it was illegal for individuals to receive\nmisoprostol — an abortive substance best known in Brazil by the brand name\nCytotec — in the mail.“Packages are checked when they arrive at the post\noffice, and if medications are discovered they are forwarded to us,” said\nCarlos Dias Lopes, an agency press officer.Lopes, whose bureau is responsible\nfor approving and supervising pharmaceuticals, told The Times: “We have a duty\nto send any illegal substances for destruction.”Since Feb. 1, Women on Web has\nbeen providing misoprostol together with mifepristone, a combination that\nincreases the efficacy of the procedure, free of charge to women in countries\naffected by the Zika virus.In Brazil, 95% of the packages have been seized,\nthe group said in a statement.Lopes said his agency was not familiar with the\norigin of the packages because that was not part of the government body's\nwork.The World Health Organization lists misoprostol and mifepristone on its\nModel List of Essential Medicines that “satisfy the priority healthcare needs\nof the population,” but includes the annotation “where permitted under\nnational law and where culturally acceptable.” It also notes that usage of\nthese drugs requires “close medical supervision.”Two-week-old Sophia, who was\nborn with microcephaly, attends a physical therapy session in February at the\nPedro I municipal hospital in Campina Grande, Brazil. Two-week-old Sophia, who\nwas born with microcephaly, attends a physical therapy session in February at\nthe Pedro I municipal hospital in Campina Grande, Brazil. Brazil is among\nseveral nations in Latin America and the Caribbean that prohibit abortion in\nmost circumstances.In Brazil, it is only permitted when necessary to save a\nwoman's life, in rape cases or in cases of a birth defect known as\nanencephaly. Calls to relax the country's abortion laws in the face of the\nZika outbreak have run up against fierce opposition from clergy and some\npoliticians.According to Women on Web, nearly a third of the women who ordered\nabortion medication from them did so out of a fear of Zika. Scientists suspect\nthat the mosquito-borne virus is linked to an increase in cases of\nmicrocephaly, a rare condition in which babies are born with unusually small\nheads.Zenevich said the organization received 9,500 emails last year from\nwomen largely in Brazil inquiring about abortion medication, and an additional\n10,400 emails from women in the Spanish-speaking Americas.The fear of facing\nmotherhood in the era of Zika had increased demand for the drugs, Zenevich\nsaid.Reproductive rights advocates fear the lack of access to abortion pills\nmight push women to pursue unsafe options to terminate a pregnancy.“We have a\nsituation here in Brazil in which women are having clandestine abortions, and\nin which women are dying,” said Sonia Coelho, a spokeswoman for the National\nCampaign for the Legalization of Abortion. “This brings consequences ...\nprincipally for poorer women and black women, who lack the means to have an\nabortion in a safer  \nplace.”Though illegal, relatively safe clandestine abortions are available in\nBrazil to those able to pay around $800 or more, almost four times the monthly\nminimum wage.The flood of emails from women who ordered the drugs from Women\non Web but didn't receive them has been frantic.One woman, whose medication\nwas confiscated twice, wrote to the group saying she had run out of options:\n“Here in my town there's nothing else to do, it's either your service or\nnothing.”**See the most-read stories this hour \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Some who ordered the\nconfiscated drugs feared they might be “hunted down” and face criminal\nprosecution, as one women put it.The group is advising women with the means to\nfind a post office box in another South American country, such as neighboring\nArgentina, where the packages could be sent. But for many of the low-income\nwomen seeking help, the option is simply unrealistic.Even before the Zika\ncrisis, a booming business in fake abortion pills had sprung up, said Coelho.\nMany women resort to buying drugs from traffickers only to discover they are\nbogus and sometimes dangerous, she said.“We have had cases of women calling us\nfor advice, saying they bought Cytotec but that it did not work,” Coelho said.\n“What can we say? There's nothing she  \ncan do. Who is she going to complain to given that the medicine is prohibited\nin Brazil?”_Special correspondent Rigby reported from São Paulo and Times\nstaff writer Simmons reported from Los Angeles.__**For more news on global\nsustainability, go to our Global Development Watch page:** latimes.com/global-\ndevelopment_**And follow me on Twitter: @AMSimmons1****MORE ON ZIKA****First\nCalifornian contracts Zika through sex****Genetic sleuths uncover Zika's viral\nsecrets****Photos: Motherhood in the time of Zika**\n\n","title":"Brazil seizes abortion drugs sent to women living in fear of Zika - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Brazil seizes abortion drugs sent to women living in fear of Zika https://t.co/eNgMv0UdGH https://t.co/tFspDlmQ6n","date":"Mon Mar 28 12:05:14 +0000 2016","favs":37,"id":{"$numberLong":"714423097684787201"},"retweets":87},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1of9M13"}

Fares Bayoush, a\nleader of Fursan al Haq, said in an interview.Rebel fighters described similar\nclashes in the town of Azaz, a key transit point for fighters and supplies\nbetween Aleppo and the Turkish border, and on March 3 in the Aleppo\nneighborhood of Sheikh Maqsud. The attacks by one U.S.-backed group against\nanother come amid continued heavy fighting in Syria and illustrate the\ndifficulty facing U.S. efforts to coordinate among dozens of armed groups that\nare trying to overthrow the government of President Bashar Assad, fight the\nIslamic State militant group and battle one another all at the same time.\nSyrian government forces drove Islamic State militants out of the ancient city\nof Palmyra on Sunday, dealing a blow to the extremist group that could\neffectively end its presence in central and eastern parts of the\ncountry.President Bashar Assad's army had imposed \"total control\" over\nPalmyra,...Syrian government forces drove Islamic State militants out of the\nancient city of Palmyra on Sunday, dealing a blow to the extremist group that\ncould effectively end its presence in central and eastern parts of the\ncountry.President Bashar Assad's army had imposed \"total control\" over\nPalmyra,...“It is an enormous challenge,” said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Burbank),\nthe top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, who described the\nclashes between U.S.-supported groups as “a fairly new phenomenon.” “It is\npart of the three-dimensional chess that is the Syrian battlefield,” he\nsaid.The area in northern Syria around Aleppo, the country's second-largest\ncity, features not only a war between the Assad government and its opponents,\nbut also periodic battles against Islamic State militants, who control much of\neastern Syria and also some territory to the northwest of the city, and long-\nstanding tensions among the ethnic groups that inhabit the area, Arabs, Kurds\nand Turkmen.“This is a complicated, multi-sided war where our options are\nseverely limited,” said a U.S. official, who wasn't authorized to speak\npublicly on the matter. “We know we need a partner on the ground. We can't\ndefeat ISIL without that part of the equation, so we keep trying to forge\nthose relationships.” ISIL is an acronym for Islamic State.**See more of our\ntop stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**President Obama this month authorized a new\nPentagon plan to train and arm Syrian rebel fighters, relaunching a program\nthat was suspended in the fall after a string of embarrassing setbacks which\nincluded recruits being ambushed and handing over much of their U.S.-issued\nammunition and trucks to an Al Qaeda affiliate.Amid the setbacks, the Pentagon\nlate last year deployed about 50 special operations forces to Kurdish-held\nareas in northeastern Syria to better coordinate with local militias and help\nensure U.S.-backed rebel groups aren't fighting one another. But such\nskirmishes have become routine.Last year, the Pentagon helped create a new\nmilitary coalition, the Syrian Democratic Forces. The goal was to arm the\ngroup and prepare it to take territory away from the Islamic State in eastern\nSyria and to provide information for U.S. airstrikes.Syrian pro-government\nforces battled their way Friday into the outer areas of the city of Palmyra,\nthe archaeological metropolis held by Islamic State militants since May of\nlast year, as part of a punishing month-long drive to wrest control of the\ncity and surrounding areas from the extremist...Syrian pro-government forces\nbattled their way Friday into the outer areas of the city of Palmyra, the\narchaeological metropolis held by Islamic State militants since May of last\nyear, as part of a punishing month-long drive to wrest control of the city and\nsurrounding areas from the extremist...The group is dominated by Kurdish\noutfits known as People's Protection Units or YPG. A few Arab units have\njoined the force in order to prevent it from looking like an invading Kurdish\narmy, and it has received air-drops of weapons and supplies and assistance\nfrom U.S. Special Forces.Gen. Joseph Votel, now commander of U.S. Special\nOperations Command and the incoming head of Central Command, said this month\nthat about 80% of the fighters in the Syrian Democratic Forces were Kurdish.\nThe U.S. backing for a heavily Kurdish armed force has been a point of tension\nwith the Turkish government, which has a long history of crushing Kurdish\nrebellions and doesn't want to see Kurdish units control more of its southern\nborder.The CIA, meanwhile, has its own operations center inside Turkey from\nwhich it has been directing aid to rebel groups in Syria, providing them with\nTOW antitank missiles from Saudi Arabian weapons stockpiles. While the\nPentagon's actions are part of an overt effort by the U.S. and its allies\nagainst Islamic State, the CIA's backing of militias is part of a separate\ncovert U.S. effort aimed at keeping pressure on the Assad government in hopes\nof prodding the Syrian leader to the negotiating table.It was oddly tranquil\nup there on the roof of an obliterated commercial center in the Old City of\nHoms, once ground zero of Syria’s sanguinary conflict.

A panorama of ruin spread in\nall directions, the ghost of a vibrant community, blown apart in body and\nspirit.Empty streets sliced through rubble...At first, the two different sets\nof fighters were primarily operating in widely separated areas of Syria — the\nPentagon-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in the northeastern part of the\ncountry and the CIA-backed groups farther west. But over the last several\nmonths, Russian airstrikes against anti-Assad fighters in northwestern Syria\nhave weakened them. That created an opening which allowed the Kurdish-led\ngroups to expand their zone of control to the outskirts of Aleppo, bringing\nthem into more frequent conflict with the CIA-backed outfits.“Fighting over\nterritory in Aleppo demonstrates how difficult it is for the U.S. to manage\nthese really localized and in some cases entrenched conflicts,” said Nicholas\nA. Heras, an expert on the Syrian civil war at the Center for a New American\nSecurity, a think tank in Washington. “Preventing clashes is one of the\nconstant topics in the joint operations room with Turkey.”Over the course of\nthe Syrian civil war, the town of Marea has been on the front line of Islamic\nState's attempts to advance across Aleppo province toward the rest of northern\nSyria.On Feb. 18, the Syrian Democratic Forces attacked the town. A fighter\nwith the Suqour Al-Jabal brigade, a group with links to the CIA, said\nintelligence officers of the U.S.-led coalition fighting Islamic State know\ntheir group has clashed with the Pentagon-trained militias.“The MOM knows we\nfight them,” he said, referring to the joint operations center in southern\nTurkey, using an abbreviation for its name in Turkish, Musterek Operasyon\nMerkezi. “We'll fight all who aim to divide Syria or harm its people.” The\nfighter spoke on condition of anonymity. Marea is home to many of the original\nIslamist fighters who took up arms against Assad during the Arab Spring in\n2011. It has long been a crucial way station for supplies and fighters coming\nfrom Turkey into Aleppo.“Attempts by Syrian Democratic Forces to take Marea\nwas a great betrayal and was viewed as a further example of a Kurdish\nconspiracy to force them from Arab and Turkmen lands,” Heras said. The clashes\nbrought the U.S. and Turkish officials to “loggerheads,” he added. After\ndiplomatic pressure from the U.S., the militia withdrew to the outskirts of\nthe town as a sign of good faith, he said.But continued fighting among\ndifferent U.S.-backed groups may be inevitable, experts on the region\nsaid.“Once they cross the border into Syria, you lose a substantial amount of\ncontrol or ability to control their actions,” Jeffrey White, a former Defense\nIntelligence Agency official, said in a telephone interview. “You certainly\nhave the potential for it becoming a larger problem as people fight for\nterritory and control of the northern border area in Aleppo.”_Bulos is a\nspecial correspondent._**For more on U.S. national security, follow @WJHenn\nand @ByBrianBennett****ALSO****Islamic State's No. 2 leader killed in U.S.\nraid, officials say****As Belgian police investigate attacks, John Kerry vows\nto destroy Islamic State****Video of a dead city: This is what Syria's\ndevastation looks like**\n\n","title":"In Syria, militias armed by the Pentagon fight those armed by the CIA - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"In Syria, militias armed by the Pentagon fight those armed by the CIA https://t.co/pwXbtNApqb https://t.co/HRZZYIyWSt","date":"Mon Mar 28 11:05:13 +0000 2016","favs":50,"id":{"$numberLong":"714407995191529475"},"retweets":151},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1Td9tAP"}

Palmyra seems to embody\nan alternative narrative.The White House, which has struggled for years to\nfind effective “partners” on the ground in Syria, has difficulty publicly\nlauding advances against  Islamic State by Assad and his allies, including the\nRussians and Iranians, after years of calling for Assad’s fall.Talal Barazi is\nseated in the pleasant outdoor restaurant of a heavily guarded hotel in Homs,\nor what is left of it.\"Basically, it's Berlin after World War II,\" says\nBarazi, who as governor of Homs province has seen much of the area under his\njurisdiction destroyed by Syria's civil war.

The U.S.\napproach in Palmyra contrasted dramatically with the very proactive U.S.\nbombardment of Kobani during 2014-15 on behalf of U.S.-allied Kurdish militias\nfending off a furious Islamic State offensive.This was, in part, because the\nSyrian conflict has developed into a multi-sided proxy war, greatly\ncomplicating the fight against Islamic State.The United States’ major allies\nin the region, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, are still deeply committed to the fall\nof Assad and a new government in Damascus more amenable to their interests.\nBoth the Saudis and Turks stepped up aid to their Syrian proxies, mostly\nvarious shades of Islamists, in response to the Russian aerial intervention on\nbehalf of Assad’s forces that began in September.It was oddly tranquil up\nthere on the roof of an obliterated commercial center in the Old City of Homs,\nonce ground zero of Syria’s sanguinary conflict.

But many rebel groups who have been deemed “moderate” and received\naid from the United States and its allies acknowledge cooperating with Al\nNusra Front, the official Al Qaeda franchise in Syria.The United States and\nits geopolitical rivals — Russia, Iran and the Assad government in Syria — all\nview Islamic State as an enemy to be annihilated. But working together to\nachieve that goal on the fractured terrain of Syria remains a daunting\nchallenge.Assad and the Russians have long asserted that his government was\nthe leading bulwark against terrorism in Syria. But the Obama administration\nhas backed a contrary argument: Assad is a “magnet” for Islamic extremists,\nWashington says, a leader whose violent crackdown on street protests in 2011\nsparked the war and drew militants from across the globe to Syria.

As part of the ongoing Geneva peace process, both Washington and\nMoscow have backed the principle that Syria’s state institutions must remain\n“intact” through any “transitional” Syrian government that may arise from the\npeace process.So far, though, the Assad government has made it clear that its\nparticipation in United Nations-backed talks in Geneva is not meant to\norchestrate its own demise.In recent months, the White House has toned down\nits “Assad must go” demands, conceding that the Syrian president could stay in\npower for some unspecified period during a transition to a new, negotiated\nadministration in Syria. Still, Washington insists Assad must step down.But\nhow to maintain a stable government structure in Damascus without Assad and\nhis loyalists remains a key obstacle for negotiators in Geneva.

That set in motion an era of\ninstability and sectarian-fueled violence that continues to this day — and has\nradiated across the region, sowing chaos.In fact, Islamic State has its\norigins in Al Qaeda in Iraq, which emerged from the U.S. occupation and became\na potent adversary of Washington and its Iraqi allies. The new war in Syria\nthat began in 2011 drew numerous battle-hardened Islamist fighters from across\nthe border in Iraq.Many of Islamic State’s current leaders, including the\ngroup’s top figure, Abu Bakr Baghdadi, were imprisoned by U.S. forces in Iraq.\nJust as young militants in Europe become radicalized in prisons, Baghdadi and\nhis confederates appear to have consolidated a sinister strategy of Sunni\nextremist resistance and expansion during their time at Camp Bucca  in\nsouthern Iraq.**ALSO****Brussels Islamic militant recruiter groomed young men\nfor violence****In Syria, militias armed by the Pentagon fight those armed by\nthe CIA****Taliban says it targeted Christians in a park on Easter Sunday,\nkilling 70**\n\n","title":"Syrian army's blow to Islamic State presents a paradox for Obama - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Syrian army's blow to Islamic State presents a paradox for Obama  https://t.co/BP6c7MFDE3","date":"Mon Mar 28 10:10:15 +0000 2016","favs":9,"id":{"$numberLong":"714394162632794112"},"retweets":23},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1Pzmvlr"}

But he was the sole suspect in custody tied directly to\nthe bombings, which triggered a wave of raids and apprehensions as officials\nresponded to the latest terrorist assault to stun Europe.The release would\nseem to signal that the third airport attacker remains a fugitive and that the\nmassive manhunt for him will continue. Three confederates died in last week’s\nsuicide attacks.They called him Papa Noel — Father Christmas — and not only\nbecause of his thick beard and stocky build.He was also the generous sort,\nproviding advice, logistical aid and travel expenses to his proteges — mostly\nyoung Belgians of Moroccan descent harboring an identity-affirming, if\npotentially...They called him Papa Noel — Father Christmas — and not only\nbecause of his thick beard and stocky build.He was also the generous sort,\nproviding advice, logistical aid and travel expenses to his proteges — mostly\nyoung Belgians of Moroccan descent harboring an identity-affirming, if\npotentially...In recent days, Belgian authorities have arrested at least five\nother men on suspicion of terrorism, but it’s unclear if any were believed\nconnected to last week’s attacks. At least one of those arrested was linked to\na foiled terrorist strike in France, prosecutors said. Police have been\nconducting almost daily raids in Brussels and the city’s outskirts.Brussels,\nthe de facto capital of the European Union, remains on high alert. Soldiers\nwith rifles guard train and bus stations and patrol city streets.In announcing\nhis release, authorities did not explicitly exonerate Faycal C., who was\ndetained Thursday outside the federal judicial building downtown. He was\nformally arrested the following day and held on suspicion of murder, attempted\nmurder and membership in a terrorist group.Outside the stock exchange in\nBrussels, people gather to remember those killed in last week's terrorist\nattacks.

The site has become an unofficial shrine to the\nvictims.A search of the man’s home yielded no sign of arms or explosives,\nauthorities said Saturday.“The indications that had led to the arrest of the\nman named Faycal C. were not supported by the evolution of the ongoing\ninvestigation,” Thierry Werts, a spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor,\nsaid in a brief statement.Police provided no further details.The now-released\nsuspect was identified in the press as Faycal Cheffou, described as an\nindependent video journalist.Belgian authorities have come under intense\ncriticism for failing to do more to prevent the attacks and officials have\nacknowledged they made “mistakes,” especially a lack of follow-up in the case\nof a Belgian man expelled from Turkey last June on suspicion of terrorist\nactivity.That man, Ibrahim El Bakraoui, returned to Belgium and, in what\nofficials conceded was a major oversight, was not questioned about his\npresence in Turkey, a chief transit zone for foreign militants seeking to\nfight in Syria.El Bakraoui was later identified as one of the two attackers\nwho detonated suicide bombs at the airport. His brother, Khalid El Bakraoui,\nwas identified as the suicide attacker on the metro train. Both were Belgian\ncitizens with previous convictions for violent crimes not related to\nterrorism, authorities said.A large cell of mostly Belgian nationals of\nMoroccan descent, many with criminal records, appears to have been behind last\nweek’s strikes and the attacks on Paris nightspots last November that left 130\npeople dead. The second Brussels airport suicide attacker, Najim Laachraoui,\nhas been identified as a bomb-maker in the November attacks in\nParis.Laachraoui was among many cell members who had traveled to Syria and\napparently joined Islamic State, the Al Qaeda offshoot that has taken credit\nfor the Brussels and Paris attacks. Authorities theorize that the plans for\nmass murder in Europe were conceived in Syria and organized in Brussels, which\nhas seen a higher proportion of its citizens travel to Syria and join militant\nfactions than any other European nation.On Monday, police disseminated video\nfootage of the three bombers at the airport before the attacks in a bid to\nseek public help in identifying the fugitive. Previously, authorities had\ncirculated only the lone image from the closed circuit camera.In the footage,\nthe third attacker appears of average height, sports a goatee and dark-rimmed\nglasses, and wears a light jacket and a black hat. His face is largely\nobscured. It was not clear how he survived the attack. Speculation has\ncentered on the possibility that the bomb he took to the airport failed to go\noff and he fled._Special correspondent Arthur Debruyne contributed to this\nreport._**MORE ON THE BRUSSELS ATTACKS****3 men arrested in Belgium charged\nwith terrorist offenses****Injured Indian flight attendant, a symbol of\nBrussels attacks, is 'out of danger,' family says****Extremist cell behind\nattacks in Brussels and Paris is being 'annihilated'**\n\n","title":"Man arrested in deadly Brussels bombing released; death toll reaches 32 - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Three are ordered held in Belgium on terror charges https://t.co/8Gr1t7MpBf","date":"Mon Mar 28 09:41:45 +0000 2016","favs":13,"id":{"$numberLong":"714386989970296832"},"retweets":21},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1RETiH3"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc68b"},"content":"The Spanish civil war, which ran from 1936 to 1939, is most notable to\nhistorians for how it foreshadowed the horrors of World War II.Yet few distant\nconflicts are so burned into our culture and consciousness.Ernest Hemingway,\nwho covered the war, made it the setting of \"For Whom the Bell Tolls,\" \"the\nbest goddamn book\" he ever wrote. George Orwell, who fought in it, called his\npopular memoir \"Homage to Catalonia.\" Pablo Picasso's \"Guernica,\" perhaps his\nmost famous painting, captures the agony of that city being bombed to rubble.\nRobert Capa's \"The Falling Soldier\" is iconic combat photography. Visitors to\nthe front included singer Paul Robeson, poet Langston Hughes and film star\nErrol Flynn.Less well known are the 2,800 American men and women who defied\nU.S. policy and risked their lives to defend Spain's democratically elected\ngovernment. Avowedly leftist, these Republican fighters received antiquated\nweapons and other supplies from Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin.Outnumbered and\noutgunned, they were defeated by Nationalist insurgents led by right wing Gen.\nFrancisco Franco. He was reinforced by modern tanks, fighter planes and troops\nfrom Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, who used Spain to test weapons and\ntactics that soon would devastate Europe.Author Adam HoschildAuthor Adam\nHoschildBattling isolationists at home, President Franklin D. Roosevelt\ncarefully kept America neutral. But his refusal to allow arms sales to the\nembattled Republicans helped seal their fate.The tragic story of the Americans\nin the doomed Lincoln Brigade — who bore some of the toughest fighting and\nheaviest casualties of any unit — comes vividly to life in Adam Hochschild's\ncompelling \"Spain in Our Hearts,\" a long-overdue book that explores this long-\noverlooked conflict.Hochschild cautions he hasn't written a history of the war\nor even of the Lincoln Brigade. He instead focuses on a handful of Americans\nto tell the larger story of why Spain loomed so large at the time.Mining\nletters, unpublished memoirs and other archives, Hochschild recounts how\nAmericans like Bob and Marion Merriman, graduate students from Berkeley, were\ndrawn to what they considered a utopian society and what they rightly saw as\nthe opening round in a global battle against fascism.Tall and taciturn,\nMerriman was a rare volunteer with military training and he rose to help lead\nthe Lincolns, as they were known, in combat. Hemingway supposedly used him as\na model for Robert Jordan, the American hero in his novel.Merriman disappeared\nin April 1938 during a chaotic Republican retreat. Reports suggest he was\ncaptured and executed by Nationalists. He was one of about 800 Americans who\ndied in Spain.Like most of them, the Merrimans were communists, an ideology\nthat lured many Americans in the turmoil of the Depression. If their politics\nhave failed the test of time, the actions of the Lincolns — and an estimated\n35,000 other foreign fighters — have endured. They went to war against Hitler\nwhile Europe's leaders sought to appease him.\"There seemed a moral clarity\nabout the crisis in Spain,\" Hochschild writes. \"Rapidly advancing fascism\ncried out for defiance; if not here, where?\"(The last surviving Lincoln,\nDelmer Berg, died last month in Columbia, Calif., age 100. He remained an\n\"unreconstructed Communist\" all his life, according to his obituary.)Many\nLincolns shared idealism verging on naivete. Once they had hiked across the\nsnowy Pyrenees from France, they often marched to war without uniforms, maps\nor modern weapons.Lois Orr, who went to Republican-held Barcelona from\nKentucky with her husband, Charles, in 1936, exalted in a letter home that she\nwas \"living the revolution\" in a workers' paradise where \"anything was\npossible, a new heaven and a new earth were being formed.\"Yet she didn't speak\nSpanish, barely acknowledged the privations around her, and was given a\nluxurious apartment, confiscated from the German consul, that most Spaniards\ncould never hope to attain.The Americans came from nearly every state and all\nwalks of life: professors and union organizers, coal miners and a former\ngovernor of Ohio. About 90 were African American. About a third came from New\nYork. Close to half were Jewish.Moral panics about female sexuality seem\nnearly old as humanity itself: Eve, the original victim of slut-shaming.

They opened all\nthe prisons in the areas they controlled, releasing violent criminals as well\nas political prisoners.Hochschild, thankfully, recounts a leader who died in\nthe battle for Madrid after \"murmuring the anarchist lament, 'Too many\ncommittees!'\"Some Americans had their passports seized when they got home or\nwere targeted in the anti-communist witch hunts of the 1950s despite fighting\nhonorably in World War II. Some played key roles in the civil rights and anti-\nwar movements of the 1960s.The heartbreak is what lingers longest in \"Spain in\nOur Hearts.\"The title comes from Albert Camus.

You spend your evenings cooling the burn of\nlip-scalding wings with frosty mugs of Hite, while bobbing your head to\nblaring K-pop in crowded dining rooms. By the third round of beer, you should\nbe ready to sing Bang Bang Bang by Bigbang at post-dinner karaoke.When you're\ncraving this experience in L.A., you head to the general vicinity of\nKoreatown. You might not think to go to Arcadia, the small suburb just east of\nPasadena in the San Gabriel Valley, known for Santa Anita Park, the 82-year-\nold race track, and the Westfield Santa Anita mall.Aldo and Nami Nakaganeku\nare trying to change that. The married couple opened Hot n Sweet chicken, a\nrestaurant on a sleepy stretch of Huntington Drive that includes a driving\nschool, a healcare supply store and a funeral home, in 2013.Customers Patrick\nRegan, right, his brother Phin Regan and Phin's wife, Connie, eat at Hot n\nSweet Chicken, where K-pop videos play and Hite is on tap.Customers Patrick\nRegan, right, his brother Phin Regan and Phin's wife, Connie, eat at Hot n\nSweet Chicken, where K-pop videos play and Hite is on tap.\"There are really no\nKorean fried chicken places here like in Koreatown,\" says Aldo. He is sitting\nnext to his wife at a table in his restaurant. Kara's Mamma Mia K-pop music\nvideo plays on a T.V. behind him. \"We wanted to bring the K-town experience to\nthis part of town,\" Aldo says. \"One day, we'd like to expand and bring the\nexperience all along the 210 freeway.\"Nami, born in South Korea, and Aldo, who\nis Japanese but was born in Argentina (he once worked as a cook and sushi chef\nat a restaurant in Anchorage, Alaska), decided to open the type of restaurant\nyou'd find somewhere in between Wilshire Boulevard and Sixth Street in Los\nAngeles. Or in Seoul.\"In Korea, people eat wings like a snack, and most people\neat them with beer,\" says Aldo. \"Thousands of people offer wings. It's like\nStarbuck's here.\"They've outfitted the restaurant with everything you'd crave\nfrom an outing in Koreatown, minus the drunk karaoke. There's Hite on tap,\nsoju, Bigbang and Girl's Generation music videos on the TVs, and — most\nimportantly — there's KFC .Most of Nami's experience in the kitchen came from\ndecades of cooking for her family in South Korea and in the U.S. She and her\nhusband developed the restaurant's wing recipe after eating fried chicken in\nKorea, Singapore, Japan, Argentina, Brazil and, of all places, Canada (every\nplace they traveled, they'd be sure to try the fried chicken). Then they spent\nfive years experimenting and perfecting the wings they now serve at the\nrestaurant.Nami's wings are not the thick-coated, ultra crisp, completely\nsauce-smothered wings you'll find at OB Bear, a Koreatown site of pilgramage\nfor those who love wings. They're also not the wings you'll find at Kyochon,\nwhich taste a bit like they've been coated in breakfast rice cereal. Rather,\nthe wings at Hot n Sweet fall somewhere in between. The coating is crisp and\ngolden, light in texture, and when you take a bite, it shatters, then melts on\nyour tongue. That crisp, airy quality is similar to what you'd get if you\ndipped a wing in tempura batter — much lighter than the coating on the double-\nfried KFC you can find all over Koreatown. This distinct texture is achieved\nthrough Nami's recipe — she uses a mix of cornstarch and flour in the batter —\nand the way she fries the chicken.It's a recent evening in their restaurant,\nand Nami is wearing a fuschia turtleneck, pink arm warmers, a black apron and\nher hair tied neatly back with a black velvet bow. She stands over a large\nfryer in her kitchen, dropping battered chicken wings into the fryer. The oil\nis light in color, due to her switching it out almost every day after\nservice.She uses a gloved hand to drop each wing, one by one, into the fryer.\n(Aldo estimates that Nami makes and coats about 1,200 wings a week.) On\ncontact, the oil seethes around the chicken. Wielding a large slotted utensil,\nshe pushes the chicken back and forth, continuously moving it around the\nbubbling pool. After about five minutes, she takes what looks like a giant\nknitting needle and punctures each piece, once or twice in the oil. \"This so\nchicken is done,\" says Nami. She doesn't use a timer. She moves the pieces\naround, lifts them out of the oil to check the color, then, about five minutes\nlater, declares the wings cooked and ready for saucing.Aldo, right, and Nami\nNakaganeku opened Hot n Sweet in 2013.

They\nspent years developing their recipe. Nami then coats the chicken in a bright,\nsalty soy garlic sauce — it's made with a heady mixture of 15 ingredients,\nincluding sake and garlic. The sauce is thinner than a glaze, with a hint of\nginger and that distinct sweetness that comes from sake or mirin. (You can eat\na dozen without much effort.) And if soy garlic sauce seems a little too tame\nfor you, Nami also has four other sauces, labeled one to four in order of heat\nlevel. One is mild enough to keep a chile head satisfied without getting\nteary-eyed — four is hot enough to stun someone who's had a few too many Hites\ninto a state that faintly resembles sobriety.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc68f"},"content":"A deal that would raise California's minimum wage to $15 an hour was met with\na mixture of joy and anxiety across the state Sunday.Some workers and labor\nofficials hailed it as a breakthrough in providing higher-wage jobs in fields\nwhere it's a struggle to make ends meet. But some business owners feared the\nshift would hurt their bottom lines -- and perhaps even put them out of\nbusiness.The debate is likely a preview for the weeks ahead as the minimum\nwage proposal works its way through Sacramento.Selwyn Yosslowitz said that\nminimum wage hikes add increased pressure to restaurants, which already\noperate on very slim margins. With the minimum wage going up, Yosslowitz said\nhe's going to have to rethink his menu and what dishes his restaurants\nserve.\"First, you have to raise prices, otherwise you'll be out of business,\"\nsaid Yosslowitz, president of the Marmalade Café, which operates seven\nSouthland restaurants and an outlet at LAX. Restaurant owners also have to\nthink about \"re-engineering the menu\" to require fewer kitchen workers.\"We\nwill try to re-engineer the labor force,\" he said. \"Maybe try to reduce the\nnumber of bus boys and ask servers to bus tables.\"**SIGN UP for the free\nEssential Politics newsletter \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**His comments came a day after\nlawmakers and labor unions  struck a tentative deal to raise the statewide\nminimum wage to $10.50 an hour next year and then gradually to $15, averting a\ncostly political campaign this fall and possibly putting California at the\nforefront of a national movement.The deal was confirmed Saturday afternoon by\nsources close to the negotiations who would speak only on condition of\nanonymity until Gov. Jerry Brown makes a formal announcement as early as\nMonday.Lawmakers and labor unions have struck a tentative deal to raise the\nstatewide minimum wage to $10.50 an hour next year and then gradually to $15,\naverting a costly political campaign this fall and possibly putting California\nat the forefront of a national movement.The deal was confirmed\nSaturday...Lawmakers and labor unions have struck a tentative deal to raise\nthe statewide minimum wage to $10.50 an hour next year and then gradually to\n$15, averting a costly political campaign this fall and possibly putting\nCalifornia at the forefront of a national movement.The deal was confirmed\nSaturday...The minimum wage compromise ends a long debate between the\nDemocratic governor and some of the state's most powerful labor unions. For\nBrown, it's political pragmatism; numerous statewide polls have suggested\nvoters would approve a minimum wage proposal — perhaps even a more sweeping\nversion — if given the chance.According to a document obtained by The Times,\nthe negotiated deal would boost California's statewide minimum wage from $10\nan hour to $10.50 on Jan. 1, 2017, with a 50-cent increase in 2018 and then $1\n-per-year increases through 2022. Businesses with fewer than 25 employees\nwould have an extra year to comply, delaying their workers receiving a $15\nhourly wage until 2023.Future statewide minimum wage increases would be linked\nto inflation, but a governor would have the power to temporarily block some of\nthe initial increases in the event of an economic downturn.Los Angeles County\nand city have already approved similar minimum wage increases. Yosslowitz said\nhe supports a fair wage, but his biggest bone of contention is that minimum\nwage legislation doesn't take into account that servers can make many times\ntheir hourly pay in tips. He said some of his servers can make $25 to $35 an\nhour in tips alone.\"So you are paying $15 an hour to someone who is already\nmaking $25, $30 an hour,\" he said. \"The problem we have is that they don't\ntake into consideration the total compensation our service staff are already\nmaking.\"The other big worry: that employees already making $15 an hour, before\nthe hike, will demand a raise as well, Yosslowitz said.\"It's a chain\nreaction,\" he said.At Tortilleria San Marcos in Boyle Heights, Sandra Carrera,\n38, welcomed the news.She said she’s been working part-time at the market for\nthe past 16 years and also operates a party supply business from her home to\nmake ends meet. Her combined income helps cover her $800 a month rent and\nanother $250 in bills.“You can’t live off minimum wage anymore,” she said.\n“You have to have two jobs to take care of your responsibilities.”Carrera\nhopes the minimum wage hike means that she will not always have to depend on\nher side business.“It’s great that they're raising the minimum wage,” she\nsaid. “It’s better than having to have two jobs.”Making tortillas in the back,\nMiguel Sanchez, 43, of Highland Park, also a part-time worker, said he was\nhappy to hear a statewide deal had been reached.\"Life is going to get a little\neasier,\" said Sanchez, who works at another tortilla market at least twice a\nweek. \"It's good for workers, but I imagine this is not going to be good news\nfor employers and small businesses.\"He said his second job supplements the\n$1,600 he earns each month from Tortilleria San Marcos. But with a $1,000\nmonth rent and nearly $300 in bills, he said he's left with very little for\nfood and other expenses.He said he's the only one in the family working at the\nmoment. He has a wife and two girls, ages 14 and 7. He said he began working\nhis second job three years ago.Although he welcomes the extra money, he said\nthat raising the minimum wage also concerns him.\"Will the cost of things go\nup?” he said. “Are employers going to cut back hours because they can't afford\nit? I worry.\"For more about the California wage plan, click\nhere.**ALSO****Donald Trump leads in California primary race but threatens a\nGOP fracture****Slaying of British tourist in San Francisco brings shock,\noutrage****Valley councilwoman's aides sought $5 and $10 donations that are\nfocus of U.S. inquiry**\n\n","title":"Minimum wage hikes put pressure on businesses to 're-engineer labor force,' a restaurateur says - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Some restaurants face pressure to trim menus and staffs under California's wage hike https://t.co/fxbStwcglY https://t.co/XezqUIbRyZ","date":"Mon Mar 28 06:55:06 +0000 2016","favs":61,"id":{"$numberLong":"714345052101849088"},"retweets":99},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1RyG1Tp"}

Meanwhile, DEFY Media is searching for at least 20,000 square feet of\nnew studio space in the L.A. area to accommodate its popular online channels\nsuch as Smosh.The upswing in production comes as Americans are expected to\ndouble their daily digital video consumption compared with four years ago to\nan hour and eight minutes, according to eMarketer.It's also mirroring a\nrevival of local TV production thanks to tax incentives introduced in\nCalifornia two years ago. Those tax breaks were aimed at reversing years of\ndecline in film and TV production that was lured away to cheaper\nlocales.Already, streaming video productions are surging this year. Amazon,\nHulu and Netflix were working on 16 scripted shows in February alone,\naccording to FilmL.A. Inc., the nonprofit group that handles film permits for\nthe city and county.That's up from just four scripted shows all of last TV\nseason, which starts in the fall and ends in the spring.Web-based TV, like the\nshorts you see from YouTube or BuzzFeed, have also seen a significant rise.\nFilmL.A. Inc. counted 1,449 shooting permits for the category in 2015,\ncompared with 641 in 2011.The boost in digital production has heightened\ncompetition for studio space, which is mostly limited to about a dozen major\nindependently owned properties, though big-name studios like Paramount still\nmake their facilities available for lease.Hudson Pacific says occupancy rates\nfor its office and soundstage space are near an all-time high at about 80%.The\ncompany, which also owns the nearby Sunset Gower Studios (the former Columbia\nPictures lot), is turning away four to six inquiries a week for its\nsoundstages.\"There's not enough stages in town,\" said Bill Humphrey, general\nmanager of Sunset Bronson and Sunset Gower studios. \"You've got to serve the\ntraditional networks, then the cable networks and now Hulu, YouTube, Amazon\nand Netflix on top.\"The company has grown its staff by about one-fifth to 50\nto accommodate the increased workload the last three years. It spent more than\n$240 million on capital improvements on the two studio lots since 2010,\nincluding the Netflix tower.Once Netflix starts its 10-year lease, it will\nhave access to soundstages at both Sunset Bronson and Sunset Gower, which are\ncurrently cranking out popular TV shows such as ABC's \"Scandal\" and HBO's\n\"Togetherness.\"**\\------------****FOR THE RECORD**An earlier version of this\nstory incorrectly identified the company that creates \"Marco Polo.\" It is a\nNetflix show.**\\------------**Writers for Amazon's orignal programming also\ntake up office space at Sunset Gower, a 15.6-acre property that's home to ad\nagencies, Technicolor Inc.'s digital production facilities and the United\nRecording Studios, which has played host to the Rat Pack, Michael Jackson and\nthe \"We Are the World\" video.That mix of digital media is being replicated\nthroughout Hollywood, no more dramatically than across the street from the\nSunset Gower Studios at Columbia Square.The $420-million office, residential\nand retail complex will serve as Viacom Inc.'s new West Coast headquarters.\nThe property owners hope that Viacom, which owns MTV, Comedy Central and BET,\nwill attract more entertainment workers to the area.Whether that includes big\ntech companies looking to produce original content remains to be seen.\nFacebook had inquired about leasing a studio in Hollywood, according to real\nestate sources (Facebook declined to comment).One major addition, BuzzFeed\nMotion Pictures, has been in the neighborhood for two years, most recently at\nSiren Studios.The boxy building on Sunset Boulevard struggled to attract its\nbread-and-butter commercial shoots during the worst of the filming exodus. For\nthe productions that remained in L.A., Siren was often overlooked.\"We weren't\ngetting the first call,\" said Dean Gavoni, the studio's chief executive.\n\"We're not Paramount or Warner.\"That resulted in some soul searching and a new\nstrategy. Gavoni decided that Siren needed to be more forward-thinking. He was\namazed at how his young daughter and her friends consumed almost all their\nvideo on their smartphones and tablets.So when BuzzFeed approached Siren about\na lease, Gavoni was wary but willing to take a chance.\"It doesn't take a\ngenius to figure out this is the next wave,\" he said.If BuzzFeed and its fast\nand cheap style of production is indeed the future of digital entertainment,\nthen other independent studios may need to adjust.Unlike some of its\ncompetitors, Siren isn't a union facility, which makes it more attractive to\nWeb-only producers on smaller budgets.Siren also doesn't require that BuzzFeed\nuse any of its services such as renting production equipment. By comparison,\nabout one-third of Hudson Pacific's revenue is from ancillary services like\nlighting, telecommunications and catering.And while Siren has embraced\nBuzzFeed's young culture, others have raised eyebrows at millennial-minded\ncompanies with their workplace happy hours, ping-pong matches and inability to\nkeep their cool when a big star is seen working next door.\"I think they got\nsick of us,\" Maria Gonima, head of communications at digital network\nFullscreen, said about the company's time at the century-old Culver Studios.\n\"We'd see stars like Halle Berry and all of us would get all fangirl and\nfanboy.\"That doesn't necessarily mean that the old studios will fall out of\nfavor, said Bruce Richmond, executive vice president of production at HBO,\nwhich first launched its streaming service in 2010 and has traditionally\nworked with union labor.\"For a big movie with 1,000 people, it helps to have a\ncatering service,\" he said. \"But not for a BuzzFeed crew of four. It's not a\nzero-sum game. There's always room for both types of studios.\"For Netflix, the\nchance to fit as many as 1,000 employees in an office next door to soundstages\nproved irresistible. Building an equivalent property from scratch was a non-\nstarter; it would have taken too long even if Netflix could find the available\nreal estate.\"The thought of co-locating offices with production operations was\nreally compelling,\" said Amy Dee, Netflix's director of global real estate,\nworkplace and procurement, who moved to L.A. from Los Gatos in October to\noversee the tower project.The move brings Netflix closer to the actors,\ndirectors and writers who produce their shows — an important edge for a\ncompany that's seeing its dominance challenged by Amazon, Hulu and HBO.\nMoreover, it reinforces the company's culture, which has one foot in Silicon\nValley and the other in show business.\"We wanted to be where Hollywood came to\nlife,\" Dee said. \"Even though we're a cutting-edge tech company, we take very\nseriously the history of the entertainment industry and its roots in\nHollywood.\"_david.pierson@latimes.com_**Twitter: @dhpierson****ALSO****Two\nmore deaths may be linked to contaminated medical scopes****Personal Finance\nQ\u0026amp;A: Bad boyfriend plagues grandparents' finances****How Snapchat's costly\nacquisition of bitmoji-maker Bitstrips could pay off**\n\n","title":"How Hollywood studios woo the hottest companies in video-streaming - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"How Hollywood studios woo the hottest companies in video streaming https://t.co/H0qBKqw1Yp https://t.co/YbyNES85lR","date":"Mon Mar 28 06:25:06 +0000 2016","favs":42,"id":{"$numberLong":"714337501717114880"},"retweets":29},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1VPhyfO"}

Remember that Jerry and Joe created a\ncharacter that was the biggest superhero of all. Practically the next hero\ncreated was Batman, who had no super powers.Everybody in comic books lie\npretty much in between these two characters. Now, I've done Batman and I've\ndone characters that were in between — that alpha and omega end of the scale —\nand I think it's time for me to do Superman.But I don't want to do a god. I\ndon't think you could evolve a god on a planet — it doesn't make any sense.\nYou can't fly into the sun. You can't put your hands on the side of a planet\nand move it. In fact, if you were a real Superman and you wanted to move a\nship out to sea, you couldn't do it by pushing it because your hands are only\nabout six inches long. What would happen if you pushed is that [the hands]\nwould just embed into the ship and you would pretty much fly through the ship.\nIn other sequences, Superman will fly through a ship. Why does he not fly\nthrough a ship in this sequence and fly through a ship in the next sequence?\nBecause we're really not thinking of Superman; we're thinking of a god who can\nuse his abilities at the whim of his mind.I would rather see a Superman who,\nif he's going to move a ship, he doesn't embed himself into the ship. He\nshould be a character who figures things out for himself and how he conducts\nhimself on a planet where everybody else is much, much weaker than he is. All\nof these things seems to me have been ignored in many ways, and it's just,\n'Well, we'll do a god thing.'I think that we want to believe in Superman. We\nwant him to be handsome. We want women to fall in love with him. We want him\nto go out and exercise and build up his muscles — we want to see his muscles.\nAnd we want to believe that he really cares about himself and that he makes\nhimself into what he is. He isn't just some schlub who just happens to inherit\nall of these super powers. He is a man, and he thinks like we do; it's just\nthat he has super powers.For me, Jerry Siegel and Joe Schuster's character was\nSuperman. It got a little fluffy and powdery along the way and got a little\ngodlike at the same time, and I think that we want to get back to being a man\nthat you fall in love with and you like as a buddy. ...

I don't think that should be a surprise to anybody. He is Lex Luthor.\nPhysically, he's very powerful, and he probably works out. He just can't take\noff those last 30 pounds. He's bald, and he doesn't wear a wig. I'm sorry.\nMaybe he does in some incarnations, but really he goes around bald, and he's\nOK with it.That's what he was, and that's how he should remain and we\nshouldn't be messing with him. If we do, then that makes him everybody else,\nand I don't like that.I also love Jack Kirby, and I love Jack Kirby's\ncharacters, and I love that Jack Kirby could leave Marvel Comics after\ncreating the Marvel Universe — and please excuse me folks out there, but Jack\nKirby created the Marvel Universe — and came over to DC and created \"New\nGods,\" created a new universe. Bang — out of nothing. Out of his mind.He\ncreated Darkseid, he created New Gods, he created Apokolips ... all these\ncharacters. And I'm using them. We have Orion. Metron. Steppenwolf and Mister\nMiracle. Granny Goodness and Big Barda. Desaad. Maybe I can't keep them on the\npage for that long 'cause we're only doing six issues, but I'm doing them all\nand I'm kicking butt. Because it's fun! All of that stuff is fun, and I'm\nhaving fun doing it. **And Superman's onscreen portrayal?**I saw this last\nSuperman movie, and they recycled Zod. I'm sorry, I've already seen him and\nI'd rather see Darkseid and all those characters. Why didn't they do New Gods?\nWe watched the \"Superboy\" [\"Smallville\"] television show, and they showed a\npiece of Granny Goodness and then she's gone. What happened?! I don't get it.\nI'm doing it, and I hope everyone else follows. I hope they appear in the\nmovies and I hope they remember so they can go 'Yep, Neal did it\nagain.'**There's a spotlight on diversity in the comics world **—** on the\npage and with the creators **—** that seems to be throughout entertainment in\ngeneral. Did that influence you at all, especially in the creation of a\npivotal character **—** a little boy and his dog **—** who show up in the\nMiddle East?**To a greater or lesser extent. Remember, I created the first\nblack super hero, John Stewart, who was both college-educated and had a\nprofession. He wasn't a gangbanger who suddenly got some power and turned into\na hero. He wasn't an African tribal chief — who we can all relate to. Well, I\ncan't. He is a college-educated professional man. That's the kind of character\nwe want to see, and that's what every black American I've met wants to see.\nThey don't like gangbangers, no matter what anyone says.I want to see an Arab\nkid, and I want to see a Puerto Rican adult and all this stuff happening\nbecause that's the world I live in. I understand it very differently from\nsegmented people who don't get exposed to a lot. I live in New York and\nCalifornia, and I get to travel. The next guy who comes to my booth could be\nan Arab or from South America — it's a world community now, and that's where\nwe should be dealing.I do have a certain place in this industry. People will\nlook and say, 'Hey, maybe that's a good idea.' If it brings the next Arab or\npeople from the Middle East into comics — great. If it brings in people from\nIndia — great.  People don't know that one of the most popular comic books in\nIndia is Archie comics.We're soon going to have Russia and Red China involved\nin our comic book industry.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc694"},"content":"**Dear Liz:** We have raised our granddaughter since birth. She is the apple of our eyes. Then she fell in love. The boyfriend had no job, no car. My husband co-signed a loan for this boy! He didn't even know the boy's last name. I was devastated, as we are on Social Security so our income is limited. Our granddaughter couldn't afford the payments and the boy was useless. They got so far behind that we ended up having to mortgage our home to pay off the truck. We hoped to sell it but of course the kids have broken up and the boy disappeared. When I asked the Department of Motor Vehicles what I could do to get him off the title, they said I couldn't do anything.**Answer:** Your husband is showing signs of cognitive impairment. Co-signing a loan can be (and often is) a lapse in judgment; co-signing for a virtual stranger indicates a more serious problem.A study for the Center for Retirement Research found that people's financial decision-making abilities peak in their 50s. By our 70s, our problem-solving abilities typically have declined enough to make us more vulnerable to bad decisions and fraud.That's why it's important to simplify our financial lives in retirement and to consider safeguards that can keep us from being victimized.Freezing your credit reports at the three major credit bureaus is one good option. That can keep criminals from opening accounts in your names. You would have to thaw your reports to apply for a loan or credit card, and adding that extra \"speed bump\" to the process could give you time to rethink a bad decision.If you had children you could trust, you might have your financial institutions send them duplicate statements and discuss any large purchases or investments with them. If you don't have someone you trust, a licensed fiduciary could serve a similar function. California has a Professional Fiduciaries Bureau within its Department of Consumer Affairs where you can learn more.At this point, you should check the vehicle title to see if the names are listed with an \"and\" between them or an \"or.\" If it's an \"or,\" your husband should be able to transfer title to the new owner. Otherwise, you may need to get an attorney to help you get a legal order to remove the boy's name from the title. Check with your local bar association to see if there are any pro bono or legal aid services that can help you.**Social Security divorced spousal benefits****Dear Liz:** A friend was told by Social Security that she could not collect spousal benefits on her ex-husband's work record because she did not have his Social Security number. How can I help her find it?**Answer:** Your friend may have run into a new Social Security employee, or at least one who is not well-informed. Social Security says on its website that people who qualify for divorced spousal benefits do not need their exes' Social Security number as long as they can provide enough identifying information for the agency to locate his record. She does need to have a marriage certificate and divorce decree along with her own birth certificate.To qualify for divorced spousal benefits, the marriage must have lasted 10 years and your friend must currently be unmarried.**Income tax vs. capital gains tax****Dear Liz:** I was wondering about the disabled vet who wanted to sell his home, which had increased in value by about $1 million. You mentioned that \"[S]ingle people with incomes over $415,050 in 2016 are subject to the 39.6% marginal tax rate. Most people pay capital gains tax at a 15% rate, but those in the top bracket face a 20% rate.\" Would he have to pay federal income tax on the non-exempt portion of the equity as well as paying 20% capital gains on the non-exempt portion?**Answer:** You may pay income tax or capital gains tax on a source of income, not both. If an investment has been held less than a year, the gain is considered short term and subject to income tax. Investments held more than a year are considered long-term and qualify for capital gains treatment.When you're selling your primary residence, the first $250,000 in profit is typically exempt from tax. The rest of the gain would be taxed as a capital gain._Liz Weston is a personal finance columnist for NerdWallet.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc696"},"content":"As California's End of Life Option Act takes effect in June, data from states\nwhere aid in dying is already legal raises a question: Who will use the new\nlaw? In Oregon, Washington, Montana and Vermont, experience shows that\nparticipants will be few in number, well less than 1% of those who die each\nyear. We also know, based on 18 years of data from Oregon, whose Death with\nDignity Act was the first such law in the nation, that most of them will be\nolder, white and well-educated.That puts to rest the worries many have had —\nthat masses of people, particularly the disadvantaged, will be targeted and\ncoerced into dying if physicians are allowed to prescribe a lethal dose of\nmedicine for terminal patients. But in a diverse state like California, the\ndata highlight another concern: The right to die may not be readily available\nto many and even most people.The modern aid in dying movement developed\nalongside medical advancements in the 1960s and '70s — CPR, respirators and\ndefibrillators — that made it possible to save lives that otherwise would have\nbeen lost. But those advances also posed new challenges for end-of-life\ndecision making. At the same time, some terminally ill patients found that\n“doing everything” to live put the emphasis in the wrong place: length of life\nover quality of life.Death with dignity court decisions, initiatives and\nlegislation, passed and pending, represent a consensus response to these\nconcerns. Most of the laws, including California's, closely follow the Oregon\nmodel, establishing multiple hurdles for terminally ill patients and highly\nregulating aid in dying.With some variations, the protocols look like this: To\nget a prescription for lethal drugs, patients must be adults, and they must be\ndeemed by two doctors to have six months or less to live. Patients must\nrequest a lethal prescription verbally and in writing, with a waiting period\nin between. If their mental competence is questioned, a psychiatrist must be\nconsulted. Once patients obtain a prescription, they choose when to fill it\nand when to self-administer the drugs.So far, Oregon's long-term data on “DWDA\ndeaths” provide the best profile of who uses aid in dying. From 1998 through\n2015, 991 Oregonians died from ingesting DWDA drugs. A majority were over the\nage of 65 (nearly 70%); slightly more were male (51%) than female. Most were\ndiagnosed with terminal cancer (77%). Almost all were enrolled in hospice care\n(90%) and died at home (94%).The racial and socioeconomic demographics are\nalso unequivocal: Nearly 97% of those who have exercised the right to die in\nOregon were white; 0.1% were African American (there has been just one African\nAmerican DWDA death in Oregon since 1998); 1% were Latino, 1.3% were\nAsian.There are many reasons for this whites-only skew, including Oregon's\nrelatively small minority populations. But even where the percentages are\nhigher, it's probable minorities will make use of the law in low\nnumbers.California's historic new right-to-die law, passed and signed during a\nspecial legislative session last year, won a further victory this week when\nits opponents fell far short of gathering the 365,880 signatures needed by\nMonday to put a referendum on the November ballot overturning it.\nThat's...California's historic new right-to-die law, passed and signed during\na special legislative session last year, won a further victory this week when\nits opponents fell far short of gathering the 365,880 signatures needed by\nMonday to put a referendum on the November ballot overturning it. That's...For\nstarters, minorities figure heavily among the millions of Americans with\nlittle or no access to quality healthcare, and that includes aid in dying.\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, compared to\nwhites, minorities receive worse medical care and less of it on about 40% of\nquality and access measures. Perhaps as important, for some in these\npopulations fear of not getting enough treatment at the end of life, rather\nthan too much, could be a factor.The African American community, for instance,\nis still marked by 1972 disclosures about the Tuskegee experiments, in which\ntreatment was withheld from black men who were the subjects of syphilis\nresearch. The number of African American organ donors is disproportionately\nsmaller than that of whites, and studies suggest this is largely because many\nblacks fear that doctors would rather harvest their organs than treat\nthem.Latinos (20% of the Oregon population; 40% of California's) also rarely\nuse aid in dying. This is partly explained by age: Latinos are a much younger\npopulation than whites (median age, 29, compared to 45 for whites). For\nLatinos (and African Americans), religious and cultural opposition to aid in\ndying also plays a role. Many churches, and especially the Roman Catholic\nChurch, have been vocal and influential opponents of death with dignity\nlaws.When demographics such as education level and insurance type are analyzed\nalong with race, Oregon's data tell us that it is the privileged who use aid\nin dying. They are well educated — since 1998, nearly 72% had at least some\ncollege. “The more educated you are, the more choices you have,” says Kat\nWest, director of policy and programs for Compassion and Choices, a nonprofit\norganization that advocates for aid in dying. And they have healthcare\nresources: Nearly 60% were covered at least in part by private\ninsurance.Insurance coverage may be particularly important. According to a\nNational Public Radio report, in February, the cost of a lethal dose of the\nmost commonly prescribed aid-in-dying drug — the sleeping pill Seconal — rose\nfrom $1,500 to more than $3,000. Even a less expensive drug cocktail costs\nabout $400. Insurance may cover at least some of the cost; it is up to each\nplan. State Medicaid funds are available in Oregon and California, but federal\nfunds cannot be used for aid-in-dying drugs.Given the nature of death with\ndignity laws, it isn't surprising that only a small number of people choose to\nmake use of the right to die. It's a complex process. And even among those who\nqualify for the drugs, know about the law, have access to doctors and have the\nwherewithal to pay for the prescription, there will always be many who would\nnever consider hastening their deaths.But if the premise of aid in dying is to\nprevent pain and suffering among terminal patients — something people of all\nraces and from all walks of life experience — the narrow pattern of use that\nshows up in the data should give us pause. Choice may be the primary factor\nbehind the predominance of white, privileged patients seeking and using aid in\ndying, but surely it also represents yet another measure of disparity in\nAmerican healthcare._Ann Neumann is a visiting scholar at the Center for\nReligion and Media at New York University.

Hosted by Ajay Fry, Morgan Hoffman and Teddy Wilson,\n\"After the Black\" will feature in-depth discussion about the show — including\nplot twists and theories — with \"Orphan Black’s\" cast and crew as well as\nbehind the scenes footage and the exclusive first look at the next episode.\nStars Tatiana Maslany (Sarah Manning, Cosima Niehaus, Alison Hendrix, Helena\nand more) and Kevin Hanchard (Art Bell) are the confirmed guests for the first\nepisode of \"After the Black\" to discuss the \"Orphan Black\" Season 4 premiere.\n**See more of Entertainment’s top stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**While Maslany\nherself was absent from the WonderCon event, it did not stop fans (many\ndressed as one version of Maslany or another) from filling the room to\ncapacity to see \"Orphan Black\" co-creators Graeme Manson and John Fawcett\nalong with cast members Jordan Gavaris (Felix Dawkins), Kristian Bruun (Donnie\nHendrix) and Hanchard discuss the show. The event kicked off with a never-\nbefore-seen sneak peak of, slight spoiler, a scene featuring brand-new clone\nM.K. (the one that wears a sheep mask) in the woods at night spying on a\ncouple of men in paramedic outfits burying something that looks like a body\nbag before having to flee the scene after giving her location away. New\n\"Orphan Black\" clone M.K. (Tatiana Maslany).New \"Orphan Black\" clone M.K.\n(Tatiana Maslany).While the panelists remained understandably coy in many of\nthere replies to questions involving the upcoming season (\"Orphan Black\" is a\nmystery, after all), fans were treated to some details on what they can\nexpect.What the panel revealed/confirmed:What we still don’t know: \"We really\nwanted to look back at the first season this year,\" Manson said of the\noverarching theme for Season 4. \"We wanted to go back to that moment on the\ntracks with Beth and with Sarah. Go back and go, 'What did Sarah miss? What\nelse happened there?'\"\"We also wanted to get that feel back,\" added Fawcett.\n\"That feel of Season 1. That feel of you don’t know who the bad guy is. You\ndon’t know who you’re speaking to. Sarah playing off her back foot all of the\ntime. That was kind of the goal of Season 4.\" The show first teased this theme\nduring Season 3 when it brought back Beth, the clone that started it all for\nSarah, in Sarah’s dream. This scene also served to remind fans that while\n\"Orphan Black\" is a show heavily rooted in science, it has not shied from\naddressing the relationship between science and religion.  Represented by two\nextremist groups introduced during the first season — the Neolutionists and\nthe Proletheans — science and religion were initially seen as two opposing\nforces competing to determine the future of Sarah and the remaining clones.\nThe Neolutionists were revealed to be those behind the corporations conducting\nthe clone experiments who are driven by the belief that through scientific\nknowledge and technology humans can self-direct their evolution, while the\nProletheans were those behind the killings of the various clones, believing\ntheir existence is an abomination. However, as the series progressed it was\nrevealed that the world of \"Orphan Black\" was not so black and white with\nregard to science and religion.  \"We purposely introduced it as something that\nseemed very binary with the old world character of Tomas,\" explained Manson in\na phone interview following the Season 3 finale last June. \"And then when we\nstepped through into the sort of the new world version of Proletheans, they\nhad different world view. One that created a mix of science of religion.\"\nTrailer for Season 4 of BBC America's \"Orphan Black.\"Trailer for Season 4 of\nBBC America's \"Orphan Black.\"As Season 3 infused Proletheans with science,\nviewers also saw Sarah and clone club’s journey include moments that seem to\ndefy scientific explanations. \"It’s safe to say that nexus of science and\nmetaphysics is a place we’re interested in looking at,\" said Manson. \"It adds\na human, spiritual dimension to a scientific quest. They needn’t be\nexclusive.\"Here is what Manson and Fawcett had to say in June about the show’s\nblurring of the lines between science and religion, as well as what sparked\ntheir interest in revisiting Beth and \"the beginning\" for Season 4.  **Season\n3 opened with Helena’s dream where Cosima says she’s cured because of science.\nBut at the end of Season 2, we see Cosima is affected by her own vision.\nSomething inexplicable by science. Was it always the plan to disrupt the sort\nof established status quo in this way?****Graeme Manson: **Yeah it was. John\nand I always really liked the idea of something that if not shook Cosima’s\nfoundation, it certainly began to pick at her and pique her curiosity about\nthe things that she knows she can’t answer with science, you know what I mean?\nShe’s certainly a deep enough thinker.  I don’t think Cosima is an arrogant\nscientist. I don’t think she completely believes that the scientific method is\nthe only way to get anything done. I think she’s an open person. So we wanted\nto just slowly begin that sort of quest. I think it exists in the other\nelements in the show as well. There are hints that there are aspects to Kira\nthat we’re not going to get to by examining her biology. We had our Prolethean\nleader, who was a religious man who put his faith in science as well. So\noverall we’re saying, I guess, that science and religion — or spiritually, or\nmetaphysics — that they’ve always been crossbred. **John Fawcett:** I think\nalso at the end of Season 2, Cosima had not just a vision but an experience.\nShe experienced something and Kira was a part of that, whatever it was that\nhappened — a vision, a near-death experience — whatever it was. Kira was a\nvery strong part of that and was there when that occurred, and I think that\nCosima is, at the beginning of Season 3, is a bit shook from it. Even though\nshe is an open person, she is someone who has come up in science. Like this is\nhow you explain things. These are the answers for A plus B equals C. And so to\nkind of throw her a little bit of a curveball and go, \"Hey, there’s more going\non here than just science\" I think is interesting because she’s someone who is\nabout the mathematical equation to some degree. So it’s interesting to see\nthis character start to think that maybe the way to healing might not entirely\nbe scientific. **Speaking of not scientifically explained, what about\nrevisiting Beth as a vision in Season 3 was appealing?  ****Fawcett**: Where\ndid that start, Graeme? Where did that conversation begin?**Manson**: I think\nthe conversation really began with, we still had a lot of questions about\nBeth. We would still talk about Beth a lot. She kicked off our series, and yet\nwe don’t know her. There’s a mystery there.  We started to discuss Sarah\ncarrying this around, and as Sarah grew through her journey and became more\nmature and more responsible we kept asking ourselves: What would she do if she\ncould be face to face with Beth now?It’s not like she could come back from the\ndead. So we were looking for ways to just put ourselves in that position in\nSarah’s mind. To look at that guilt a little bit. And to go back to the front\nof that and to seed the front of the show again. Because the beginning is\nsomewhere we’re interested in going next season. **Fawcett**: It’s not a Beth\nghost scene. It’s not like Obi-Wan returning to Luke Skywalker as a ghost.\nIt’s really a Beth hallucination.**Manson**: It’s Sarah’s view of who Beth\nmight be.**Fawcett**: It’s a Beth hallucination born out of Sarah’s guilt,\nprobably, to some degree. Don’t you think? Her guilt or her obsession.\n**Manson**: Yeah.**Fawcett**: So it was interesting working through that.\nBecause it was very cool to put the character in a situation where she was\nactually asking questions of a dead character. It was a really interesting new\nplace for the show to go. It’s something that we weren’t, as creators of the\nshow, entirely certain about. We wanted to do it. We weren’t really sure how\nto do it. It took a long time to figure out how to seed it, how to play it\nout, how to allow it to feel a part of the show rather than something that\nfelt random, I guess. So hopefully we seeded in and embedded it properly.\n**Manson**: And again it’s along the lines of what we’re talking about. Like\nthere is with twin sisters, there’s a bond between the [clone] sisters, and\nit’s not something that can be explained by science. It’s this empathetic\ntract. It’s the human element of connection that science can’t touch.\n**Fawcett**: I think that’s a good way of putting it too. And it’s interesting\ntoo that it’s somehow also, in those moments, a little bit connected to\nKira.**We’ve talked about Kira. Even back in the first season she has her\nmiracle moment when she survives getting hit by the car. Do you plan on\nfurther exploring this aspect of Kira? Does Kira have superpowers?\n****Fawcett**: Kira has always been an important aspect of the show for Graeme\nand I, and there is sort of bigger, sort of critical story questions about\nKira’s biology and what she’s capable of. I would never say superhero exactly.\nBut there are those things that you can’t quite explain. Whether it has to do\nwith her biology or whether it has to do with something less tangible. All\nquestion that we need and want to continue to blur. They’re important to the\nbigger picture. **Manson**: The intangible is that human quality too. That is\na bit ephemeral. It’s how you put your finger on something like empathy, or\nsomething like that, you know what I mean? And also, these are epigenetic\nquestions. These are questions you can take back to nature-nurture.  Was it\nbiology or was it the way that she was raised? Is it the fact that she’s the\ndaughter of a clone who was supposed to be infertile, and how will science\never identify that? **Another sort of non-scientific element from Season 3 was\nHelena’s scorpion friend. How far back did you conceive of that? ****Manson**:\nWell, it was one of those things that John brought up really early and sounded\ndumb at the time, but then it was a talking scorpion and then we started\nlaughing about it. And we grew to think \"this is perfect.\" But spirit animal\nwas what John was striving at from the beginning. It was an early idea for the\nseason. Not long ago but for the season for sure. **Fawcett**: Yeah. It did\ncome along with the season, but we really quickly kind of realized that it\nfactored into Helena’s character. This wasn’t the first time the scorpion’s\nbeen around. The scorpion has been around with her in the past. It kind of\nfactored into her back story and was kind of like her spirit animal or\nintuition. It was kind of just a fun way to represent the demon in Helena’s\nhead, or the angel on her shoulder, or her bad golem or whatever you want to\ncall it. It just seemed like a fun thing to do. **Is the scorpion among the\ncasualties of Season 3 or will she be coming back?****Fawcett**: Well, I don’t\nknow how you kill an imaginary scorpion.**Manson**: I think she’s probably\neaten the scorpion before. **Fawcett**: I think that this is not the first\ntime the scorpion has been consumed by Helena. I think it’s probably like the\nthird time. So that scorpion can appear at any moment. **Will you be exploring\nany connection between Kira and Charlotte in the future?****Fawcett**: It’s\ncertainly something that we’ve talked about a lot. I think Graeme and I have a\nlot of interest in connecting those two. And so that’s certainly something\nthat we consider and think about a lot. We love the idea. I don’t know that we\nwould say one way or the other but we like the idea. **Season 3 ended on a\nvery biotech, science-heavy note. Is the show headed back to explore more\nscience in Season 4 or will there be more explorations of the\nspiritual/metaphysical aspects as well?****Manson**: I just think it’s a\nparallel theme — maybe it doesn’t need to be heavily dramatized, but it’s a\ncounter to the science, I think, that humanizes and shows the other side to\nthe dilemmas and the questions about their biology, their existence their\nownership and all of those things._This interview was edited for content and\nclarity._**Twitter: @tracycbrown**\n\n","title":"'Orphan Black' co-creators discuss going back to the beginning for Season 4 - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"\"Orphan Black\" co-creators discuss going back to the beginning for Season 4 https://t.co/GhuJ1FhD4W","date":"Mon Mar 28 03:00:22 +0000 2016","favs":22,"id":{"$numberLong":"714285975875297280"},"retweets":10},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1XWJLQo"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc698"},"content":"The United States is expanding.That was not among the goals when the Elwha\nRiver was set free. With the removal of two concrete dams that blocked the\nriver for a century, the Elwha has released a wave of sand that has pushed the\nshoreline here north toward Canada.Acres of new land stand between surfers and\nthe chilly shore break. Eagles feed in a growing estuary at the mouth of the\nriver. Families and their dogs stroll where not long ago they would have been\nsubmerged in the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Across the water, Vancouver Island is\nnot quite as far away as it used to be.\"You can see it a little bit better\nnow,\" said Andy Ritchie, a hydrologist with Olympic National Park here on\nWashington's Olympic Peninsula.**NEWSLETTER: Get the day's top headlines from\nTimes Editor Davan Maharaj \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**When the largest dam-removal project in\nAmerican history — and maybe world history — began here nearly five years ago,\nthe principal beneficiaries were expected to be the salmon that would once\nagain be able to spawn in the Elwha's headwaters. That is proving true, with\nmore fish and wildlife filling the river and surrounding forest.But along the\nway, a beach was born, too.\"See all that?\" asked Dan Callahan, a 34-year-old\nsurfer, as he pointed to the wide ribbons of sand that have formed where the\nElwha meets the strait. \"Wasn't there before. Used to be nothing but rocks.\nWhen you were surfing, you'd hit rocks. Now you hit sand.\"California, Oregon\nand the federal government are working on a way around congressional barriers\nto the removal of hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River.The states, the U.S.\nInterior Department and the owner of the dams, PacifiCorp, announced Tuesday\nthat they have agreed in principle to pursue...California, Oregon and the\nfederal government are working on a way around congressional barriers to the\nremoval of hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River.The states, the U.S.\nInterior Department and the owner of the dams, PacifiCorp, announced Tuesday\nthat they have agreed in principle to pursue...A century's worth of sediment —\nabout 21 million cubic feet — was trapped behind the two dams that blocked the\nriver. One, Elwha Dam, was just five miles from its mouth. The other, Glines\nCanyon, was further up the 45-mile stream and more than 200 feet tall.Built in\nthe early 1900s, the two dams once were viewed as essential to the growing\npopulation of the peninsula's northern coast. But over time, the relatively\nmodest amount of electricity they produced — enough to power about 14,000\nhomes — no longer seemed to justify the cost of maintaining them. And unlike\nmany other dams in the region, they provided no way for fish to pass, blocking\none of the nation's richest historical salmon runs.The push to remove the dams\ngathered momentum in the 1980s, and in 1992, Congress passed the Elwha River\nEcosystem and Fisheries Restoration Act, allowing for their removal. Two\ndecades passed before stimulus funds approved under President Obama helped pay\nthe $325-million cost.Since removal began in 2011, Ritchie said, nearly 60% of\nthe sediment behind the dams has made its way down the river, most of it in\nthe fall of 2013, about a year before the last pieces of concrete were hauled\naway. Nearly a third of that has settled at the mouth, instantly reversing a\nlong-standing pattern of erosion on the coastline.It may be Washington's\nnewest beach. Or maybe it was only misplaced. For a century. Behind the\ndams.That, Ritchie said, made for \"a pent-up beach.\"But nothing about the\nElwha is pent-up any longer.The flow of sediment is smaller now and much of\nthe sediment remains in the riverbed, raising the water level. Scientists\npredicted that would happen. They also predicted that they would not be able\nto predict everything.In November, the river rushed past its banks in a big\nstorm, washing out a crucial road inside the park and two campgrounds that\nprobably will not be rebuilt.Until the road is repaired — a temporary fix is\nexpected by this summer — reaching a new overlook that the park built at the\nsite of the former Glines Canyon Dam requires hiking or bicycling at least six\nmiles each way.Thus setting the Elwha free has made it harder to reach in\nplaces, and for the National Park Service to show off one of the boldest and\nmost expensive endeavors in its 100-year history.\"We really want to get the\nroad open because we really want people to see this,\" said Barb Maynes, a\nspokeswoman for the park.But Maynes and others noted that restoring wildness —\nand accepting the consequences — was the idea from the beginning.\"It's\ndefinitely a counterpoint to the trend you see in a lot of other places,\nincluding on the peninsula,\" Ritchie said. \"It's nice to see that sometimes\nnature wins.\"**See more of our top stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**About 80% of\nthe river's course is in the park, but not the very last of it — not the newly\nformed beach. Where it meets the strait, the river also meets the small\ncoastal reservation of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe.The tribe, which has\nfished here for centuries, has opposed the dams since they were built. Now\nthat its eroded coast is being replenished, prompting new interest and new\nvisitors, the tribe has joined other groups that are planning to build\npermanent public access to the beach, away from the reservation, and do\nrestoration work.The effort is led by the Coastal Watershed Institute, a\nnonprofit based here that recently received about $1.5 million in grants to\nhelp buy land on the east side of the river mouth to provide access and remove\nlarge rocks put in place long ago, ostensibly to protect the shore. Now\nsediment delivered by the Elwha will help do that.Anne Shaffer, the\ninstitute's executive director and lead scientist, stood on the new beach on a\nrecent weekend and recalled the many years of studying and modeling and\nimagining before the dams came down.\"We knew this was supposed to happen,\" she\nsaid. \"But seeing it was completely different.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc699"},"content":"Seven weeks before L.A.'s 2015 municipal election, political aide Caesar\nHuerta was on the hunt for campaign donations.His boss, City Councilwoman Nury\nMartinez, needed contributions from 200 of her constituents to make her\ncampaign eligible for up to $100,000 in taxpayer funds. Huerta, a field\ndeputy, turned to aunts, uncles, cousins and others in his immediate circle,\nasking for as little as $5, according to several members of his extended\nfamily.Since then, Huerta and at least eight of his relatives have been\nquestioned by FBI agents, called to appear before a federal grand jury, or\nboth, family members told The Times.**See more of our top stories on Facebook\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**\"I'm not really into politics. I was doing this to support him and\nhis cause,\" said Panorama City resident Alexandra Galarza, one of at least 18\nHuerta relatives listed in city records as Martinez donors. \"I never thought\ngiving $5 would make me go to federal court.\"Huerta, 30, is one of at least\nfive lower-level Martinez staffers who solicited and collected $5 and $10\ncontributions to the councilwoman's re-election effort, according to\ninterviews with several of her constituents in the San Fernando Valley. Those\nsmall contributions, part of a federal grand jury investigation, were a major\nfactor in Martinez's success in collecting $65,360 in taxpayer \"matching\nfunds\" for her campaign.Ethics experts say it's not uncommon for elected\nofficials to have their own in-house political staff volunteering on their re-\nelection campaigns. Such efforts are generally allowed under city and state\nlaw if they are conducted outside an employee's regular work hours, such as\nweekends or during vacation time.But those politicians can run into trouble if\ninvestigators determine that their staff used government resources — work\ntime, computers or other taxpayer-funded equipment — to engage in campaign\nactivities.\"Obviously, if there were campaign violations, and those were done\nby a city staffer, that looks worse because it's [the councilwoman's]\nprofessional staff,\" said attorney Gary Winuk, who previously handled\nenforcement duties for the state's Fair Political Practices Commission.The\ntarget of the federal investigation into San Fernando Valley campaign\nactivities remains unclear.Huerta, a resident of Arleta, had no comment when\ncontacted by The Times, and Martinez declined to discuss the grand jury's\nefforts. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office also had no comment.In\nApril, an aide to U.S. Rep. Tony Cardenas (D-Los Angeles) — who backed\nMartinez in her 2013 and 2015 campaigns — disclosed she had received a\nsubpoena to appear before the grand jury. Six months later, a Martinez\ncampaign spokesman confirmed that several of the councilwoman's aides had been\ncalled before the grand jury to answer questions about her re-election bid.\nAnd in recent months, Martinez's constituents — in interviews with The Times —\nhave identified at least 19 people who went to the grand jury and were listed\nas giving Martinez contributions of $5 or $10.Some of those people say they\ntold investigators that they never gave those small donations, even though\nthey were listed in city records as having done so. \"When I go to the [grand]\njury, I tell them I don't have extra money to support somebody else,\" said\nCiro Catalan, a resident of Arleta.Catalan said neither he nor three other\nrelatives — a sister, a brother-in-law and a cousin — gave to Martinez's re-\nelection bid. Yet all four are listed as $5 donors in paperwork submitted by\nMartinez to the city's Ethics Commission. He also said his wife did give\n$5.Federal law enforcement agencies have the power to investigate fraud of\nmore than $5,000 in cities that receive federal funds. In addition, the Los\nAngeles City Charter bars campaign donors from giving on behalf of another\nperson without that person's knowledge and participation.Nearly a fifth of the\nmoney raised by Martinez for her 2015 re-election campaign came from matching\nfunds, according to Ethics Commission records. If FBI agents suspect that\nMartinez used fraudulent donor information to obtain taxpayer money, they\nwould be more likely to pursue the people who were in charge — not junior\npolitical aides, said attorney Joseph Akrotirianakis, a former prosecutor in\nthe U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles.\"It is unlikely the FBI is targeting\na low-level staffer,\" he added.Last fall, a campaign spokesman said Martinez\n\"understands from the U.S. attorney\" that she is not a target.Last year was\nthe first election cycle in L.A. in which, under a newly approved ethics law,\ncouncil candidates had to obtain contributions from at least 200 residents in\ntheir respective districts in order to receive taxpayer funds. Donations as\nsmall as $5 were allowed and, under the city's rules, any contribution up to\n$30 could be made in cash.Panorama City resident Brian Bautista said he gave\n$5 to Martinez's campaign in response to a request from his brother's\ngirlfriend, who works as an aide to the councilwoman. The aide, whom he\ndeclined to name, went to the family's home and collected four $5\ncontributions, he said.\"I think someone had a 20 and we just split it up,\" he\nsaid.Bautista said that several months later, he and three family members were\nsummoned to appear before the grand jury. During questioning, he said,\nprosecutors asked whether he had personally signed a donation form. The 27\n-year-old bus driver said he told the grand jury that the Martinez staffer\nfilled out the form but that he had signed it himself.Gary Villagonzalo, who\nalso lives in Panorama City, said he and three other family members also went\nto the grand jury to answer questions about Martinez's donor list.\nVillagonzalo said his daughter, without his knowledge, had listed himself, his\nwife and another family member as $10 donors to the councilwoman's\ncampaign.Villagonzalo said his daughter, a college student, did so after being\napproached for donations by Martinez staffer Guillermo Marquez.Marquez, who\nworks in Martinez's Van Nuys office, hung up the phone when reached by The\nTimes.Martinez's district stretches from Lake Balboa to Sun Valley. First\nelected to the council in 2013, she has been outspoken about the need for a\nmatching fund system, talking up its significance in L.A. in a video. In a\nsix-minute spot produced by the campaign finance watchdog organization\nCalifornia Common Cause, she said those taxpayer funds provide candidates who\naren't part of the political establishment \"a shot at running for office and\nwinning.\"\"You're going to need money to be able to communicate with voters,\"\nMartinez said in the video. \"It's impossible to zigzag across your district.\nThere's almost 300,000 people I represent in my district.\"Kathay Feng, the top\nexecutive at California Common Cause, said it's possible that some of\nMartinez's donors denied that they gave small contributions out of an\nincorrect belief that donating might get them in trouble with federal\nauthorities. Such behavior would not be unusual in heavily immigrant\nneighborhoods, such as the ones represented by Martinez, where residents are\nunfamiliar with campaign finance laws, Feng said.It's also possible, Feng\nsaid, that either Martinez's staffers or her donors cut corners while\ngathering the small contributions that qualified her for matching funds.\"When\nI look at Nury's organization, I have a hard time believing her office would\nproactively try to game the system,\" she added. \"It feels like there may have\nbeen inadvertent mistakes because of an inexperienced and relatively excited\ngroup\" of contributors or entry-level staffers.After The Times interviewed\nFeng, the Common Cause video was replaced with a shorter version that did not\nfeature Martinez._David.zahniser@latimes.com_**Twitter:\n@davidzahniser****ALSO****'It's not supposed to be this way': Why it's getting\nmore difficult for foster families****Donald Trump leads in California primary\nrace but threatens a GOP fracture****Deal reached to boost California's\nminimum wage to $15, avoiding ballot box battle**\n\n","title":"Valley councilwoman's aides sought $5 and $10 donations that are focus of U.S. inquiry - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Valley councilwoman's aides sought $5 and $10 donations that are focus of U.S. inquiry https://t.co/MiNtRHXhp6 https://t.co/sX5GdQRg0a","date":"Mon Mar 28 02:30:12 +0000 2016","favs":13,"id":{"$numberLong":"714278384138895360"},"retweets":18},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1Rv7fbx"}

The anticipation for the\nreturn of this animated series was high, especially since very little was\nknown about the secretive Netflix series \"Voltron: Legendary Defender,\" until\nnow.The crowd of elated fans was treated to never-before-seen footage from\nDreamWorks Animation. And as the lights went out the madness froze. Clearly\nthe world is ready for the return of the gigantic cat-hand robot. \"Voltron:\nLegendary Defender\" still.\"Voltron: Legendary Defender\" still.For the\nuninitiated, \"Voltron\" was a hit anime program created by Peter Keefe and John\nTeichmann in 1984. In it, a team of five young pilots command five robot lions\nthat can be combined to form Voltron -- a giant, sword-wielding robot. That's\nright, robot lions turn into a gigantic robot. The animated series comes with\na built-in fan base and a lot of history. And the new Netflix series will no\ndoubt only add to the fan fervor as it's being helmed by the folks from\n\"Legend of Korra,\" another cult-loved animated property. After the surprise\nfootage the panelists took the stage. \"Legend of Korra\" alum Joaquim Dos\nSantos, now executive producer of \"Voltron,\" co-executive producer Lauren\nMontgomery and writer Tim Hedrick were joined by members of the cast, which we\ncan finally confirm. The voices of the new team Voltron actors are:Sadly,\n\"Walking Dead\" actor Steven Yeun couldn't be at the panel, but he sent a\nspecial greeting to the WonderCon crowd.Interspersed between tales of fun\nvoiceover moments and cast interactions -- many having to do with the comedic\nstylings of New Zealander Darby -- more clips were shown. One clip revealed\nthe first robot lion to be introduced to the group (Lance's blue lion) and\nanother included a battle with a Robeast. But more importantly the footage\nshowcased the style of the new \"Voltron\" series, which you can also see in the\nnew trailer below.After a few requests, the panelists yelled the catchphrase,\n\"Form Voltron!\" from the stage, igniting the crowd yet again. Questions having\nto do with an upcoming Voltron movie (there isn't one), were brushed aside. At\nthe end of the presentation about three-fourths of the room rose to its feet\nto applaud the panel. Rhys Darby, Kimberly Brooks, Tyler Labine, Josh Keaton,\nBex Taylor-Klaus, Jeremy Shada, Tim Hedrick, Lauren Montgomery and Joaquim Dos\nSantos on the \"Voltron: Legendary Defender\" WonderCon panel.Rhys Darby,\nKimberly Brooks, Tyler Labine, Josh Keaton, Bex Taylor-Klaus, Jeremy Shada,\nTim Hedrick, Lauren Montgomery and Joaquim Dos Santos on the \"Voltron:\nLegendary Defender\" WonderCon panel.The actors carried that giddiness with\nthem as they continued to answer questions afterward. Not only this was the\nfirst time they had seen a lot of the footage screened at the panel, but they\nwere also finally able to spill the beans after being sworn to secrecy about\ntheir involvement in the franchise.Labine, one of the first actors to be\nhired, waited for a long time as different casts were formed with different\nscripts and other changes. He wondered aloud, \"Is this really a thing? Are we\nreally doing 'Voltron'?\"The panel, though, was cathartic, \"It's such a\nrewarding, amazing feeling to be here today and to see it reaching people and\nseeing their reactions,\" Labine said. \"And seeing that all of that secret-\nkeeping -- which can cause cancer -- meant something to them. Because if all\nthose people had seen stuff, it wouldn't have been as cool for them. So it is\nworth it.\"When asked about their level of fandom for the show, Labine said he\nwas a fan from his childhood. \"Voltron and He-Man were it for me,\" said\nLabine. Actor Keaton agreed, adding a \"scary\" Scooby-Doo to his\ninfluences.Topics included Andrea Romano's direction, the camaraderie among\nthe cast, even when working seprately, and getting ready mentally to perform\nas an actor in a story that had been a big influence on them.\"And it's not\njust 'Voltron.' It's 'Voltron' and Netflix _and_ DreamWorks,\" said\nDarby.Brooks, who voices Princess Allura, was prepared for it, though. \"I knew\nfrom the get-go that this was going to be a big deal,\" said Brooks. \"I can't\nwait to get the scripts.\"As for the plot, will the \"Legend of Korra\" folks\nbring their epic story-telling style to \"Voltron?\" Darby thinks so, saying\n\"It's somewhat of a space opera.

Yeah,\nit's a total binge show.\" Trailer for Netflix's \"Voltron: Legendary\nDefender.\"Trailer for Netflix's \"Voltron: Legendary Defender.\"So when will\nthis bingey show be available? The official air date (also announced at the\nWonderCon panel) is June 10, 2016.**Follow me on Twitter: @Storiz**\n\n","title":"Netflix's 'Voltron' reboot causes a standing ovation at Wonder-Con - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Netflix's \"Voltron\" reboot causes a standing ovation at WonderCon https://t.co/xU7twinPk8","date":"Mon Mar 28 01:40:05 +0000 2016","favs":48,"id":{"$numberLong":"714265774198824960"},"retweets":40},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1LSGUHr"}

Wan (who found horror fame\ndirecting \"Saw\" \"Insidious,\" and \"The Conjuring\") took the stage welcoming\nnewcomer Sandberg and his wife, Losten, who appears in the feature (and new\ntrailer) as well.Teresa Palmer and Gabriel Bateman in \"Lights Out.\" Teresa\nPalmer and Gabriel Bateman in \"Lights Out.\" Offstage in an interview with The\nTimes, Wan described how he came across \"Lights Out\" via fellow producer\nLawrence Grey. It was Grey who first recommended they turn the short into a\nfeature film. Wan wasn't fully convinced until he met with Sandberg.\"He had a\nlot of really smart things to say,\" Wan explained. \"I saw a lot of him in the\nyounger version of me. You feel like you have a lot to prove, you've nothing\nto lose, you're new to the scene, you don't know anything better, you're young\nand naive. He also did a lot of things that I used to do. I would edit things,\nI would draw things to try and get people excited about my projects.\"Noticing\nhow Sandberg would frame a shot or design a sequence gave Wan what he needed\nto believe in Sandberg the filmmaker.  \"This guy has what it takes, and it's\nreally hard to find filmmakers that get these things. People think it's easy\nto make a horror movie that works. It's not, that's why there's a lot of crap\nout there. To find a director that gets this stuff I go, 'All right, this is\nwhat we'll do. We'll support him, we'll give him the tools, we'll give him a\nbit of the money that he needs to make the movie, we'll surround him with a\ngood crew. And hopefully that will let him be creative as he can be.'\"The new\ndirector clearly benefited from Wan's presence on the set of \"Lights Out,\" and\nhe described a scene on the WonderCon panel where it helped to have the Wan\ncachet. \"There’s a scene in the film where Gabriel, the little boy, has this\nlittle candle that’s the only light source,” Sandberg said to the crowd. \"I\nwas said, ‘Let’s light that with just candlelight. Let’s just have a candle.’\nAnd people were like, ‘We can’t do that, you gotta light it, you can’t just\nhave candlelight.’ Then on the day we were shooting that scene James was on\nset, and he said, ‘You know, we should shoot that with just candlelight.’ And\npeople were like ‘Yeah, let’s do that -- great idea, James.’ So he came in\nhandy to get [the film] made properly.\" As for Wan, not being in charge was\nactually liberating for the director. \"I find it a relief because I go on set,\nI get that pang of anxiety,\" Wan said. \"And then I think, oh wait, I'm not\ndirecting this! All right, I can just go to craft services, I can eat, I can\nsit back. I can joke with the crew and the cast. And let the director do all\nthe hard work. Because usually on a film set I'm always so stressed out.\"Did\nworking with Sandberg revive any new passion or revive the creative streak?\nWan says he's not that \"jaded\" yet and is still happily working on his next\nproject, \"The Conjuring 2.\"The sequel to \"The Conjuring\" also had a trailer\ndebut at WonderCon. Back in the horror saddle is the Warren family (played by\nPatrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga). But this time the duo are headed to London\nfor a new ghostbusting challenge. Wan wasn't ready to promise a \"Conjuring\n3.\"\"We joke about it,\" Wan said. \"Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, we joke that\nthe next one has to be set in the '80s. Because I want to see Vera with big\nearrings. That's all I know, if there is another 'Conjuring' it should take\nplace in the '80s.\"'The Conjuring 2' trailer.'The Conjuring 2'\ntrailer.Although Wan has been working in the horror world for over a decade,\nhe still practices restraint with all things occult. When the real Lorraine\nWarren invited the director over to her haunted museum (which has also housed\nthe allegedly possessed Annabelle doll), Wan refused. \"I'm very superstitious\nand I don't really need to attract or invite potential negative, spiritual\nstuff,\" Wan said. \"I can just admire it from a difference.\" That caution is\nclearly not extended to the film world because \"Annabelle 2,\" the sequel to\nthe doll horror show inspired by \"The Conjuring\" legacy, already has a\ndirector: \"Lights Out's\" David F. Sandberg.\n\n","title":"How the horror short 'Lights Out' went from 3-minute film to Hollywood feature - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"How the horror short \"Lights Out\" went from 3-minute film to Hollywood feature https://t.co/XZoHpsRJlD https://t.co/4VDFKSPSng","date":"Mon Mar 28 00:50:08 +0000 2016","favs":46,"id":{"$numberLong":"714253203836157952"},"retweets":33},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1LSfvpb"}

Two associates later went to Han’s home, a gated\n7-acre ranchette at the top of a hill off the 101 Freeway.The front door was\najar, and they could see the family cars parked in the garage.The two\nimmediately notified sheriff’s deputies, who found the victims’ bodies,\nwrapped in plastic and duct tape, in the garage, Brown said.Preliminary\nindications are that all three suffered gunshot wounds.

Thank you for giving your\nlife back to me, Dr. Han.”Irma Russell collected the flowers and arranged them\non a table, creating a memorial for a man who touched many in Santa\nBarbara.For almost half her life, Russell said, Han had treated her for back\npain and chronic flu-like symptoms.“You just knew he was going to fix it,”\nsaid Russell, 71. “He worked magic.”Patient Ron Rakow, 78, described Han as a\n“national treasure.”“His life was solving insolvable problems,” said Rakow,\nwho suffers from an incurable lung disorder and has breathing problems. Han\nmixed several herbs into a tea, which Rakow drank daily. His breathing\nimproved, and he can now exercise several hours a day.“This is a sacred place\nwhere people come here broken and get fixed,” Rakow said, adding that he was\nheartbroken to learn of the family’s death.Earlier this week, he received a\ncall from Han’s daughter, who invited him to her sixth birthday party on\nSaturday.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc6a0"},"content":"As more information emerged about the men who detonated bombs in Brussels on\nTuesday, it became clear that they were members of a militant cell that was\nalso behind November's attacks in Paris that killed 130.Here's a brief rundown\nof the major players involved in each attack, and the connections between the\ntwo.Laachraoui was one of the suicide bombers at the Brussels airport, a U.S.\nofficial with knowledge of the investigation told the Los Angeles\nTimes.Laachraoui was also suspected of helping plan the Paris attacks. He is\nbelieved to have made the explosives that were set off around the city and to\nhave helped an alleged key participant in the attacks, Salah Abdeslam, during\nAbdeslam's four months on the run.Laachraoui traveled to Syria in February\n2013, and was on a list maintained by authorities to track Belgian citizens\nwho had traveled there. He is known to have used fake Belgian ID cards\nidentifying him as Soufiane Kayal while traveling in Europe. His DNA was found\nin houses in the Brussels neighborhoods of Auvelais and Schaerbeek that\nauthorities believed were used in the Paris terrorism plot.A U.S. official\ntold The Times that Laachraoui had been on an American terrorism watch\nlist.Bakraoui died detonating a bomb in the Maelbeek Metro Station.He is the\nbrother of Brahim Bakraoui; both were Belgians of Moroccan descent. A U.S.\nofficial told the Los Angeles Times that the brothers had been on an American\nterrorism watch list.Khalid El Bakraoui had been sentenced to five years in\nprison for his part in an armed carjacking, Belgian media reported.He is also\nbelieved to have rented apartments used by the Paris attackers, according to\nBelgian media.Abdeslam grew up in Belgium. A top suspect in last year's Paris\nattacks that left 130 people dead, he was charged with \"terrorist murder\" by\nBelgian authorities. After the Paris attacks, he was the subject of an\ninternational manhunt until March 18, when he was shot in the leg and arrested\nin a police raid. He is being held in isolation in a Belgian jail.A French\nprosecutor said Abdeslam had planned to detonate a suicide bomb at Stade de\nFrance on Nov. 13 but backed out at the last minute.He was a childhood friend\nof Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected mastermind of the Paris attacks.Bakraoui\nis the brother of Khalid El Bakraoui and was a Belgian of Moroccan descent. He\ndied in the suicide bombing at the Brussels airport, along with Najim\nLaachraoui.He had served part of a nine-year prison sentence -- handed down in\n2010 -- for his participation in an armed robbery during which a police\nofficer was injured. It was unclear why he was released before completing his\nterm.In 2015, Bakraoui was deported from Turkey on suspicion of being a\nforeign fighter involved in the conflict in neighboring Syria. Turkish\nofficials have said they notified Belgium, raising concerns that Belgian\nofficials overlooked warning signs.Belgian officials downplayed his centrality\nto the Brussels plot. “He's only one of the perpetrators, and not even the\nmost enterprising one,” Justice Minister Koen Geens said. “He was not the\nmastermind of this affair.”In a trash bin at a flat in Schaerbeek after the\nBrussels bombings, investigators said, they found a laptop containing a kind\nof last testament from Bakraoui.“I don't know what to do, I am in a hurry,”\nread the declaration. “I am on the run. People are looking for me everywhere.\nAnd if I give myself up, I will end up in a cell.”Investigators said one man\nescaped after abandoning his bomb at the airport.An airport camera screen\ngrab, made and released March 22 by the Belgian Federal Police, shows this man\npushing a luggage cart and walking alongside two of the bombers in the\nBrussels Airport shortly before the explosions. Some media reports have taken\nto calling him the \"man in white.\"A man identified as Fayal C. was charged\nwith terrorism offenses on March 26, and Belgian media reported that he was\nthe surviving airport bombing suspect. Authorities, however, never publicly\nalleged that the man was the third airport bomber. He was released on March 29\ndue to a lack of evidence, seeming to signal that the third airport attacker\nremains a fugitive and that the massive manhunt for him will continue.  A\npossible fifth suspect was captured on closed-circuit TV film as he carried a\nlarge bag in the subway alongside one of the suicide bombers, according to\nBelgium TV network RTBF and French newspaper Le Monde. Abaaoud, the Belgian\nson of a Moroccan immigrant, was killed in a November police raid in France.\nHe may have been the mastermind of the attacks in Paris. He has also been\nidentified as a suspect in a variety of thwarted plots to attack churches,\ntrains and police officers in Belgium and beyond.In an active social media\nlife since leaving Belgium for Syria in 2013, Abaaoud was first seen on the\nInternet as an online recruiter of Europeans. He boasted of the glory of jihad\nto an audience of disaffected young European Muslims like himself, and he\ntaunted European officials for being unable to catch him.\"A Muslim should not\nfear the bloated image of the crusader intelligence,\" he said in an interview\npublished by the Islamic State's in-house magazine in February 2015. \"My name\nand picture were all over the news, yet I was able to stay in their homeland,\nplan operations against them, and leave safely when doing so became\nnecessary.\"Hadfi and two unidentified men blew themselves up outside the Stade\nde France in Paris. Hadfi had also been living in Belgium but went to Syria in\nFebruary 2015.Abdeslam died on the night of the Paris attacks when he\ndetonated a suicide vest outside a restaurant. He lived in Belgium and was the\nbrother of Salah Abdeslam. He is believed to have used the pseudonym Amine\nChoukri.Brahim spent time in territory controlled by Islamic State and trained\nin the group's capital of Raqqah, according to what an activist group, known\nas Raqqah is Being Slaughtered Silently, told the Associated Press.He\nreportedly grew up in the Brussels neighborhood of Molenbeek and, along with\nhis brother Salah, owned a bar called Les Beguines.Officials identified Akrouh\nas one of the attackers who opened fire at bars and restaurants in Paris on\nthe night of the attacks there. He reportedly had ties to the Molenbeek\nneighborhood in Brussels.Akrouh killed himself with a bomb five days after the\nParis attacks during a police raid in Saint-Denis.Aggad attacked the Bataclan\nconcert hall with two other suspects.He lived in Strasbourg, France, and went\nto Syria to join Islamic State militants in late 2013, but managed to reenter\nFrance, French officials said.Abrini grew up in the Brussels neighborhood of\nMolenbeek. Footage shows him at a gas station with Laachraoui two days before\nthe attacks in Paris. They were driving a black Renault Clio, the same car\nthat was used in the attacks.Mostefai attacked the Bataclan Concert Hall in\nParis with two other men armed with assault rifles and explosive vests. He was\nborn near Paris, and neighbors where he lived in Chartres reported that he\nstarted becoming radicalized about five years before the attacks.Mostefai had\nreportedly been on a watch list as someone susceptible to radicalization but\nnot yet requiring extensive surveillance. He was known to police as a small-\ntime criminal whose offenses included driving without a license and insulting\nbehavior toward authorities.A senior Turkish official told the Associated\nPress that in 2013, Mostefai entered Turkey, a common pathway to Syria for\nforeign fighters hoping to join Islamic State. The newspaper Le Monde said\nMostefai probably spent the winter of 2013-14 in Syria.Amimour attacked the\nBataclan Concert Hall with two other men. He was reportedly raised in a Paris\nsuburb.Amimour was one of three friends arrested in 2012 on suspicion of\nplotting to travel to Yemen or Afghanistan to take part in violent jihad,\naccording to the French newspaper Le Parisien.  He was put under judicial\nsupervision but disappeared in the fall of 2013.He apparently later made it to\nIslamic State-held territory, where he appeared in a video that showed several\nof the future Paris attackers standing behind captives who were either\nbeheaded or shot.\"Soon on the Champs-Elysées,\" Amimour said in the video while\nholding a victim's head aloft, according to the Associated Press.This\nunidentified man blew himself up outside the Stade de France stadium with two\nother attackers. Fingerprints taken from one the suicide bombers outside the\nstadium matched those of a man who arrived in Europe via Greece in October.A\nSyrian passport was found near the man’s body, identifying the holder as Ahmad\nAl Mohammad, 25, from Idlib, Syria. It's not clear if the passport or the name\nwas authentic. According to some reports, Mohammad was a Syrian soldier who\ndied some time ago.French authorities circulated this photograph asking for\nhelp identifying the dead attacker.This man is a second unidentified attacker\noutside the Stade de France.\n\n","title":"The key players in the Brussels and Paris attacks - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"The key players in the Brussels and Paris attacks https://t.co/6DRDSbVhc8","date":"Sun Mar 27 23:15:05 +0000 2016","favs":12,"id":{"$numberLong":"714229285041647616"},"retweets":17},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1UQNOzs"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc6a1"},"content":"Today it's popular to say that political correctness is destroying America,\nbut a recently discovered set of century-old clippings offer a cautionary\nreminder of what our country was like without political correctness. From\nOregon to South Carolina, journalists and their editors in 1906 felt free to\ntrumpet racial epithets and outright lies, including those they printed about\nmy American grandmother and my Chinese grandfather.Beginning with their\nengagement, my grandparents' union was national news, simply because of their\nraces. Front-page headlines ranged from the seemingly benign San Francisco\nCall's “Charming Miss Dolly Gives Her Hand to Len Shen Yu” to the Denver\nPost's virulent “Los Angeles Heiress Elopes with a Chink Editor of San\nFran.”Reporters couldn't be bothered to learn my grandfather's actual name,\nLiu Chengyu, instead concocting random approximations. And in true tabloid\nfashion, the Denver paper fabricated the notion that my grandmother was an\nheiress eloping with her Chinese lover.Advice on how to attract and manage\nmillennial employees has become a fixture of business journalism and corporate\nreports. Thanks to extensive research, we know that millennials may come to\nthe workplace with “a sense of entitlement, a tendency to overshare on social\nmedia, and frankness verging...Advice on how to attract and manage millennial\nemployees has become a fixture of business journalism and corporate reports.\nThanks to extensive research, we know that millennials may come to the\nworkplace with “a sense of entitlement, a tendency to overshare on social\nmedia, and frankness verging...In fact, until the 1906 San Francisco\nearthquake one month earlier, Dolly Trescott, then 29, had been struggling to\nsupport herself by tutoring students in English. One of them was my 30-year-\nold grandfather-to-be, then enrolled at UC Berkeley and the editor of a\nnewspaper in San Francisco's Chinatown. When the quake struck, Liu Chengyu\nhelped his tutor escape her boarding house on Jackson Street before the Great\nFire engulfed it. He then protected her in the tent city for refugees that was\nerected on the Presidio. Homeless, and with no family other than her\nnaturopath father in Los Angeles, Trescott understandably accepted when this\nwealthy son of a former Viceroy of Canton proposed marriage.Liu was a protege\nof Sun Yatsen. In an ironic twist, his newspaper was an instrument of Sun's\ncampaign to overthrow the imperial dynasty that had employed generations of\nLiu ancestors. My grandfather wanted to see China remade as a Western-style\nrepublic. It's not clear that my grandmother knew any more about these\nrevolutionist activities than did the American reporters who dubbed her fiance\nan “embryo diplomat.” Regardless, she was prepared to go the distance to marry\nher “Celestial.” That alone made her fair game for the papers.Among its many\nfunctions, political correctness applies a brake on the impulse to lie. It's\ntempting, when spewing venom, to gin up one's case with sensational\nfalsehoods, but less so if you know your audience will call you out and\nchallenge you to justify your prejudices with reason and with facts. In 1906\nthe citizens who would correct the record were few, but they did exist. The\nPresbyterian minister who married my grandparents was one.In the continental\nUnited States at the time, all but 17 mostly northeastern states had so-called\nanti-miscegenation laws that prohibited interracial marriage. And even in a\nstate where it was allowed, finding a willing preacher was no small feat.\nTrescott and Liu apparently thought they could find one in Mormon Utah, so\nthey boarded a train to Ogden, where reporters gleefully documented the local\nminister's refusal. The determined couple proceeded to Evanston, Wyo., where\nthe Rev. Leon C. Hills was willing not only to wed them, but also to defend\nthem against the public outrage that followed.In a Wyoming Press editorial,\nHills made a case for racial (although, alas, not class) tolerance that could\nwell be leveled at those issuing screeds against immigrants today:Some very\nunfair and indiscret [sic] remarks have been made by those who do not know the\nfacts of this case. Some speak of this affair as though a Chinese “coolie” had\nmarried some white woman of doubtful character. ... Please pause until you\nhear some facts. This misunderstanding comes no doubt from three causes:\nFirst, from the sensational reports in the newspapers; second, it is due to a\ngross prejudice in this western country toward the Chinese because of labor\nproblems; third, because some Americans have the idea that the Chinese are an\ninferior race.The good reverend's appeal had little effect. In South Carolina,\nCharleston's News and Courier picked up on one bastardization of my\ngrandfather's name to sneer, “Miss Dolly Trescott, a white girl, of\nCalifornia, has married a Chinaman whose first name is ‘Sin.'

Superman: Dawn of Justice,” took to the stage at\nWonderCon to reveal their Rebirth lineup, a comic book event the company has\nlong been trumpeting.Rebirth is a comic event that will run through many of\nDC's top titles. Not a reboot like the previous New 52 initiative, but a\nrelaunch of over 50 titles that will not throw away recent history but hopes\nto \"right the ship\" in terms of editorial direction.New creative teams will be\ntaking over many titles while some will remain but be relaunched with No. 1s.\nRebirth will be publishing twice monthly on key characters, and the price of\nthe books will be brought down to $2.99.But before any announcements were\nunderway, there was an apology. Co-publisher Dan Didio addressed the DC-\ncentric crowd, giving a mea culpa on The New 52, which relaunched many core\ntitles. Though it did \"some good things,\" said Didio, it seemed that feedback\nfrom the fans, mixed with concern coming from creators, caused the powers that\nbe to rethink every title and character in the comics stable.“We talked about\nthe New 52, but something was missing. You felt it, and over time, we felt it\ntoo,” said Didio. “Why? Well, sometimes you lose your way. The whole purpose\n[of this event] is to show you, the fans, our commitment to you.”DC Universe\nRebirth Event at WonderCon. DC Universe Rebirth Event at WonderCon. During the\npanel, co-publisher Jim Lee explained the look of the new comics, and shared\ndesigns for the lineup -- including ones for Batman, Superman, a female Latina\nGreen Lantern, and a goateed Green Arrow (which elicited a huge cheer from the\ncrowd).“Every great Green Arrow story, he had a goatee,” said Johns.After the\nintroduction of Rebirth, the new creators took the stage in families to give a\none-liner or two about the books they were on. The Bat-family of books, the\nSuperman family, the Justice League family and more were each represented by\nartists and writers who would be guiding this rebirth. Here were a few\ntakeaways from the nearly two-hour-long gathering.\"All-Star Batman\" – written\nby Scott Snyder; art by John Romita Jr., Sean Gordon Murphy, Jock, WTula Lotay\nand Afua Richardson\"All-Star Batman\" – written by Scott Snyder; art by John\nRomita Jr., Sean Gordon Murphy, Jock, WTula Lotay and Afua Richardson\"The\nFlash\" – written by Joshua Williamson; art by Carmine Di Giandomenico and Neil\nGooge\"The Flash\" – written by Joshua Williamson; art by Carmine Di\nGiandomenico and Neil GoogeIn the post-panel press conference, Didio explained\na bit about why he felt the need to apologize, saying that you have to admit\nwhen things aren’t going well. He used an example of him being at New York\nComic-Con on a panel, and feeling a weird sensation when no asked him one\nquestion about story. He knew something was wrong.Storytelling was also\nbrought up post-panel. And how the medium and the manner in which we tell\nstories has changed, and how the books and the business should reflect those\nchanges. That means organic diversity in the books and in the creators who\nwrite and draw those books. This may cause character changes, etc., but the\nheart of the character, what made them popular in the first place, never\nreally changes.

This is how it ends, he thought to himself, after three\nhonorable years of service in the U.S. Navy and one serious run-in with the\nlaw, he was being set adrift, here in a deadly Mexican border town hundreds of\nmiles from home.So he ran.Juan Valadez once embraced the Navy's ideals: Be\nyour best, serve with honor, protect your country. But because he was born in\nMexico and taken to the U.S. as an infant, his pact with America when he\njoined the military came with a catch: If he ever was convicted of a felony,\nhe would be deported.**See more of our top stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**The\nonly legal way to return would be in a casket — a final mercy the U.S.\ngovernment grants veterans who die after deportation.\"They'll take you back\nonce it's not no good to you anymore,\" Valadez said.For much of its wartime\nhistory, the U.S. has offered naturalization to noncitizens who enlisted in\nthe military and completed boot camp. The practice was halted after the\nVietnam War and then resumed a generation later by the Army in 2009, and the\nNavy after that.Valadez, 33, is one of the thousands who served in those\nmiddle years when naturalization wasn't a part of boot camp\ngraduation.Advocates estimate there are now at least 2,000 veterans living in\nnorthern Mexico, many in border towns such as Tijuana and Juarez where English\nspeakers can find decent-paying work in telemarketing and other service-sector\njobs. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement doesn't track the military\nhistory of deportees, so it is difficult to tell exactly how many veterans the\ngovernment has deported.In Mexico, Valadez said, his military training and\nfluent English have drawn the keenest interest from a powerful drug cartel. In\na single day, he said, he could make what he earns in a month running the\nsushi restaurant he now owns in downtown Juarez.But he has a wife and young\ndaughter now, and he resists picking up the phone. Still, when the bills pile\nup, the job beckons.\"They want to talk to you when you [reach Mexico],\" said a\nmilitary veteran in Juarez, who did not want to give his name for fear of\nreprisal. \"They know who's here, who can do things they need.\"Valadez believes\ngoing to work for the cartel, even for simple jobs like driving a truck or\nrunning security, would not only be dangerous, but a betrayal.\"I'm still an\nAmerican, I'm still a sailor,\" Valadez said.Valadez admits that he could have\ndone far more to secure a foothold in America.After boot camp, when he was\ndeployed south of Yemen, in the Gulf of Aden, he could have found someone on\nhis ship who could naturalize him, as the law permits immigrants on active\nduty abroad. But he never did, and eventually forgot about it.The modern path\nto naturalization is far easier, allowing boot camp graduates to participate\nin a naturalization ceremony. But naturalization ceremonies were not a part of\nboot camp when Valadez enlisted.A Pentagon report, issued in 2008 amid two\nwars, estimated that about 8,000 noncitizens enlist in the military each year.\nIt is unclear whether enlistment numbers have continued at that pace.After the\nVietnam War, military members had to complete one year of honorable service to\neven begin applying for citizenship. After the September 2001 terrorist\nattacks, President George W. Bush signed an executive order allowing for a\nshorter time frame, clearing the way to a quicker path to citizenship.The\nresult was scattershot. Some enterprising service members in the country\nillegally understood the process after deployment and were diligent in filing\ntheir applications through their closest embassy. Some thought the boot camp\ngraduation was itself a citizenship ceremony.\"They raised their right hands\nand swore to defend the Constitution,\" said Margaret Stock of Cascadia Cross-\nBorder Law in Anchorage, Alaska, who has represented many veterans seeking to\navoid deportation. \"They thought that made them citizens.\"Some, like Valadez,\nwere unsure of their options.\"Military recruiters mislead people,\" Stock said.\n\"They tell them that citizenship will be automatic.\"Once deported, veterans\nare no longer are able to get medical coverage, though the Department of\nVeterans Affairs will continue to mail them medication.Vietnam veteran Manuel\nde Jesus Castano, for instance, was being treated for Lou Gehrig's disease and\nlupus at an El Paso Veterans Affairs hospital when he was deported in 2011. He\nwas rebuffed every time he tried to come back to the U.S. for treatment, and\nin 2012 died of a heart attack. He was 55.Manuel Valenzuela and other\nadvocates for deported veterans helped arrange to have his body returned to\nthe U.S. He is now interred at Ft. Bliss National Cemetery in El Paso, buried\nwith full military honors.**See the most-read stories this hour\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officials say they enforce U.S.\nimmigration law, irrespective of a person's military status.When Valadez\nreturned from duty in the Gulf of Aden, he left the military and went looking\nfor quick cash. He found it in marijuana.He told a friend of a friend he would\ntake a shipment of pot from El Paso to Columbus, Ohio. He said he didn't know\nit at the time, but he was working for the same cartel that would later ask\nabout his services in Juarez.

William\nLudlow and his three sons of sharply contrasting personalities and values, the\nnarrative extending from before World War I to the mid-20th century, from San\nFrancisco to Singapore.In the poem \"Spirit,\" which appears in the collection\n\"Dead Man's Float,\" coming in January from Copper Canyon Press, Jim Harrison\nwrites:Rumi advised me to keep my spiritup in the branches of a tree and not\npeekout too far, so I keep mine in the very tallwillows along the irrigation\nditch...In the poem \"Spirit,\" which appears in the collection \"Dead Man's\nFloat,\" coming in January from Copper Canyon Press, Jim Harrison writes:Rumi\nadvised me to keep my spiritup in the branches of a tree and not peekout too\nfar, so I keep mine in the very tallwillows along the irrigation ditch...\"Late\nin October 1914 three brothers rode from Choteau, Montana to Calgary, Alberta\nto enlist in the Great War,\" reads Harrison's celebrated opening sentence,\nwhich author Vance Bourjaily would praise for establishing \"both the voice and\nmanner of the epic storyteller, who deals in great vistas and vast\ndistances.\"The book was a bestseller, and Harrison worked on the script for an\nOscar-nominated 1994 film of the same name starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins\nand Aidan Quinn. Harrison's screenplay credits also included \"Revenge,\"\nstarring Kevin Costner, and the Nicholson film \"Wolf.\" But he would liken the\nunpredictable and nerve-wracking process to being trapped in a \"shuddering\nelevator\" and reminded himself of his marginal status by inscribing a putdown\nby a Hollywood executive, \"You're just a writer,\" on a piece of paper and\ntaping it above his desk.Harrison could have been a superb character actor, a\nbearded, burly man with a disfigured left eye and a smoker's rasp who confided\nthat when out in public with Nicholson he was sometimes mistaken for the\nactor's bodyguard. Erudite enough to write reviews for the New York Times and\nto quote Wallace Stevens from memory, he also had a strong affinity for\nphysical labor and a history of writing stories for and about men.\"My\ncharacters aren't from the urban dream-coasts,\" he told the Paris Review in\n1986. \"A man is not a foreman on a dam project because he wants to be macho.\nThat's his job, a job he's evolved into.\"How is it macho that I like to hunt\nand fish? I've been doing it since I was four.\"Harrison had displayed numerous\ntalents before the general public caught on to him. He was an accomplished\npoet and sports journalist and a fiction writer with a strong feel for open\nspaces and the pull and consequences of history. He set many works in the\nrural north of his native Michigan, including the detective novels \"The Great\nLeader\" and \"The Big Seven,\" and used Nebraska as the backdrop for one of his\nmost acclaimed works, \"Dalva.\"His other books included a volume of novellas,\n\"The River Swimmer\"; the poetry collections \"Songs of Unreason\" and \"Returning\nto Earth\"; and a memoir about food, \"The Raw and the Cooked: Adventures of a\nRoving Gourmand.\" He was voted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters\nin 2007.Harrison married Linda King in 1959 and had two daughters.The grandson\nof farmers, and son of an agricultural extension agent, Harrison grew up in\nsmall Michigan towns — Grayling, Reed City, Haslett — where he developed a\nlove of books and a primal bond with the outdoors, \"bone- and marrow-deep.\"He\nwould associate his childhood with simple pleasures and ongoing loss, a\ngeneral longing for simpler times and the physical handicap of his blind left\neye, injured at age 7 when a neighborhood girl jammed a bottle in his face.In\nthe 1950s and '60s, he drifted between studies at Michigan State University\nand the \"Beat\" scene in Boston, where he met Jack Kerouac, and New York City,\nwhere he taught briefly before returning to rural Michigan. In 1965, he\ndebuted as a poet with \"Plain Song.\"Life as an outdoorsman inadvertently made\nhim a novelist. In the late 1960s he slipped off a bank along the Manistee\nRiver in Michigan, injured his back, lapsed into a semi-coma and for some two\nyears was forced to wear a corset. His close friend Tom McGuane suggested he\ntry a full-length work of fiction since Harrison \"could no longer do anything\nto avoid it.\" (Through McGuane, he would also meet Nicholson when Harrison\nvisited the set of \"The Missouri Breaks,\" a 1976 movie written by\nMcGuane).Harrison's first novel, \"Wolf: A Fake Memoir,\" came out in 1971 and\nwas followed two years later by a work of fiction about the ecology, \"A Good\nDay to Die.\" But he was devastated by the commercial failure of his novel\n\"Farmer\" and was so broke, he recalled, that he couldn't pay his taxes and\ncouldn't fill out a scholarship form for his daughter because he was required\nto include records from the IRS.His turnaround involved a true Hollywood\ntwist. Harrison was visiting his in-laws' home when he came upon the journals\nof his wife's great-grandfather, a mining engineer named William Ludlow, and\nwas inspired to write a story. The completion of what became \"Legends of the\nFall\" was made possible by a $15,000 loan from Nicholson.\"And now the one-eyed\ngoofy, the black-sheep poet ... has inadvertently struck it rich,\" Harrison\nlater wrote of his midlife success. \"After the first full year of this\nexperience I was sitting on the porch of our recently remodeled farmhouse,\ntriple the estimated time and expense and a thoroughly enervating process,\nreading the Detroit Free Press and noting that I had made more money in the\nlast year than the President of General Motors, Harlow Curtis.\"I idly hoped he\nwas happy in his work.\"**ALSO****Earl Hamner Jr., creator of 'The Waltons,'\ndies at 92****Garry Shandling dies at 66; comedian's influential career\nspanned decades****Rob Ford, scandal-prone former Toronto mayor, dies of\ncancer at 46**\n\n","title":"'Legends of the Fall' author Jim Harrison dies at 78 - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"\"Legends of the Fall\" author Jim Harrison dies at 78 https://t.co/Os436MUmcw https://t.co/Z2IWy59KcX","date":"Sun Mar 27 19:35:04 +0000 2016","favs":36,"id":{"$numberLong":"714173914289725441"},"retweets":58},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1RIewKv"}

Sunday, the positive rating had\ndecreased to just 29%, with 262 reviews being counted.But audiences on the\nwhole disagreed. Moviegoers gave the DC Comics adaptation a respectable B\ngrade, according to polling firm CinemaScore. Those younger than 25 gave it a\nB-plus; those under 18 gave it an A-minus.“It was such a disconnect with what\nthe critics were writing because the fans were interested,” Goldstein said.\n“This movie was made for a global fan base, and the fans embraced it in such a\nbig way.”Senior Media Analyst for comScore Paul Dergarabedian agreed, noting\nthat the studio’s decision to release over Easter weekend, as opposed to the\npre-planned summer date, provided “unfettered access” to its core\naudience.While \"Batman v Superman\" the film is currently battling it out at\nthe box office, the real question of who would win in this prizefight of\nsuperhero heavyweights is also being debated by comic book fanatics, cosplay\nenthusiasts, and the pop culture elite at the 2016 WonderCon. We headed\nover...While \"Batman v Superman\" the film is currently battling it out at the\nbox office, the real question of who would win in this prizefight of superhero\nheavyweights is also being debated by comic book fanatics, cosplay\nenthusiasts, and the pop culture elite at the 2016 WonderCon. We headed\nover...“We can now put to bed the notion that reviews were going to hurt\n[‘Batman v Superman],” he said. “And if they did, I’m not seeing it.

Audiences,\nhowever, gave it an impressive A-minus CinemaScore.Fourteen years later,\nCarpou said, the concept of family as told through “Wedding” has not gone\nstale. He expects the film to continue to play well in coming weeks and among\nfamilies of all backgrounds.Regardless, it placed third at the box office,\nbehind Disney's animated hit, \"Zootopia,\" now in its fourth week in\nrelease.The film voiced by the likes of Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, Idris\nElba, Shakira and Octavia Spencer garnered $23.1 million this weekend.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc6ab"},"content":"Federal prosecutors investigating the possible mishandling of classified\nmaterials on Hillary Clinton’s private email server have begun the process of\nsetting up formal interviews with some of her longtime and closest aides,\naccording to two people familiar with the probe, an indication that the\ninquiry is moving into its final phases.Those interviews and the final review\nof the case, however, could still take many weeks, all but guaranteeing that\nthe investigation will continue to dog Clinton’s presidential campaign through\nmost, if not all, of the remaining presidential primaries.No dates have been\nset for questioning the advisors, but a federal prosecutor in recent weeks has\ncalled their lawyers to alert them that he would soon be doing so, the sources\nsaid. Prosecutors also are expected to seek an interview with Clinton herself,\nthough the timing remains unclear.**Join the conversation on Facebook\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;**The interviews by FBI agents and prosecutors will play a significant\nrole in helping them better understand whether Clinton or her aides knowingly\nor negligently discussed classified government secrets over a non-secure email\nsystem when she served as secretary of State.The meetings also are an\nindication that much of the investigators' background work – recovering\ndeleted emails, understanding how the server operated and determining whether\nit was breached – is nearing completion.“The interviews are critical to\nunderstand the volume of information they have accumulated,” said James\nMcJunkin, former head of the FBI's Washington field office.  “They are likely\nnearing the end of the investigation and the agents need to interview these\npeople to put the information in context.

Bernie\nSanders' supporters in California say they expect that come November, Hillary\nClinton will be elected president — and, by and large, they're OK with\nthat.While both Democratic camps prepare for a final battle in the state’s\nJune 7 primary, the latest USC Dornsife/Los Angeles...Many legal experts\nbelieve that Clinton faces little risk of being prosecuted for using the\nprivate email system to conduct official business when she served as secretary\nof State, though that decision has raised questions among some about her\njudgment. They noted that using a private email system was not banned at the\ntime, and others in government had used personal email to transact official\nbusiness.The bigger question is whether she or her aides distributed\nclassified material in email systems that fell outside of the department’s\nsecure classified system. But even if prosecutors determine that she did,\nchances she will be found criminally liable are low. U.S. law makes it a crime\nfor someone to knowingly or willfully retain classified information, handle it\nin a grossly negligent manner or to pass it to someone not entitled to see\nit.Clinton has denied using the email account to send or receive materials\nmarked classified. Though some emails have since been deemed to be too\nsensitive to release publicly, Clinton's campaign has attributed that to\noverzealous intelligence officials and \"over-classification run amok.\"Legally\nit doesn’t matter if the emails were marked as classified or not, since\ngovernment officials are obligated to recognize sensitive material and guard\nagainst its release. But legal experts noted that such labels would be helpful\nto prosecutors seeking to prove she knew the information was classified, a key\nelement of the law. “The facts of the case do not fit the law,” said Stephen\nVladeck, a law professor at American University. “Reasonable folks may think\nthat federal law ought to prohibit what Hillary did, but it’s just not clear\nto me that it currently does.”Even so, her use of the private server, which\nwas based at her home in New York, has become fodder for Clinton’s political\nfoes as she campaigns to secure the Democratic nomination for president.Though\nSen. Bernie Sanders has largely declined to use the email scandal against her\nin the Democratic primary, Republicans have repeatedly said she should be\nindicted or disqualified from running for the nation's top office. At a recent\nDemocratic debate, Clinton grew exasperated when asked what she would do if\nindicted. “That’s not going to happen,” she said.Her attorney, David Kendall,\ndeclined to comment. Her campaign spokesman, Brian Fallon, said in an email\nthat Clinton is ready to work with investigators to conclude the\ninvestigation.“She first offered last August to meet and answer any questions\nthey might have,” Fallon wrote. “She would welcome the opportunity to help\nthem complete their work.”Lawyers for her closest aides – Huma Abedin, Jake\nSullivan, Cheryl Mills and Philippe Reines – either did not respond to\nmessages or declined to comment.The Justice Department and FBI began their\ninvestigation after receiving what is known as a security referral in July\nfrom the inspector general for U.S. intelligence agencies, which at the time\nwere in the midst of reviewing paper copies of nearly 30,500 emails Clinton\nturned over in 2014 that she said were work-related.The State Department has\nsince released all 3,871 pages of Clinton’s emails in its possession and has\ndetermined that 22 of her emails contained \"top secret\" information, though\nthey were not marked as such as the time. Hundreds of others contained\nmaterial that was either secret or confidential, two lower levels of\nclassification.After stepping down as secretary of State, Clinton, who has\nsaid she used her personal email to conduct personal and official business as\na matter of convenience, told her staff to delete 31,830 emails on the server\nthat she felt were non-work-related.In August, the FBI obtained the server and\nhas since recovered most, if not all, of the deleted correspondence, said a\nperson familiar with the investigation.FBI agents have finished their review\nof the server and the correspondence turned over by Clinton to the State\nDepartment. They have interviewed a number of former aides so they could\nbetter understand how the system was used and why Clinton chose to use it, the\nperson said.Hillary Clinton made her second visit to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on\nThursday night, where she was treated to a healthy dose of mansplaining from\nher host. \"I am going to be your secret weapon,\" Kimmel told the Democratic\npresidential candidate. \"I'm going to help you win this election no\nproblem....Hillary Clinton made her second visit to \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on\nThursday night, where she was treated to a healthy dose of mansplaining from\nher host. \"I am going to be your secret weapon,\" Kimmel told the Democratic\npresidential candidate. \"I'm going to help you win this election no\nproblem....Federal prosecutors granted immunity to one of those aides, Bryan\nPagliano, who helped set up the server in Clinton’s home. He has cooperated\nwith the federal investigation and provided security logs that revealed no\nevidence of foreign hacking, according to a law enforcement official.His\nlawyer, Mark MacDougall, did not respond to messages seeking comment. The\nprobe is being closely watched and supervised by the Justice Department’s top\nofficials and prosecutors. FBI Director James B. Comey has said he has been\nregularly briefed on the investigation, which is being overseen by prosecutors\nin the Justice Department’s national security division.The decision on whether\nto prosecute could be difficult. Vladeck, the law professor noted the\ndifferences between Clinton’s email issue and two previous cases involving the\nmishandling of classified material that resulted in prosecutions and guilty\npleas.In 2005, Sandy Berger, a former national security advisor, pleaded\nguilty to the unlawful removal and retention of national security information\nafter being caught trying to smuggle classified documents out of the National\nArchives.In another case, Gen. David Petraeus, a former CIA director, was\ninvestigated for knowingly allowing a mistress to read classified material as\nshe researched a book about him. Petraeus eventually pleaded guilty to a\nmisdemeanor charge of mishandling classified material and was spared prison\ntime.Legal experts said Petraeus’ actions were far more serious than anything\nClinton is accused of doing. Clinton’s emails, even those later deemed\nclassified, were sent to aides cleared to read them, for example, and not\nprivate citizens, they said.Several of the lawyers involved in Clinton’s case\nare familiar with the differences. Petraeus’ defense lawyer was Kendall, who\nalso represents Clinton. And a prosecutor helping oversee the Clinton email\ninvestigation was part of the team that obtained Petraeus’ guilty\nplea.**Election 2016 | Live coverage on Trail Guide | Track the delegate race\n| Sign up for the newsletter  **“Those cases are just so different from what\nClinton is accused of doing,” Vladeck said. “And the Justice Department\nlawyers know it.”While she is not likely to face legal jeopardy, the emails\ncould cause some political heartburn when the aides are questioned. However,\nshort of an indictment or an explosive revelation, the controversy is not\nlikely to alter the overall dynamics of the primary race or general election,\npolitical observers said.\"This is clearly disruptive to the campaign,” said\nMark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. “It will take her off message and\ncoverage about important aides being questioned is not coverage you'd like to\nhave. However, this issue is largely dismissed by Democratic primary voters\nand baked into the cake for the general electorate.”**ALSO****When serving in\nthe U.S. military isn't enough to prevent deportation****Donald Trump leads in\nCalifornia primary race but threatens a GOP fracture****In Syria, militias\narmed by the Pentagon fight those armed by the CIA**\n\n","title":"Clinton email probe enters new phase as FBI interviews loom - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Clinton email probe enters new phase as FBI interviews loom https://t.co/7fWh2LvQ27 https://t.co/bjSQOq8XV4","date":"Sun Mar 27 18:25:05 +0000 2016","favs":79,"id":{"$numberLong":"714156302801453056"},"retweets":91},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1SoGqIb"}

Among the known losses are a 2nd century statue, Lion of al-Lat; the\ncity's magnificant Arch of Triumph; the Temple of Baalshamin; and dozens of\nfuneral towers.In August, the group beheaded Khaled Assad, retired director of\nPalmyra's antiquities museum, before crucifying his mutilated corpse on a\ntraffic light pole in the center of town.The full extent of damage to\nPalmyra's ancient sites has been unclear, but should be fully revealed in the\ncoming days.Over the last week, Syrian government forces, backed by Russian\nspecial forces units and advisors, clashed with Islamic State militants in and\naround the city. They finally pushed through to the majestic ruins that lie at\nthe southwest entrance of the city's residential neighborhoods, under heavy\ncover from Syrian and Russian warplanes and a steady barrage of\nartillery.Assad's forces were reportedly slowed by their inability to use\nheavy weaponry in the ruins. They also had to navigate dozens of IEDs, a\nparting gift left behind by Islamic State fighters.Embedded pro-government\nreporters deluged social media with up-to-the-minute updates on the assault,\neven as the army’s media unit broadcast pictures of soldiers holding\nKalashnikovs over their heads in triumph, and edited videos of tanks and heavy\narmor firing into the distance while army helicopters swooped overhead to\ndestroy tanks.The takeover was confirmed by opposition sources, including the\nObservatory, which reported that sounds of sporadic gunfire and explosions\ncould still be heard from Palmyra’s outskirts.With Palmyra back under\ngovernment control, world attention turned to the fate of its\nmonuments.Palmyra was an important caravan oasis in the ancient world that\nbecame increasingly important under Roman rule in the 1st century. It was a\nkey stop on the trade route linking Persia, China and India with the Roman\nEmpire.Besides destroying some of its most important Roman-era structures,\nIslamic State converted the Palmyra museum into a court and a dungeon, and\ndestroyed a number of Islamic shrines, according to Dr. Maamoun Abdelkarim,\ndirector of Syria’s antiquities and museums directorate.Writing in the British\nGuardian newspaper on Sunday, Abdelkarim issued a plea for the “international\ncommunity to stand with [Syria] in this cultural battle” and to “unite to save\nPalmyra.”“Syria’s heritage is part of humanity’s heritage. It cannot be\ndivided among those who support the government and those who support the\nopposition.He also said that initial evaluations seemed promising, but once\nthe security situation stabilizes in the next few days, he and his team of\n2,500 employees, including “exceptional local experts in engineering and\narchaeology,” will “breathe new life into Palmyra.\"The significance of the\nSyrian victory over Islamic State, which coincided with Syria’s Christian\npopulation celebrating Easter, was not lost on the government in the capital,\nDamascus, where officials were quick to invoke heavy symbolism for the\noccasion.Assad's Twitter account sent out a “glorious Easter salute to all\nSyrians” from a Palmyra “baptized in the blood of the men of the Syrian Arab\nArmy.\"In the wake of the Brussels terror attacks, other Syrian government\nofficials painted this as part of the Assad government's fight against global\nterrorism, conflating the Islamic State and the Syrian opposition in the\nprocess.\"The victory in Palmyra… is proof of the correctness of our position\nagainst terror since the beginning, which some tried to depict as a crisis in\nSyria, [while] it is in truth an attack on Syria,” said Syrian Information\nMinister Omran Al-Zoubi in a phone interview with Syrian state TV from the\nDamascus.The Syrian government has long insisted that the civil war, which\nbegan as a series of mostly peaceful protests against Assad’s rule, was the\nwork of terrorists, egged on by Syria’s enemies in the West and the region. In\nSeptember, with Assad’s forces on the verge of collapse, Russian President\nVladimir Putin initiated a large-scale air campaign purportedly against\nIslamic State. Although the scale of the campaign has since been reduced,\nRussian troops continue to play a vital role in combat operations throughout\nthe country – a fact Putin reiterated once again Sunday in a congratulatory\nphone call to Assad, according to SANA.Beyond Palmyra, the offensive’s success\nopens up access to strategically important areas in the country’s east,\nincluding parts of Deir Al-Zor and Raqqa, provinces still largely under the\ncontrol of Islamic State. Later on Sunday, the Observatory reported that\ngovernment troops had begun their offensive on Al-Qaryatayn, a Christian-\ndominated town in central Homs province that had also fallen to Islamic\nState._Bulos is a special correspondent._**ALSO****Raid that killed an Islamic\nState leader marks a shift in U.S. strategy****Extremist cell behind attacks\nin Brussels and Paris is being 'annihilated'****Dozens killed in bomb blast\nnear children's rides at a Pakistan park during Easter celebration**\n\n","title":"Syrian troops drive Islamic State out of historic Palmyra - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Syrian troops drive Islamic State out of historic Palmyra https://t.co/DAcEdTyJTZ","date":"Sun Mar 27 17:22:46 +0000 2016","favs":55,"id":{"$numberLong":"714140621246750720"},"retweets":47},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1pROdoX"}

But for some reason, a\nmere day hike, even in one of the world's most spectacular natural wonders,\nwas never on my radar. I'd been to the Grand Canyon several times as a kid and\na parent, taken pictures of the awesome views, bought a refrigerator magnet,\nand left. And I'm not unusual. Only 10% of park visitors hike at all, says the\nNational Park Service, and a fraction of those actually go all the way to the\nbottom — the Colorado River — and back.But then a friend invited me to do just\nthat.And when our epic 11-hour, 15.1-mile trek down and up nearly 5,000 feet\nwas done, I realized something: This otherworldly journey into a land before\ntime, with its stunning rock formations, famous river, an oasis and\nastonishing, incomprehensible vastness, is no mere walk in the park. It's a\ntrue bucket-list adventure. And the beauty of it: It's practically next-\ndoor.Hundreds hike the Grand Canyon every day, but it seemed as if most of\nthem were like the seven men and women in my group: middle-aged and well-\norganized. You don't need to be a super athlete — a couple in our group had\nnever hiked before or even went to the gym. But you do need water and food in\nthe backpack, hiking poles to assist the legs, roomy shoes for swelled feet,\nlube and Band-Aids to stop blisters, and hat and sunscreen to beat the heat.\n(And don't even think about doing it in summer when temperatures are\nbrutal.)Like mountain climbing in reverse, Grand Canyon hikes go down, then\nup. This one, the safest and most popular route, is a loop linking the park's\ntwo \"superhighway\" trails: The 7.1-mile South Kaibab, which starts at an\nelevation of 7,200 feet and descends 4,800 feet to the Colorado, and the\n8.0-mile Bright Angel, which climbs back 4,380 feet to the South Rim,\nelevation 6,860 feet. The former has views; the latter has water. We took the\ncrowded free shuttle bus from our South Rim hotel to the trailhead and began\nthe steep descent at 7 a.m.The South Kaibab trail is a revelation, a ridge-\nline route with unobstructed 360-degree vistas that evoked oohs and aahs for\n3.5 hours. In fact, its first official lookout is Ooh-Ahh Point, which\nshowcases the stunning O'Neill Butte, a massive, bright-orange sandstone\nformation glistening in the distance like a temple in the Holy Land.We\nAngelenos are led to believe that we don't walk much. Perhaps the exceptions\nprove that rule, and there we were, our group of comfy-shoe-clad, sun-hat-\nwearing, day-pack-carrying pedestrians. ¶ No matter, we were about to take off\nand walk the entire length of Wilshire Boulevard.The Sierra Club...We\nAngelenos are led to believe that we don't walk much. Perhaps the exceptions\nprove that rule, and there we were, our group of comfy-shoe-clad, sun-hat-\nwearing, day-pack-carrying pedestrians. ¶ No matter, we were about to take off\nand walk the entire length of Wilshire Boulevard.The Sierra Club...Dodging\nmule trains carrying overnighters who'd camped at the bottom, we homed in on\nO'Neill for the next 90 minutes like bugs to a bright light, then stopped to\nsnack and bandage blister hot-spots at the Skeleton Point overlook.\nDehydration clearly inspired the name as there's no drinking water on the\nSouth Kaibab.The first water is at the bottom. Invisible from the South Rim,\nthe Colorado River grew from a tiny blue dot halfway down the Kaibab into a\npond and finally into a bend in a wide river by the time our endless\nswitchback descent was done. When we arrived about 10:30 a.m., it was\ndecorated with colorful inflatables and paddlers on rafting expeditions. It\nwas getting hot — the river's only 2,480 feet above sea level — but swimming\nis out; people have died in the strong, frigid current.Ready for lunch, we\ncrossed and recrossed the Colorado on two suspension bridges, tracked the\nsouth bank of the river for an hour, then found picnic tables at the River\nResthouse, one of several toilet- and water-equipped rest houses along the\nBright Angel Trail.What do you love to do outdoors?

Pretty\nbut lacking awesome Kaibab-ish views because it's nestled in a canyon, it\noffers a welcome respite halfway up: Indian Garden, a lush, green oasis with a\nrunning stream, a cool pond, toilets and crowds of half-day hikers coming down\nfrom the South Rim. It can easily turn into an hourlong foot bath and nap,\nwhich proved useful. I woke up refreshed and ready for the hardest part of the\nday: 3,000 feet of climbing in about four miles.Planting my poles like a\nNorwegian cross-country skier, I plowed past the crowds of backpackers, kids\nand families struggling on the ridiculously steep grades. As cool afternoon\nshadows from the towering South Rim walls draped the endless switchbacks, the\npace quickened. I caught my friends near the top just before 6 p.m.After 11\nhours, the eight of us gazed at the postcard view from the fast-chilling South\nRim, 6,860 feet above sea level.Below, Indian Garden was a tiny green\nsmudge.The Colorado was nowhere to be seen.And a worthy adventure was crossed\noff the bucket list._health@latimes.com_\n\n","title":"He hiked the Grand Canyon in a day, on the lookout for blisters and ooh-aah views - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Hike the Grand Canyon in one day, and stay on the lookout for blisters and ooh-aah views https://t.co/ElLzxNzrud https://t.co/Sonu7a0Luu","date":"Sun Mar 27 16:30:32 +0000 2016","favs":98,"id":{"$numberLong":"714127473185828865"},"retweets":48},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/1RvFQIE"}

They need to be scrubbed back down to\nthe raw cast iron, treated and repainted,” Carroll said, adding that the poles\nhave not been restored since the exhibit opened outside the museum in\n2008.Exposure to the elements has had its effect on the paint adorning the\nlampposts, leading to fading and rusting, but Carroll reports that they’ve\n“found a paint that is much more durable and has the right sheen for the\nsculpture, as well as meeting California's new VOC [Volatile Organic Compound]\nregulations.”The darkening of “Urban Light” was originally scheduled to take\nplace during summer 2015 only to be delayed in the wake of Burden’s death in\nMay of last year.“We thought it was better to hold back so that people could\nstill celebrate the work,” Carroll said.The museum is loath to close the\npopular exhibit to the public, knowing that “Urban Light” serves as a Los\nAngeles landmark.“It's been very difficult for us because it's such a focal\npoint for both LACMA and Los Angeles.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc6b2"},"content":"University of California President Janet Napolitano announced new steps\nSaturday to closely monitor UC Berkeley's handling of sexual misconduct cases\nfollowing outcry that campus administrators gave light sanctions to powerful\nfaculty members found to have sexually harassed students and staff.Napolitano\nsaid in a statement that UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks has agreed to\nprovide written reports to her office on campus progress in combating sexual\nmisconduct and would meet monthly with her beginning April 1.Napolitano has\nalso assigned Jody Shipper, the systemwide director for sexual misconduct\nissues, to work full time with Berkeley to make sure that complaints are\ninvestigated quickly and equitably. Shipper will work with the campus at least\nthrough the end of the semester, Napolitano said.\"I am happy that Chancellor\nDirks agrees that these issues demand concentrated, effective measures,\"\nNapolitano said in a statement. \"We both believe UC Berkeley needs to bring\nthe same focus and competence to its handling of sexual assault and harassment\ninvestigations as it does its education and research missions.\"With sexual\nharassment controversies roiling multiple campuses in the University of\nCalifornia system, UC President Janet Napolitano on Friday announced new\nmeasures designed to prevent future incidents and ensure that punishments,\nwhen necessary, are uniform system-wide.In an open letter addressed...With\nsexual harassment controversies roiling multiple campuses in the University of\nCalifornia system, UC President Janet Napolitano on Friday announced new\nmeasures designed to prevent future incidents and ensure that punishments,\nwhen necessary, are uniform system-wide.In an open letter\naddressed...Napolitano's intervention comes after weeks of protests on campus\nthat Dirks and Provost Claude Steele had mishandled cases involving law school\nDean Sujit Choudhry, prominent astronomer Geoff Marcy and vice chancellor of\nresearch Graham Fleming. The three faculty members were found to have violated\nUC's sexual harassment guidelines and resigned under pressure.Campus officials\nrecently fired assistant men's basketball coach Yann Hufnagel after finding\nthat he had sexually harassed a reporter by sending her explicit and\nthreatening text messages. Hufnagel's former boss, Head Coach Cuonzo Martin,\nis now under review for his handling of the situation.Although campus sexual\nmisconduct is a national problem, Berkeley has been a hotbed of protest over\nthe issue. In 2014, 31 women filed a federal complaint alleging a decades-long\npattern of mishandling cases by campus administrators. In the recent law\nschool case, faculty, students and staff have condemned Dirks and Steele for\nallowing Choudhry to stay in his job with a 10% pay cut, counseling and\napology to his then-executive assistant, Tyann Sorrell. She is suing Choudry\nand the regents for failing to take adequate steps to protect her from what\nshe alleged was near-daily unwanted kisses, hugs and touching over six months\nlast year. Choudhry has admitted the behavior but said it did not occur as\nfrequently as alleged.**Follow the Times' education initiative to inform\nparents, educators and students across California \u0026gt;\u0026gt;** Napolitano, who\nlearned about the case through the news media, stepped in and ordered Dirks to\nkeep Choudhry off campus through the end of the school year and refer him to\nthe Academic Senate for disciplinary hearings. She also directed Dirks to\nremove Fleming from a job as a campus \"global ambassador\" he was given after\nresigning.Aiming to stem the outcry, Dirks unveiled a new plan to combat\nsexual misconduct on Thursday, including quicker investigations, more money\nfor counseling and other services for victims and expanded education and\ntraining. Officials will also establish a new review committee to make sure\nsanctions are imposed in a \"firm and consistent manner regardless of the rank\nor position of either the complainant or respondent\" Dirks said in his\nannouncement.  Dirks said Saturday that he welcomed Napolitano's assistance in\nhelping Berkeley improve.  \"The president and I share a sense of urgency\naround the need for concerted action,\" Dirks said in a statement. \"I am fully\ncommitted to driving significant and substantive change on the Berkeley\ncampus.\"Dirks has named Carla Hesse, a history professor and executive dean of\nthe College of Letters \u0026amp; Science, to lead the campus improvement efforts\nuntil a permanent coordinator is hired in the summer.

Both sides say it's about values.Georgia lawmakers see\nthemselves as fighting to ensure religious freedom against societal trends and\nan ever-permissive Hollywood. But the entertainment industry, which is\nsometimes accused of resorting to situational ethics when the box office is at\nstake, says it's seeking to uphold values of its own.\"Diversity in all its\nforms is core to our value system and to the success of our business,\" Time\nWarner said in condemning the Georgia legislation. \"We strongly oppose the\ndiscriminatory language and intent of Georgia's pending religious liberty\nbill, which clearly violates the values and principles of inclusion and the\nability of all people to live and work free from discrimination.\"Although it's\nhard to predict just how widespread a boycott might be, there clearly is much\nat stake. Georgia has benefited enormously from film and TV production, while\nHollywood has enjoyed lucrative tax breaks and lower labor costs. Now**, **the\nfuture of that multibillion dollar relationship has been jeopardized by a\nGeorgia legislature determined to buttress its state from what it sees as the\ncountry's drift toward a liberalism that defies Christian values.Amid mounting\npressure from multinational corporations, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal on Monday\nannounced his plan to veto a contentious bill framed as protecting religious\nfreedom but that critics warned would lead to anti-gay discrimination.The\nbill, dubbed the Free Exercise Protection Act, would...Amid mounting pressure\nfrom multinational corporations, Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal on Monday announced\nhis plan to veto a contentious bill framed as protecting religious freedom but\nthat critics warned would lead to anti-gay discrimination.The bill, dubbed the\nFree Exercise Protection Act, would...What happens next is up to Republican\nGov. Nathan Deal, who is under intense pressure to veto legislation that would\nprotect faith-based institutions from providing services, such as performing\ngay marriages, contrary to their beliefs. Supporters of the bill, which was\npassed by lawmakers on March 16, say it safeguards religious freedoms and\nprotects institutions from hiring people whose lifestyles they oppose.The\nbacklash against the proposed Free Exercise Protection Act escalated last week\nwhen the Walt Disney Co., Netflix, Weinstein Co., Amblin Partners and other\nentertainment industry firms said they would cease production in Georgia if\nthe legislation is signed. They've joined other companies and institutions,\nincluding Atlanta-based heavyweights Coca-Cola, Delta Air Lines and Emory\nUniversity, which have come out to oppose the bill.More Hollywood studios and\nmedia companies are speaking out to put pressure on Georgia's governor to veto\nlegislation that backers say protects religious liberty but that is condemned\nby opponents as antigay.Time Warner on Thursday became the latest media\ncompany to join Disney, Viacom and AMC...More Hollywood studios and media\ncompanies are speaking out to put pressure on Georgia's governor to veto\nlegislation that backers say protects religious liberty but that is condemned\nby opponents as antigay.Time Warner on Thursday became the latest media\ncompany to join Disney, Viacom and AMC...At least 40 actors and filmmakers,\nincluding Anne Hathaway and Julianne Moore, entered the fray in what quickly\ncoalesced into a struggle viewed by conservatives as a Hollywood attempt to\nimpose its will on a state. Liberals, however, regard it as a morality play by\nGeorgia legislators whose politics don't speak to wider American sentiments on\ngay marriage and social issues.Georgia state Sen. Joshua McKoon, a Republican\nproponent of the bill, said he believes the legislation is good for his\nconstituents.\"We have numerous examples all over the state of people of faith\nbeing harassed or treated in a hostile way by various entities of government,\"\nMcKoon said. He cited as an example a \"cross-country athlete this past year\nwho was participating in a meet and he was disqualified for wearing a headband\nthat included a Scripture reference.\"\"There is no question,\" said McKoon, that\nthe fight over the bill is symptomatic of a wider culture gap between\nHollywood and conservative southern states such as Georgia. The battle over\nvalues, a catch-all code word for Democrats and Republicans, has propelled a\nparticularly acrimonious presidential campaign and has defined the\npolarization in American politics since Barack Obama became president.The\npolitical debate over gay and transgender rights is also reverberating in\nother states. In North Carolina, businesses, including American Airlines and\nLionsgate, have criticized a new state law that weakens civil rights\nprotections for bisexuals, gays and transgender people.The country is \"deeply\ndivided, and it's on many levels,\" said Wheeler Winston Dixon, a film studies\nprofessor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. \"This is the stuff democracy\nis about. Everyone gets to make their choice, and Disney is making its\n[choice] with where they would shoot. That's their right.\"Georgia, which chose\nDonald Trump over the more right-leaning Ted Cruz in its recent Republican\nprimary, follows California and New York as the third-largest hub for film and\ntelevision production in the country. In recent years it has offered hundreds\nof millions of dollars in tax breaks to producers and studios, and has grown\naccustomed to celebrities and big budget films.\"Fast and Furious 8\" and\n\"Baywatch\" are currently shooting in the state. In the last fiscal year 248\nfilms went into production in Georgia, bringing in more than $1.7 billion — up\nfrom $132.5 million in 2007. Georgia has been nicknamed the \"Hollywood of the\nSouth\" and Deal was instrumental in starting the Georgia Film Academy to help\nresidents find jobs in the movie business.Disney alone has funneled tens of\nmillions of dollars worth of production to the state. Recent Disney projects\nto shoot in Georgia have included the Marvel Studios-produced \"Ant-Man\" and\n\"Captain America: Civil War.\" The production of \"Ant-Man\" spent $106 million\nin the state and employed 3,579 Georgians.Film producer Bill Mechanic, the\nformer chairman and chief executive officer of Fox Filmed Entertainment, said\nthat the level of industry response to the Georgia bill has been \"highly\nunusual.\"\"I don't remember any other issue like this,\" said Mechanic, who\npreviously served as president of international distribution and worldwide\nvideo at Walt Disney Studios. He said it is a \"good thing that a social issue\nwas dealt with by somebody taking a stand.\"Actor and producer Mike O'Malley,\nthe show runner on Starz's Atlanta-based basketball comedy \"Survivor's\nRemorse,\" said that people working in Georgia's film economy are \"worried\nabout their employment.\"\"People don't want to travel to a place where you feel\nas if the majority of the people are in support of an idea of how people\nshould be treated when it is against your core beliefs,\" he said. \"Life is\nhard enough.\"I have nothing bad to say about Atlanta, but I hope Georgia\ndoesn't pass this bill,\" O'Malley said.McKoon, however, questioned whether\nstudios would make good on their boycott threats, claiming that their public\nstatements were an effort to score \"cheap public relations points.\"\"Hairspray\"\ndirector Adam Shankman, who produced the film \"The Last Song,\" which was shot\nin Georgia, insisted that the threats are genuine.\"We have other places to go\nto shoot,\" Shankman said. \"I believe that other states that are more liberal\nare going to take advantage of this and start offering those incentives to\njust steal that money back.\"Deal is in a sensitive predicament. His party is\nlooking to appease Republicans ahead of the November elections, but Deal has\nbeen dogged about attracting the movie business; he hosted a reception last\nyear dubbed \"Georgia Night in L.A.\" for studio executives and producers at the\nSunset Tower Hollywood.Those efforts now seem jeopardized by the controversial\nlegislation.\"If there is a boycott, it will absolutely hurt us, and you know\nwhat, it should,\" said Ric Reitz, president of SAG-AFTRA in Atlanta. \"This\ngoes beyond business in\ngeneral.\"jeffrey.fleishman@latimes.comdaniel.miller@latimes.com_Times staff\nwriters Josh Rottenberg and Yvonne Villarreal contributed to this\nreport._**ALSO****'It's not supposed to be this way': Why it's getting more\ndifficult for foster families****Deal reached to boost California's minimum\nwage to $15, avoiding ballot box battle****UC President Napolitano to keep\nclose tabs on Berkeley's actions against sexual misconduct**\n\n","title":"Anti-gay bill pits Georgia's conservative values against Hollywood's inclusivity — much like the nation's political divide - LA Times","twitter":{"body":"Anti-gay bill pits Georgia values against Hollywood values https://t.co/oUcyKufnbS https://t.co/zcLJqKdrGu","date":"Sun Mar 27 12:27:50 +0000 2016","favs":35,"id":{"$numberLong":"714066396402028544"},"retweets":39},"topic":"all","source":"latimes","link":"http://lat.ms/22R8eKq"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc6b5"},"content":"In an era when family films are almost exclusively comic book adaptations and\nanimated adventures, \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2\" is a relative rarity: a big-\nhearted, relationship-driven movie suitable for a multi-generational audience.\nNo computer-generated cities were harmed in the making of this film — although\na few clichés are pounded relentlessly.As with the original romantic comedy, a\ntrue word-of-mouth hit that became a box office juggernaut in 2002, \"My Big\nFat Greek Wedding 2\" finds a universal story in the saga of the suffocating\nGreek American Portokalos clan. The sequel is a little like a bear hug from a\nbeloved old relative — the embrace is too tight, the perfume is too strong,\nbut ultimately it still leaves you feeling good inside.**SIGN UP for the free\nIndie Focus movies newsletter \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**The first film, based on star and\nscreenwriter Nia Vardalos' one-woman theater show, earned an Academy Award\nnomination for original screenplay and a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination\nfor its cast, and yielded a short-lived sitcom. Its depiction of a loving — if\ncrazy — immigrant family inspired by Vardalos' own seemed to catch a cultural\nmoment when audiences were embracing sincerity.Ever since Adam and Eve came\nupon a second tree in the Garden of Eden, mankind has been intrigued by\ncounterprogramming. Sure, there's an appealing option right in front of us,\nbut maybe the other one is a little better?That stretches, in a rather\ndifferent manner, all the way to the current moment...Ever since Adam and Eve\ncame upon a second tree in the Garden of Eden, mankind has been intrigued by\ncounterprogramming. Sure, there's an appealing option right in front of us,\nbut maybe the other one is a little better?That stretches, in a rather\ndifferent manner, all the way to the current moment...Fourteen years later,\nthat tone may be a harder sell. This time Vardalos' Toula is the daughter of\nthe bride, as Lainie Kazan's Maria and Michael Constantine's Gus discover that\ntheir 50-year marriage was never actually official. As her parents deal with\nmarital doubts, Toula's own daughter, Paris (Elena Kampouris), is college\nshopping and hoping to get some breathing room from her hovering\nbrood.Vardalos mainly sticks to her formula. As in the original film, which\nwas directed by Joel Zwick, the characters are broad, and the conflict comes\nfrom tensions between the zany, first-generation Greeks and their more toned-\ndown Americanized heirs.Thanks to the charisma and warmth of the older cast\nmembers, working this time under the laid-back direction of Englishman Kirk\nJones (\"Waking Ned Devine\"), this works more often than it doesn't, and even\nfamiliar jokes manage to land.The filmmakers still rely on sitcom-style gags —\nthe reveal of a gaudy backyard wedding tent, the excessive spritz of a bottle\nof Windex — but Vardalos wisely surrenders much of the screen time to her\nsupporting cast, and what the movie lacks in polish it makes up for in\nsoul.Constantine delivers an appealing mixture of bravado and bumbling as Gus,\na man claiming cultural superiority who doesn't know how to use a computer\nmouse. According to Gus, the Greeks invented everything, even Italy, and now\nhe's on an Internet quest to confirm that he is a direct descendant of\nAlexander the Great. In a sequence that will feel familiar to anyone who has\never introduced an older relative to Google, this quest will take a\nvillage.It's easy to see why the family hovers in Maria's orbit, as Kazan,\ntoo, projects a confidence and earthy sense of fun even when she's just\npresiding over her kitchen island. Later in the film, when Maria wonders\nwhether a life with Gus was all her destiny held, Kazan reveals the vulnerable\nheart beating under the muumuus. Andrea Martin is also a scene stealer,\ndispensing unsolicited advice (\"Shave everything!\") with brio.Unfortunately\nVardalos and John Corbett, who returns as Toula's unfailingly patient WASP\nhusband, Ian, have a lot less appeal than their older counterparts. Ian is as\nunderwritten as any bland wife character in an Adam Sandler movie, and his\nsaintly tolerance for his in-laws leaves Corbett with precious little to do,\nwhile Vardalos' mugging style of acting fails in selling their love. The plot\nline that this marriage is in a passionless rut may be almost too believable —\nat a certain point it's not clear these two people even know each\nother.Perhaps charisma skips a generation, because as teenager Paris,\nKampouris manages the impossible task of playing a sulky adolescent you'd\nactually want to spend time around. Her timing is funny and true in appalled\nreactions to her grandfather's premature concern for her fertility and her\nmother's clinging, and her budding romance with a cute schoolmate (Alex Wolff)\nfeels sweet rather than saccharine.It's unlikely \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding 2\"\nwill ever match the jaw-dropping box office success of the first film, but it\nmatches it in one important regard — heart.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc6b6"},"content":"Joanna Newsom didn’t hear the question — or at least she pretended not\nto.Pausing her performance at the Orpheum Theatre on Friday night to tune her\nmassive harp, Newsom opened the floor for an impromptu question-and-answer\nsession.Someone in the audience asked which Kate Bush album is her favorite.\n(She couldn’t decide.) Someone else asked what she dreams about. (Accidentally\nleaving a friend off the guest list.) And then someone asked about Andy\nSamberg, the comedy star to whom she’s married.The words hung in the air for a\nsecond as she tinkered away at the harp’s strings.“Any other questions?” she\nsaid.The desire for mystique against the demands of celebrity: This exchange,\nlike much of the concert, reflected Newsom’s position at an improbable\ncrossroads.A native of tiny Nevada City in northern California, she emerged in\n2004 as part of the so-called freak-folk scene that included Devendra Banhart\nand Animal Collective. But over the next decade, her music grew more\nidiosyncratic, with traces of ragtime and bluegrass and lyrics dense with\nallusions to history and literature. Her latest album, the masterful “Divers,”\nis her most erudite yet.At the same time, Newsom, who is related to California\nLt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, has become increasingly visible outside the insular\nrealm of highbrow indie rock. She’s now a regular presence on red carpets, for\ninstance, alongside Samberg, who took in Friday’s gig from a stage-right box\nseat. Watch the video for Joanna Newsom's song \"Divers.\"Watch the video for\nJoanna Newsom's song \"Divers.\"In 2014, she worked as an actor herself in\ndirector Paul Thomas Anderson’s big-screen adaptation of Thomas Pynchon’s\n“Inherent Vice.” And this summer, she’ll appear in a musical mockumentary from\nSamberg’s comedy troupe, the Lonely Island.At the Orpheum, where she’s set for\na second show on Saturday, Newsom was getting something of the pop-idol\ntreatment from her fans, who cheered the singer as heartily as Taylor Swift’s\nfaithful cheer her. During the Q\u0026amp;A, one person even asked who she was\nwearing.Michael van der Ham, she replied cheerfully, her red-carpet experience\nclearly coming in handy. She added that van der Ham had designed 11 dresses\nfor her, one for each song on “Divers.”This pop semistardom hasn’t diminished\nthe scholarly complexity of Newsom’s music, which poured forth Friday in a\ngreat stream of sound: quickly but carefully plucked harp notes; flecks of\nbanjo, piano and mbira from the members of her five-piece band; percussion\nthat could make the songs swing or steady them with a stately boom; and, most\nmemorably, Newsom’s darting, interval-jumping vocals.For the last few songs of\nher nearly two-hour set, Newsom invited two guests — Robin Pecknold of Fleet\nFoxes and Amber Coffman of Dirty Projectors — to join in as singers, which\nmade the sound more dizzying still.If she’s maintained a kind of artisanal\nvision, though, she’s also opened up her music to offer more of what people\ncome to pop for: beauty, humor, sensuality. This was by far the most\nemotionally vivid of the Newsom performances I’ve seen, with a human warmth I\ndon’t always get from her impeccably arranged recordings.“I ain’t saying that\nI loved you first, but I loved you best,” she sang in the gently thrumming\ntitle song from “Divers,” and the tenderness in her voice led you to believe\nshe was addressing her famous husband, as opposed to speaking for some obscure\nliterary figure.Is that precisely the reductive reasoning she was trying to\nshut down by dodging the question about Samberg? Of course. But Newsom seemed\nto accept the misunderstanding.**Twitter: @mikaelwood**\n\n","title":"Is Joanna Newsom an artist or a pop star?

Everything\nfrom grade school to graduate school.But my knees wobbled when I was offered a\nchance to teach an evening class at Cal State L.A.Why?Because visiting a class\nto answer a few questions and offer a few tips — never to return again — isn't\nthat big of a challenge. But a teacher has to actually teach.And I didn't know\nhow to do that, even though I was pretty familiar with the subject: How to\nfind and tell stories.Still, I took a leap.As someone who spouts off now and\nthen about education, it couldn't hurt to do a little honest homework.And I\ndid it because I'm a graduate of the Cal State system (San Jose State, 1975),\nand I believe in it.The mission is the same as ever — offer a quality\neducation at a reasonable price — although tuition has spiked in recent times.\nEvery year, tens of thousands of graduates, many from humble means, help drive\nCalifornia's economy when they go into healthcare, business, technology,\nsocial sciences, engineering, law enforcement, communications and teaching.So\nI asked teachers for some advice, and David Olsen, chairman of Cal State\nL.A.'s communications department, helped me put together a syllabus that\noffered something to aspiring journalists, TV/film majors and students\ninterested in polishing their writing skills.And then on a Monday night in\nJanuary, I found myself standing before 20 upperclassmen and grad students,\nall of whom looked at me expectantly.It was the first of 10 classes in the\nwinter quarter, each one from 6:10 to 10 p.m., which struck me — as I passed\nout my syllabus — as an eternity. That's a lot of teaching for a flat-footed\nrookie, and I loosened my collar, feeling the heat.What if I ran out of things\nto say?My students, I soon learned, do a lot of juggling. Most of them work,\nsome of them full time, and care for families. They save money, take classes\nwhen they can afford them and keep pursuing the dream of a college degree,\neven if it takes six or eight or 10 years to earn the paper.**See more of our\ntop stories on Facebook \u0026gt;\u0026gt;**I owed them something, and I made it through\nthe first session encouraged not so much by my performance but by my students'\nengagement. With the exception of one young man who may or may not have been\nawake — I couldn't tell for sure, and he later dropped the class — they\nlistened, and spoke up, and we began to get to know each other through a\nshared love of words.I followed all the advice I'd gotten from real teachers:\nSplit the students into groups, have them read each other's work, find ways to\nspark class discussions and bring in guest speakers.My appreciation of\nteachers is now greater than ever.Two students sitting next to each other\nmight have vastly different skill levels, and you've got to find a way to\naddress their very different needs.Meeting one-on-one during office hours\nhelps. But I've come away from this experience even more convinced that\npacking 30 or 40-plus students into a classroom — the norm in public K-12\nschools — is insane. It's a burden on teachers and a disservice to\nstudents.The 10-week course ended just as I was getting to know my students,\nand realizing that while I may have helped them find ways to shape stories,\nthey were teaching me things about the city I cover.Daniel Noriega wrote about\nhis grandfather riding through East Los Angeles on a bicycle, collecting\ndiscarded toys for a backyard shrine, believing that each toy represents \"the\nlost spirit of a child.\"Noriega wrote that his mother took this idea to the\nnext level, caring for troubled, wayward children. When one later died, she\npaid for his coffin, and then \"La Mama de East L.A.\" started a nonprofit to\nbuy coffins for other families that couldn't afford proper burials for loved\nones.Brandon Winfield — a full-time student and laborer — would often hustle\ninto class a few minutes late, just off work from laying underground wire. His\nterm paper was an account of the culture shock his African American family\nendured when his mother, determined to keep her kids safe, shepherded her\nbrood out of South-Central and into the San Gabriel Valley.**Follow the Times'\neducation initiative to inform parents, educators and students across\nCalifornia \u0026gt;\u0026gt;** Former teacher Claudia Mercado took care of her parents,\nworked several jobs and commuted 30 miles to school in pursuit of her\nmaster's. She wrote a poetry-infused tribute to a Northeast Los Angeles\nwomen's activism and art collective — Mujeres de Maiz — where kindred spirits\nhave connected through stories of personal struggle and cultural pride.Gus\nUgalde Jr. — my oldest student, in his 50s — told me how upset he was about\nthe demolition of the Sixth Street bridge in February, because it held special\nmemories of his youth in Boyle Heights. Then tell me a story, I told him. And\nhe did, writing that in his memories, the days are long and never turn to\nnight, and he is riding his bike across the bridge or crossing it on foot,\nholding his grandmother's hand.\"I can still hear the sound of my corduroy\npants rubbing against each other like that of clothes being scrubbed on an\nold-fashioned washboard. It was perpetual summer. I could still see grandma\nholding her parasol overhead to shield herself from the unyielding rays of the\nsun.\"A new crop of students is coming in now for the start of the spring\nquarter, and I feel a little more confident this time around.We'll write,\nwe'll talk, we'll get to know each other.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a793dea3b36a58fbc6b9"},"content":"Bernie Sanders scored three wins in Western caucus contests Saturday, giving a\npowerful psychological boost to his supporters but doing little to move him\ncloser to securing the Democratic nomination.While results in Washington and\nAlaska barely dented Hillary Clinton's significant delegate lead, Sanders'\nwins underscored her persistent vulnerabilities within her own party,\nparticularly with young voters and liberal activists who have been inspired by\nher rival's unapologetically liberal message. Sanders also won the Hawaii\ncaucus.In an interview with The Associated Press, Sanders cast his performance\nas part of a Western comeback, saying he expects to close the delegate gap\nwith Clinton as the contest moves to the more liberal northeastern states,\nincluding her home state of New York. He also said his campaign is increasing\nits outreach to superdelegates, the party insiders who can pick either\ncandidate, and are overwhelmingly with Clinton.**Election 2016 | Live coverage\non Trail Guide | March 22 election results | Track the delegate race | Sign up\nfor the newsletter  **“The Deep South is a very conservative part of the\ncountry,” he said. “Now that we're heading into a progressive part of the\ncountry, we expect to do much better.”He added: “There is a path to victory.”\nWith Clinton far in front, however, it is a difficult path.Clinton anticipated\nthe losses: She barely campaigned in the three states, making just one day of\nstops in Washington state, and was spending the Easter weekend with her\nfamily.She is turning her focus to the April 19 contest in New York, seeking\nto win a large share of the delegates at stake and to avoid the blow of losing\nto Sanders in a state she represented in the Senate. She is trying to lock up\nan even larger share of delegates in five Northeastern contests a week later,\nhoping to deliver a big enough haul to unify the Democratic Party and relegate\nSanders to little more than a protest candidate.Sanders, who's found some\nsuccess in the industrial Midwest, wants to leverage his working-class support\nand fiery arguments against free trade into an April 5 victory in delegate-\nrich Wisconsin. He also plans to compete fiercely in New York and is pushing\nfor the party to schedule a debate in the state, saying in the interview that\nit would be “really absurd” if one did not take place.After Sanders' two early\nwins in Washington and Alaska on Saturday, Clinton held a delegate lead of\n1,234 to 956 over Sanders, according to an Associated Press analysis, an\nadvantage that expands to 1,703-985 once the superdelegates are included. It\ntakes 2,383 delegates to win.Based on the AP count, Sanders needs to win more\nthan 57 percent of the remaining delegates from primaries and caucuses to have\na majority of those delegates by June's end.His bar is even higher when the\nparty officials are considered. He needs to win more than 67 percent of the\nremaining delegates overall — from primaries, caucuses and the ranks of\nuncommitted superdelegates — to prevail.He was unlikely to emerge from his\nSaturday sweep with significantly more delegates, winning at least 36\ndelegates to Clinton's 11 for the day after his victories in Alaska and\nWashington. More are likely to be allocated to Sanders in several weeks, when\nWashington state Democratic party releases vote shares by district. Sixty-\nseven delegates are awarded based on results in the state's congressional\ndistricts.But there's little question that Sanders has tapped into a powerful\nfrustration within the party. He continues to attract tens of thousands to his\nrallies and has collected more than $140 million from 4.7 million\ndonations.Most of his 14 primary-season wins have been in states with largely\nwhite populations and in caucus contests, which tend to attract the most\nactive liberal Democrats. He's heavily favored by younger voters, who were a\nkey part of the coalition that boosted Barack Obama to victory twice.\nClinton's ability to win the White House, should she capture the nomination,\nwill hinge on how well she can motivate his passionate and politically active\nsupporters.In Spokane, Wash., a huge line of caucus attendees — largely\nSanders backers — snaked around a high school parking lot Saturday morning.“I\nthink one of the biggest things is free tuition for students,” said Savannah\nDills, 24, a college student who supports Sanders. “And getting big money out\nof politics. He's not paid for by billionaires.”Retiree Dan McLay, 64,\nattended the caucus in a hard-hat, which he joked he needed because he was one\nof the relatively few Clinton supporters in the big crowd.“Look at this thing\nin Brussels,” McLay said, referring to the deadly attack in Belgium this week.\n“We need a real experienced leader.”It was strong support for Sanders that\nbrought Kirsa Hughes-Skandijs out to her first caucus in Juneau, Alaska.“This\nis the first time I've ever felt that kind of belief in a candidate, that they\nmean what they say and that they are not saying what they think people want to\nhear,” she said.**ALSO****Why winning California's presidential primary won't\nbe easy for Bernie Sanders****Clinton criticizes lax campaign finance laws\nbetween two L.A.-area fundraisers****Bernie Sanders discusses his prospects of\nbeating Donald Trump with the L.A.

Her\ncreations were delicious but looked dreadful, so she considered starting a\nbusiness called \"The Ugly Cake Company.\"Instead, she joined forces with\nStanley and Muller to create Au Fudge, a restaurant where the food — even the\ngrass-fed beef burger and baked mac and cheese — is organic, all-natural and\ndye-free. With an Anthropologie-furnished creative space where kids can play\nunder the supervision of au pairs employed by the restaurant.

(She has a 10-month old son with husband Justin\nTimberlake.) Gwyneth Paltrow, whose lifestyle brand Goop recently launched its\nown line of beauty products, said this month on the \"Today\" show that she is\ntaking a break from acting because she felt a financial responsibility to her\nGoop investors to focus on the company. Drew Barrymore, who also has her own\ncosmetics line, has said that her acting roles will be \"few and far between\"\nuntil her two daughters are older. And the Honest Company co-founder Jessica\nAlba, whose nontoxic household goods brand is now valued at more than $1\nbillion, is so busy running her business she hasn't had a major role in a film\nsince 2014.There are of course business-minded actresses with young children\nwho are starring in movies, including Reese Witherspoon and Kate Hudson. Biel,\nwho rose to fame on the WB show \"7th Heaven,\" said she intends to follow that\ntrack. Though she took the majority of last year off from acting to focus on\nraising her baby, she has three films in production for 2016, including \"The\nDevil and the Deep Blue Sea,\" which premieres in April at the Tribeca Film\nFestival.Stanley, who has long dressed Biel for the red carpet and also\ndesigned the interior of her home, initially thought the actress might be\ninterested in providing the baked goods for Au Fudge.\"But I'm not a baker,\nreally. I have no clue what I'm doing,\" said Biel. \"So I put my focus toward\nhelping be a part of the nutritional stuff … here. I want this to be like our\nversion of 'Cheers.' We want a local spot.\"Before Au Fudge opened this month,\nBiel was with Stanley and Muller at one of the restaurant's corner tables.\nThey had coordinated their outfits: three gauzy pastel floral ensembles that\nmade them look like the sisters in \"The Virgin Suicides.\"\"We're wearing\nZimmermann,\" Stanley said, referring to the Australian designer. \"Will you be\nsure to say we were wearing Zimmermann?\"Bar and dining area at Au Fudge in\nWest Hollywood.Bar and dining area at Au Fudge in West Hollywood.When news of\nAu Fudge first leaked in 2014, the press wasn't exactly kind.

Because of its location right near the\npaparazzi hot spot Craig's, Au Fudge is attracting star onlookers.

There is no membership fee, though leaving your child with an au\npair for two hours does cost $15. Still, Biel seems defensive about the idea\nthat the restaurant is uppity.\"You can call me snotty. You can call me\nelitist. Whatever you want,\" said Biel. \"We are providing a space where you\ncan eat and be comfortable and confident that your children are not being\npumped full of hormones and chemicals. You can come here and know that it's\nsafe for your kid to crawl on the floor because what we're cleaning the floor\nwith is safe. You can come in here and know we are doing everything we can to\nbe sustainable in terms of our energy and our waste. And if we're snot faces\nor elitists for that, I think we're OK with that.\"It's important that Au Fudge\nbe viewed as more than an only-in-L.A. vanity project for financial reasons\ntoo. Biel views the idea as a long-term play — the kind of place that could\nhave locations nationwide — which is why she brought in partners Jonathan\nRollo and Joey Gonzalez. Rollo is the founder of Greenleaf Gourmet Chopshop,\nwhile Gonzalez is the CEO of Barry's Bootcamp; they are also a married couple.\n(Australia-based Monica Saunders-Weinberg, co-chairman of Terrace Tower, is\nalso a partner in the restaurant.)\"We want to make this part of the country's\ncommunity,\" Biel said. \"This should be in places where families are going all\nthe time. Like airports!\"\"I think everyone is starting to understand that you\nget what you pay for,\" added Rollo, who had joined the conversation midway.\n\"When you can establish yourself as a trustworthy brand — which is what we are\ndoing — people will be more accepting of the price. We're not here to gouge\npeople. We are not looking to pay this back in six months. The idea is not to\nbe just a small, one-off anything. This is a long-term play for us.\"\"You can\nfind me at the one in Italy or the Hamps,\" joked Stanley, referring to the\nHamptons.

Special craft kits let kids make kaleidoscopes, snow globes or\nkites.\"Aesthetically beautiful arts and crafts projects that you'd actually\nwant to hang on your wall,\" explained Muller. \"And we'll have classes too.\nDuring dinner, maybe the kids are making bread and the au pairs will put it in\nthe oven so when you leave, you're leaving with fresh bread for the\nmorning.\"\"It's called a creative space for a reason,\" added Stanley, who said\nthey'd received more than 1,100 resumes for the au pair positions. \"There's\nnot like a plastic ball thing and jungle gyms.
