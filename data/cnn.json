Pat McCrory, responded to a Charlotte\nCity Council ordinance approved in February that would have extended\nprotections to gays and lesbians as well as bisexual and transgender people\nwhile at hotels, restaurants and stores. Charlotte also would have allowed\ntransgender people to use the restroom aligned with their gender identity.Also\non Friday, Pepsico CEO Indra Nooyi sent a letter to McCrory calling on him to\nconsider repealing the measure when the General Assembly convenes in Raleigh\nlater this month.Nooyi said she was taken aback by the law as well as\nMcCrory's decision to sign it so quickly. She said the measure is \"completely\ninconsistent\" with the way her company treats its workers, and that it\nundermines efforts to advance North Carolina's long-term interests.Pepsi-Cola\ntraces its roots to North Carolina, where it was created in the late 1890s by\nNew Bern pharmacist Caleb Bradham. PepsiCo's annual shareholder meetings have\nbeen held in New Bern in the past several years.Separately Friday, the venture\ncapital arm of Google's parent corporation confirmed it won't invest in North\nCarolina startup businesses while the law is in place. GV spokeswoman Jodi\nOlson cited written comments by CEO Bill Maris in which he asked his firm's\npartners to flag possible North Carolina investments because he's \"not\ncomfortable deploying dollars into startups there until the voters there fix\nthis.\" The move was first reported by Re/code, a tech-focused news site.The\nnew law blocked Charlotte's rules and prevented other local governments from\napproving similar ordinances. And government agencies of all kinds must now\nrequire people who use multi-stall public restrooms to use the one that\ncorresponds with their biological sex.District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser\nand Boston's city council also this week banned government-connected travel to\nNorth Carolina as a sign of opposition to the law. Similar travel bans have\nbeen issued by the governors of Washington, New York and Connecticut and by\nother cities.Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton sent a letter on Saturday banning\nstate employees from nonessential travel to North Carolina because of the law.\nHe directed all state workers to stop all nonessential travel to North\nCarolina for conferences or other official state business until further\nnotice.NCAA President Mark Emmert says he has spoken to North Carolina's\ngovernor about the state's new law excluding LGBT people from\nantidiscrimination protections, making clear if it remains in place it will\naffect the state's chances to host major college athletic eventsA rally was\nheld early Friday night in front of the Legislative Building to support\ntransgender people and to oppose the law. Supporters of the new law held\nprayer vigils Thursday night in multiple locations in eastern North Carolina.\nOne was held across from the Executive Mansion, where McCrory lives.Supporters\nof the law say hundreds of businesses support the law and have signed on to\ntheir own letter praising McCrory and the legislature.McCrory and a key\nlawmaker this week suggested some changes are possible to the law. But Senate\nleader Phil Berger, has no appetite for them because \"an overwhelming majority\nof North Carolinians we've heard from support\" the law, spokeswoman Shelly\nCarver said in a release.

SANA news\nagency reported they were killed by Islamic State militants and said some of\nthe bodies were beheaded and bore signs of torture.Syrian army experts\ndetonated hundreds of mines they say were planted by the Islamic State before\nthey were forced out of Palmyra last Sunday, according to the Associated\nPress.Reporters were able to tour the archaeological gem that had attracted\ntens of thousands of tourists every year before the Islamic State captured the\ncity and destroyed most of its Christian artifacts. While, some parts of the\nsite, including the Roman-era grand colonnades and amphitheater appeared\nrelatively untouched, the damage every else was very much visible.According to\nthe Associated Press the Arch of Triumph – which was under the Roman emperor\nSeptimus Severus between A.D. 193 and A.D. 211, has been reduced to a pile of\nstones. The monumental arch once sat atop the famed colonnaded streets of the\nancient town.The Temple of Baalshamin and parts of the Temple of Bel, one of\nthe best-preserved Roman-era sites, are also destroyed.The town was completely\ndeserted Friday, except for Syrian army soldiers working on dismantling\nexplosives and visiting journalists.

That was after the Wildcats made easy\nwork of Buddy Hield and Oklahoma, with a 95-51 trampling that was the biggest\nmargin of victory in a national semifinal game.Villanova (34-5) did it with\n71.4 percent shooting led by Josh Hart, who scored 23 points on 10 of 12\nshooting.That percentage was the second best in the history of the Final Four.\nThe only team to shoot better was that 1985 team which won the title with a\nvictory over Georgetown by hitting 78.6 percent of its shots.\"They shot the\nball very efficient tonight,\" Hield said of Villanova. \"If a team do this, I\nfeel they can go win it all.\"It won't be easy against the only No. 1 seed to\nadvance to the Final Four this season. Coach Roy Williams has already led two\nNorth Carolina teams to championships and this squad has won each of its five\ntournament games this year by an average of 16.2 points.Williams wasn't ready\nto talk about the next game just minutes after North Carolina had wrapped up\nits semifinal victory.\"Marty Schottenheimer, the coach of the Chiefs a long\ntime ago, had the greatest saying in the world: 'Enjoy the dickens out of it\nuntil midnight and then worry about that other team,'\" he said.North Carolina\nhas reached the title game for the 10th time and it will be just the third\nappearance for Villanova.The Wildcats seemed to handle their easy win exactly\nthe way a coach would hope a team with its biggest game to come would. Forward\nDaniel Ochefu, who was one of six Villanova players to score in double\nfigures, insisted there was no postgame revelry after Saturday night's\nvictory.\"It was very businesslike,\" he said. \"No one was celebrating. Everyone\nunderstands that our next game on Monday we'll be playing a great team and\nwe're not celebrating. We told each other at the end of the game that we have\na lot of work to do. We can still get better.\"North Carolina also had a\nbalanced scoring attack in its semifinal win with Brice Johnson and Justin\nJackson adding 16 points each to go with 15 from Kennedy Meeks and Marcus\nPaige's 13.But it was the defensive effort of the Tar Heels that Williams was\nmost excited about.\"The last four weeks we've been much, much better\ndefensively,\" he said. \"We had a brain lapse there for about three minutes in\nthe second half, but other than that I thought we were really good defensively\nagainst a team that's hard to guard.\"The matchup on Monday could be\ninteresting inside after both teams dominated in the paint on Saturday.\nVillanova outscored Oklahoma 38-20 inside and North Carolina had more points\nbut the same margin by making 50 inside to 32 by Syracuse.  \n__\n\n","title":"North Carolina, Villanova to meet in NCAA final | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"North Carolina, Villanova to meet in NCAA final https://t.co/azeEybxo5Z https://t.co/g5Ic658mj2","date":"Sun Apr 03 03:39:48 +0000 2016","favs":155,"id":{"$numberLong":"716470227802796032"},"retweets":61},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1M8yjjW"}

(Don Boomer/The San Diego Union-Tribune via AP)LOS\nANGELES –  A small plane that made headlines when it landed safely on a\nSouthern California freeway years ago crashed on the same stretch of road\nSaturday, slamming into a car and killing a woman in the vehicle.Five others,\nincluding the pilot and his passenger, were injured in the crash on a stretch\nof Interstate 15 that has been the scene of several emergency\nlandings.Witnesses said the single-engine plane appeared to be having problems\nbefore it banked and came down, California Highway Patrol Officer Chris Parent\nsaid. One man said he didn't hear the plane's engine as it passed overhead.The\nLancair IV landed on its belly and skidded about 250 feet before striking the\nrear of a black Nissan Altima sedan that was stopped on the shoulder of the\nroad in San Diego County near Fallbrook. The driver of the car had pulled over\nto synchronize the Bluetooth device on his phone, Parent said.The impact\ncrumpled the back of the car, fatally crushing Antoinette Isbelle, 38, of San\nDiego in the back seat and injuring three others in the vehicle, authorities\nsaid.\"The plane went completely into the trunk and pushed the rear bumper\nalmost into the rear passenger seat,\" said John Buchanan, spokesman for the\nNorth County Fire Protection District.Pilot Dennis Hogge, 62, and his female\npassenger suffered major injuries, Parent said. The driver suffered moderate\ninjuries, and his other two passengers were expected to survive their\ninjuries.The plane was once owned by major league catcher Matt Nokes, who made\na noteworthy landing on busy I-15 when the engine quit on its second flight on\nFeb. 18, 2000.Nokes guided the high-performance $500,000 plane to a smooth\nlanding and safely taxied off the road without injuries.Nokes went on to fly\nthe plane every day for five years without incident before selling it. He said\nit had been rebuilt several times since he sold it.\"It was crazy,\" Nokes told\nThe Associated Press on Saturday. \"Everything worked out so beautifully. It\nwas almost a humorous thing. Unfortunately, it doesn't always turn out that\nway.\"When Nokes heard about the crash, he unsuccessfully tried to reach Hogge.\nHe didn't realize Hogge had been injured.He described Hogge as a good man, an\noutstanding pilot and a master plane builder.\"It's just horrible to hear\nabout,\" said Nokes who spent 11 years in the majors, mostly with the Detroit\nTigers and New York Yankees.The stretch of freeway is no stranger to unusual\nlandings. Parent said he's aware of three other planes that have come down on\nthat stretch of freeway about 50 miles north of San Diego in the past\ndecade.Nokes said the freeway is a popular route for flying because there are\nfewer flight restrictions than along the Interstate 5 corridor.The crash\ncaused major backups throughout the day on the freeway that runs from the\nMexican border through Las Vegas and Salt Lake City to Canada.The Federal\nAviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board will\ninvestigate the crash, FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said.  \n__\n\n","title":"1 killed, 5 others injured after plane lands on California freeway | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"1 killed, 5 others injured after plane lands on California freeway https://t.co/DaxNoUZKCs https://t.co/tz9QmK596F","date":"Sun Apr 03 03:10:38 +0000 2016","favs":104,"id":{"$numberLong":"716462889192726536"},"retweets":96},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1X7R6fP"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc95875"},"content":"  The Clinton campaign has met rival Sen. Bernie Sanders’ challenge to debate\nhim in New York ahead on the state’s April 19 primary, but the final\nnegotiations have resulted in the kind of acrimony the has pervaded their\nprimary contest in recent days.The Clinton campaign said Saturday that the\nSanders team rejected three days offered this week: Monday night, the evening\nof April 14 or on ABC’s April 15 “Good Morning America” show.“The Sanders\ncampaign needs to stop using the New York primary as a playground for\npolitical games and negative attacks against Hillary Clinton,” said Clinton\nNational Press Secretary Brian Fallon.He said the Monday date was apparently\nrejected because the Sanders campaign wanted the debate after Tuesday’s\nMilwaukee primary and that the April 14 and 15 offers still stand.Clinton has\na huge delegate lead over Sanders in the race to win the Democratic nomination\nin July. However, Sanders is on roll, having recently upset Clinton in the\nMichigan primary and taken five of the last six state contests. And polls show\nhe’s in a tight race with Clinton in Wisconsin.A loss in delegate-rich\nWisconsin or New York would be a major setback for Clinton, particularly in\nNew York, her adopted home state for which she was a U.S. senator. Sanders was\nborn in Brooklyn.The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest\nname in politics. See Latest Coverage →“We are very pleased that Secretary\nClinton finally has accepted our request for a debate,” Sanders spokesman\nMichael Briggs said in response to the offers. “Unfortunately, the dates and\nvenues she has proposed don’t make a whole lot of sense.”Briggs the Monday\nnight idea is “ludicrous,” considering the NCAA men’s basketball finals are\nbeing played at that time and Syracuse could be one of the teams.  \nHe left open the possibility of compromise by saying, “We hope we can reach\nagreement in the near future.”However, the episode capped an especially\nscrappy week for the campaigns.Clinton snapped at a Greenpeace protester. She\nlinked Sanders and Tea party Republicans. And she bristled with anger when\nnearly two dozen Sanders supporters marched out of an event near her home\noutside New York City, shouting \"if she wins, we lose.\"\"They don't want to\nlisten to anyone else,\" she shot back. \"We actually have to do something. Not\njust complain about what is happening.\"After a year of campaigning, months of\ndebates and 35 primary elections, Sanders is finally getting under Clinton's\nskin in the Democratic presidential race.Clinton has spent weeks largely\nignoring Sanders and trying to focus on Republican front-runner Donald Trump.\nNow, after several primary losses and with a tough fight in New York on the\nhorizon, Clinton is showing flashes of frustration with the Vermont senator —\nirritation that could undermine her efforts to unite the party around her\ncandidacy.According to Democrats close to Hillary and former President Bill\nClinton, both are frustrated by Sanders' ability to cast himself as above\npolitics-as-usual even while firing off what they consider to be misleading\nattacks. The Clintons are even more annoyed that Sanders' approach seems to be\nrallying — and keeping — young voters by his side.While Hillary Clinton's team\ncontends her lock on the nomination as \"nearly insurmountable,\" the campaign\nfrequently grumbles that Sanders hasn't faced the same level of scrutiny as\nthe former secretary of state, New York senator and first lady. Her aides\ncomplain about Sanders' rhetoric, claiming he's broken his pledge to avoid\ncharacter attacks by going after her paid speeches and ties to Wall Street,\nand they point to scenes of Sanders supporters booing Clinton's name at his\nrallies.Actress Rosario Dawson's 15-minute speech at a New York City rally on\nThursday, in which she rallied the crowd by crying \"shame on you, Hillary\" and\nnoted that Clinton could soon face an FBI interview over the email controversy\nwhile at the State Department, underscored the growing tensions between the\ncampaigns.Clinton hopes that big victories in New York and five Northeastern\nstates a week later will allow her to wrap up the nomination by the end of the\nmonth.But aides acknowledge that Sanders, who's raised $109 million this year\nand has pledged to take his campaign to the party convention in July, is\nunlikely to feel significant political or financial pressure to drop out of\nthe race, even if it becomes clear he cannot win the nomination.Clinton stayed\nin the 2008 contest against Barack Obama until the bitter end, though her\ninitial advantage with superdelegates, who later flipped to the Illinois\nsenator, gave her a stronger case for the nomination.Unlike eight years ago,\nwhen California Sen. Dianne Feinstein brought Clinton and Obama together for a\nmeeting, few Democrats are in position to broker peace between Clinton and\nSanders. For most of his political career, Sanders identified as an\nindependent — not a Democrat — leaving him with far weaker ties to party\npowerbrokers.According to an Associated Press analysis, Sanders must win 67\npercent of the remaining delegates and uncommitted superdelegates — party\nleaders and officials who can support any candidate — through June to be able\nto clinch the Democratic nomination. So far he's only winning 37 percent.Joel\nBenenson, Clinton's chief strategist, said: \"We're going to get to a point at\nthe end of April where there just isn't enough real estate for him to overcome\nthe lead that we've built.\"Still, any kind of truce is probably weeks, if not\nmonths, away.For now, Sanders is costing Clinton significant time, money and\npolitical capital. His victories in recent Western caucuses underscored her\nweaknesses among younger and white working-class voters, important elements of\nthe Democratic coalition. He's favored in the Wisconsin primary\nTuesday.Sanders is drawing sizable crowds in New York, attracting 18,500 to\nrally in the South Bronx on Thursday. A victory in that state, which Clinton\nrepresented for two terms in the Senate, would deal a significant\npsychological blow to her campaign, rattling Democrats already worried about\nher high national disapproval ratings.Clinton is more reliant on traditional\nfundraising than is Sanders, who's raised the bulk of his money online. Even\nas she prepares for New York's primary, she has scheduled fundraisers before\nthen in Denver, Virginia, Miami and Los Angeles — at the home of actor George\nClooney.She needs to continue raising primary dollars because June contests in\nCalifornia and New Jersey will be expensive. Sanders faces fewer financial\nanxieties.Sanders adviser Tad Devine said the senator was not encouraging his\nsupporters to disrupt Clinton's events and was focused on his own message. But\nhe also said the campaign would respond when Clinton mischaracterizes Sanders'\nrecords and positions.Her attacks, he said, only help Sanders.\"When your\nattacks against your opponent feed the biggest weakness that you have, you are\nundermining yourself,\" said Devine._The Associated Press contributed to this\nreport.___\n\n","title":"Clinton, Sanders camps squabble over NY debate, latest in now contentious primary | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Clinton, Sanders camps squabble over NY debate, latest in now contentious primary\nhttps://t.co/u76TyFYZqS https://t.co/n63JYmU3cv","date":"Sat Apr 02 23:43:36 +0000 2016","favs":90,"id":{"$numberLong":"716410787405803520"},"retweets":59},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1ULSQho"}

Steve Warren, a US-led coalition spokesman in Iraq,\ncould not confirm that Russian \"sappers\" or engineers had arrived in Syria\nwhen asked at a Pentagon press conference Friday. Russian jets and helicopter\ngunships helped Syrian forces push ISIS from Palmyra, once a popular tourist\ndestination filled with ancient Roman-era artifacts, earlier this week. A US\ndefense official tells Fox News that Syrian forces suffered \"heavy losses\"\nagainst ISIS, but would not offer any specifics. In a statement from Russia's\ndefense ministry posted on its website, the new Russian forces will conduct\n\"humanitarian mine clearance\" in Palmyra. Russian President Vladimir Putin\nsaid in March that his main forces would begin withdrawing from Syria.\nPentagon officials now say otherwise.Huge Russian convoy going to Palmyra to\ndemine it pic.twitter.com/n3ORoXgzUNCritics point to a similar pledge from\nPresident Putin when Russian agreed to a ceasefire and to withdrawal troops\nand equipment out of eastern Ukraine in 2014. The outgoing U.S. commander of\nNATO forces in Europe recently said Russian troops and equipment\nremain.Despite sending less than half of its jet fighters back to Russia,\nthere are now more Russian attack helicopters in Syria than at any time since\nthe air campaign to shore up Syrian President Bashar al-Assad began in late\nSeptember. The Pentagon has not seen Russian aircraft fly from Syria to Russia\nsince March 19, one official tells Fox News. More than 20 fixed-wing fighter-\nbomber aircraft remain in Syria in addition to more than a dozen attack\nhelicopters including the newest gunship in Russia's arsenal, the Mi-28N\n\"Havoc.\" US officials believe the deployment of Russian military forces to\nSyria is not short term. \"The Russians installed underground fuel tanks in\ntheir airbase in Latakia. This was not a temporary move, but a permanent one,\"\na defense official told Fox News.  The Russian Navy has occupied a Syrian port\nin Tartus since the early 1970s.  In Fall 2015, the Russians sent T-90 battle\ntanks, rocket-propelled artillery systems, and in December, the advanced S-400\nair defense system to protect their new airbase north of Tartus on the\nMediterranean coast in Latakia. US officials say all of these weapons remain\nas well. After defeating ISIS in Palmyra, it is unclear if the Russian-backed\nSyrian forces will continue to the Islamic State's de-facto capital of Raqqa,\nonly a three-hour drive from Palmyra, or head east to oil-rich Deir ez-Zor,\nthe site of an Assad regime airbase. Col. Warren did not expect an assault on\nISIS headquarters in the near future.  \"Nobody's going to get to Raqqa anytime\nsoon, frankly, neither the Russians nor the SDF [Syrian Democratic Forces],\"\nsaid Col Warren.The US military supports the Syrian Democratic Forces which\nare made up of largely Kurdish fighters, but also Arab groups as well. Russia\nhas been accused of killing hundreds of civilians and destroying hospitals\ninside Syria.  US officials say Russia has conducted a majority of its\nairstrikes using unguided or dumb bombs, far less precise than the satellite-\nguided weapons used by the US military.__Lucas Tomlinson is the Pentagon and\nState Department producer for Fox News Channel.

Ted Cruz is making the case that GOP presidential rival John Kasich and\nhis pesky campaign cannot win the party nomination unless he has top showings\nin eight states -- an argument that could help Cruz in the upcoming Wisconsin\nprimary and the GOP White House race.Cruz in recent interviews has repeatedly\ncited a Republican National Committee rule that states candidates can be\nnominated only if they've won the total delegate majority in eight or more\nstates, as reported first by The Washington Post.The Texas senator is trailing\nfront-runner Donald Trump by 273 delegates with about half of the country’s\ncaucus-primary contests remaining.However, Cruz now leads Trump in the\nTuesday’s Wisconsin primary, according to most polls. But Kasich, the governor\nof Ohio who is running a distant third in the GOP White House, could win\nenough votes to decide the primary and the entire nominating process.Kasich\nhas won only one contest, his home-state of Ohio, and he has finished in\nsecond-place or tied for second in five others.Trump has 736 pledged\ndelegates, followed by Cruz with 463, then Kasich with 143 -- with 1,237\nneeded to secure the nomination.The latest headlines on the 2016 elections\nfrom the biggest name in politics.

Ron Paul had nearly enough wins to at least\ncomplicate the nomination process for clear front-runner Mitt Romney.Kasich is\nnow considered the only remaining candidate that the Republican establishment\ncould try to nominate in a contested convention.Trump and Cruz have in part\nmade their campaigns an indictment of insider Washington and are being called\nun-electable in a general-election race against Democratic front-runner\nHillary Clinton.Cruz on Wednesday told conservative talk show host Hugh\nHewitt: \"It was the Washington establishment that put this rule in place. So\nnow when the Washington establishment candidates are losing, they want to\nchange the rules to try to parachute in some candidate who hasn't earned the\nvotes of the people. That is nothing short of crazy.\"Hewitt was following up\non Cruz’s comments on a CNN “Town Hall” in which he said Kasich being on the\nballot was “against the rules” and “If no one has 1,237 (delegates), you have\nto have won at least eight states.\"Karl Rove, a senior Bush White House\nadviser, said Thursday on Hewitt’s show that Cruz has “misinterpreted” the so-\ncalled 40b rule.Rove acknowledge the rule was indeed written just before the\n2012 convention to keep Paul, who has just roughly 5 percent of the vote, from\ngetting a “full blown” nomination process.He said the rule states candidates\nmust have that majority of delegates to have an official nominating speech and\nseconding speeches. However, they can receive votes on the first ballot from\nthe “pledged” delegates they won in caucuses and primaries.Republican\nofficials and others have also reportedly said new rules could be written\nbefore this year’s convention in July.  __\n\n","title":"Cruz turns to GOP convention rule to keep Kasich from nabbing nomination | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Cruz turns to GOP convention rule to keep Kasich from nabbing nomination\n\nhttps://t.co/zfqPRLJwG7 https://t.co/f4VPW6SkOA","date":"Sat Apr 02 21:30:17 +0000 2016","favs":158,"id":{"$numberLong":"716377236471808000"},"retweets":83},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1UzXkY1"}

(AP)PROVIDENCE, R.I.\n–  The state's top marketing official, who oversaw the disastrous rollout of a\ntourism campaign that included a video mistakenly featuring a scene from\nIceland, resigned on Friday.Gov. Gina Raimondo said she accepted Betsy Wall's\nresignation and added that the state would drop part of a new logo, the\ntagline \"Cooler \u0026amp; Warmer.\" The tagline was designed by Milton Glaser,\ncreator of the iconic \"I Love NY\" logo, but it left many people scratching\ntheir heads.Raimondo, a Democrat, said it was unacceptable how many mistakes\nwere made in the tourism campaign rollout and people need to be held\naccountable.\"As I dug into it a little bit and realized just how poor of a job\nwas done, I got pretty mad myself,\" she said. \"These were sloppy, just\nunacceptable mistakes.\"The video was part of a $5 million integrated campaign\nto attract tourism and business.The video, which briefly showed a skateboarder\nin front of the Harpa concert hall in Iceland's capital, Reykjavik, was mocked\non social media and made international news. Embarrassed state tourism\nofficials quickly yanked it off YouTube on Tuesday.The Iceland mistake was one\nof several controversies that dominated discussion in Rhode Island since the\ntourism campaign rolled out Monday. The scrutiny of the video led to the\ndiscovery of numerous errors and outdated material on a newly redesigned\ntourism website that said Rhode Island is home to 20 percent of the country's\nhistoric landmarks — instead of less than 2 percent.Raimondo said the state\nwas getting back $120,000 spent on the campaign: $100,000 for work by a\nmarketing firm that has coordinated the effort and $20,000 for the cost of the\nvideo by a subcontractor.Many residents also were unhappy about the new state\nlogo and the \"Cooler \u0026amp; Warmer\" motto. Raimondo said the motto would be\ndropped because it \"seems to not ring true for the people of Rhode Island.\"But\nshe defended Glaser's visual design and praised how Rhode Island residents\nhave been adapting the sail-shaped logo with their own interpretations, many\npoking fun at the campaign or making earnest nods to favorite local places or\nproducts.Raimondo had picked Wall just over three months ago to lead the\ncampaign.Wall lives in Massachusetts and led its tourism bureau until last\nyear. She made an embarrassing admission during an interview with WPRO-AM\nduring the week when she acknowledged she was unfamiliar with Gaspee Days, a\npopular local festival.Wall earlier this week said she took primary\nresponsibility for the rollout mistakes.\"These are small elements of a large\nmarketing program,\" she said. \"I know it's creating a lot of laughs and\nemotion, but this is a 2-second error. This was not an attempt to deceive\npeople or embellish. This was a mistake.\"The video editing company took\nresponsibility for the Iceland mix-up.

Human immune cells that were tested in the\nlabs have showed no alteration to any other part of the genetic code.“The fact\nthat for the first time we have been able to completely eliminate segments of\nthe viral genome in the laboratory demonstrates that we should be able to\neliminate it in the human body,” lead researcher Professor Kamel Khalili told\nThe Telegraph.He reiterated that based on the recent findings, clinical trials\ncould start within the next three years.The new technique is called\nCrispr/Cas9. It involves targeting the genetic code of HIV which inserts into\ncells, according to The Telegraph. Scientists then take the Cas9 protein and\nedit it so it can recognize viral code.The patient’s blood is then taken and\nscientists would inject Cas9, which would then seek out the HIV virus in the\ncells. The protein then releases and enzyme and snips out the virus.\nScientists are confident that replacing 20 percent of immune cells with\ngenetically altered cells would be enough to cure the virus.“It is an\nimportant step forward.

Farah, who was the\ndeputy head of the Mandera township primary school, and other Muslim\npassengers refused to cooperate -- instead telling the insurgents to kill all\nthe passengers or leave them alone. Al-Shabab militants have been known to\nexecute Christians and spare Muslims in previous attacks in the region.Farah,\nwho was shot in the hip and suffered shrapnel wounds to his arm, died during\nsurgery one month later. Prior to his death, Farah told Kenya's The Daily\nNation that, \"We asked them to kill all of us or leave us alone.\"\"People\nshould live peacefully together,” Farrah told Voice of America from his\nhospital bed in January.“We are brothers. It's only the religion that is the\ndifference, so I ask my brother Muslims to take care of the Christians so that\nthe Christians also take care of us. … and let us help one another and let us\nlive together peacefully,\" Farah said. On Thursday, Kenyatta lauded Farah,\ntelling parliament that the Muslim man \"refused to be divided by terrorism,\"\nBBC News reported. \"We are our brother's keeper.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc9588c"},"content":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Thomas Frieden speaks\nduring a press conference at a one-day Zika summit Friday, April 1, 2016, in\nAtlanta. (AP)ATLANTA –  The government urged health officials around the\ncountry Friday to get ready now in case there are outbreaks of the mosquito-\nborne Zika virus in the U.S. this summer.A Zika epidemic has been sweeping\nthrough Latin America and the Caribbean, and officials think it's likely some\nsmall clusters of Zika will occur in the U.S. when mosquito numbers boom.At a\n\"Zika Summit\" on Friday, experts prodded some 300 state and local officials\ngathered at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters to\nmake Zika response plans now.When West Nile virus — transmitted by a different\nmosquito — moved through the U.S. about 15 years ago, health officials were\ncaught flat-footed, noted Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the\nAmerican Public Health Association.\"This is an opportunity to get ahead of the\ncurve,\" he told the summit's attendees.The Zika virus causes only a mild and\nbrief illness, at worst, in most people. But in the last year, infections in\npregnant women have been strongly linked to fetal deaths and to potentially\ndevastating birth defects, mostly in Brazil.The virus is spread mainly by\nAedes aegypti mosquitoes, which also live in parts of the U.S. It was thought\nto be mainly in the South but the CDC revised its map this week, showing the\nmosquito has been found in parts of the Midwest and Northeast.Officials don't\nexpect Zika to be a big problem, though, in the U.S. for a number of reasons,\nincluding the widespread use of air conditioning and screens. The Zika\nmosquito likes to bite indoors. They think the clusters may be small and\nsurface only in a few states — most likely Florida and Texas. But they don't\nknow for sure.So far, there have been no Zika infections in the U.S. caught\nfrom mosquitoes. More than 300 illnesses have been reported, all linked to\ntravel to Zika outbreak regions.About 350 additional cases have been reported\nin U.S. territories, most of them in Puerto Rico, where mosquitoes are already\nspreading the virus. Together, dozens or even hundreds of births in the 50\nstates and territories could be affected in devastating ways by Zika, said Dr.\nEdward McCabe of the March of Dimes, who spoke at the summit.\"We have a few\nshort weeks to stop the Zika virus from gaining a foothold,\" McCabe\nsaid.During the summit, state and local officials were encouraged to map where\nthe Zika mosquito lives and breeds in the state and which insecticides would\nwork best in their area.The Zika response will likely mean workers will go\ndoor to door, sometimes asking to go on properties and even spray. That's\ndifferent from the truck- and aerial-spraying seen in conventional mosquito\neradication efforts.It will be a kind of campaign not seen in this country\nsince efforts to wipe out yellow fever in the 1950s and 1960s, and it will\ntake different kinds of equipment, approaches and more staff, CDC officials\nsaid.Local health officials at the summit said the work ahead is daunting,\nespecially since it's not clear where they're going to get the money. And\nhealth departments are already struggling financially, said Dr. Jeff Duchin, a\nSeattle-based county public health official who was at the meeting\nrepresenting the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\"Our priority is to\nmake sure we have enough resources to meet the threat,\" Duchin said.Paul\nEttestad, New Mexico's public health veterinarian, said some of the state's\ncounties only have a handful of people doing mosquito control work — the same\npeople who also handle snow removal in the winter\"They don't have much,\"\nEttestad saidThe Obama administration in February requested nearly $2 billion\nin emergency funding for Zika response work. Congressional leaders have not\nformally voted on the request.One of the things money is needed for, officials\nsaid, is better and faster blood tests for Zika. Now, it takes between a few\ndays to a week to get results.If Zika starts spreading in the U.S, women of\nchildbearing age are going to be \"intensely concerned,\" predicted Dr. Bill\nFoege, a former CDC director and expert on global health. \"They're going to\nwant to know if they are infected and they're not going to want to wait a\nweek.\"__\n\n","title":"CDC urges health officials to prepare for possible Zika outbreak this summer | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"CDC urges health officials to prepare for possible Zika outbreak this summer https://t.co/YVVjFfiiQg","date":"Sat Apr 02 04:33:49 +0000 2016","favs":89,"id":{"$numberLong":"716121433559027713"},"retweets":125},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1Vi2EOA"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc9588d"},"content":"  WASHINGTON –  World leaders declared progress Friday in safeguarding nuclear\nmaterials sought by terrorists and wayward nations, even as President Barack\nObama acknowledged the task was far from finished.Closing out a nuclear\nsecurity summit, Obama warned of a persistent and harrowing threat: terrorists\ngetting their hands on a nuclear bomb. He urged fellow leaders not to be\ncomplacent about the risk of catastrophe, saying that such an attack by the\nIslamic State or a similar group would \"change our world.\"\"I'm the first to\nacknowledge the great deal of work that remains,\" Obama said, adding that the\nvision of disarmament he laid out at the start of his presidency may not be\nrealized during his lifetime. \"But we've begun.\"Despite their calls for\nfurther action, the roughly 50 leaders assembled announced that this year's\ngathering would be the last of this kind. This year, deep concerns about\nterrorism were the commanding focus, as leaders grappled with the notion that\nthe next Paris or Brussels could involve an attack with a nuclear weapon or\ndirty bomb.Obama said of the terrorists, \"There is no doubt that if these\nmadmen ever got their hands on a nuclear bomb or nuclear material they most\ncertainly would use it to kill as many innocent people as possible.\"So far, no\nterrorists have obtained a nuclear weapon or a dirty bomb, Obama said,\ncrediting global efforts to secure nuclear material. But he said it wasn't for\nlack of the terrorists trying: Al-Qaida has sought nuclear materials, IS has\ndeployed chemical weapons and extremists linked to the Brussels and Paris\nattacks were found to have spied on a top Belgian nuclear official.Throughout\nthe two-day summit, growing fears about nuclear terrorism tempered other, more\npositive signs of the world coming together to confront the broader nuclear\nthreat.The U.N. Security Council members who brokered a sweeping nuclear deal\nwith Iran held up that agreement as a model for preventing nuclear\nproliferation, as they gathered on the summit's sidelines to review\nimplementation of the deal.Obama also spent part of the summit huddling with\nthe leaders of South Korea and Japan about deterring nuclear-tinged\nprovocations from North Korea, in a powerful show of diplomatic unity with two\nU.S. treaty allies. Similarly, Obama's sit-down with Chinese President Xi\nJinping offered the two strategic rivals a chance to illustrate mutual concern\nabout the North, a traditional Chinese ally.Undeterred, North Korea only hours\nlater fired a short-range missile into the sea and tried to jam GPS navigation\nsignals in South Korea — precisely the kind of act that South Korean President\nPark Geun-hye had warned would trigger even tougher sanctions and more\nisolation.Aiming to show concrete action, leaders came to the nuclear summit\nwith commitments in hand, known in diplomatic-speak as \"gift baskets.\"Latin\nAmerica and the Caribbean are now free of highly enriched uranium, the White\nHouse said, praising Argentina by name for converting its remaining stockpile\ninto a less dangerous form. Fissile materials like highly enriched uranium and\nseparated plutonium are necessary ingredients to make nuclear bombs.The United\nStates, in newly declassified statistics, said its own national inventory of\nhighly enriched uranium has dropped from 741 metric tons two decades ago to\n586 metric tons as of 2013. And the U.S. and Japan announced they'd finished\nremoving hundreds of kilograms of weapons-grade material from a Japanese\nresearch reactor, and pledged to do the same at another.On the global front, a\nstrengthened nuclear security agreement was finally poised to take force,\nextending safeguards for nuclear materials being used, stored and transported\nwhile requiring criminal penalties for nuclear smuggling. Those tweaks were\napproved in 2005, but have sat dormant awaiting ratification from a critical\nmass of nations, reached only in the past few days.Still, frustration over the\nslow pace of reducing nuclear stockpiles shadowed the summit. The absence of\nkey players — especially Russia — further underscored the lack of unanimity\nconfronting global efforts to deter nuclear attacks.After six years of\nprodding by Obama and others before him, the global stockpile of fissile\nmaterial remains in the thousands of metric tons.

Greg Brachle,\napproaches and opens the rear passenger door where Grant is sitting. He yells\n\"gun, gun, gun\" and begins shooting. After ducking behind his truck, Brachle\nremerges and another officer says it was Grant who was shot. Brachle realizes\nthe mistake and begins to yell obscenities and curse at himself.Brachle asks\nGrant if he’s OK and Grant says no.

Youngsters at the Volunteer\nState’s flagship university are about to engage in all sorts of debauchery\nranging from lessons on male sexual fluidity to a lecture on “butt stuff” from\nan amateur porn star.Sex Week at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville kicks\noff April 4 \\- five days of depravity that makes Mardi Gras on Bourbon Street\nlook like a Sunday school picnic.**Click here to join Todd’s American\nDispatch: a must-read for Conservatives!**The star of the show is Sophia St.\nJames, a self-described “queer diesel femme.” St. James will be teaching the\nboys and girls on Rocky Top how to “explore all the titillating crevices and\nprotrusions of your body.”“Fellatio, cunnilingus, analingus; maybe you’ve\nheard the word, now it’s time to find out about doing the deed,” reads a\ndescription of the Sex Week workshop.The university will also provide testing\naround campus all week for sexually transmitted diseases – which might not be\na bad idea.Organizers of Sex Week told the blog Campus Reform there was great\ninterest from the student body for workshops on bondage, domination,\nsubmission/sadism and masochism – not to mention, “How to Drive a\nVulva.”“These events are critically important and were chosen based on an\noverwhelming number of requests from the UT student body, whose feedback we\nrely heavily upon in selecting our events,” one of the event organizers told\nthe website.Critics, however, are furious – especially state lawmakers and\nalumni.“The content is horrifically disturbing,” State Rep. Kevin Brooks told\nme. “The fact that we are using state dollars and state classrooms on state\ncampuses to promote UT Sex Week is unforgiveable.”Lawmakers are advancing a\nbill that would prohibit UT from using any state money to promote Sex Week.\nThe bill, authored by State Rep. Micah Van Huss, would also strip $100,000 in\nfunding for the university’s office of diversity and inclusion.“These are\ntaxpayer dollars, taxpayer funds,” Van Huss told me. “Frankly, (Sex Week)\ndoesn’t represent the values of my constituents and the majority of\nTennesseans.”According to Campus Reform, event organizers are using private\ndonations to pay for Sex Week.Van Huss said his phones have been ringing non-\nstop from angry alumni and citizens.“They are embarrassed by their alma mater\nand that sends a pretty powerful statement,” he said.Over the past few years,\na number of national controversies have given the university a black eye –\nmost recently an “unofficial” recommendation from the Office of Diversity and\nInclusion that campus Christmas parties avoid the Baby Jesus and Santa\nClaus.“Ensure your holiday party is not a Christmas party in disguise,” the\nuniversity office warned.And in the fall of 2015, the vice chancellor for\ndiversity and inclusion recommended that the campus use “gender inclusive”\npronouns.Lawmakers have pleaded with the university’s administration to fix\nthe problem – but so far – their pleas have fallen on deaf ears.“We are\nabsolutely shocked that this continues after repeated requests directly to the\nUT administration to cease and desist,” Brooks said. “If the administration of\nthe university system is not going to listen – we are going to legislate. And\nwe are going to represent what our voters want.”Van Huss was even more to the\npoint.“I don’t trust the University of Tennessee to fix this,” he said. “I\ndon’t want to micromanage the university, but when they have shown again and\nagain and again that they are incapable of fixing it on their own – I’ve got\nto step in.”So hang in there, taxpayers.

It is also returning $228,910 provided by the company and a\nco-op of milk producers.The moves come after the school faced a backlash for a\nquestionable press release that it issued in December. The release said a\npreliminary study showed Fifth Quarter's milk helped improve the cognitive and\nmotor functions of high school football players, even after suffering\nconcussions.The announcement sparked criticism because it touted a specific\nbrand, and appeared to underscore the breakdowns in scientific standards and\nconflicts-of-interest that can come about when companies fund research about\ntheir own products.In July, another university press release had declared that\nFifth Quarter's milk outperformed competing products in aiding post-exercise\nrecovery. The details of the study were not made available.The two-part study\nwas funded through a university program intended to boost Maryland's economy\nby partnering local businesses with researchers.In a report detailing its\ninternal investigation Friday, the university said it found a \"concerning lack\nof understanding of the basic principles of conflict of interest in research\nat all levels of the process.\" It said the study also had too many\nuncontrolled variables to produce meaningful results.That was particularly\ntroubling because the subjects were students, the report said.Anne Wylie, a\nformer provost who chaired the university's internal review committee, said\nshe did not know if the football players were aware that they were research\nsubjects. She said \"informed consent\" forms were not required for the study\nbecause the football players were already being given tests to gauge their\nreactions.That means the data for the study was already being generated, she\nsaid.The committee's report also noted serious questions were raised early on\nby a reviewer about the nutritional expertise of the researcher conducting the\nstudy. The school said the researcher, Jae Kun Shim, a professor of\nkinesiology, did not see the comments and did not revise his procedures. But\nit said the product endorsements attributed to Shim in its press releases were\ntroubling.The university said any potential sanctions against faculty or staff\nwould be considered confidential personnel matters.Andrew Holtz, who initially\nbrought attention to the study after writing about it for\nHealthNewsReview.org, said it was extremely unusual for a university to\nfeature a study in a press release without providing the actual research. He\nsaid he was troubled by the university's stonewalling when he asked for a copy\nof the study.In addition to reviewing its internal approval procedures for\nresearch, the committee's report recommended that clear distinctions be made\nbetween when the university is conducting research, and when it is providing a\nservice to a business or industry.In a letter posted online, the University of\nMaryland's chief research officer the school had \"every reason to believe this\nwas an isolated incident.\"Fifth Quarter Fresh says its milk comes from \"super,\nnatural cows\" and has higher amounts of protein, electrolytes, calcium and\ncarbohydrates.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc95894"},"content":"  At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention we’ve learned to expect\nthe unexpected the unexpected – but the ongoing Zika outbreak has caused\ndangers from a mosquito bite no one imagined: birth defects.It’s been more\nthan 50 years since we’ve seen a birth defect linked to a virus – and never\nbefore have we seen this from a mosquito bite. The reported association\nbetween Zika virus infection and microcephaly (small head size) is\nunfortunately likely to be part of a spectrum of brain damage that results\nfrom this virus invading the brain of the developing fetus.There are many\nunknowns with this virus, but what’s certain is that it has arrived in United\nStates territories and is also already affecting Americans who have traveled\nto areas with Zika virus transmission.The U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has\nhad hundreds of locally acquired cases of Zika, and we expect that by the end\nof the year they could have hundreds of thousands of cases and thousands of\ninfected pregnant women.  The Puerto Rico Department of Health, CDC, and\npartner organizations are working around-the-clock to provide pregnant women\nwith information and resources to reduce their risk of infection, but it is a\ndaunting task. Many homes lack window screens and air conditioning, making it\nhard to prevent mosquito bites. Access to contraception in Puerto Rico is\nlimited for couples who want to avoid pregnancy during this outbreak.There are\nthings that can reduce risk of infection right now in Puerto Rico, such as\nwearing effective insect repellents and long-sleeved shirts and long pants,\nreducing standing water that allows mosquitoes to breed near homes, and take\nadditional steps to make the homes of pregnant women more mosquito-proof.  In\naddition, the male partners of pregnant women should to use condoms\nconsistently and correctly during sex or abstain, because the virus may\nsurvive in human sperm after a man is infected.Zika is likely to reach the\ncontinental United States in the coming months. Chikungunya and dengue –\nviruses spread by the same mosquito that spreads Zika – have caused clusters\nof cases in Florida and Texas. Even if Zika does not spread in a particular\nstate, there could be many travel-associated cases – posing a risk for sexual\ntransmission between men and their pregnant partners.Friday, hundreds of state\nand local health representatives will gather at CDC to develop their Zika\naction plans, including how to provide information for the public (especially\npregnant women), how to track and control the mosquitoes that spread Zika, how\nto expand availability of laboratory testing, and how to assure blood safety.\nIt’s a crucial event in the nation’s response to the virus.To protect\nAmericans, all levels of government need to implement a comprehensive Zika\nresponse.At CDC, we are scaling up lab capacity to test for Zika infection and\nstrengthening efforts to control the mosquito that spreads Zika. Faster\ndiagnostics are needed, as are effective mosquito control strategies. We are\nworking to further evaluate the relationship between Zika and microcephaly, as\nwell as with other neurological conditions such as Guillain-Barré syndrome.\nWith the National Institutes of Health as the lead and support from the\nBiomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), we are working\nto accelerate vaccine development to fully protect our future generations.We\nneed funds to put plans into action and boots on the ground.CDC’s mission and\ncommitment is to protect the health, safety and security of Americans—and\nwithout Zika supplemental funding requested by the Obama administration, we\nwon’t be able to provide the robust protection against Zika that Americans\ndeserve. There is something everyone can do to control this emerging epidemic\nand to protect our next generation from this newly discovered threat, and we\nmust act now.___Tom Frieden, M.D.__ is the director of the U.S. Centers for\nDisease Control and Prevention.

Army Green Beret Sergeant First Class Matthew McClintock\nlost his life, and two others were wounded, when his unit came under Taliban\nfire in a compound in Marjah, Afghanistan. After the unit was pinned down by\nenemy combatants, reports say the ground commander requested support from a\ncircling AC-130 gunship.Due to the Obama administration’s fear of collateral\ndamage, the gunship was initially waived off. The “quick” reaction force (QRF)\nwas also delayed by hours. Although one of his fellow soldiers was able to\nkeep him alive through the night, by the time the QRF and Medevac arrived\nabout twelve hours later, it was too late. SFC McClintock died in the\nhelicopter. The Taliban may have killed SFC McClintock, but the White House\nfailed to save him.It’s unthinkable that situations like this – where our\ntroops are left defenseless and told not to return fire – happen at all. Even\nmore disturbing, under this administration, these situations are the new\nreality. Rules of engagement matter. For SFC McClintock, it could have made\nthe difference between life and death.For the past several years, the White\nHouse has been forcing our troops to fight a war with their hands tied behind\ntheir backs. Troops are told they must have certainty that an individual is a\ncombatant -- apparently a known Taliban fighter pointing a weapon at them does\nnot qualify.Our pilots are told to hold their fire until the U.S. gains\npermission from foreign governments to strike; and even the president’s 2015\nAuthorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) was a list of options he would\nnot consider, rather than a path to victory. Overly restrictive rules of\nengagement put our troops in danger and allow our enemy to hide in plain\nsight.I served 23 years as a U.S. Navy SEAL. I commanded some of the finest\nteams on the face of the planet and led 3,500 operators as the acting\nCommander of Joint Special Forces in Iraq. Part of the reason we were able to\nsecure Fallujah, Ramadi and other areas is because our troops had the right\nrules of engagement.We have seen a level of armchair quarterbacking from this\nadministration that is unprecedented and has led to needless loss of life in\nMarjah and Benghazi. Micromanagement by the White House will have lasting\nimpacts on our fighting force if it is not reversed quickly.I’m no longer in\nthe military, but I’m on the front lines in Congress. I’ve continually pressed\nfor Congressional hearings into what happened in Marjah. I’ve grilled senior\nDoD officials on the impact overly-restrictive rules of engagement can have on\nthe battlefield. This is my new mission. We owe it to our military men and\nwomen, people like SFC McClintock, to change course and make sure our troops\nhave the right tools, resources, force package, and rules of engagement to win\n-- and win decisively -- on the field of battle.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc958a0"},"content":"(AP)Donald Trump is facing a damaging media narrative just as he seemed to be\nin a position to wrap up the Republican race.The sharks are circling in the\ncampaign water, sensing blood from a series of controversies that his critics\nwant to define him.And it’s happening in the final stretch before Tuesday’s\nWisconsin primary, which a Fox Business poll yesterday says Ted Cruz is\nleading over Trump, 42 to 32 percent, with John Kasich at 19.Trump insists he\nrespects women, and he has promoted many of them at his company. But\ncomplaints about his language began to pick up again when he attacked Megyn\nKelly as “sick” and “crazy.”Then the Corey Lewandowski story exploded.The\ndecision by Florida police to charge Trump’s campaign manager with a\nmisdemeanor for manhandling former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields produced\na tsunami of media coverage. The campaign insists that Lewandowski did nothing\nwrong. The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in\npolitics. See Latest Coverage →But what upset some folks is Trump’s dismissive\ncomments about Fields, questioning her account of how her arm got bruised,\nreading from her statement in a dramatic voice, and musing about whether he\nshould sue her because she touched him in attempting to questioning him (and\nwas armed with a pen).Now 16 conservative female commentators (including Fox’s\nDana Loesch, Katie Pavlich and Meghan McCain and CNN’s S.E. Cupp and Mary\nKatharine Ham) have signed a petition urging Trump to fire Lewandowski.\nWhether or not they shot themselves in the foot in terms of future coverage,\nas Greta Van Susteren says, the move underscored  how Trump is on the\ndefensive. Next came the major misstep on abortion.Trump was in an MSNBC town\nhall with Chris Matthews, who’s a pretty aggressive interviewer when he’s\nsitting down with Republicans.  Asked about his pro-life views, Trump said\nthat if abortion were illegal, women who undergo the procedure should be\npunished. That set off shock waves, as even the leading pro-life groups don’t\ntake this position.Trump’s campaign quickly issued a statement in which he\nbacked off, saying that if abortion were outlawed, it is doctors who perform\nthem, not female patients, who should be punished.All this has led to a spate\nof stories such as this one from ABC: “Donald Trump's Growing Problem With\nWomen and What It Means for the GOP.” And the billionaire faces a huge gender\ngap in the polls.The mistake also fuels another media narrative that could be\nequally harmful to Trump: that he hasn’t thought through the issues. And\nabortion, as opposed to, say, the role of NATO, is a hot-button subject for\nboth pro-choice liberals and pro-life conservatives.Trump made the mistake in\npart because he’s not a polished politician. Candidates who had run for office\nbefore would have a carefully calibrated response emblazoned on their brain.\nThey also would have parried Matthews by refusing to answer a hypothetical, or\npivoted to the importance of naming the next Supreme Court justice, or\nsomething.Trump just says what he thinks, political correctness be damned, and\nthat is at the heart of his appeal. This approach, as we have seen this week,\ncan also get him into trouble. __Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the\nhost of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

A third\nofficer has an open case pending with the Police Commission and could face\ndiscipline or termination, police said.  \n  \nLai was charged last week with misdemeanor counts of unlawful possession of\ncriminal offender history information and misuse of confidential Department of\nMotor Vehicle information, but prosecutors found insufficient evidence to\ncharge him with sexual assault. He has been on unpaid leave since the\ninvestigation began, police said.  \n  \nCity Public Defender Jeff Adachi said his office would \"begin a full review of\npast cases that may have been tainted by these officers,\" Adachi said. \"I am\nalso calling for an independent investigation into when the police chief and\ndistrict attorney learned of the text messages.\"\"Every person in San Francisco\ndeserves equal justice,\" Adachi added. \"It does them a grave disservice to\ndismiss every hateful act as an isolated incident. The Police Department must\naddress the culture that lets racism fester in its ranks.\"**Click for more\nfrom KTVU.com.**__\n\n","title":"San Francisco police officers accused of exchanging racist, homophobic texts | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Group of San Francisco police officers investigated over racist, homophobic text messages https://t.co/KOPmun5h1V","date":"Fri Apr 01 10:23:00 +0000 2016","favs":45,"id":{"$numberLong":"715846921794023424"},"retweets":45},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1Vf5eES"}

The promise\nof an affordable electric car from Tesla Motors had hundreds of people lining\nup to reserve one. At a starting price of $35,000 before federal and state\ngovernment incentives the Model 3 is less than half the cost of Tesla's\nprevious models. (Tesla Motors via AP)HAWTHORNE, Calif. –  It's the car\nthousands of people were waiting for: Tesla Motors' new, lower-priced Model 3\nsedan.Tesla unveiled the Model 3 on Thursday night at its Los Angeles design\nstudio. It doesn't go on sale until late 2017, but in the first 24 hours that\norder banks were open, Tesla said it had more than 115,000 reservations. Long\nlines at Tesla stores, reminiscent of the crowds at Apple stores for early\nmodels of the iPhone, were reported from Hong Kong to Austin, Texas, to\nWashington, D.C. Buyers put down a $1,000 deposit to reserve the car.At a\nstarting price of $35,000 — before federal and state government incentives —\nthe Model 3 is less than half the cost of Tesla's previous models. Tesla CEO\nElon Musk says the car will go at least 215 miles when fully charged, about\ndouble what drivers get from current competitors in its price range, such as\nthe Nissan Leaf and BMW i3.Prototypes shown Thursday night looked like a\nshorter version of Tesla's Model S sedan. The Model 3 has a panoramic glass\nroof and an elongated hood. Inside, it seats five adults and has the same\nlarge touchscreen dashboard as other Teslas. It also has Tesla's suite of\nsemi-autonomous driving features, including automatic lane changing and lane\nkeeping. Musk said it will accelerate from zero to 60 in less than 6\nseconds.Musk said the car is on schedule to go on sale at the end of 2017,\neliciting a cheer from the crowd of around 800 people. Tesla has a history of\nmissing deadlines for its vehicles to hit the market.\"I do feel fairly\nconfident it will be next year,\" Musk said.The Model 3 is the most serious\ntest yet of 13-year-old Tesla's ability to go from a niche player to a full-\nfledged automaker. It could be the car that finally makes electrics mainstream\n— or consumers could continue to be skeptical that electrics will work for\neveryday use. In the U.S., they still make up less than 1 percent of annual\nsales. Either way, the Model 3 is already changing the industry, spurring\ncompetitors to speed development of electric cars and improve their battery\nrange.General Motors Co. is set to start selling the Chevrolet Bolt electric\ncar at the end of this year. The Bolt will have a similar price tag and a\n200-mile range. Hyundai's Ioniq, which has a 110-mile electric range and could\nmatch Tesla on price, goes on sale this fall. Audi will follow with an\nelectric SUV in 2018.Musk said last month he's not worried. He thinks the\nModel 3 will compete most directly with small luxury cars such as the Audi A4\nand the BMW 3 Series.Musk said Tesla will expand its stores and its fast-\ncharging Supercharger stations globally in order to support the Model 3. He\nsaid the company plans to double its stores worldwide to 441 by the end of\n2017, and it will double its Superchargers to 7,200. Tesla will also add\nthousands of its so-called destination charging stations at hotels and other\nlocations.Right now, Tesla sells two vehicles: The Model S sedan, which starts\nat $71,000, and the Model X SUV, which starts around $80,000. But a lower-\npriced car was Musk's longtime goal. Musk said the Model S and Model X, along\nwith Tesla's first car, the discontinued Roadster sports car, helped Tesla\nmake the money to invest in the Model 3.\"We needed to figure out how we, as a\ntiny company with very few resources, could make a difference,\" he said.Tesla\nlowered the cost of the car, in part, by making cheaper batteries. The company\npreviously assembled its battery packs with cells made in Japan by Panasonic\nCorp. But Tesla and Panasonic are building a massive, $5 billion factory in\nNevada which will supply batteries for the Model 3. Tesla says the scale of\nthe factory will lower the cost of its battery packs by 30 percent.The Model 3\nputs Tesla within reach of millions more customers. Last year, only 2.1\npercent of new cars purchased in the U.S. cost $75,000 or more, but 35 percent\n— or 5.5 million — cost $35,000 or more, according to TrueCar. The Model 3 is\na critical part of the money-losing automaker's plan to increase sales from\naround 85,000 this year to 500,000 by 2020.Robin Santucci got the sixth spot\nin line when he arrived at the Santa Monica, California, Tesla store at 3:45\na.m. Thursday. By 9 a.m., he estimated there were 200 people in line.Santucci\nhas admired Tesla for years. When he got his current car, an electric Fiat\n500, he made sure the lease would run out at the end of 2017 so his next car\ncould be the Model 3.\"The design of every other car they've put out is\nbeautiful,\" said Santucci, who works in digital advertising and lives in West\nHollywood.Santucci added that he didn't want to wait too long to order a car\nbecause the federal tax credit of $7,500 will sunset once Tesla sells 200,000\nvehicles in the U.S. That is still likely several years away, although a\nticker at the Tesla event showed orders continuing to rise throughout the\nnight.\n\n","title":"Tesla unveils new, lower-priced Model 3 | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"ALL CHARGED UP: Tesla unveils new, lower-priced Model 3 https://t.co/D6rLxDMUXO","date":"Fri Apr 01 08:18:11 +0000 2016","favs":107,"id":{"$numberLong":"715815508914880512"},"retweets":67},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1qlUp8G"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc958a7"},"content":"  SACRAMENTO, Calif. –  California lawmakers on Thursday approved the nation's\nhighest statewide minimum wage of $15 an hour to take effect by 2022 after it\nwas hailed by Democrats as an example to the nation as it struggles with a\ngrowing gap between rich and poor.The legislation now goes to Gov. Jerry\nBrown, who says he will sign it into law Monday after previously working out\nthe plan with labor unions.Brown says the measure approved by the Legislature\nproves again that California can get things done and help people get ahead.The\nstate of New York was considering a similar move.The income divide has become\na key issue across the U.S., with President Barack Obama proposing an increase\nto the federal minimum wage and the issue getting attention in the Democratic\npresidential primary.Democrats who control both legislative chambers in\nCalifornia hailed the increase as a boon to more than 2 million of state's\npoorest workers.Republicans, however, echoed fears from business owners and\neconomists that the annual increases — eventually tied to inflation — will\ncompound California's image as hostile to business.The Assembly passed SB3\nwith a 48-26 vote. The Senate followed, 26-12.The increases would start with a\nboost from $10 to $10.50 on Jan. 1. Businesses with 25 or fewer employees\nwould have an extra year to comply. Increases of $1 an hour would come every\nJanuary until 2022. The governor could delay increases in times of budgetary\nor economic downturns.California's current $10 an hour minimum wage is tied\nwith Massachusetts for the highest among states. Only Washington, D.C., at\n$10.50 per hour is higher.Los Angeles, Seattle and other cities have recently\napproved $15 minimum wages, while Oregon officials plan to increase the\nminimum to $14.75 an hour in cities and $12.50 in rural areas by 2022.In New\nYork, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and state lawmakers continued to negotiate Thursday\nover Cuomo's proposal to gradually raise the state's minimum wage from $9 to\n$15 by the end of 2018 in New York City and by mid-2021 elsewhere in the\nstate.Brown, a Democrat, was previously reluctant to raise the base wage. He\nnegotiated the deal with labor unions to head off competing labor-backed\nNovember ballot initiatives that would have imposed swifter increases without\nsome of the safeguards included in the legislation. Brown now says the most\npopulous state's fast-growing economy can absorb the raises without the\nproblems predicted by opponents.About 2.2 million Californians now earn the\nminimum wage. The University of California, Berkeley, Center for Labor\nResearch and Education, projected the increase would have a ripple effect for\nthose whose wages would increase to keep pace.The researchers project it would\nincrease pay for 5.6 million Californians by an average of 24 percent.

The newly found distant world, known as\nKELT-4Ab, orbits one star. That star in turn is orbited by a nearby pair of\nstars. The twin stars are close enough to the planet to appear about as bright\nas the full moon in the sky, new research has revealed.In addition to\nproviding an example of a solar system very different from Earth's, the\nstrange arrangement may help provide insight into how gas giants that lie\nclose to their parent star — known as \"hot Jupiters\" — evolve. [The Strangest\nAlien Planets (Gallery)]KELT-4Ab, which is about as massive as Jupiter, orbits\nthe single star KELT-A once every three days. Nearby, the stars KELT-B and\nKELT-C orbit one another once every 30 years, and together they travel around\nKELT-A and its planet every 4,000 years or so.Jason Eastman, a research\nassociate at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, is the lead\nauthor of a study that used the two robotic telescopes that make up the\nKilodegree Extremely Little Telescope (KELT), located in Arizona and South\nAfrica respectively, to identify the system that includes the single star\nKELT-A, the more distant pairing KELT-BC and the overheated planet.While the\ncomposition of the planet's atmosphere isn't yet known, Eastman told Space.com\nthat standing in the atmosphere above the planet (since you can't stand on its\nsurface), the single star would appear to be about 40 times as large as the\nsun appears in the sky on Earth. Each member of the binary star pair would be\nalmost as bright as the full moon, though without a good telescope they would\nlook like dots of light about a pinky-finger-width apart in the sky.\"Those two\nstars would orbit each other every about 30 years, and every 4,000 years\nthey'd make one orbit around KELT-4A,\" Eastman said.Planets around triple\nstars are rare; KELT-4Ab is only the fourth known system to contain three\nstars. Of these, KELT-A is the brightest host star, not only because it is a\nhotter star than the ones in the other three systems, but also because it lies\nso close to Earth — only 680 light-years away.The research was published in\nthe Astronomical Journal.\"Hot Jupiters aren't supposed to exist. None of\nthem,\" Eastman said.\"Gaseous planets the size of Jupiter are supposed to form\nmuch farther out [from their parent star] and stay there, like our own Jupiter\ndid,\" he said. \"Exactly how they got so close is an outstanding question, but\none theory is that it migrates due to hot interactions with a third body — in\nthis case, the third and fourth bodies KELT-BC.\"When astronomers developed the\nfirst theories of planet formation, all they had to work with was the solar\nsystem. When the first exoplanet discoveries were gas giants that orbited\ntheir stars in a handful of days, it turned the existing theory on its head\nand sent scientists scrambling to understand how the newly observed systems\ncould exist. Most scientists seem to agree that the massive worlds traveled to\ntheir current position after they finished forming, driven by companion\nplanets, stars or other processes, Eastman said.\"The binary system KELT-4BC\nmay be what ultimately drove the planet KELT-4Ab so close to its star,\"\nEastman said.Using a survey produced by KELT, the scientists identified the\npotential planet KELT-4Ab, then confirmed its existence with several other\ninstruments. Like the more well-known NASA Kepler spacecraft, KELT relies on\nthe transit method to detect exoplanets, observing how the amount of light\nfrom a star drops as the planet passes between it and Earth.\"KELT is different\nin several ways [from other transit surveys],\" Eastman said. \"It has a smaller\ntelescope, a larger field of view and a larger pixel scale than other mature\ntransit surveys.\"These features deliberately bias the instrument toward\nbrighter stars, which Eastman said allows a broader range of observations and\ncharacterizations. Among those is the ability to determine if the planet's\norbital plane appears edge-on as seen from Earth, or whether the plane is\ntipped, and this process allows scientists to more precisely calculate the\nstar's mass.When the KELT-4 system was originally observed in 1973, it was\nthought to host only two stars. Not until Eastman observed the system almost\n40 years later was one of the single stars resolved into two individuals.\"In\nall previous observations, KELT-4B and KELT-4C were blended together and\nlooked just like one star,\" Eastman said.This is a recurring challenge for\nscientists observing binary systems — resolving close-orbiting stars into\nbinary pairs. Eastman said that many known planets may live in unknown triple\nsystems. One reason the twin stars in the KELT-4 system were so easily\nidentified as two individual stars instead of one was because of the system's\nclose proximity to Earth.The European Space Agency's Gaia satellite, currently\nengaged in a five-year mission, will observe the triple system in the coming\nyears. These observations will enable a more precise measurement of the\ndistance to KELT-4A, providing more detailed measurements of its mass and\nradius, which will result in more precise measurements of the mass and radius\nof the planet.\"But more exciting, Gaia will be able to measure the motion of\nthe KELT-4BC binary pair around KELT-4A,\" Eastman said.Measuring the path of\nthe pair of stars will help improve models of how they could have affected the\nmigration of the planet, shoving it closer to its parent star. In doing so, it\nwill help scientists understand how hot Jupiters manage to form so close to\ntheir parent stars._ ___\n\n","title":"New alien planet boasts rare triple suns | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"New alien planet boasts rare triple suns  https://t.co/mTyWg3hbk9 https://t.co/bn4ORm2ume","date":"Fri Apr 01 07:28:03 +0000 2016","favs":249,"id":{"$numberLong":"715802891655602176"},"retweets":153},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1UFvDxk"}

If an offender pays\nfull restitution, is not convicted of another database-eligible offense and\ncomplies with court orders, they may be taken off in 10 years.Most\nlegislators, who passed the bill 65 to 7 in the House and unanimously in the\nSenate, say the database is an essential instrument to fight fraud on behalf\nof the public. Some opponents, however, worry it could be used as a public\nshaming mechanism, or to deny jobs or housing to ex-cons who may have\notherwise rehabilitated themselves.State Representative Mike McKell sponsored\nthe white-collar crime registry legislation in the House of Representatives.\n(utah.gov) “When we were passing the bill I had people asking me, ‘Is this a\nScarlet Letter?’” McKell said. “And maybe it is. And I’m comfortable with\nthat. If it’s a public shaming to the extent that it’s someone that’s stripped\nretirement accounts from seniors, I’m okay with that.”Bramble said he’s heard\nfrom victims’ advocates who said the legislature didn’t go far enough and\noffenders’ advocates who say the legislature went too far.“And frankly,”\nBramble said, “if you have folks on the more extreme ends of the equations of\nboth sides, generally you’ve struck a pretty good balance.”__\n\n","title":"Utah's white-collar crime database could serve as national model | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Utah's white-collar crime database could serve as national model  https://t.co/2roAolD7PY via @CDerespina https://t.co/XPam1JTZZi","date":"Fri Apr 01 07:10:06 +0000 2016","favs":51,"id":{"$numberLong":"715798375237419008"},"retweets":32},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1SCtTRG"}

(LouisianaBowhunter.com)Deer hunters are facing\ncompetition from a source that is mean, relentless and out of control. The\nexplosion of feral hogs across the U.S. is threatening the deer population --\nspreading disease, dominating the food chain and even, on occasion, killing\nand eating fawns. In Louisiana, where there are an estimated 700,000 wild\nhogs, hunters and wildlife officials say they are taking a toll on the\nwhitetail deer herd.\"They are in the marshes and beaches of Louisiana all the\nway up into the hills and piney woods and swamps,\" Jim LaCour, state wildlife\nveterinarian for the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, told\nFoxNews.com. \"They’re in every habitat in the state.\"\"If you start to see hogs\nin your hunting area, you are absolutely not going to see deer.\"- hunter\nJustin Lanclos\"They’re very adaptable and also highly destructive,\" LaCour\nsaid.LaCour described the feral pigs, which can weigh up to 500 pounds, as\n\"opportunistic\" eaters -- omnivores that feast on anything crossing their\npath, including deer fawn, other piglets and dead animals. LaCour said hogs\ncarry many diseases, such as leptospirosis, which can infect or kill other\nanimals, like deer, as well as humans. \"Hogs are the sport utility vehicle for\ndisease and parasites -- they move them across the landscape,\" he said. \"That\nbacteria [leptospirosis] can cause abortion in the deer – and it can kill\nadult deer or people.\"Their presence is also detrimental to the land, forcing\nwildlife officials to carry out aerial gunning in certain areas \"because they\ntear up the marsh and that leads to coastal erosion.\"Hogs were first\nintroduced to North America by Spanish settlers. The breed most commonly seen\nin Texas is a mixture of those hogs and Russian boars brought over more\nrecently for sport hunting, according to the Texas Parks and Wildlife\nDepartment.Some speculate the population boom is due to relatively recent\ncross-breeding in the wild. Others, like LaCour, say the popularity of hog\nhunting in the 1980's and early '90's led humans to move the feral pigs from\nconfined, geographically isolated areas into places they had never been\nbefore. Wild hogs can reproduce by the time they are 6 months old. Feral sows\ncan have two litters per year averaging six piglets per litter, according to\nwildlife experts. Statisticians have determined that 75 percent of the\npopulation must be harvested to maintain a static population -- prompting\nLouisiana and other states to adopt liberal hunting policies when it comes to\nkilling the hogs. Texas has the highest rate of feral hogs to date, according\nto environmentalists.For deer hunter Justin Lanclos, the very sighting of a\nferal pig means trouble.\"If you start to see hogs in your hunting area, you\nare absolutely not going to see deer,\" said Lanclos, a 33-year-old bowhunter\nfrom Sulthur, La.\"Deer are extremely smart and elusive,\" Lanclos told\nFoxNews.com. \"They just don’t like to occupy the same area as hogs.\"Lanclos,\nthe owner of retailer Louisiana Bowhunter, said he recently received a photo\nshowing a herd of hogs -- or sounder -- running off with a whitetail fawn. The\nimage, believed to have been taken in Louisiana, has since gone viral on\nsocial media.  \"We’ve got other photos of feral hogs carrying fawns,\" noted\nLaCour. \"If the hogs are coming through a field and they happen to come across\nit, they’re going to eat it.\"__\n\n","title":"Deer hunters face unwanted competition as feral hog explosion thins herds | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Deer hunters face unwanted competition as feral hog explosion thins herds https://t.co/VF1fS5Yn5x https://t.co/JA3OYQaFeK","date":"Fri Apr 01 05:10:05 +0000 2016","favs":124,"id":{"$numberLong":"715768172876464128"},"retweets":135},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1UFK3gO"}

The\nsix-hour ordeal ended peacefully when police arrested Mustafa after all\npassengers and crew were released.During a court hearing Wednesday, a police\nprosecutor said Mustafa told authorities after his arrest, \"What's someone\nsupposed to do when he hasn't seen his wife and children in 24 years and the\nEgyptian government won't let him?\"But Paraschou suggested in the interview\nthat it was all a ruse.\"This man never cared for his children for one minute,\neither when he lived here or when he went away,\" Paraschou is quoted as\nsaying. \"He only offered pain, misery and terror. And even now when he's in\npolice custody, my children and I are afraid.\"Cypriot police said Mustafa had\nnot asked any lawyer to represent him.In a separate interview with daily\nPolitis also published Thursday, Paraschou said Mustafa used her as an\n\"excuse\" to seek asylum in Cyprus.Paraschou told Phileleftheros she married\nMustafa in 1985 when she was 20. The couple divorced five years later and\nsince then had only once made contact when she called him several years later\nto say that their teenage daughter — one of four children the couple had\ntogether — had been killed in a car accident.\"What do I care? It doesn't\nmatter she was killed,\" Paraschou said Mustafa had told her.She said while\nmarried, the couple lived in her parents' home and that Mustafa never held\ndown a job, beating his children when he couldn't support his drug\nhabit.Egypt's interior ministry said Mustafa had a long criminal record but\nhad finished serving a one-year prison term in March 2015.Cyprus police told\nthe AP that Mustafa's criminal record on the island stretched back to 1988,\nwhen he was convicted on six counts of forging passports and handed a\nsuspended sentence. He was later deported to Egypt following domestic violence\ncharges by Paraschou.He re-entered Cyprus on an assumed Qatari identity, but\nwas tracked down and again deported to Egypt in 1990._The Associated Press\ncontributed to this report._  \n__\n\n","title":"Ex-wife calls EgyptAir hijacker 'abusive' as video emerges of passenger 'selfie' | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Ex-wife calls EgyptAir hijacker 'abusive' as video emerges of passenger 'selfie'  https://t.co/N4Om92b0pm https://t.co/6h0h6iuH6f","date":"Fri Apr 01 04:25:05 +0000 2016","favs":60,"id":{"$numberLong":"715756850583437312"},"retweets":46},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1SAn8jd"}

Dawson, 66, of Tennessee was charged with assaulting,\nresisting, or impeding certain officers or employees with a dangerous weapon\nand assaulting a federal law enforcement officer with a dangerous weapon,\nprosecutors said in a statement. The first charge carries a statutory maximum\nof 25 years in prison, and the latter a statutory maximum of 30 years, they\nsaid.Dawson was shot by police during the incident Monday and was\nhospitalized. He has not yet appeared in court.U.S. Capitol was on lockdown\nfor about an hour Monday after the incident. A female bystander also sustained\nnon-life-threatening injuries.Court paperwork filed Thursday says Dawson\narrived at the visitor's center at about 2:30 p.m. Monday and went through a\nmetal detector, which indicated the presence of metal at his waist. He spread\nhis arms in response to an officer's request, the court paperwork says, but\nthen suddenly reached into the area of his waist and removed \"what appeared to\nbe a black handgun.\" Dawson took a hand-held metal detector from the officer\nwho had asked him to spread his arms and threw it onto the floor. He then\npointed the weapon at the officer, who drew his own weapon. Dawson ignored\nofficers' commands to drop the weapon and was shot twice, according to court\npaperwork provided by prosecutors.\"The gun resembled in color, shape, weight,\nand other outward appearances a semi-automatic handgun,\" the document\nsaid.Dawson was known previously to police, who last October arrested him for\ndisrupting House proceedings and yelling he was a \"Prophet of God.\" He was\nissued a \"stay away order\" that required him to avoid the Capitol\ngrounds.After Dawson's arrest in October, he did not appear in court as\nscheduled the following month.

Mason resigned from his office Wednesday.Al.com reported that Democratic\nRep. Craig Ford, the Alabama House Minority Leader, confirmed that Republican\nState Rep. Ed Henry is setting up the initial framework for articles of\nimpeachment.“If the House impeaches Bentley, it would bring the governor one\nstep closer to being removed from office by the legislature,” Al.com\nsaid.Henry said the articles of impeachment must be introduced due to\nBentley’s “incompetence and moral turpitude,” calling into question the\ngovernor’s ability to govern the state.Henry is due to start the impeachment\nprocess next week when the Alabama state legislature is due to return after\nits spring break.Despite the calls for resignation, it is still unclear if\nHenry would have enough support in the legislature to move forward with the\nprocess.Alabama requires a simple majority in the House to introduce articles\nof impeachment.Bentley has remained firm in his plan to continue in the\ngovernor’s mansion, saying “My intentions are to try to make this state\nbetter, to work through the difficulties we’re going through.”  The\nimpeachment threat further compounds the calls for Bentley’s resignation from\nboth prominent Republicans and Republican groups in the state.Among those\ncalling for his resignation are State Sen. Bill Holtzclaw, State Sen. Shay\nShelnut, and Terry Dunn, a member of Alabama’s Republican State Executive\nCommittee.The Montgomery County Republican Party also issued a statement about\nthe scandal swirling around Bentley and Mason, further pushing the threat of\nan impeachment process .The statement said, “the Montgomery County Republican\nExecutive Committee hereby calls upon Governor Bentley to resign his office\nimmediately to avoid bringing further embarrassment and disgrace upon himself,\nthe great state of Alabama, and the Republican Party of Alabama which could\nresult from pending investigation by the Attorney General and/or impeachment\nproceedings.”The College Republican Federation of Alabama issued a statement\nagainst Bentley, falling just short of calling for his resignation. “Gov.\nBentley has brought shame and embarrassment to the State of Alabama by means\nof local, state, and national news as well as social media through his own\nself-admitted devious, immoral, and possibly illegal actions involving his\nmarried senior top aide, not only of the sexual nature but regarding her\ncompensation as a non-state employee yet making key decisions in the governing\nof the state,” the statement said._FoxNews.com's Danny Jativa and The\nAssociated Press contributed to this report.___\n\n","title":"Alabama lawmakers threaten to impeach governor over relationship scandal | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Alabama lawmakers threaten to impeach governor over relationship scandal  https://t.co/6JmpcsvrPk https://t.co/6qVUx4CGju","date":"Fri Apr 01 03:55:05 +0000 2016","favs":83,"id":{"$numberLong":"715749300987236352"},"retweets":61},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1SCF0Ko"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc958b7"},"content":"  Among the mounting headaches for Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan – in\nWashington this week for a visit that notably does not include a formal\nsitdown with President Obama – is a 74-year-old Muslim cleric quietly living\non a private compound in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania.Fethullah Gulen,\na one-time Erdogan ally, is the head of a faith-based social movement that\nboasts a global following, has deep roots in Turkish society, and cultivates\nnotable influence in the U.S. education through a network of roughly 150\nsecular charter schools.But a nasty split between the two over Erdogan’s\nyears-long crackdown on domestic dissent and Turkey’s once-open media\nlandscape has now spread to the United States, and threatens to further\ndestabilize an already frayed alliance.“It is Erdogan’s way of fighting the\ncorruption without obviously confronting the issue of corruption.”- Professor\nHenri Barkey, expert on TurkeyMore than 2,000 Gulen supporters have been\narrested in Turkey on various charges since the 2013 split, though many were\nlater released. And Turkish authorities recently seized control of one of\nTurkey’s largest newspapers, Zaman, which was associated with Gulen.But what’s\nrelatively new to many Americans only now hearing about Gulen is a high-\nprofile, multimillion-dollar public relations and legal effort by the Erdogan\ngovernment to extradite him to Turkey, and raise myriad questions about the\npropriety of the charter schools.Erdogan has cracked down on the media in\nTurkey, but has been unable to strike at his arch nemesis in the U.S.\n(Associated Press) “This is a really dangerous group,” charged Robert\nAmsterdam, a lawyer whose firm Erdogan hired to launch an international\ninvestigation of the Gulen organization - particularly its business and\npolitical dealings in the U.S. “When it comes to these charter schools and\nGulen, nothing is transparent.”Gulen cloisters himself on the grounds of an\nIslamic retreat owned by Turkish Americans in Saylorsburg, Pa., and rarely\ngives interviews to news media. But his sermons appear online. He preaches\nwhat many consider a moderate form of Islam. And he has regularly and\nstridently condemned jihadist terror attacks – much more so than Erdogan, say\nthe president’s critics – and typically advocates interfaith dialogue.Turkish\nIslamic preacher Fethullah Gulen, pictured at his residence in Saylorsburg,\nPa., is charged in Turkey with plotting to overthrow the government.\n(Associated Press) Gulen’s Hizmet movment -- meaning “service” in Turkish --\nis marked by business savvy and a successful push to build political\nconnections. The movement is believed to be worth billions of\ndollars.**_Troubling statements from Turkey's Erdogan_**“This is not a\nproselytizing movement. This is not a glory-of-Islam movement. This is a\nglory-of-the-Gulen-movement movement,” said Joshua Hendrick, an associate\nprofessor of sociology and global studies at Loyola University of Maryland who\nwrote a book about Hizmet.Hendrick disputed Amsterdam’s argument the\norganization is dangerous. But in Erdogan’s view, Gulen is an arch-enemy of\nthe state, whose followers represent a seditious “parallel state” within\nTurkey.Erdogan claims the school network funnels money back to Turkey to fund\nGulen's efforts to overthrow his government. Gulen is specifically accused of\nscheming to have his followers infiltrate the Turkish government for the\npurpose of overthrowing Erdogan’s ruling Justice and Development Party, known\nby its Turkish acronym as the AKP. Gulen also faces espionage charges, and two\ntrials are now being held in absentia.“Those accusations are laughable; they\nhave no evidence,” said Y. Alp Aslandogan, executive director of the Alliance\nfor Shared Values, a New York-based organization that promotes Gulen’s\nteachings.Several scholars in the U.S. interviewed by FoxNews.com also\ndefended Gulen and criticized the Turkish prosecution of him, citing Erdogan’s\naggressive crackdown.“There is no evidence that I am aware of to support the\nidea that the movement is at all violent or terroristic,” Zeki Saritoprak,\nprofessor of Islamic studies at John Carroll University in Ohio, told Fox\nNews. “Allegations to the contrary are absurd.”Another scholar, A. Kadir\nYildirim, of Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy, agreed. “All\nopposition groups, including the Gulen Movement, are being targeted by\nPresident Erdogan,” he said, listing Kurds, non-Muslim minorities and liberals\nas other victims of Erdogan’s autocratic tilt.Professor Henri Barkey, director\nof the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for\nScholars and a longtime expert on Turkey, said Gulen supporters have been\nscapegoated to draw attention from Turkey’s complex domestic and foreign\npolicy problems -- which range from increased internal unrest and a Kurdish\ninsurgency to Russia’s menacing influence in Syria and Turkey’s fraying\nalliance with the U.S. over – among other factors -- the Obama\nadministration’s support for Kurdish militias in the battle against ISIS.“It\nis convenient for the government to blame the Gulenists for everything,”\nBarkey said. “It is Erdogan’s way of fighting the corruption without obviously\nconfronting the issue of corruption.”One scholar argued for a more careful\napproach. Abraham Wagner, a lecturer at Columbia Law School and a board member\nat the Center for Advanced Studies on Terrorism, said the next U.S.\nadministration should pay close attention to Hizmet activities in\nAmerica.“They are trying to undermine the (Turkish) government … We have to be\naware of what they are and how they are operating,” he said. “It’s not an open\nand shut case. What I am urging is, let’s take a closer look at what they are\ndoing.”Some have done just that. A number of Gulen-affiliated schools have\nbeen investigated over accusations that include mismanagement of public funds\nand possible visa fraud. Amsterdam alleges the network has a history of\nreceiving a disproportionate share of H-1B visas -- temporary non-immigrant\nwork visas -- that allow foreign teachers to work in the U.S. He said Gulen’s\nU.S. charter network, however loosely organized, generates massive profits,\nand that “a percentage of that is going back to Turkey” and being used to\nfoment “instability.”Barkey said Gulen-affiliated charters aren’t necessarily\nengaging in illegality, but they “skirt good practices or common sense\nsometimes.” He said he was infuriated when he saw a recent report on the CBS\nprogram “60 Minutes” about Gulen charters that highlighted one example of a\nschool bringing a Turkish national to the U.S. to teach English.“You are going\nto tell me that a Turk, who is going to speak with an accent, is going to\nteach English to kids in the U.S.?” Barkey asked.The Chicago Sun-Times also\nreported last year that the Justice Department launched an investigation into\nalleged misuse of federal grant money at Concept Schools, a Gulen-linked\nnetwork of some 30 charters in Illinois and five other states. Federal\nofficials did not respond to multiple inquiries from FoxNews.com, but Concept\nmanagement said, through a spokeswoman, they “continue to cooperate with\nauthorities.” To date, no one affiliated with a Gulen charter has been\nconvicted of any criminal activity.Amsterdam and other Hizmet critics also\naccused some Gulen-linked charters of targeting selected students to\nproselytize.“Our investigation has uncovered that … there is a proselytizing\ncampaign where these Turkish teachers, we are told, actually target youths in\nthese schools -- not a lot, maybe four or five per class -- to bring them into\nthe movement,” Amsterdam said.When asked, Amsterdam, who reiterated many of\nthe charges in a news conference in Washington Thursday, would not immediately\nprovide specifics.That charge, too, was met with skepticism by those who note\nGulen schools are often highly regarded and more focused on science and\ntechnology instruction.“Worldwide, to my knowledge, there has been no credible\nevidence of religious indoctrination at any school established or run by\nHizmet sympathizers,” said Saritoprak.Amsterdam vows his investigation is far\nfrom over. His efforts have thus far produced one court case -- a pending\ncivil suit in U.S. District Court in Pennsylvania -- which alleges Gulen used\na 2009 sermon to signal his followers in law enforcement in Turkey to falsely\narrest three political opponents.Gulen’s lawyer in that case, Michael Miller,\nargues U.S. law does not apply, and called it “an abuse of the U.S. courts to\ntry to initiate a lawsuit like this as part of a global campaign, a political\ncampaign, to harass Mr. Gulen.”Meanwhile, Aslandogan and other Hizmet\nsupporters want Americans to see through these anti-Gulen efforts, and\nrecognize this as an international political fight led by the increasingly\nautocratic Erdogan.“We are talking about a person with dictatorial ambitions\nin Turkey, and he is taking his battles to American shores,” Aslandogan\nsaid.__\n\n","title":"Embattled Erdogan visits US as mysterious nemesis watches from compound in Pa. mountains | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Embattled Erdogan visits US as mysterious nemesis watches from compound in Pa. mountains  https://t.co/3o9cAx7jD0 https://t.co/wIs0wBCr06","date":"Fri Apr 01 03:44:05 +0000 2016","favs":37,"id":{"$numberLong":"715746529634439168"},"retweets":54},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1SCePmV"}

(UN Photo/Nektarios\nMarkogianni)s The ugly record of alleged rape and sexual abuse by\ninternational peacekeepers in the battered Central African Republic, one of\nthe worst scandals to stain the United Nations in years, is growing much worse\n-- despite more U.N. assertions that it is moving aggressively to deal with\nthe seemingly endless crisis.According to one of the U.N.’s most persistent\nand best-informed critics over the sex-abuse issue, nearly 100 new allegations\nof Central African Republic sexual wrongdoing --one an alleged rape that took\nplace last Monday -- have been aired before U.N. investigators in the past two\nweeks.Yesterday, the U.N. announced only that an “integrated team” of\ninvestigators was on the ground to probe unspecified allegations of sexual\nwrongdoing by U.N. and non-U.N. peacekeepers alike in the beleaguered country,\noften known by the acronym CAR, where a new President, Faustin-Archange\nTouadéra, is being inaugurated today.(U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Samantha\nPower was in CAR for the inauguration, and today among other things planned to\nvisit a U.N. peacekeeping field office, as well as “some of the families\nimpacted by allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse by UN peacekeepers.)\n“The exact number and nature of these extremely troubling allegations are\nstill being determined,” the press release declared, noting they extended from\n2013 to 2015.At least two peacekeeping units from Burundi and Gabon, part of\nthe 11,500-member U.N. force known as MINUSCA, have been confined to their\nbarracks during the probe, the U.N. declared -- “except for essential tasks”\napparently related to CAR’s budding political process.Other non-U.N.\npeacekeepers from France -- operating under a U.N. Security Council mandate --\n“are also being investigated,” according to the statement. It added that\n“local armed groups” -- warring factions -- were implicated in some of the\nactions.  The U.N. press statement followed a series of earlier, lower-key\ndeclarations both by MINUSCA itself and then by Secretary General Ban Ki-\nmoon’s spokesman, Stephane Dujarric, announcing that new allegations of sexual\nabuse had been uncovered and were being investigated.  Emphasizing that “these\nallegations reportedly refer to incidents that occurred in 2014 and 2015,”\nDujarric declared on Easter Monday that MINUSCA’s “primary concern was to\nensure that the victims have been assisted and all reports immediately\ninvestigated to ensure that any perpetrator is appropriately\nsanctioned.”Military personnel participate in the official hand-over ceremony\ntransitioning peacekeeping responsibilities in the Central African Republic\nfrom MISCA to MINUSCA on Sept. 15, 2014. (UN Photo/Catianne Tijerina) “We\nexpect more information from the mission in the next days,” he added.Instead,\nthe next information blast came from a gadfly non-government organization that\nhas repeatedly exposed U.N. internal documentation on the long-running sexual\nabuse scandal over the past year.The advocacy group known as AIDS-Free World\nwas far more graphic about the shocking scope and number of the allegations,\nand the amount of time the U.N. has taken looking into them.On a website\ndubbed the Code Blue campaign, AIDS-Free World yesterday reported that as far\nback as two weeks ago the U.N. child relief agency UNICEF had interviewed 98\ngirls in one CAR province alone who said they were sexually abused by\ninternational peacekeepers.The Code Blue site did not reveal the confidential\nsources for its information, but provided details of some of the sordid\nincidents, including alleged forced sex with a dog.The website also said the\nroster of those allegations dated as far back as 2013 and extended through\n2015, but named only peacekeepers from Gabon and France as being involved.Code\nBlue then brought the allegations much closer to home, at least so far as the\nU.N. is concerned.It declared, once again without naming its confidential\nsources, that in another part of the country, the mother of a 16-year-old girl\nhad told local police that on March 28 -- last Monday -- her daughter had been\nraped in a hotel room by a U.N. peacekeeper from Congo. According to the\nwebsite, the soldier had subsequently declared in front of his force commander\nthat he had had sex with the girl for money.The U.N.’s own announcement of the\ninvestigations made no mention of the March 28 incident.Code Blue also\noutlined what it said were the outcomes of a meeting on Tuesday, March 29, of\ntop-level U.N. officials to discuss how to deal with the latest eruption of\ncrisis. That included what Code Blue called “unified ‘messaging’” to the CAR\ngovernment, troop-contributing countries, Secretary General Ban and the media,\nas well as the possible sending of “high-level envoys” to countries whose\ntroops were confirmed to be part of the scandal.Queried by Fox News about the\nmeeting details, press spokesman Dujarric confirmed that such a gathering had\ntaken place, but emphasized that “the way we are reacting shows the level of\nchange within the U.N. in how to react to these sorts of allegations.”Dujarric\nalso pointed to an article that appeared in Newsweek on March 30 by the U.N.’s\nspecial envoy to CAR, Parfait Onanga-Anyanga, relating news of the alleged\nrape of a 14-year-old girl by peacekeepers, along with a reference to the\nearlier incidents, and expressing his determination “to put an end to it in my\nmission.”Ananga-Anyanga related his extensive travels across CAR to spread an\nanti-abuse message, declaring that “I have made the fight against sexual\nexploitation and abuse one of the Mission’s top priorities.” An unspecified\n“task force” had been established to deal with the issue he said, and patrols\nmounted to monitor off-duty peacekeeping personnel. Now, he said, “is the time\nfor the rights of the victim to come first.”“They're a ragtag collection of\nuntrained, unqualified staff with zero authority to investigate crimes . . .”\n\\- Paula Donovan, co-director of AIDS-Free WorldMaybe so. But the alarming\napparent scope of the allegations as Code Blue revealed them hit hard at\nclaims the U.N. has been making for months that it was moving as fast and\nvigorously as possible to put a clamp on peacekeeper sexual abuse -- not just\nin CAR but at 15 other U.N. peacekeeping missions are around the world -- and\nalso bringing ugly facts as fast as possible into the daylight.Indeed, the\nU.N.’s “integrated team” of investigators was derided by Paula Donovan, co-\ndirector of AIDS-Free World, as “a reckless, panicked response” to the latest\nabuse crisis.“They're a ragtag collection of untrained, unqualified staff with\nzero authority to investigate crimes, no idea how to preserve evidence for a\ntrial, and no expertise to_ _question _any _victims of rape, never mind women\nand children who've been violently sexually abused by the integrated team's\nfellow U.N. workers,” she told Fox News in response to the latest U.N. press\nrelease.An “incompetent and disingenuous” U.N. bureaucracy is creating “dead-\nends to justice and putting civilians in danger,” she added.Code Blue’s\nproposed solution to the sex abuse crisis is to take such investigations out\nof the U.N.’s hands, and given them to an independent committee of experts to\nhandle, a possibility that the U.N. argues is legally and practically\nimpossible.  The fact is that U.N. reactions to the continuing cascade of\nsexual abuse allegations have contrasted recently with official expressions of\ncriticism and even despair at the U.N.’s handling of the problem.The criticism\nwas summed up most starkly in the findings of an independent panel that last\nDecember castigated specific U.N. senior officials for their inaction and\ncoverup of sexual abuse allegations in an earlier chapter of the scandal\ninvolving the non-U.N. troops in CAR.That document somewhat prophetically\nwarned that bureaucratic indifference might well have prevented the discovery\nof “the possibility of a broader pattern of sexual violence by some\ninternational peacekeeping troops.”U.N. Secretary General Ban deftly\nsidestepped those conclusions in February, when he announced the creation of a\nnew special coordinator, Jane Holl Lute, to handle the battle against sexual\nabuse. Her job, he said, was to “better align our peacekeeping and human\nrights systems and to strengthen United Nations response to sexual\nexploitation and abuse.”Ban followed that at the beginning of this month, when\nhe made another and bigger public effort at U.N. “transparency” and rigor, in\nthe form of  his  annual report on the battle against sexual exploitation and\nabuse, known in UN-speak as SEA.The document revealed there were 22 new sex\nallegations in CAR during 2015, out of 69 worldwide against peacekeeping\npersonnel -- the largest single-mission total.Ban’s report was stippled with\nplanned measures, ranging from better training to better vetting of\npeacekeepers to faster investigation procedures and better channels for\nvictims to use in bringing allegations -- most of which were still entangled\nin the U.N.’s molasses-dense combination of bureaucracy and need for member\nstate assent.Ban had also called for a U.N. trust fund to be set up to aid\nvictims of sexual abuse -- but the U.N. itself has no money to put in it, a\nfact that came up again in spokesman Dujarric’s press briefings.Ban’s report\ncame out just a month after the resignation of Anthony Banbury, the U.N.’s\nAssistant Secretary General for Field Support, who had been a key U.N.\ntroubleshooter on the peacekeeping rape issue, as well as other U.N. crises.\n(Banbury’s replacement, Lisa Buttenheim, was named to the job yesterday.)Two\nweeks ago, Banbury revealed his own opposition to the inclusion of soldiers\nfrom the Democratic Republic of Congo in the CAR peacekeeping mission. About\n120 of them were sent home just before he resigned; Ban’s report revealed that\nthe DRC troops were U.N. peacekeeping’s top offender in terms of number of\nsex-abuse allegations against them.In an impassioned New York Times op-ed\npiece, Banbury declared that the main reason he left the U.N. was “colossal\nmismanagement,” coupled with “minimal accountability” even as he praised Ban\nas a “man of great integrity” and hailed “smart, brave and selfless” U.N.\nstaffers.He also noted that as sexual abuse cases kept rising in CAR --\ncoupled with the brazen beating of civilians by the Democratic Republic of\nCongo forces -- there was “hardly a murmur, and certainly no outrage, from the\nresponsible officials in New York.”_George Russell is Editor-at-Large of Fox\nNews.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc958c4"},"content":"  As the FBI enters the final phases of its investigation into Hillary\nClinton’s use of an unauthorized email server for government business,\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI Director James Comey are meeting\nfrequently to discuss the progress and handling of the highly sensitive case,\na source told Fox News.Among the issues discussed in the meetings, which have\nbeen taking place several times per week, are who will be interviewed and in\nwhat order, according to an intelligence source close to the ongoing case.\nEmails released by the State Department have already shown Clinton and several\nkey aides used the personal, unsecured network to send more than 1,000\nmessages which have been deemed classified.“In a case like this you get one\nshot at the queen,” the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record,\nsaid referring to Clinton, the former secretary of state and current front-\nrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination. “The pressures are enormous\non the agents, as the case has to be airtight and perfect.”“In a case like\nthis you get one shot at the queen.”- Source with knowledge of\ninvestigationComey and Lynch are likely involved in daily briefings on the\nstatus of the explosive investigation, said Ron Hosko, former assistant\ndirector of the FBI’s criminal investigative division.The investigation into\nClinton's private email server is reaching a critical point, according to\nsources. “This in an incredibly high stakes, high-wire act,” Hosko said.\n“Timing is of the essence, but being right is absolutely critical. Comey must\nbe the one to make the case that the law has been broken and a prosecution is\nrecommended.”Nearly a dozen people who worked with Clinton at State, as well\nas others linked to the Clinton family’s nonprofit foundation have received,\nor are expected to receive, formal interview requests from the bureau, the\nsource told Fox News. The Los Angeles Times reported Sunday that the FBI was\nsetting up interviews with Clinton’s closest associates and would likely seek\nan interview with her.The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the\nbiggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage →“The authority for these formal\ninterview requests by the Bureau is granted by the Attorney General,” the\nsource added.FBI Director Comey wants to make sure the case is airtight,\naccording to a key source. The formal interview requests are now being rapidly\norganized to set a time, date and place for the individuals to speak with\nfederal agents about how their names have surfaced in the FBI’s ongoing\ncriminal investigation. The interviews would not require any statements under\noath, and subjects could decline them.As the interviews evolve, the FBI, as\nfirst reported by Fox News last fall, will explore possible violations of\nCriminal Code section 1001, which covers \"statements or entries generally,\"\nand can be applied when an individual makes misleading or false statements\nthat cause federal agents to expend additional resources and time. Legal\nexperts, as well as a former FBI agent, told Fox News Section 1001 could apply\nif Clinton, her aides or attorney were not forthcoming with FBI agents about\nher emails, classification and whether only non-government records were\ndestroyed.High-profile names convicted of violating Section 1001 include\nMartha Stewart, as well as former CIA Director David Petraeus.Clinton recently\ninsisted to Fox News’ Bret Baier during a town hall that neither she nor her\nlawyers have been formally notified that they are targets of an FBI\ninvestigation.“Absolutely not,” Clinton said.Attorney General Loretta Lynch is\nregularly briefed on the investigation, sources told Fox News. (Associated\nPress) But such formal notification typically comes at the end of a process\nthat sometimes spans months or even years of investigation, and even then only\nif it is determined that a subject’s activities likely merit\nprosecution.Former Clinton campaign staffer and State Department information\ntechnology specialist Bryan Pagliano, who installed Clinton’s private server,\nwas granted immunity by the Justice Department and is cooperating with the\nFBI.“His importance as a witness cannot be underestimated,” a source told Fox\nNews.Pagliano has first-hand knowledge of who held and used accounts on the\nserver from Clinton’s dealings in politics, philanthropy and private\nenterprise.  Understanding how these worlds intersected is “causing rats to\nleave the ship and others to sweat blood,” said the source. IT specialist\nBryan Pagliano could emerge as a key witness. (Associated Press) Who was doing\nwhat while getting paid by whom is key to the ongoing criminal probe, as the\nFBI’s No. 1 priority is ferreting out public corruption. Putting the pieces\ntogether is a challenge for federal investigators and investigative\njournalists.Key Clinton aide Huma Abedin told the State Department in a July\n5, 2013, letter that, “in addition to my work for the Department of State, I\nperformed work for three others.”Those jobs included working during parts of\n2012 and 2013 for the Clinton-allied firm Teneo Holdings, which paid Abedin\n$105,000 even as she earned another $135,000 as a State Department\n“consultant.” Teneo, which was founded by longtime Clinton insider Doug Band,\n“advised clients on communications and investor relations for 10 different\nmerger and acquisition deals worth a total of over $60 billion,” according to\nFortune magazine.Abedin, (l.), is a longtime aide to Clinton. (Reuters) In the\nsame letter, Abedin stressed that “it is my understanding that Teneo does not\nconduct business with the Department of State. I also was not asked nor did I\nprovide insights about the Department, my work with the Secretary or any\ngovernment information to which I may have had access.”The Clinton Foundation,\nfounded in 1997, before President Bill Clinton left the White House, was\nrenamed the “Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Foundation” six weeks after Hillary\nClinton left the State Department in February 2013. Abedin worked for the\nfoundation before and after it was renamed.Critics, including Republican\nlawmakers, have suggested that Clinton may have used her influence as\nSecretary of State to reward donors to the foundation, which Hosko believes is\nan aspect of the email investigation.“I am certain the FBI is looking at the\nnexus of State and the business of the foundation enrichment,” Hosko said. “Is\nthere a shell game being played out on a global grand scale that creates a\nchallenging paper trail?”__Pamela K.

A DC police\nspokesperson told FoxNews.com that officers already were on the scene to\nassist with security outside the event and no calls had been placed for their\nassistance. As of 12:15 p.m. ET, no arrests had been made, the spokesperson\nsaid.When protesters tried crossing the street to move closer to Brookings, DC\npolice officers blocked traffic and separated them from Turkish security,\naccording to Foreign Policy. A Secret Service agent standing nearby was\noverheard saying “the situation is a bit out of control.”A shoving match\noccurred later between a Turkish security official and another person, who\nappeared to be a Brookings Institute worker, Foreign Policy magazine's website\nreported.

But why?**  \n**• RNC unveils contested contention website**  \n**• Sponsors balk at backing Republican convention**  \n**• Hillary grabs big lead in home state showdown with Trump **  \n**• Clean inside and out**  \n  \n**TRUMP IS LOSING IN WISCONSIN. BUT WHY?**  \nNever underestimate the capacity of those in media and politics to overstate\ntheir influence. Like roosters who credit themselves with the sunrise, members\nof the narrow elite witness any phenomenon and immediately look for evidence\nof their own influence.  \n  \nFor example, **Donald Trump**’s rise is often attributed to the jaw-dropping\nimbalances of coverage that he has received compared to other candidates. And\nthe chasm has been embarrassingly deep indeed.  \n  \nBut that’s a better explanation for why traditional candidates didn’t catch on\nthan why Trump first captured the support of his most ardent followers. His\npre-existing celebrity combined with a message aimed right at the heart of the\nAmericans whose lives have been most disrupted by the changing world economy\ndid that. Trump and his acolytes did that.  \n  \nThis would sound obvious everywhere but in Washington, but it still merits\nsaying: If Trump, as expected, becomes the Republican nominee, the media will\nbear considerable responsibility, but not nearly so much as he and his\nsupporters.  \n  \nNow Trump is stumbling. Predictable, avoidable distractions involving his\ncampaign team and his attacks on a rival are piled on top of a series of three\nserious policy blunders.  \n  \nPart of this is attributable to intensifying scrutiny, but part of this is\nbecause Trump’s ability to clear one controversy by creating another is\ncatching up with him. It was already costing him with voters even before the\nmost recent round of troubles. After months of benefitting from media spasms\nby doubling down on what seemed like errors, Trump is, at least temporarily,\noutrunning his supply lines.  \n  \nAnd as it would happen, there is a pivotal primary in five days. Wisconsin is\nthe only major primary contest in a one-month span and could substantially\nreset the frame for the race as it goes into the remaining 16 states.  \n  \nWisconsin’s Republican voters look an awful lot like those in neighboring\nIllinois and Michigan, states where Trump handily won primaries earlier this\nmonth. Fox News First has little doubt that if Wisconsin’s primary had been\nheld three weeks earlier, Trump would have been in a very strong position to\nwin.  \n  \nBut April looks different than March and daily we see polls in Wisconsin that\nshow Trump stuck around 30 percent and Sen. **Ted Cruz** leaping ahead thanks\nto voters who previously supported other candidates now out of the race.  \n  \nExplaining this ought to be simple. The Republican nominating process is a\nreferendum on Trump and Trump has been stumbling. Cruz has been working hard\nto woo supporters of his fallen rivals and voters in the Badger State are\nresponding. It’s a fairly simple dynamic, unless, of course, you are part of\nthe narrow elite in the press or politics.  \n  \nIn that case, the reason Trump is losing is because the establishment is\nbattling back. Just ask ‘em.  \n  \nThat’s silly. Establishment battling has done nothing but help Trump. Angry\ndenunciations by the _very serious people_ have given prankster Trump perfect\nstraight lines. His voters oftentimes seem to love the destruction of the\nruling caste more than they do their own champion.  \n  \nConsider the current confounding claim that if Trump fails to win enough\ndelegates to become the nominee, it will be because of trickery. Many Trump\nsupporters ardently believe this and find efforts by other candidates to win\nas evidence of pure corruption.  \n  \nCertainly the belated but sustained barrage of negative ads against Trump is\ntaking its toll. And in that way, outside forces are at work in Wisconsin and\nelsewhere.  \n  \nBut as they did in explaining his rise, politicos and pressies continue to\noverstate their parts and underestimate the role of the candidate and voters\nin explaining Trump’s stumbles.  \n  \nIf Trump breaks down on the back nine, it won’t be the fault of the announcers\nin the booth or the sponsors of the tournament. It will be just him and his\nscorecard.  \n  \n**Trump backs then immediately opposes women being punished for having abortions - **Fox News: “Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump quickly walked back a statement he made earlier Wednesday that if abortion were illegal in the United States, then women who have the procedure should be punished - saying later that only those who performed the procedure should be punished.”  \n  \n[Staunch pro-lifer **Molly Hemmingway** makes the case for how Trump’s answer\non abortion could sabotage the pro-life movement.]  \n  \n**Trump tries to change the subject with tax release refusal - **The Hill: “The Donald Trump campaign on Wednesday released what appears to be a letter from the Republican presidential front-runner’s tax attorneys saying that his tax filings since 2009 are currently being audited. ‘Your personal tax returns have been under continuous examination by the Internal Revenue Service since 2002, consistent with the IRS’s practice for large and complex businesses,’ reads the letter, signed by tax partners **Sheri Dillon** and **William Nelson** of Morgan, Lewis \u0026amp; Bockius.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc958cc"},"content":"  The next round of Gitmo transfers will begin this weekend with two detainees\ngoing an undisclosed country in Africa, a U.S. official told Fox News.In\nJanuary, the Pentagon conducted a bulk transfer of 10 detainees at once, the\nlargest transfer from the U.S. Naval Station at Guantanamo, Cuba to date.This\nnext transfer of Gitmo detainees can't happen all at once because the Pentagon\nis required by law to notify Congress 30-days before any transfers.Capitol\nHill sources tell Fox News that period has not elapsed yet for all the\ntransfers.The first notification went to Congress in early March and the\nsecond one in the middle of this month.The first transfer of two detainees\nwill begin this weekend, and the rest are expected in the middle of next\nmonth.All told, the number of detainees in these next two rounds will be about\na dozen.There are 91 detainees remaining at Gitmo. Thirty-five have been\ncleared to transfer to other countries.A Pentagon spokesman would not confirm\nthe transfer of any Gitmo detainees beginning this weekend.“I do not have a\ntimeline on when particular detainees will be transferred from Guantanamo.\nHowever, the Administration is committed to reducing the detainee population\nand to closing the detention facility responsibly,” Cmdr. Gary Ross, a defense\ndepartment spokesman, told Fox News.In the past, the Pentagon only confirmed\ndetainee transfers once they are completed. The detainees fly in US military\naircraft to their third-party nation.In a startling revelation, days ago the\nPentagon's point man for Gitmo said that some of the detainees transferred\nfrom the prison have in fact re-joined the fight and worse.Congressman Dana\nRohrabacher, R-Calif., asked Paul Lewis, the defense department’s envoy for\nthe prison many lives have been lost after detainees had been\ntransferred.“Unfortunately, there have been Americans that have died because\nof GITMO detainees,” said Lewis.The Pentagon a short time later issued a\nstatement saying that only 5% of detainees who have been released have\nreturned to the battlefield during the Obama administration. Pentagon\nofficials don't believe those detainees are among those who have killed\nAmericans.In January, the Defense Department released new statistics saying\nthe number of former Gitmo detainees suspected of re-engaging in terrorism\ndoubled from six to 12.Senator McCain refuted the administration’s statistics.\nHe believes more released Gitmo detainees return to the battlefield putting\nmore American lives at risk.“We know for a fact that roughly 30 percent of\nthose who have been released have re-entered the fight, and usually at a very\nhigh level, because it's a badge of honor to have been an inmate at Guantanamo\nBay,\" McCain said.Last month the Pentagon submitted a plan to transfer those\ndetainees not eligible for transfer overseas to go to American prisons in\nColorado, Kansas or South Carolina. The plan was immediately rejected by\nCongress who passed a law forbidding the transfer of any Gitmo detainees to\nthe United States.Late last month, flanked by his defense secretary and vice\npresident, President Obama vowed once again to close the prison.“It is viewed\nas a stain on our broader record of upholding the highest standards of rule of\nlaw,” Mr. Obama said. “This is about closing a chapter in our history.”The\npresident’s critics in Congress point out that in addition to keeping\nterrorists from returning to the fight, they also demand a plan for handling\nISIS detainees, now that a 200-man special operations task force fighting ISIS\nand recently killed the group’s second in command last week.The U.S. military\nhas no plans to hold captured Islamic State operatives for more than a month\nbefore turning them over to the Iraqi government, a spokesman for the U.S.-led\ncoalition based in Baghdad told reporters recently.“Fourteen to 30 days is a\nballpark figure, but even that is not really completely nailed down,” said\nCol. Steve Warren, a U.S. military spokesman based in Baghdad. “There isn’t a\nhard definition of short-term.”Earlier this month, Pentagon Press Secretary\nPeter Cook also made clear that the policy for holding operatives is, at best,\nevolving. He said they would be handled on a “case-by-case” basis over a\n“short-term” period.The lack of a well-defined policy for handling captured\nISIS terrorists is in turn raising concerns on Capitol Hill.“The law requires\na comprehensive detainee policy,” a congressional aide said. “By definition,\n‘we’ll figure it out if we ever capture anyone’ is not a comprehensive policy.\n“Warren said that two airstrikes against ISIS chemical weapons facilities were\nconducted following a recent mission carried out by a US special ops assault\nforce capturing an ISIS operative linked to its chemical weapons program.  \n __Lucas Tomlinson is the Pentagon and State Department producer for Fox News\nChannel.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc958cf"},"content":"(Reuters )When celebrity and science collide, harmful side effects may\noccur.The latest case happened last weekend when the Tribeca Film Festival\npulled a documentary from its program by a discredited former doctor whose\nresearch into the connection between vaccines and autism has been debunked.\nAfter festival co-founder Robert De Niro initially defended the film's\ninclusion, Tribeca - facing an uproar from doctors and experts - pulled it.The\nfilm, \"Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,\" is directed by Andrew Wakefield,\na former British gastroenterologist who was stripped of his medical license in\n2010. The British medical journal BMJ called Wakefield's study connecting\nautism and vaccines - which was retracted by the Lancet, a medical journal -\nan \"elaborate fraud.\"Scientific research has consistently found the MMR\nvaccine (given to children for measles, mumps and rubella) to be safe and have\nno link to autism. Cases of measles, however, have increased in recent years,\nlargely infecting unvaccinated people.De Niro acknowledged he personally chose\nto program the film at the festival, something he had never previously done.\n\"My intent in screening this film was to provide an opportunity for\nconversation around an issue that is deeply personal to me and my family,\"\nsaid De Niro, who, with his wife, Grace Hightower De Niro, has an 18-year-old\nson with autism.No one would question that the issue is personal to De Niro.\nBut the Tribeca Film Festival, which opens its 15th edition on April 13, is an\nextremely public event. When news of the documentary's scheduled screening\nspread, disease experts were distressed that the festival would lend its\nmegaphone to a film by a disgraced doctor. Michael Specter, the New Yorker\nstaff writer and medical expert, called it \"a disgrace\" for the festival, and\ncompared Wakefield's film to \"Leni Riefenstahl making a movie about the Third\nReich.\"The episode is only the latest instance of the medical community being\nforced to combat the influence of a celebrity promoting questionable science.\nIt has particularly bedeviled questions over vaccinations, beginning with the\nanti-vaccination advocacy of TV personality Jenny McCarthy.\"Celebrities have\nhad an out-of-proportion impact on the public's understanding of vaccine\nrisk,\" says Arthur L. Caplan, head of the Division of Medical Ethics at New\nYork University. \"I don't want to overplay it; most people vaccinate. It's not\nlike hordes of people are listening to Jenny McCarthy and saying, 'Forget the\nAmerican Association of Pediatrics, I'm going with the former Playboy\nBunny.'\"Jim Carrey and Rob Schneider have also spoken out against vaccines, as\nhave some politicians. In a GOP debate last year, Donald Trump, while saying\nhe supported them, added a story about a 2-year-old boy developing autism\nfollowing vaccination.Wakefield has vowed to press on with his film. He called\nthe Tribeca Film Festival reversal \"another example of the power of corporate\ninterests censoring free speech, art, and truth.\"Steven Silberman, author of\n\"NeuroTribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity,\" believes\nthe claims of anti-vaccination campaigners are rooted in a misunderstanding of\nautism history.

And\nyet the party, and particularly its Paul Ryan wing, was peddling the same old\nnostrums of tax cuts that primarily benefited corporations and the wealthy,\nlax immigration policies, and entitlement cuts that threatened benefits the\nvoters felt they had earned.There was just one missing element: the media.News\norganizations, for the most part, were either oblivious or uninterested in the\ngrowing disconnect between the political parties and working-class voters.\nThat’s because they were suffering from the very same gap.Media executives\nwere interested in the affluent readers and viewers most prized by\nadvertisers. Websites targeted those who could afford to pay for news.\nNewspapers like the Times in particular produced sections and features that\ncatered to folks who could afford exotic vacations, luxury homes and gourmet\nrestaurants.The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name\nin politics. See Latest Coverage →Stories about poverty and inner cities\nbecame a rarity, far more depressing than lifestyles of the rich and famous.\nPapers abandoned the labor beat as unions themselves shrunk. Politics was\ncovered as a narrow debate between Republican and Democratic ideologues,\nsometimes over hot-button social issues, that did little to address the fact\nthat wages were stagnant and manufacturing jobs disappearing.Most big-city\njournalists are well-educated and upper middle class, not a bad thing in terms\nof professionalism but a far cry from the shot-and-a-beer types of the “Front\nPage” era. The downside, however, is that it leads to blind spots.To be sure,\njournalists learned firsthand about economic insecurity as a shriveling news\nindustry gave rise to waves of layoffs and buyouts. But for the most part they\ndidn’t have to worry about their jobs moving to Mexico or China.No wonder the\npundits scoffed at the rise of Trump and failed to understand his appeal. They\nsoon realized the public was angry—and Bernie Sanders tapped into this anger\non the liberal side—but thought it was a generalized disgust with politicians\nand paralysis. They were slow to grasp the resentment on free trade and\nimmigration, two issue where big business favors a more liberal approach.A few\npolicy-oriented journalists made these observations, and there were warning\nsigns such as an unknown college professor named Dave Brat knocking off Eric\nCantor in a 2014 primary.But when Trump proposed building a wall along the\nMexican border, the media elite was dubious. When he proposed a temporary ban\non Muslim immigration, many journalists said such religious discrimination\nwould doom his campaign. Now polls show that half the public—and seven in 10\nRepublicans—agree with such a ban.The Times quoted Buffalo-area GOP\ncongressman Chris Collins, who watched a dinnerware plant he had owned go out\nof business, in part because of what he saw as Chinese currency manipulation.\n“Those jobs were stolen. And the politicians let it happen,” he said.Media\ninstitutions don’t engage in much reflection, so it’s hardly surprising that\nthe Times piece ignored their role. But some journalists for that paper\nacknowledged their myopia, in pieces ripping Trump but also pleading guilty to\nmissing his appeal.“We expected Trump to fizzle because we were not socially\nintermingled with his supporters and did not listen carefully enough,” writes\nDavid Brooks. “We were largely oblivious to the pain among working-class\nAmericans and thus didn’t appreciate how much his message resonated,” says\nNick Kristof.Trump is running against the media establishment with the same\nfervor as he castigates the political establishment.

After the FBI acquires\nraw data -- for example, the nature and number of the state secrets in the\nemails Clinton failed to protect or the regular, consistent, systematic nature\nof that failure -- prosecutors and agents proceed to draw rational inferences\nfrom that data.Then they proceed to corroborate those inferences, looking for\nother sources to support or even to contradict them. With one exception, all\nof this work has been done with neutral sources of evidence -- documents,\nemail metadata, government records and technical experts.The exception is\nBryan Pagliano, the one member of Clinton's inner circle who, with either a\nwritten promise of non-prosecution or an order of immunity from a federal\njudge, began to cooperate with federal prosecutors last fall.Here is what he\ntold the feds.Pagliano has explained to federal prosecutors the who, what,\nwhen, how and why he migrated an open State Department email stream and a\nsecret State Department email stream from government computers to Clinton's\nsecret server in her home in Chappaqua, New York. He has told them that\nClinton paid him $5,000 to commit that likely criminal activity.The latest\nheadlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest\nCoverage →He has also told some of the 147 FBI agents assigned to this case\nthat Clinton herself was repeatedly told by her own State Department\ninformation technology experts and their colleagues at the National Security\nAgency that her persistent use of her off-the-shelf BlackBerry was neither an\neffective nor an acceptable means of receiving, transmitting or safeguarding\nstate secrets. Little did they know how reckless she was with government\nsecrets, as none was apparently then aware of her use of her non-secure secret\nserver in Chappaqua for all of her email uses.We know that the acquisition and\ncorroboration phase of the investigation has been completed because the\nprosecutors have begun to ask Clinton's top aides during her time as secretary\nof state to come in for interviews. This is a delicate and dangerous phase for\nthe aides, all of whom have engaged counsel to represent them.Here are the\ndangers.The Department of Justice will not reveal to the aides or their\nlawyers what it knows about the case or what evidence of criminal wrongdoing,\nif any, it has acquired on each of them. Hence, if they submit to an FBI\ninterview, they will go in \"blind.\" By going in blind, the aides run the risk\nof getting caught in a \"perjury trap.\" Though not under oath, they could be\ntrapped into lying by astute prosecutors and aggressive FBI agents, as it is a\ncrime -- the equivalent of perjury -- to lie to them or materially mislead\nthem.For this reason, most white-collar criminal defense lawyers will not\npermit their clients to be interviewed by any prosecutors or FBI agents.\nMartha Stewart's lawyers failed to give her that advice, and she went to\nprison for one lie told in one conversation with one FBI agent.After\ninterviewing any Clinton aides who choose to be interviewed, the DOJ personnel\non the case will move their investigation into its final phase, in which they\nwill ask Clinton herself whether she wishes to speak with them. The\nprosecutors will basically tell her lawyers that they have evidence of the\ncriminal behavior of their client and that before they present it to a grand\njury, they want to afford Clinton an opportunity blindly to challenge it.This\nwill be a moment she must devoutly wish would pass from her, as she will face\na damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't dilemma.Here is her dilemma.If she\nwere to talk to federal prosecutors and FBI agents, they would catch her in\nmany inconsistencies, as she has spoken with great deception in public about\nthis case. She has, for example, stated many times that she used the private\nserver so she could have one mobile device for all of her emails. The FBI\nknows she had four mobile devices.

For example: If the Iranians want to sell oil to\nIndia and be paid in euros instead of rupees, so they could more easily\npurchase European goods, the process commonly starts with the rupees being\nconverted into dollars.  \nAmerican sanctions block Iran from exchanging the money on its own. And Asian\nand European banks have steered clear of such transactions, fearful of U.S.\nregulators who have levied billions of dollars in fines in recent years and\nthreatened transgressors with a cutoff from the far more lucrative American\nmarket. Using dollars to make even a rupees-to-euros conversion, following\nthat example, would still involve the money entering the U.S. financial\nsystem, if only momentarily.  \nDropping the prohibition would go a long way to meet Iran's complaints that\nthe West hasn't sufficiently rewarded it for taking thousands of uranium-\nspinning centrifuges offline, exporting its stockpile of the bomb-making\nmaterial and disabling a facility that would have been able to produce\nweapons-grade plutonium. But it surely would prompt intense opposition from\ncritics of last July's nuclear accord.  \nIf approved, the new guidance would allow dollars to be used in currency\nexchanges as long as no Iranian banks are involved, according to the\nofficials, who weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and demanded\nanonymity. No Iranian rials can enter into the transaction, and the payment\nwouldn't be able to start or end with American dollars. The ban would still\napply if the final payment is intended for an Iranian individual or business\non a U.S. sanctions blacklist.  \nThe administration has hinted the U.S. could introduce new sanctions\nconcessions, but has confirmed nothing.  \nIn a speech Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew lauded Iran for accepting\nthe nuclear deal to achieve its goal of ending Western sanctions. \"Since Iran\nhas kept its end of the deal, it is our responsibility to uphold ours, in both\nletter and spirit,\" he told the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.  \nLew warned that \"sanctions overreach\" risked driving business away from the\nUnited States, hurting the U.S. and global economy and empowering economic\nrivals.  \n\"Our central role must not be taken for granted,\" he said. \"If foreign\njurisdictions and companies feel that we will deploy sanctions without\nsufficient justification or for inappropriate reasons -- secondary sanctions,\nin particular -- we should not be surprised if they look for ways to avoid\ndoing business in the United States or in U.S. dollars.\"  \nMembers of Congress are crying foul. The 2012 National Defense Authorization\nAct instructs the president to \"block and prohibit\" all Iranian assets if they\n\"come within the United States, or are or come within the possession or\ncontrol of a United States person.\"  \nIn a letter to Lew on Wednesday, Republican Sens. Marco Rubio and Mark Kirk\nsaid any Iranian access to dollars \"would benefit Iran's financiers of\ninternational terrorism, human rights abuses and ballistic missile threats.\"\nThey cited testimony last year by Treasury Department's sanctions chief, Adam\nSzubin, who told lawmakers Iran wouldn't be allowed \"even to execute a\ndollarized transaction where a split second's worth of business is done in a\nNew York clearing bank.\"  \nU.S. officials said the change wouldn't break that pledge because Iran still\nwouldn't have access to the American financial system. If an Indian bank\nexchanges the money with a Hong Kong clearinghouse and the money is eventually\nconverted to non-U.S. currency, no Iranian institution ends up touching any\ndollars. And no Iranian rials would be entering the United States.  \nBoth concerns are rooted in the Obama administration's designation of Iran in\n2011 as a jurisdiction of \"primary money laundering concern.\" Critics of\nObama's outreach to Iran say softening the rules would provide Iran a toehold\ntoward re-entering the global financial system, helping it raise more cash for\nU.N.-banned ballistic missile development or support of U.S.-designated\nterrorist groups.  \nMark Dubowitz, an Iran sanctions expert at the Foundation for the Defense of\nDemocracies and critic of the nuclear deal, said the administration's currency\nargument was \"a bait and switch which ignores a long-standing administration\ncommitment not to greenlight Iran's access to the greenback.\"  \n\"This is above and beyond what is required by the nuclear deal,\" he argued.  \n __\n\n","title":"US may allow dollars to be used in Iran business deals | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"US may allow dollars to be used in Iran business deals https://t.co/Pa4zEdcs61","date":"Thu Mar 31 09:26:59 +0000 2016","favs":52,"id":{"$numberLong":"715470435652009984"},"retweets":61},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1RPqIcs"}

Allegations against\nFrench forces in the same area are also being investigated, he said.The U.N.\nrecently reported that 25 allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation were\nregistered with the U.N. mission in Central African Republic in January and\nFebruary, most from previous years. This compares with a total of six\nallegations in the 15 other U.N. peacekeeping missions in the first two months\nof this year, the U.N. peacekeeping department said.A U.N. report earlier this\nmonth said there were 69 allegations of sexual abuse and exploitation by\npeacekeepers in 2015 -- 22 of them in CAR.Central African Republic has been\nrocked by sectarian violence since 2013.AIDS-Free World called the information\nit received \"shocking.\" Two weeks ago, it said, the U.N. children's agency\nUNICEF interviewed 98 girls who reported being sexually abused.The group said\nthat Saturday a delegation from the U.N. peacekeeping mission known as MINUSCA\nmet local leaders and victims who alleged that troops from France and Gabon\nhad sexually abused girls. Some victims left the area because they were\nstigmatized by the community, it said.During the delegation's visit, AIDS-Free\nWorld said the three girls reported being tied up inside a camp by the French\nmilitary commander. After having sex with the dog, the group said, each girl\nwas given 5,000 Central African Francs, or about $9.One girl told the U.N.\nhuman rights officer that the fourth girl who later died \"was called `the\nSangaris' dog' by people in the community.\"AIDS-Free World also said the\nmother of a 16-year-old girl informed local police in another part of CAR that\na Congolese U.N. peacekeeper raped her daughter in a hotel room Monday\nafternoon.The group said that when the soldier was questioned by police in the\npresence of his commander he confirmed that he \"had sexual intercourse\" with\nthe victim several times and paid her between 2,000 and 5,000 Central African\nFrancs._Fox News' Jonathan Wachtel and The Associated Press contributed to\nthis report.___\n\n","title":"US group says 98 girls sexually abused by UN peacekeepers in Central African Republic | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Dozens of African girls report sexual abuse by UN peacekeepers, US group says https://t.co/ppxHTTlwbn","date":"Thu Mar 31 07:26:13 +0000 2016","favs":72,"id":{"$numberLong":"715440044111060992"},"retweets":144},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1MDatNj"}

(REUTERS/Aubrey Gemignani/NASA/Handout via Reuters)\nSince 2012, the folks over at NASA have been working on developing a high\nperformance \"green\" rocket propellant it hoped to one day use as an\nalternative to the incredibly toxic hydrazine fuel currently in use. According\nto a press release published in August of 2012, the Washington D.C.-based\nspace agency selected Boulder, Colorado's Ball Aerospace \u0026amp; Technologies\nCorporation to research the fuel alternative and as of this month, it appears\nit's ready to show off its work. In an invite sent to media outlets late last\nweek, Ball Aerospace will officially open its doors on March 31 to unveil\nNASA's Green Propulsion Infusion Mission (GPIM).Essentially a new spacecraft\nwhich is reportedly \"safer on the ground and more efficient in space,\" the\nGPIM is ready for public viewing after passing a series of functional and\nenvironmental tests of both its system and software. Currently, the craft is\nset for launch in early 2017 where it will have the ability to display its\nhydroxyl ammonium nitrate-based fuel and oxidizer propellant blend -- known as\nAF-M315E. Developed by the U.S. Air Force Research Lab at Edwards Air Force\nBase, the hope is that the fuel will prove to boast a higher performance and\nwill be kinder on the environment than traditional hydrazine fuel. \"High\nperformance green propellant has the potential to revolutionize how we travel\nto, from, and in space,\" said the director of NASA's Space Technology Program,\nMichael Gazarik in 2012. \"An effective green rocket fuel would dramatically\nreduce the cost and time for preparing and launching space missions while\ndecreasing pollution and harm to our environment.\"In addition to its cleaner\nprofile, the innovative green propellant features a higher density than\nhydrazine, meaning it has the ability to be stored much more efficiently. More\nof it can be stored in propellant tanks of the same volume which results in a\n50-percent uptick in spacecraft maneuvering capability. Furthermore, the\npropellant's freezing point is much lower than hydrazine, and thus requires\nless power from the spacecraft itself to maintain a suitable temperature.\n\"NASA and its partners always strive to maintain the strictest safety\nstandards for storage, transport and use of rocket propellants,\" reads a\nrecent GPIM overview published by the agency. \"While all rocket fuels can be\ndangerous to handle without the proper safety precautions, AF-M315E has\nsignificantly reduced toxicity levels compared to hydrazine, making it easier\nand safer to store and handle. It also requires fewer handling restrictions\nand potentially shorter launch processing times, resulting in lower\ncosts.\"**Related:** NASA wants to install extra airlock space on the ISS, then\nlease it to private companiesAside from cutting costs, use of the green\npropellant would also make launches safer and faster, potentially altering\nground processing time for launches from weeks to a matter of days.

Robert Bentley\nlistens to a phone call as Rebekah Mason, right, announces his win for Alabama\ngovernor, in Montgomery, Ala. (AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)MONTGOMERY, Ala. –  A\ntop political aide to Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley resigned Wednesday, a week\nafter he publicly admitted making inappropriate remarks to her but denied the\ntwo ever had an affair.Soon after, a GOP lawmaker said he planned to introduce\na resolution to begin impeachment proceedings against the Republican\ngovernor.Rebekah Caldwell Mason announced her resignation in a statement sent\nby the governor's office, saying she would no longer be his senior political\nadviser and would no longer be paid by his campaign fund.\"My only plans are to\nfocus my full attention on my precious children and my husband who I love\ndearly,\" she said.As Bentley's confidante, sounding board, adviser and message\nmolder, Mason has been there for the biggest moments of his political career,\nfrom his improbable 2010 election to the development of his major policy\ninitiatives. More recently, she has been at the center of the lowest moment of\nhis political career.Last week, Mason was thrust into the spotlight when\nformer Law Enforcement Secretary Spencer Collier accused the 73-year-old\ngovernor of having an inappropriate relationship with her. Collier made the\nallegations a day after he was fired. The scandal has engulfed Bentley, a\nmild-mannered dermatologist and former Baptist deacon whose political\nascendency was based partly on his morally upright, honest reputation.Dianne\nBentley, the governor's ex-wife, filed for divorce in 2015 saying their\n50-year marriage had suffered an irreparable breakdown.Recordings obtained by\nThe Associated Press purportedly show the governor — before his divorce —\nprofessing love to someone named Rebecca or Rebekah and telling her how much\nhe enjoyed kissing and touching her.The recordings were provided by a former\nadministration member who did so on condition of anonymity to avoid angering\npolitically powerful former associates.In a furtive phone call, Bentley says\nhis family is vacationing at the beach and tells the person on the other end:\n\"I love you so much, I worry about loving you so much.\"While the governor is\nclearly heard, the person on the other end is not.Later, he talks about\ngetting physical. Bentley says he meant to text the person, but accidentally\nsent the message to a male aide.\"It didn't say, 'Hey baby I love you so much\nand I'd like to spent the rest of my life with you. ... You kiss me. ... I\nlove that. You know I do love that. You know what, when I stand behind you and\nI put my arms around you and I put my hands on your breasts and I put my hands\non you and just pull you in really close. I love that, too.\"The fallout from\nthe scandal does not appear to be over. Rep. Ed Henry said Wednesday that he\nplans to introduce the impeachment resolution when the Alabama Legislature\nreturns from spring break next week because the governor has lost the\nconfidence of lawmakers and voters. Henry and Bentley are both Republicans who\nhave frequently clashed over the past two years, including over the governor's\nproposal last year to raise taxes.However, Henry acknowledged the resolution\nfaces an uphill climb. A majority of House members would have to vote to begin\nproceedings.Mason, a former television news anchor in Bentley's hometown of\nTuscaloosa, signed on as spokeswoman for the little-known legislator's 2010\nlongshot bid for governor. She worked as the governor's communications adviser\nbefore leaving to work on his 2014 re-election.Observers said Mason helped the\ngovernor talk through options as he weighed decisions ranging from taking down\nConfederate flags to his proposed $800 million prison construction project\nbefore lawmakers.Her detractors within the administration said her opinion\nincreasingly became the only one Bentley would trust.\"At the end of 2014,\nGovernor Bentley made it clear to me in no uncertain terms that from that\npoint forward anyone who questioned Rebekah's influence would be fired,\"\nCollier said.As his senior political adviser, she was not paid by the state.\nInstead, she was paid with campaign funds — something the governor's office\nsaid Bentley had done with previous political advisers in his\nadministration.Campaign records show Bentley's campaign paid Mason's company,\nRCM Communications, $76,500 in 2015 for consulting and travel reimbursement.\nMason disclosed last week that the Alabama Council for Government Excellence,\na nonprofit formed to promote Bentley's agenda, also paid her company $15,000\nfor consulting work.Mason's husband also works for Bentley as the director of\nServe Alabama, the Governor's Office of Faith-Based and Volunteer Service.In a\nstatement issued last week, she said Bentley \"apologized to me and to my\nfamily, we accepted his apology and have put all of this behind us.\"__\n\n","title":"Top aide to Alabama Gov.

A judge\non Tuesday agreed to postpone the trial of 18-year-old Hunter Drexler so\nprosecutors could ask the FBI for help. Drexler's trial was moved from next\nweek to June 27.Drexler and 15-year-old Justin Staton are accused of killing\nRobert and Patricia Cogdell at their home in Conway, 30 miles north of Little\nRock, in July. The Cogdells had raised Staton as their grandson.The FBI\nannounced Monday that it had gained access to an iPhone belonging to Syed\nFarook, who died with his wife in a gun battle with police after they killed\n14 people in San Bernardino in December. The FBI hasn't revealed how it\ncracked Farook's iPhone. Authorities also haven't said whether the iPhone and\niPod in the Arkansas case are the same models or whether the FBI will use the\nsame method to try to get into the devices.Hiland said he could not discuss\ndetails of the murder case in Arkansas, but confirmed the FBI had agreed less\nthan a day after the initial request.\"We always appreciate their cooperation\nand willingness to help their local law enforcement partners,\" he said.Drexler\nand Staton have both pleaded not guilty to capital murder, aggravated robbery\nand other charges in the deaths of the Codgells, who were both 66.A phone call\nand text message to Drexler's attorney Patrick Benca seeking comment late\nWednesday was not immediately returned.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc958e4"},"content":"  President Obama’s push to improve relations with Cuba has coincided with an\ninflux of Cuban immigrants into the U.S., statistics show, amid revived talk\non Capitol Hill about ending a decades-old law allowing them easy entry to the\ncountry.  “We are seeing an influx of Cubans at the Texas-Mexico border who\nare immediately admitted to this country and have an extremely fast pathway to\ncitizenship,” Texas GOP Rep. Blake Farenthold said in a statement. Lawmakers\nsuspect the immigrants are flocking to the border out of fear the current\nimmigration policy will be changed, though they can't know for sure. But the\nnumbers are clear. U.S. Customs and Border Protection documents obtained by\nFoxNews.com indeed show a spike in Cuban immigrants at U.S. points of entry\nsince Obama announced his diplomatic plan in December 2014.The number of Cuban\nimmigrants has increased every quarter except for one since the announcement\n-- from 5,770 in the three months prior, to as many as 14,114 in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal 2015, roughly 26 months later. A total of 44,159 arrived at\nthe more than 325 U.S. entry points in fiscal 2015, compared with nearly\n26,280 in fiscal 2014.And the number in just the first five months of fiscal\n2016 is 27,644, which at that pace would bring the total for the year to over\n66,000.  Farenthold, who is working with other Republicans to lift the\ndecades-old law giving Cuban immigrants more favorable treatment, said the\ncurrent policy is outdated and needs to change. “With President Obama\nrestoring diplomatic relations with Cuba, the immigration preferential\ntreatment given to Cubans … no longer makes sense,” he said. Under the the\nCuban Adjustment Act of 1966, Cuban nationals can be allowed -- or “paroled”\n-- into the United States. After one year in the country, they can apply for a\ngreen card, or permanent legal residence.However, they must express fear of\nreturning to Cuba and can enter only if arriving by land and have no criminal\nrecord.The federal government stopped applying that treatment to Cubans\narriving by sea after massive flotilla migrations in the 1980 in which many\nwho reached U.S. shores had a history of crime or mental illness.There is also\nno cap on the number of Cuban nationals allowed into the country.Farenthold\nand fellow Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat, last week proposed\nlegislation that would end such preferential treatment under the law.  \n“It is the sense of Congress that Cuban nationals should be treated under the\nsame immigration rules as nationals of other countries,” their Correcting\nUnfair Benefits for Aliens, or CUBA, Act, in part reads.Texas has 29 ports of\nentry, the most in the United States, which has contributed to the state\nhaving the biggest surge -- especially Cuellar’s home district in Laredo,\nabout 100 miles north of the U.S.-Mexico border.   Customs and Border\nProtection’s Laredo field office -- with jurisdiction over six ports of entry\nincluding the Del Rio/ International Bridge -- handled a total of roughly\n44,000 cases of Cuban nationals in fiscal 2014 and 2015, about three times as\nmany as Miami, in second place.Cuellar calls the 50-year-old immigration law a\n“relic of a bygone era.”And he urged Americans after Obama’s historic visit to\nCuba earlier this month to remember that thousands of people from Central\nAmerica and elsewhere also are fleeing from despair, including drug violence,\nbut face a disadvantage when compared with Cubans.Cuellar and Farenthold’s\nefforts appear to have the support of Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn, who has also\ncalled for a policy change.Still, the administration has no plans to change\nthe immigration policy “or seek legislative change,” according to Customs and\nBorder Protection.“We continue to promote safe, legal and orderly migration\nfrom Cuba,” the agency said in a statement.Cubans began fleeing their country\nin the 1960s to escape the Castros' oppressive, communist regime. The recent\nexodus is largely driven by poverty and lack of economic opportunity.Lawmakers\nand other officials have tried before to repeal the 1966 law, in no small part\nbecause it also offers Cuban immigrants some federal welfare benefits.The\nadvantages for Cubans, compared to other Latin Americans, came to light again\nin 2014 when thousands of families from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras\narrived at the southern U.S. border to escape drug-trade violence and other\nproblems.“We’ve been calling for a repeal of the law for years,” Ira Mehlman,\na spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said this\nweek.“It has never achieved its objective. All it has done is drain the\ndissidents from Cuba where they might have effected change. ... It’s time for\nCuba to have the same immigration policy as the rest of the world.”__\n\n","title":"Officials see 'influx' of Cuban immigrants as lawmakers eye immigration change | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Officials see 'influx' of Cuban immigrants as lawmakers eye immigration change  https://t.co/lktKz3H4Y4 https://t.co/YKgGZF9AeR","date":"Thu Mar 31 04:25:05 +0000 2016","favs":86,"id":{"$numberLong":"715394462592020480"},"retweets":98},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1UDlEIO"}

The county says the state\nshould have obtained permits, licenses and inspections for 523 narrow wells\ndrilled from January 1990 to May 2014, according to a notice of violation\nobtained by CalWatchdog.The wells, four to six inches in diameter, are used to\nmonitor geological conditions and water levels for safe building purposes.\nState water laws are aimed at making sure the holes, which can extend hundreds\nof feet into the ground, don’t allow for untreated stormwater or hazardous\nchemicals to pollute groundwater, which the holes often intersect\nwith.Officials in Sacramento County say the state ignored its own\nenvironmental laws in drilling hundreds of monitoring wells.

The agency has had relatively recent run-ins in\nMarin, Mendocino, San Joaquin and Humboldt counties. Some of those counties\nand others have filed records requests on well drilling in their\njurisdictions.The state estimates it drilled 10,000 borings across the state\nsince 1990, though some would not have been subject to the state Water Code at\nissue.CalWatchdog asked Dinger why the state agency failed to fully adhere to\nstate and local laws during that time.“Caltrans adopted policies in 2014 to\nensure that its operations are in full compliance with the California State\nWater Code and the local enforcement agencies’ standards, and is working with\nlocal enforcement agencies to resolve issues from previous practices,” Dinger\nsaid.As a result of not alerting Sacramento County and not keeping adequate\nrecords, Caltrans lost track of most of the wells, although some may be\ncovered by structures.

There is no\nhow-to guide for survival that a Christian can follow.\"Wycliffe Associates has\nbeen in existence for over 70 years, helping Christians throughout the world\nby working towards translating Bibles into nearly 2,000 different languages.\nThey often set up offices in the areas where a new translation is needed,\nworking on the ground level in places like Asia, Africa and South America as\nwell as the Middle East using a method of translation called “Paradigm 3.0,”\nwhich focuses on local translators and local control.Smith said the work\nsimply cannot be done in the relative safety of the U.S.“The simple answer is\nthat the Church prefers to do translation where the people are,” Smith said.\n“Paradigm 3.0 Bible translation is all about church engagement from beginning\nto end. Dislocated translations delay and dilute the impact to the local\ncommunities.”Officials for Wycliffe Associates say that those who survived the\nattack have committed to finishing the projects in an effort to recover the\nwork lost. They are in the process of setting up a new secret location and\nhave even asked for the public’s help in raising emergency funds.“Even when\ntragedy strikes, as in this case, the testimony of Christ is loud and clear,”\nSmith also said in his statement to FoxNews.com. “Yes, there is a tremendous\ncost.

(OIG) The federal government dropped\n$86 million on an advanced Drug Enforcement Administration plane that was\nmeant for counter-narcotics missions in Afghanistan – yet remains “inoperable”\nand “resting on jacks” to this day, according to a scathing watchdog report\nreleased Wednesday.The review by the Justice Department's inspector general\nsaid the plane was purchased seven years ago to support anti-drug efforts in\nthe Afghanistan war zone, where opium poppy cultivation has long been rampant.\nThe so-called Global Discovery program to modify the ATR 42-500 aircraft with\nadvanced surveillance capabilities was supposed to be completed in December\n2012.But the program has been plagued by missteps, has missed a string of\ndeadlines, has ballooned in cost from an original estimate of $22 million, and\nremains incomplete and grounded in Delaware. The report said it was unlikely\nthe plane will ever fly in Afghanistan because the DEA has since ceased\naviation operations there.\"Our findings raise serious questions as to whether\nthe DEA was able to meet the operational needs for which its presence was\nrequested in Afghanistan,\" the review said.The project was part of an\nagreement with the Defense Department.The DEA said in a statement that it\nagreed it \"can and should provide better oversight of its operational funding\"\nand was reviewing its policies and procedures.The drug agency spent $8.5\nmillion on parts for the plane — including $5 million in spare engines — \"the\nmajority of which cannot be used utilized on any other aircraft in its fleet,\"\nand the Defense Department built a $2 million hangar in Afghanistan for the\nplane that was never used and likely never will be, the report said.The audit\nalso found that the DEA didn't fully comply with federal procedures when it\npurchased the aircraft, spending nearly $3 million more than it had previously\nestimated for the $8.6 million aircraft.The DEA also charged about $2.5\nmillion in improper expenditures billed under the agreement with the Defense\nDepartment, including for costs associated with aircrafts and personnel who\nwere entirely unrelated to the agency's Afghanistan operations. That included\n$8,122 in unallowable travel related to missions in Haiti, the Bahamas, Peru\nand Florida.The review found the DEA's Aviation Division lacked adequate\npolicies and procedures for receiving, reviewing and paying contractors with\nno requirement that any documentation be approved before personnel were paid.\nWhen modifications were improperly done on the plane, the Defense Department\npoured more money into the effort.The plane, which has missed every scheduled\ndelivery date, is now estimated to be completed in June — nearly one year\nafter the DEA pulled out of Afghanistan. The report said the DEA intends to\nfly the plane in the Caribbean, Central America and South America.The report\nmade 13 recommendations to improve oversight of its aviation operations\nagreements and the problematic program.The drug agency has already acted on\ntwo recommendations, according to the inspector general's office. That\nincludes ensuring foreign offices are now required to provide supporting\ndocumentation to be paid for work. The agency said it's also now established\nan electronic method for pilots to submit mission reports to make sure program\ndata is accurate.In its formal reply to the audit, the DEA said that based on\nprevious positive experiences using Defense Department contractors to modify\nits aircraft it \"had no indication that the Global Discovery modification\nwould encounter the significant delays and problems that ultimately\noccurred.\"_The Associated Press contributed to this report. ___\n\n","title":"Watchdog: DEA's $86M Afghanistan counter-drug plane still 'resting on jacks' | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Watchdog: DEA's $86M Afghanistan counter-drug plane still 'resting on jacks'  https://t.co/I9oksBOuA3 https://t.co/VPsT8wPXAT","date":"Thu Mar 31 03:06:06 +0000 2016","favs":114,"id":{"$numberLong":"715374583449137152"},"retweets":72},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1UD9fod"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc958ea"},"content":"Liang Bua, a limestone cave on the Indonesian island of Flores. The Liang Bua\nTeam prepares for new archaeological excavations. (Smithsonian Digitization\nProgram Office / Liang Bua Team) It turns out a tiny hominin nicknamed the\n“Hobbit” may have disappeared from the Indonesian island of Flores much\nearlier than scientists originally thought.When it was first discovered in\n2003 in the Liang Bua cave, an international team concluded that _H.\nfloresiensis_ was 18,000 years old and bone fragments were deposited there\nfrom 12,000 and 95,000 years ago. But after digging up new stratigraphic and\nchronological evidence from other parts of the massive, stalactites, filled\ncave, scientists concluded in a Nature study published Wednesday that new\ndates for the tiny creature – that stood only 3.6 feet and had a chimp-sized\nbrain - range from 190,000 to 50,000 years ago.The remains of _H.\nfloresiensis_ _  including 20-foot skeleton and bone fragments of as many as\n10 individuals – have been dated from between about 100,000 and 60,000 years\nold. Stone artifacts found in the cave and believed to have been used by the\nhobbit range from 190,000 years to 50,000 years.Related: When the 'Hobbits'\nConquered IndonesiaThe new dates are significant because it reduces the\npossibility – although it doesn’t eliminate it – that _H. floresiensis_ came\nin contact with modern humans who were most likely traveling from Asia to\nAustralia. Modern humans are believed to have reached Australia 50,000 years\nago and the earlier dates – also from stone tools in the cave - raised the\nprospect that humans clashed with _H. floresiensis_ and competed for\nresources.“We dated charcoal, sediments, flowstones, volcanic ash and even the\nH. floresiensis bones themselves using the most up-to-date scientific methods\navailable. In the last decade, we’ve vastly improved our understanding of when\nthe deposits accumulated in Liang Bua, and what this means for the age of\n‘hobbit’ bones and stone tools,” Richard ‘Bert’ Roberts, an Australian\nResearch Council Laureate Fellow at the University of Wollongong who oversaw\nthe various dating analyses used in the study, said in a statement.“But\nwhether ‘hobbits’ encountered modern humans or other groups of humans—such as\nthe ‘Denisovans’—dispersing through Southeast Asia remains an open and\nintriguing question,” he added.Matthew Tocheri, the Canada research chair in\nhuman origins at Lakehead University and a co-author on the study, said a\npriority is finding evidence that modern humans and H. floresiensis overlapped\non Flores. So far, the earliest evidence of modern humans on Flores goes back\nto 11,000 years.Related: Humans, Neanderthals interbred thousands of years\nearlier than first thought, research shows“With the new dating results pushing\nback that last appearance time of H. floresiensis to 50,000 years ago, it\ncertainly removes the potential amount of time overlap on the island itself,”\nTocheri, who is also a research associate at the Smithsonian’s National Museum\nof Natural History, told FoxNews.comAn artist's drawing sits on display at the\nAustralian Museum in Sydney October 28, 2004 of a newly discovered species of\nhobbit-sized humans that adds another piece to the complex puzzle of human\nevolution. (REUTERS/HO/Peter Schouten-National Geographic Society) “But we\nstill don’t have evidence of modern humans on Flores until about 11,000 years\nago. It’s clearly a major research question that we are now focused on,” he\ncontinued. “There should be remains of modern humans somewhere on Flores that\nare earlier than that. Modern humans just didn’t jump over the islands of\nSoutheast Asia to get to Australia by 50,000 years ago. They must have come\nthrough islands of Indonesia and it’s highly unlikely they skipped Flores.”But\neven if modern humans did overlap H. floresiensis, Tocheri said it doesn’t\nmean they killed off their tiny ancestor. Noting that many other species on\nthe island including Komodo dragons, vultures and pygmy stegodon also\ndisappeared around 50,000 years, Tocheri said a number of factors including\nincreased volcanism and changing climate could also have played a\nrole.Related: Ancient DNA reveals bones in Spanish cave were\nNeanderthals“During the late Pleistocene, there are lots of ice ages going on\nand off and the climate changing around every few tens of thousands of years,”\nhe said. “There are lots of large animals around the world that go extinct at\nthis time. You look at the Komodo dragon, giant marabou stork, the vulture,\npygmy stegodon and the hobbit. They would have been a lot more sensitive to\nthese late Pleistocene climatic shifts.”Chris Stringer, research leader in\nhuman origins at the Natural History Museum in London, said the new dates for\nare H. floresiensis are “much more in line” with the “inferred last\nappearances of the Neanderthals and perhaps also the Denisovans.”“This in turn\nmay reinforce the idea that the successful spread of modern humans from Africa\nafter about 60,000 years ago played at least a role, if not the most\nsignificant role, in the physical extinction of other forms of humans outside\nof Africa,” he said in an email interview. “However, at least some of those\nother forms of human did not go completely extinct, since their DNA lives on\nin us today through ancient interbreeding between the archaic and early modern\npopulations. This leaves open the fascinating possibility that even\nfloresiensis might have contributed some of its DNA to living groups in the\nregion, if there was at least a short overlap between floresiensis and sapiens\nabout 50,000 years ago.”Thomas Sutikna, a co-author on the study also from the\nUniversity of Wollongong and National Research Centre for Archaeology in\nIndonesia, said in a statement that dating mix up occurred because “we didn’t\nrealize during our original excavations that the ‘hobbit’ deposits near the\neastern wall of the cave were similar in age to those near the cave center,\nwhich we had dated to about 74,000 years ago.”Related: Neanderthal DNA may\ninfluence modern depression riskArchaeological excavations of Holocene\ndeposits at Liang Bua in progress. These sediments contain skeletal and\nbehavioural evidence of modern humans (Homo sapiens). (Liang Bua Team) As the\nteam expanded their excavation of the cave, Sutikna said it “became\nincreasingly clear that there was a large remnant pedestal of older deposits\ntruncated by an erosional surface that sloped steeply toward the cave mouth” -\nthat was covered by younger sediments over the past 20,000\nyears.“Unfortunately, the ages of these overlying sediments were originally\nthought to apply to the ‘hobbit’ remains, but our continuing excavations and\nanalyses revealed that this was not the case,” said co-author Wahyu Saptomo,\nhead of conservation and archaeometry at the National Research Centre for\nArchaeology.But the researchers were adamant that the new dates did little to\nchange their belief – and that of most scientists – that H. floresiensis was\nstill a distant relative, not a deformed modern human as critics have long\ncontended. Those critics argue that the small size of H. floresiensis would\nindicate it suffered from a genetic disorder that caused the body and brain to\nshrink.“For the few stragglers that are still hanging onto (to the idea) that\nthis is a pathological modern human, it certainly weakens their argument yet\nagain,” Tocheri said, comparing those minority voices who believe it’s a\nmodern human to scientists who “say that human-mediated climate change isn’t\nhappening right now\" or \"that smoking doesn’t cause cancer.”“The field has\nreally shifted to debates over these more interesting questions of what is H.\nfloresiensis descended from? What is its exact relationship to us?” he\nadded.Stringer agreed.The dates “would seem to fatally undermine remaining\nclaims that the ‘Hobbit’ fossils belong to diseased modern humans, since the\nmaterial now dates beyond any modern human specimens known from the region,”\nhe said.“That said, my guess is that the sceptics will still not back down, as\nthey have shown no signs of doing so in the face of a wealth of other data\nthat conflict with their ideas.”__\n\n","title":"'Hobbit' found in Indonesia may have gone extinct earlier than thought | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"'Hobbit' found in Indonesia may have gone extinct earlier than thought #FNSciTech | https://t.co/2my3iN8CVp","date":"Wed Mar 30 23:00:36 +0000 2016","favs":61,"id":{"$numberLong":"715312803809087488"},"retweets":55},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1UD0JWl"}

(Reuters)In most circles,\nPatty Duke may be best known for her longtime career in Hollywood, including\nher Academy Award-winning performance at age 16, as Helen Keller in “The\nMiracle Worker,” and later on “The Patty Duke Show.” But to growing population\nof activists, she was also revered for her outspoken voice about her mental\nhealth struggles.Duke, who died of sepsis from a ruptured intestine Tuesday\nmorning at age 69, suffered from bipolar disorder, and she spoke openly about\nhow it impacted her life daily. She was diagnosed with the disorder in the\n1980s, when it was called manic depression.Her son Sean Astin described his\nmother as a \"warrior\" who fought for awareness of the disorder during a time\nwhen mental health issues carried an even larger stigma than they do\ntoday.“She would do fundraisers and she would lobby Congress and write another\nbook specifically on bipolar disorder ... She was indefatigable,\" he told\nEntertainment Tonight. \"Wherever I go on this planet, for my whole life,\npeople would come up to me and they'd say to me, ‘How’s your mom?’”In 1992,\nDuke spoke with former “Today” show co-anchor Katie Couric about bipolar\ndisorder, crediting a 13-day marriage and other lapses in judgment to her\nmental health struggles.\"I choose to take responsibility for those things that\nI did, and I tried to not— you can't fix them,\" Duke told Couric in an\ninterview. \"You can't buy back that time, but to certainly explain to the\npeople who were so seriously injured emotionally and spiritually that there\nwas something else going on. The best way is, once you start taking your\nmedicine, if that works for you, is to change that behavior. And it's taken,\noh, it's 10 years. It's thrilling for me to say 10 years of a healthy\nlife.\"Bipolar disorder is marked by dramatic fluctuations in mood, energy,\nactivity levels, and the ability to carry out daily tasks, according to the\nNational Institutes of Health (NIH). Different from the typical ups and downs\nevery individual has, the disorder can be treated with medication and\ncounseling. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),\nbipolar disorder is more common in women than men, accounting for an estimated\nlifetime prevalence of 4 percent.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc958ee"},"content":"  Marco Rubio is moving to lock down his delegates until the Republican\nconvention so no one else can claim them just yet, in an unconventional move\nthat represents the latest bid to stall Donald Trump’s front-running campaign\n– and perhaps give the Florida senator and ex-candidate a bigger role to play\nin July.A Rubio spokesman confirmed the push Wednesday, while suggesting it’s\nmore an effort to thwart Trump by denying him the necessary delegates than to\nsomehow get Rubio back in the game in the event of a contested convention.\"Of\ncourse, he's no longer a candidate and wants to give voters a chance to stop\nTrump,\" spokesman Alex Burgos told FoxNews.com.Rubio is making his personal\nappeal in a letter to the chairs of state Republican parties across the\ncountry, the entities that decide how to divvy up delegates.While some of the\nsenator’s delegates might otherwise be allowed to support other candidates\nbefore the July convention, Rubio is asking that those delegates be “bound” to\nhim through at least the first round of voting at the convention.The letter, a\ncopy of which was obtained by FoxNews.com, says the decision to suspend his\ncampaign was “not intended to release any National Convention Delegates bound\nto me as a result of the 2016 delegate selection process that took place in\nyour State.The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in\npolitics. See Latest Coverage →“It is my desire at this time that the\ndelegates allocated to me by your rules remain bound to vote for me on at\nleast the first nominating ballot at the National Convention.”According to\nMSNBC, Rubio is sending the letter to parties in all 21 states and territories\nwhere he won delegates.As of Wednesday afternoon, Rubio had 171 delegates to\nhis name. In a normal year, such a delegate haul might not matter much – but\nin the competitive 2016 GOP primary race, keeping all those delegates off the\nfield could potentially keep Trump from clinching the nomination pre-\nconvention with the necessary 1,237.Trump currently has 736; Texas Sen. Ted\nCruz has 463; and Ohio Gov. John Kasich has 143.Under the complex set of rules\ngoverning each state’s primary, dozens of Rubio’s delegates – though not all\nof them -- would normally become “unbound” before the convention and free to\nvote for whomever they choose.Ever since Rubio suspended his campaign, those\ndelegates have been an attractive target for the remaining candidates. Barry\nBennett, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, recently told FoxNews.com the\ncampaign already had started “going after” the “unbound” delegates.“We aren’t\ngoing to waste resources on them, but if you’re 'wooable' we plan to woo,”\nBennett said.  It’s unclear whether any sizeable number of Rubio’s delegates\nwould back Trump anyway, as Rubio himself describes Cruz as the only true\nconservative left in the race. But Rubio’s letter-writing push is an attempt\nto prevent Trump from peeling off any before the convention.MSNBC reported\nthat the chairman of the Alaska GOP already has agreed to grant Rubio’s\nrequest.Alaska previously had divvied up Rubio's five delegates to Trump and\nCruz. However, since the actual people have not been selected yet, the state\nparty said the delegates will go back to Rubio.In Oklahoma, state party\nChairwoman Pam Pollard said she also received a letter from Rubio saying he\nhas not released his 12 delegates from that state.Meanwhile, the three\nremaining Republican candidates are ramping up efforts to win over Rubio's\ndelegates, in addition to claiming dozens more unbound delegates, in the\ncontentious battle for the 1,237 delegate majority.Acknowledging a late start\nin the nuts-and-bolts business of political wrangling, Trump's campaign will\nopen a Washington, D.C. office in the coming days to run its delegate\noperation and congressional relations team, Bennett told the AP.

The scans, carried out by Japanese radar technologist\nHirokatsu Watanabe, \"suggest the presence of two empty spaces or cavities\nbeyond the decorated North and West walls of the burial chamber,\" they said in\na statement. The scans also suggest the \"presence of metallic and organic\nsubstances,\" and show what could be door lintels that indicate the presence of\ndoorways, they said.Egyptologist Nicholas Reeves, Director of the Amarna Royal\nTombs Project, said the cavities may contain the burial of Tutankhamun's\nstepmom, Queen Nefertiti. [See Photos of King Tut's Burial and Radar\nScans]However, Live Science contacted radar experts not affiliated with the\nproject, and they said they doubt the validity of these claims. Some of these\nexperts noted that the geology of the Valley of the Kings, which contains many\nnatural voids, makes it difficult for radar to distinguish archaeological\nfeatures from natural ones. \"It does not appear that these GPR [ground-\npenetrating radar] data have been processed, or that any of the so-called\nanomalies are visible in the raw data that are provided,\" said Lawrence\nConyers, a professor of anthropology at the University of Denver. Conyers\nliterally wrote the book (now in its third edition) on the use of ground-\npenetrating radar in archaeology.\"My suggestion to those who are collecting it\nis that they release the raw data for some peer review by other GPR people\nbefore they allow the antiquities people to hold a press conference about all\nthe 'riches' that might be in these supposed tombs,\" Conyers said. \"That [peer\nreview] would cut down on all the speculation and critiques that have been\ngoing around by email the last few days, as there might be many scientists who\ncould reach a consensus in advance of the speculation in the press.\"Michele\nPipan, a geosciences professor at the University of Trieste in Italy, said the\nradar images released by the antiquities ministry show \"many interesting\nfeatures\" but that the absence of vertical or horizontal scales on the images\nmakes it difficult to determine how many feet behind the wall they are\nlocated.  \"I may only say that cavities and metals may fall within the\nreasonable detection range of a survey like that, but I obviously know nothing\nabout the kind of inversion/interpretation procedure adopted by Watanabe,\"\nPipan said, noting that more information on radar velocity is also needed. The\ninversion/interpretation procedure refers to the techniques used to gather and\nanalyze the radar data.Live Science talked to other radar experts who agreed\nto comment only off the record. They also expressed doubts on the findings,\nand said there was a need for third-party review and the release of more\ndata.The Egyptian antiquities ministry said more radar surveys will be\nconducted in the next few days, and another news conference is scheduled to\ntake place on April 1 in Luxor.**Economic crunch**Egypt's tourism numbers have\nplummeted since the 2011 revolution that drove then-President Hosni Mubarak\nfrom power, according to other experts who spoke with Live Science. The\ncountry has been subject to terrorist attacks, including an attack by the\nIslamic State group that brought down a Russian plane in the Sinai\nDesert.Egyptologists have expressed hope that if Tutankhamun's tomb does,\nindeed, hold Nefertiti's tomb, it may help to bring back tourists and the\nbadly needed jobs and income.Reeves recently told The New York Times that now\nis a good time to visit Egypt. \"For anyone interested in Egyptian history,\nthis is the time to plan a trip, because you're not going to get jostled by\nothers the way you would have prerevolution. And, it's also a more affordable\ndestination because prices have dropped,\" Reeves said.Reeves did not\nimmediately return Live Science's requests for comment.__  \nCopyright 2016 LiveScience, a Purch company.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin) Imagine that you are an out-of-\nwork performer – looking for a job.You discover an advertisement for\n“Hamilton” – the hottest show on Broadway. The producers are searching for\ncast members for nationwide productions.**Click here to join Todd’s American\nDispatch: a must-read for conservatives!**You can sing. You can act. You can\ndance. You’re a triple threat.But there’s just one problem – you are also\nblack. And the casting notice stipulates the producers are only hiring “WHITE\nACTORS.” Now, let’s imagine the cries of injustice. Al Sharpton would lead\nmarches through Times Square. Civil Rights groups would stage boycotts.\n#ThespianLivesMatter would trend online.I could imagine President Obama\nstepping into the national firestorm. He would remind us of the teachings of\nDr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He would tell us – judge people on the content of\ntheir character, not the color of their skin.But in reality something\ndifferent happened this week. The producers of “Hamilton” – a rap musical that\noffers a fresh take on the Founding Fathers --  really did put out a casting\ncall. “Seeking NON-WHITE men and women, ages 20s to 30s, for Broadway and\nupcoming Tours!” their casting notice read. The NON-WHITE part was in all\ncaps.Oh, they also need singers who rap. Sorry, Vanilla Ice. I’m afraid you\nmight be a bit too – vanilla.CBS 2 News in New York City reports that\n“Hamilton’s” casting notice for ‘NON-WHITE” performers may violate the city’s\nhuman rights law.“You cannot advertise showing that you have a preference for\none racial group over another,” civil rights attorney Randolph McLaughlin told\nthe television station. “As an artistic question – sure, he can cast whomever\nhe wants to cast, but he has to give every actor eligible for the role an\nopportunity to try.”NYC’s Commission on Human Rights declined to say if they\nwere investigating, the television station reported.Actors Equity, the\nBroadway union, tells me the “Hamilton” casting notices were not in compliance\nwith their policies. They said that all casting notices are supposed to be\nopen to performers of all races and ethnicities.And while the show has earned\nnational praise for casting minority performers to portray our Founding\nFathers, it’s not the first time “Hamilton” has courted controversy. In early\nMarch, they posted a casting call for actors to portray Aaron Burr and George\nWashington, the New York Daily News reported.Here’s the actual casting\ncall:“George Washington: Males \u0026amp; Females, 30-49, African American,\nHispanic, Asian, South Asian, Native American, Middle Eastern, Southeast\nAsian/Pacific Islander, Ethnically Ambiguous/Mixed Race, African Descent. Non-\nWhite, tenor/baritone.”In other words, no white folks need apply.After a bit\nof online outrage, the producers changed their minds and decided to open the\nauditions to the pigmentationally-challenged.But don’t expect too much\ndiversity. As the Daily News pointed out none of the lead roles are currently\nplayed by a Caucasian.And by the way, what in the world does “ethnically\nambiguous” mean – Canadian?Ironically, opinion seems to be on the side of the\nproducers.“NON-WHITE in all caps and bold is my favorite part,” one Broadway\nfan wrote on Facebook. “It’s just so unapologetic and something we’re all not\nused to seeing. The great white way is finally getting revamped.”“Caucasian\nactors are way at the front of the line when it comes to casting so give other\nethnicities a chance to catch up,” another wrote.And then there’s this item:\n“For all the white people complaining about the NON-WHITE part of this ad,\njust go audition for the 98.9 percent of the other roles that are out there\nfor you.”There were some critics, though. One Broadway fan said they\nunderstand that “Hamilton” was trying to make a point by using ethnic actors\nto play our white Founding Fathers, but “do they really have to exclude ALL\nwhites to make that point?”“That would be considered racism if the tables were\nturned,” wrote one reader. “It should be called out for what it is –\nracism.”“Hamilton” producer Jeffrey Seller told CBS his casting call for NON-\nWHITE performers is on the up and up.“I stand by it and believe it to be\nlegal,” he told the television station.That may be true, Mr. Sellers.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc958f4"},"content":"Sheri Valle, 51, felt depressed when her hair wouldn't grow back following\nradiation. Now, with the CNC, she has more confidence than ever. (Photo\ncourtesy Transitions Hair Solutions) Custom CNC molds and hair are pictured at\nTransitions Hair Solutions in Wall Township, New Jersey. (Photo courtesy\nTransitions Hair Solutions) Danielle Grillo, owner of Transitions Hair\nSolutions, applies the CNC to client Kea Buote, who suffers from alopecia due\nto a rare disease. (Photo courtesy Transitions Hair Solutions)Sheri Valle was\ndiagnosed with small cell lung cancer in April 2011, but the idea of re-\ngrowing the hair she lost from treatment gave her hope for normalcy after she\nfinally beat the disease. After going into remission in early 2012, Valle\nwould get her hair back— just not in the way she expected.Valle, who lives in\nFanwood, New Jersey, ended up suffering permanent hair loss after undergoing\nprecautionary radiation on her brain, where doctors feared the cancer could\nhave spread. But thanks to a custom, 3-D printed prosthetic scalp hand-\ninjected with healthy human hair follicles to match her natural head shape and\nstrands, Valle feels normal again. In fact, she’s more confident than ever.“I\nalways had nice hair, but I never got the comments I get now,” 51-year-old\nValle, who got her hairpiece in May 2015, told FoxNews.com. “People say, ‘Wow,\nI love the color,’ and ‘It’s so shiny!’ I’ve heard that a million times.”Valle\ngot the custom hair and scalp system, called the CNC, at Transitions Hair\nSolutions in Wall Township, New Jersey. She’s about one of 60 customers who’s\ngotten the service at the center, said Transitions owner Danielle Grillo, who\noffers the CNC not only to cancer survivors, but also to people with alopecia,\nor hair loss, and trichotillomania, a disorder whereby an individual can’t\nresist pulling her hair out.A photo of Sheri Valle's custom mold and the film\nused during the application process. (Photo courtesy Transitions Hair\nSolutions) The caps themselves are produced out of Bologna, Italy-based Cesare\nRagazzi Laboratories, but CNC-certified centers worldwide, like Grillo’s,\napply them to clients’ heads then help them maintain the system.“It’s not a\ntraditional hairpiece or wig— it’s ultra-custom,” Grillo told FoxNews.com.\n“It’s the most natural thing I’ve seen in the 21 years I’ve been doing\nthis.”Like human hair, the follicles can be dyed, highlighted and styled\nhowever the client wants. But unlike wigs, the scalp portion of the CNC is\nmade with biomedical-grade material that’s antimicrobial, antifungal, and\nbreathable. Because the CNC is secured to the head, clients can also go\nswimming, windsurf or do anything a normal person with normal hair can, Grillo\nsaid. They can even go to a regular salon, and often the hairdresser won’t\nknow their hair isn’t growing from their head.“They turn back into how they\nused to be,” Grillo said of her clients, “and they let you in to do that. I\ncan’t think of a better feeling.”From design to application, preparing the CNC\nfor a client is a three-month process. First, Grillo observes and records\nspecific details of the client’s hair, including texture and direction of\ngrowth, as well as the client’s scalp pH, hydration levels and pigmentation.\nThe client’s scalp is then mapped out and a replica mold is created based on\nhow much of the head the client would like covered. The mold is then sent to\nBologna, where bioengineers create an exact replica of the client’s scalp\nusing 3-D printing. Virgin, unprocessed hair based on the client’s\nspecifications is then injected into the custom scalp.At centers like\nTransitions, the final custom CNC is then applied to the client’s head using\nmedical-grade glue or adhesive tape. Clients don’t take them off at all—\nshowering and sleeping in the CNC— until they return to Transitions for\nfollow-up appointments every four to six weeks. At that time, Grillo trims any\nhair that’s grown underneath, treats the client’s natural scalp, and\ndisinfects the CNC in a custom solution. A client typically uses two CNCs that\nlast a year apiece, alternating the systems at each follow-up\nappointment.Depending on the unique design of the client’s scalp and hair, the\nCNC system can cost anywhere between $3,000 and $10,000, Grillo said.Michael\nSuba, owner of Toronto, Canada-based Continental Hair, also offers the CNC to\nhis clients. Like Grillo, about 60 of his customers have them. Suba himself\ngot a CNC after suffering from hair thinning due to thyroid medication he had\nto take following radiation for Hodgkin’s lymphoma, which he had been\ndiagnosed with at age 25. “I play hockey with mine,” 51-year-old Suba, who got\nthe CNC about three years ago, told FoxNews.com. “It’s not hot; it’s not\nuncomfortable.”Suba worked with Grillo for a documentary on one of Suba’s\nlongtime clients, Kea Buote, who traveled with Grillo to Bologna to get the\nCNC and has since pursued her dream of becoming a dancer. In the documentary,\n“Kea Can Dance,” Buote describes how suffering from alopecia due to a rare\ndisease impacted her self-confidence on a daily basis. With the CNC that she\ngot in March, she’s able to focus on dancing, not on her hair.Danielle Grillo\nposes for a photo with Kea Buote, who is wearing her custom CNC. (Photo\ncourtesy Transitions Hair Solutions) Buote’s story is like that of many\npatients of Grillo’s and Suba’s, the two say.“You have these women in a lot of\ndistress who have hair loss,” Suba said. “They’re always thinking about the\nlimitations of what’s out there: a wig or a hair piece or things that don’t\nfit or don’t stay on right … it’s so important for them to know there’s\nsomething that can help,” he said. “It really gives you a ray of hope.”For\nValle, having a full head of hair again has given her the confidence to walk\nher 27-year-old son Anthony down the aisle next month, when he’s getting\nmarried.“Just having hair for that is a big to-do,” she said. “Just being\nalive is a big to-do because I survived small cell lung cancer. I’m glad every\nday when my foot hits the ground, but when it hit the ground without hair, it\nwas very depressing.”__\n\n","title":"Custom 3-D printed scalp, hair helps cancer survivors feel like themselves again | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Custom 3-D printed scalp, hair helps cancer survivors feel like themselves again  https://t.co/KE6ygNP2Fa https://t.co/R6T1buYMFB","date":"Wed Mar 30 19:26:01 +0000 2016","favs":232,"id":{"$numberLong":"715258802056994816"},"retweets":100},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1UCMXmB"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc958f6"},"content":"  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has kicked up a potential abortion\nhornet’s nest with states that impose restrictions on a common abortion-\ninducing drug, approving a new label for the medication that relaxes\nguidelines for using it.The FDA notified the manufacturer of Mifeprex, a drug\npreviously known as RU-486, in a letter on Tuesday that the drug is safe and\neffective for terminating a pregnancy in accordance with the new label. Also\nknown as mifepristone, the synthetic steroid drug is used in combination with\nanother drug, misoprostol, to end a pregnancy.Under the new label, a smaller\ndose of Mifeprex can be used significantly later in the pregnancy — up to 70\ndays of gestation, from 49 days.The decision could rankle lawmakers in states\nthat required the drugs to be used in accordance with the original labels.\nCritics complained those labels were outdated and restrictive. Abortion rights\ngroups say the FDA change will now affect laws in Ohio, North Dakota and Texas\nthat prohibited \"off-label\" uses of the drug. Similar laws are on hold in\nArizona, Arkansas and Oklahoma.The National Right to Life Committee argued\nthat the FDA changes would not increase safety for women.“In the end, it is\nobvious that the FDA's new protocol serves only the interests of the abortion\nindustry by expanding their base of potential customers, increasing their\nprofit margin, and reducing the level of staff and amount of resources they\nhave to devote to the patient,” Randall K. O'Bannon, National Right to Life\ndirector of education and research, said in a statement. “It is clear whose\ninterests it is the FDA is serving. It isn't the women, and it isn't the\nbabies.”The new label rules will make it easier to use the drug. Not only do\nthey widen the window for using it, but according to the New York Times, they\nreduce the number of trips women have to make to a doctor from three to two in\nmost states.Under the new label, the drug dosage has been reduced from 600\nmilligrams to 200 as well. According to The New York Times, the previous\ndosage had been deemed too high by most medical societies and abortion rights\nadvocates said it increased the cost and side effects of the procedure.The\ndrug, formerly known as RU-486, induces miscarriage when used with\nmisoprostol.“This is a huge step in increasing access to medication abortion\nand it comports with the scientific evidence,” Elizabeth Nash, a senior state\nissues associate at the Guttmacher Institute, which tracks women’s\nreproductive health issues, told The New York Times. She said that medication\nabortions accounted for about a quarter of all abortions in 2011, the last\nyear measured by the institute.According to a statement by the American\nCongress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the organization was “pleased\nthat the updated FDA-approved regimen for mifepristone reflects the current\navailable scientific evidence and best practices.”Additionally, The New York\nTimes reported the group saying, “medication abortion has been subject to\nlegislative attacks in various states across the country, including mandated\nregimens that do not reflect the current scientific evidence. We hope that\nthese states take the FDA label into account.”_The Associated Press\ncontributed to this report.___\n\n","title":"FDA authorizes expanded use of medical abortion pill | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"#FDA authorizes expanded use of medical #abortion pill https://t.co/c1GrWzJNxP https://t.co/33nQOCfFH4","date":"Wed Mar 30 18:16:01 +0000 2016","favs":56,"id":{"$numberLong":"715241184268935168"},"retweets":53},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1UCDETO"}

Andrew Cuomo will go to Cuba … but North Carolina is off-\nlimits.What gives?That’s the charge being leveled against the Democratic\ngovernor by North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory’s office after Cuomo banned\ncertain official travel to the Tar Heel State over a law critics say\ndiscriminates against transgender people.Earlier this week, Cuomo signed an\nexecutive order barring “non-essential state travel” to North Carolina. He\nrequired all state agencies to “immediately review” any such requested trips,\nadding: “As long as there is a law in North Carolina that creates the grounds\nfor discrimination against LGBT people, I am barring non-essential state\ntravel to that state.”But McCrory spokesman Josh Ellis accused Cuomo of\n“hypocrisy and demagoguery.” In a statement, he noted that Cuomo last year\nvisited Cuba, a country he said has a \"deplorable\" human rights record.He also\nquestioned whether the Democrat would ask the Syracuse University basketball\nteam to boycott the upcoming Final Four because it is hosted by Houston, where\nvoters last year defeated a non-discrimination ordinance. (As a private\nuniversity, Syracuse would not be subject to a state travel ban even if one\nexisted.)The retort heightens the war of words between the two state\ngovernments, as North Carolina faces increasing pressure from other states and\ncompanies as well over the new law.The law, which McCrory signed last week,\nwould prevent local governments from protecting people on the basis of sexual\norientation and gender identity when they use public accommodations such as\nhotels and restaurants. People also would have to use multi-stall bathrooms\nthat match their birth certificates at state agencies and public schools and\nuniversities.Critics, even inside the state government, say this would\ndiscriminate against transgender people.Attorney General Roy Cooper, the\ngovernor's Democratic challenger in the looming election, announced Tuesday\nthat his office won't defend this \"national embarrassment\" against a federal\nlawsuit filed by two transgender men, a lesbian law professor and civil rights\ngroups.McCrory complained this week that a well-coordinated national campaign\nis \"distorting the truth,\" and in a video Tuesday accused Cooper of \"inventing\nconflict that simply doesn't exist\" to justify his argument to refuse to\ndefend the law.Cuomo’s trip to Cuba last year was part of a two-day trade\nmission with other state industry leaders. It preceded President Obama’s\nhistoric visit last week to Havana, where he was joined by congressional\nlawmakers of both parties.A Cuomo spokesman, in response to Ellis, told\nSyracuse.com there is a “fundamental difference between legislative action\nthat strips LGBT people of their rights and taking affirmative steps to help\nchange long standing practices in a foreign country.”_The Associated Press\ncontributed to this report. ___\n\n","title":"Cuomo hit for visiting Cuba, but banning North Carolina travel | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"CUBA SI', CAROLINA NO?

(Associated Press) \"The\nroad to revolution is long and arduous,\" an editorial in the state-run Rodong\nSinmun newspaper said Monday, according to The Telegraph. \"We may have to go\non an arduous march, during which we will have to chew the roots of plants\nonce again.\"\"Even if we give up our lives, we should continue to show our\nloyalty to our leader, Kim Jong Un, until the end of our lives.\"- North Korean\nstate-run media\"Arduous march\" in North Korean is code for famine. It's how\nstate media described the disaster that struck when Kim was a mere teen, which\nexperts say was brought on by the economic mismanagement of his father, Kim\nJong Il, loss of foreign aid and natural disasters.  \nBut Kim, who at 33 walks with a cane and reportedly suffers from gout, won't\nmiss any meals. Last September, South Korea disclosed that Kim appeared to\nhave added nearly 70 pounds to his 5-foot, 9-inch frame over the previous five\nyears, reaching an estimated weight of 290 pounds.Kim's weight has been the\nsubject of discussion in South Korea. (Reuters) Photos released over the past\nyear have shown Kim Jong Un's rapid weight gain. The secretive regime hasn't\nsaid much about it, but South Korean analysts suspect he's been under severe\nstress. Investigators also note that he reportedly developed a taste for\nEmmental cheese while he was a student in Switzerland years ago.Pyongyang has\nordered every citizen in the capital to provide around 2 pounds of rice to the\nstate’s supplies every month, while farmers are forced to hand over additional\nrations from their own meager crops to the military, South Korean newspaper\nChosun Ilbo reported.Peasants in North Korea must turn food over to the\ngovernment, even as they starve.

Kim Jong Un’s regime has been cracking down on open-air markets\nthat have served as a source of additional food for city dwellers.\"Even if we\ngive up our lives, we should continue to show our loyalty to our leader, Kim\nJong Un, until the end of our lives,\" the state-run newspaper wrote, calling\nfor a \"70-day campaign of loyalty.\"Much of North Korea's population of 25\nmillion is already hungry, but new sanctions, the most severe in 20 years,\nwere approved by the UN Security Council after Pyongyang’s February nuclear\nweapons test and a recent long-range missile launch.The sanctions will further\ncripple North Korean trade and squeeze Kim's weapons programs.

You must first unify your party and build on\nit.Trump is literally a former builder. He must understand the importance of\nbuilding a strong foundation.Right now, his foundation is full of cracks and\nthe Republican Party is as divided as I have seen in the 50 years I've been\naround the game.Trump is presently getting 37 percent of Republican voters.\nHis biggest deficiency is among Republican women where the latest Wall Street\nJournal poll shows that 47 percent of Republican women say they will not vote\nfor Trump if he is the nominee.That is a sure formula for a landslide defeat,\neven to a vulnerable Hillary Clinton.Two things must be the focus for Trump\nand must be his team's agenda every day. First, bring Republicans home. And,\nsecond, add women voters!Trump can't win a general election by repeatedly\nattacking and insulting the majority of voters (women). The gender gap is real\nand growing. Women decided the election in 2012. The margin of victory was\ncast by women voters and the gap between President Obama and Mitt Romney among\nwoman voters was 12 percent. Women voters will be the deciding vote again in\n2016 and that gap has the potential to grow even larger.In his 2012 loss,\nRomney got 93 percent of the Republican vote and McCain, in 2008 got 90\npercent.George W. Bush in his two wins got 93 percent in 2004 and 91 percent\nin 2000.Looking at the numbers game, Trump must get over 90 percent – minimum\n-- of Republicans to support his nomination to be a viable candidate in a\ngeneral election.In order to do that he has to do a lot of repair work among\nthe base and with the other candidates and their supporters.Trump starts this\nelection with extremely high negatives, 65 percent in the latest Fox News\npoll, and even higher in other polls (the highest of any presidential\ncandidate running in the history of polling!)Trump has insulted and trashed\nall his fellow candidates in the race, along with the recent nominees of the\nparty: Dole, McCain, Romney. Trump also called former President George W. Bush\na liar.Of course the only Republican nominee he supported for president was\nRomney in 2012.In previous elections he was a Democrat/independent/businessman\nand he cast his vote for their opponents.Fast forward to 2016: Trump has made\nup for his Romney endorsement by calling him the biggest loser of all.Even if\nTrump manages to repair his relations with his own party he must also end his\nperceived war on women. The attacks on Mrs. Cruz (whether he started it or not\nhe certainly threw gas on the flames) have to stop.His ongoing feud with\nMichelle Fields, Megyn Kelly and other female journalists also has to\nstop.When 68 percent of voters don’t think you have the right temperament to\nbe president (including 48 percent of Republicans, 64 percent of\nindependents,64 percent of white voters, and 76 percent of women) it gets\nawfully hard to get the 65 million plus votes you will need to get elected.Mr.\nTrump is a hell of a salesman. He's already convinced a lot of voters in the\nprimaries he can do the job. But to get across the finish line as the winner\n-- not the loser -- is going to take a coordinated, and disciplined plan of\naction.First and foremost, Mr. Trump needs some substantive policy advisers in\nboth foreign and economic areas. Sound bites alone won't work in the fall\ncampaign.The world is a mess and good intentions and a \"can do attitude\" is\nnot enough.Trump needs to map out how he is going to win both the necessary\nconstituencies and the swing states that can get him to 270 electoral votes or\nmore.If he doesn’t begin to pivot now, he's going to lose and so will the\nparty he has now joined and wants to lead.But the first steps are to quit\ninsulting women, his fellow Republicans and minorities (and leave Mrs. Cruz\nand the female reporters alone). Mr. Trump, if you don't, I guarantee you, the\nlast thing voters will say to you is: \"You're fired!\"_Edward J. Rollins is a\nFox News contributor.

Kasich\nused conditional terms, pinning his reticence on Trump’s conduct and\ncandidacy, saying he wouldn’t support someone who was “really hurting the\ncountry, and diving the country.” Cruz reverted to his prior objections to\nsupporting a candidate who had attacked his wife, **Heidi**, but ultimately\nwaved off the question by promising to defeat Trump.  \n  \nTrump, however, was not equivocal, saying he would not honor the pledge he\nsigned with considerable fanfare back in September because he has “been\ntreated very unfairly\" by the Republican Party. Trump was presumably alluding\nto rules that might still deny him the nomination even if he has the most\ndelegates heading into the party’s convention.  \n  \nAs was observed at the time Trump and others signed the pledge, it was not a\ncontract enforceable by any court, but rather an agreement between gentlemen\nand one lady that they would unite when the primary was over. So it’s not like\nthe RNC can sue Trump if he bolts the party post-convention.  \n  \nIn that sense, Trump’s breach and the threatened breaches of his rivals means\nnothing. The Republicans were already hopelessly divided and embittered before\nTuesday night, rent by a struggle over Trump’s fitness as a nominee and\npresident.  \n  \nBut make no mistake: This is a considerable escalation and there will be\nconsequences of Trump’s departure from the pact.  \n  \nTrump’s tacit threat of working to ensure Republican defeat if he is denied\nthe party’s nomination is now explicit. That will further embolden those who\nsay they would rather lose in the fall than support Trump.  \n  \nWe’ve heard suggestions in every election cycle that if the party doesn’t\nlisten to the anguished cries of the supporters of trailing candidates that\n“the base” will stay home in the fall. But we’ve never heard it from the\nfrontrunner and certainly moving into the realm of overt threats is something\nwe’ve not seen in the modern era.  \n  \nIt is nearly an admission of inevitable defeat that both sides in the dispute\nvow to send the party to defeat against presumptive Democratic nominee\n**Hillary Clinton** if their demands are not met. There are certainly enough\nvoters in both camps to make good on their promises.  \n  \nAnd if eventual defeat is becoming a foregone conclusion, then the frame of\nthe race has changed massively. Hardliners on both sides of the Trump divide\nwill feel even more liberated to press their cases.  \n  \nWith his revocation, Trump has dropped more napalm on the already incinerated\nGOP.  \n  \nWith no conclusive end in sight for the Republican nominating process before\nJune at the soonest and each week finding a lower circle of Hell in which the\nrace can reside, it seems increasingly likely that the party will be in full\nrupture even before what promises to be a heinous convention.  \n  \n**Trump goes after reporter who brought assault charges against his campaign manager - **The Hill: “Donald Trump on Tuesday argued that his campaign manager acted appropriately by getting physically involved when a reporter approached him earlier this month. ‘She shouldn’t have been touching me,’ he said during a CNN town hall in Milwaukee, discussing former Breitbart journalist **Michelle Fields**. ‘She had a pen in her hand,’ Trump told moderator Anderson Cooper. ‘It could have been a knife. It might have been dangerous.’ Trump said he would not punish **Corey Lewandowski** because his top aide did nothing wrong during the encounter on March 12 in Jupiter, Fla. ‘I would have loved to have fired him, but I stick up for people when they are unjustly accused,’ he said of his campaign manager.”  \n  \n**Wait. Never mind -** Pressed by a town hall questioner on what he saw as the three most important functions of the federal government, Donald Trump listed national security, education and health care, later including housing as another key role. When it was pointed out that the latter items were widely rejected as federal functions by conservatives, Trump backtracked.  \n  \n**Cruz says politicians shouldn’t ‘wear their faith on their sleeve’ - **CBS News: “Early in his presidential campaign, Ted Cruz ran on a strategy of winning the support of evangelical conservatives, but the GOP candidate on Tuesday said he doesn't want people to vote for him because of his faith…Cruz said in a Milwaukee, Wisconsin town hall televised by CNN… ‘I’m a Christian, I’m not going to hide that... but I also think those in politics have an obligation not to wear their faith on their sleeve.’”  \n  \n**Power Play: Can Cruz and Kasich deconflict their campaigns? - **Early signs show there may be an alliance forming between John Kasich and Ted Cruz to stop Donald Trump from obtaining the nomination outright, but at a sacrifice to both.

The group stood before 61 images and mannequins of famous figures, ranging from comedian **W.C.

Twenty-three\nyears after his death, his name still evokes feelings of fear, anger and – as\nmuch as we hate to admit it – respect. The son of a peasant laborer and a\nschoolteacher, this child from the suburbs of Medellin, Colombia, grew up to\nbecome the King of Cocaine.Today, portrayed by Brazilian actor Wagner Moura,\nhe reigns in the ratings as the lead character in the Netflix series _Narcos_.\nThe show is a hit, reportedly with more viewers than _Game of Thrones_.\n(Netflix doesn’t release information about its ratings)Intrepid Travel\n(Colombia Valley seen from above.) “God created Colombia and made it so\nbeautiful he had to fill it with bad people,” begins the series, which was\nshot in Colombia. The country itself is a polarizing place, thanks in large\npart to Escobar’s lingering presence. They say people are a product of their\nenvironment, but Colombia, to some degree, is a product of its people. For\nyears it was called the murder capital of the world, and the idea that an\nAmerican would vacation there ranked somewhere between absurd and suicidal.But\nColombia today is a far cry from what it was in the ’90s. Escobar has been six\nfeet under since 1993, the drug cartels have been crippled and the government\nis taking great strides to promote tourism. And it has a lot to work with.\nFrom its Caribbean and Pacific beaches to its coffee-growing region of the\nAndes, the country is a scenic gold mine. Its cities – colonial Cartagena on\nthe Caribbean, cosmopolitan Bogota in the center and mountainous Medellin in\nthe northwest – offer everything that can be found in other major South\nAmerican cities, and the prices are so low they warrant double takes.Intrepid\nTravel (It's easy to navigate Bogota and discover Escobar-themed tourist\nattractions.) In Colombia, two dollars gets you the same Starbucks Frappucino\nyou pay five bucks for in the U.S. Part of the price difference has to do with\nsupply. Colombia is the world’s third largest producer of coffee and the\nlargest producer of the Arabica variety. If Escobar had wanted to rule a\nlegitimate industry, he would have invested in this bean business, like Juan\nPablo Echeverri, the owner of Hacienda Venecia, a bed-and-breakfast stop on\nIntrepid Travel’s Café Colombia tour. The eight-day guided adventure takes\nguests to the pulse of Colombia’s “Coffee Triangle,” where they get a crash\ncourse in coffee production.Echeverri serves unlimited shots of espresso\nbefore putting his guests to work, hand-sorting dried, handpicked beans into\ntwo piles. The best beans are exported; the others end up in the cups of\nColombians. Echeverri also teaches the nuances of coffee tasting. Basically,\nit’s the art of slurping. Tongue, teeth and the right amount of inhaled air\nare what make or break a tasting. While coffee and cocaine share similarities\n– both are addictive stimulants – the coffee bean is a key export Colombians\ncan be proud of. Around the world, the friendly face of Juan Valdez – the\nfictional character denoting Colombian coffee – is as prevalent as Escobar’s,\nonly Valdez’s portrait represents hardworking coffee farmers.Well-caffeinated\nbut not quite jittery, travelers on Intrepid’s tour eventually trade the\npastoral coffee plantation for the city of Medellin, where Escobar oversaw the\ninfamous Medellin Cartel. Once the most violent city in the world (there were\n6,349 murders in 1991), this urban mountain oasis is a far cry now from the\nbloodstained, bomb-ravaged streets of _Narcos_. Today, visitors use words like\n“clean” and “progressive” to describe Colombia’s third largest city, one of\nthe most modern cities in South America.A practically flawless public\ntransportation system ferries the public to and from world-class museums,\nshopping, churches, parks and even a few Escobar-themed tourist attractions.\nDialed-in local guides make the rounds at hotels and hostels, picking up\ntourists who fork over $20 to walk in the kingpin’s footsteps. Highlights\ninclude Escobar’s office, his home – where his brother Robert cares for many\nof his belongings – his jail cell and his grave. After a barrage of bullets in\nDecember 1993, the King of Cocaine got his wish: “_I prefer to be in the grave\nin Colombia than in a jail cell in the United States.”_Intrepid Travel (After\nexploring the city, head to the beach. ) In his prime, Escobar sat on a $30\nbillion fortune. The opening credits of _Narcos_ include footage of his\nprivate zoo, which contained animals from Africa. He spared no expense in\nbuilding his lavish, 300-room compound along the Caribbean Coast, a vacation\nparadise that runs from Panama to Venezuela and includes colonial Cartagena, a\ncolorful crossroads where old and new coexist in harmony.Wearing traditional\ndresses that make rainbows seem dull, women balance baskets of fruit on their\nheads around the main plazas, machetes at the ready to whip up a fruit salad\nfor tourists willing to pay two to six dollars for enough to feed a family of\nfour. Yes, the price ranges. On the street, tourists are often charged up to\n50 percent more than the locals, so bartering is essential for budget\ntravelers. After the sun sets, Ana Gomez, an Intrepid guide, leads her group\nout past the old city walls and into the hole-in-the-wall joints where the\nlocals go to show off their salsa moves.Gomez is acutely aware of her guests’\nfascination with Escobar, and she politely fields questions about him. But\nfrom the day her cross-country tour begins in Bogota, she keeps her charges\npreoccupied. While taking in the city’s culinary scene, ranging from farm-to-\ntable fine dining to a local market that would make a three-ring-circus seem\nboring, it’s easy to forget about Escobar – until you run into a street that’s\nclosed off for the filming of season two of _Narcos_. If Netflix has its way,\nEscobar’s posthumous 15 minutes of fame are far from over. It seems\ncounterintuitive, but perhaps reliving the country’s darkest times will cement\nits status as a worthwhile tourist destination.__Katie Jackson is a travel\nwriter.

But because Sunday was Easter, a large number of\nChristian families had come to the park.”_In majority Muslim Pakistan, a\ncountry where anti-Christian sentiment is a numbing fact of daily life, no one\nshould be surprised that the Pakistani government would seek to downplay the\ntargeted Easter mass murder of Christians in the Punjab.What was shocking,\nhowever, was that the initial statement by National Security Council\nSpokesperson Ned Price failed to mention that the terrorist group taking\n\"credit\" for the carnage was targeting Christians. Here’s his statement:_“The\nUnited States condemns in the strongest terms today’s appalling terrorist\nattack in Lahore, Pakistan. This cowardly act in what has long been a scenic\nand placid park has killed dozens of innocent civilians and left scores\ninjured. We send our deepest condolences to the loved ones of those killed,\njust as our thoughts and prayers are with the many injured in the explosion.\nThe United States stands with the people and Government of Pakistan at this\ndifficult hour. We will continue to work with our partners in Pakistan and\nacross the region, as together we will be unyielding in our efforts to root\nout the scourge of terrorism,”_Twenty-four hours later White House Press\nSecretary Josh Earnest _did_ acknowledge that Christians were targeted in\nPakistan on Easter though he was quick to add that the majority of the victims\nwere Muslim.The fact is that the Obama administration’s legacy when it comes\nto terror attacks has been to avoid highlighting or even acknowledging the\nIslamist theology of hate that is a common denominator and motivator of\nunspeakable crimes against humanity launched by ISIS, Al Qaeda, Al Shabab and\nBoko Haram in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and yes, the United\nStates.Tragically, the initial failure by the U.S. to acknowledge that the\nsuicide bomber who blew himself up among the swings and sliding ponds was\nlooking to murder and maim _Christian _families, is not surprising.While\npublic opinion long ago connected the dots of Islamist anti-Christian\npropaganda to their genocidal actions in Syria and Iraq, it took a\ncongressional resolution to finally force Secretary of State John Kerry to\nrecently admit that yes, Christians and Yazidis were victims of an attempted\ngenocide. And, for decades, Europe’s elite had their eyes wide shut to the\nhate burgeoning Islamist networks in their own cities and are only now playing\na deadly game of catch up.The disgraceful NSC statement on Sunday wouldn’t\nhave made any difference to the terrorists, so at this late stage in the Obama\nadministration, what difference does it make how the latest atrocity is\ncharacterized by Washington?For one thing, an emphatic and empathetic\nstatement from the White House would have sent a message of solidarity to the\nbeleaguered Christians of our sometime ally Pakistan. Secondly, Lahore was not\nthe first, only the latest site for Islamist fanatics targeting religious\nminorities, and not just Christians.Sky News is now reporting that ISIS\nmilitants recently arrested in Turkey revealed their (active) plans to attack\nJewish kindergartens in that country and to attack (again) Istanbul’s Great\nSynagogue.Embedded in the DNA of the Islamist fanatics is a theologically\nfueled and validated hate for the “Kafir” (a person who is not Muslim).There\nare countless plots in the terror pipeline, on every continent targeting\nMuslims and non-Muslims alike who dare to stand up to the fanatics.But just\nhow do we go about killing the message along with the genocidal messengers\nwithout attacking the cancerous DNA?Does anyone other than the President Obama\nbelieve anymore that refusing to call out Islamist terrorism for what it is\nwill somehow empower and win the day for truly peaceful and moderate\nMuslims?Here we are now, caught in a trap of our own making. The price of our\nfailure to deal with genocidal hate head-on recalls a dire warning from an\nancient Jewish Midrash that teaches: “Whoever shows mercy to the cruel, will\nin the end be cruel to the Merciful.”G-d help us all.___Rabbi Abraham Cooper\nis associate Dean of the __Simon Wiesenthal Center__ in Los Angeles.

Some claim it must surely be a\nsign of a secret right-wing plot, _The Sun_ reports.One even featured a Nazi-\nstyle ‘stormtrooper’ carrying a huge sword and rifle. With names like ‘In\nPeace and Harmony With Nature’ and ‘The Children of the World Dream of Peace’,\nthey depicted — the artist said — the triumph of peace over war. (Denver\nInternational Airport) Conspiracy theorists soon turned their attention to the\nairport’s bizarre art-packed interior and exterior.Most prominent is the\nbright blue Mustang, by El Paso artist Luis Jiménez. The giant sculpture\nactually killed Jiménez in 2006, when a section of it fell on him severing an\nartery in his leg.But it was a collection of bizarre murals by Leo Tanguma,\nnow removed, that really generated interest.One even featured a Nazi-style\n\"stormtrooper\" carrying a huge sword and rifle.With names like In Peace and\nHarmony With Nature and The Children of the World Dream of Peace they depicted\n— the artist said — the triumph of peace over war.To many the pictures true\nagenda were hints at a \"New World Order.\" Others point to masonic symbols\nscattered around the airport including a huge stone in the airport’s Great\nHall.The presence of gargoyles is also said to demonstrate that something evil\nis lurking.So what is the true purpose of Denver International Airport, if not\nto usher travelers in and out of Colorado?Some conspiracy theorists claim it\nis a giant military base, or even a concentration camp, just waiting to be\nused to assist in the enslavement of the American people.There’s also vague\nreferences to a vast underground facility, that may or may not connect to\nother deep subterranean military bunkers throughout the country.According to\nthe website VigilanteCitizen.com: “This gigantic structure will eventually\nbecome much more than a regular commercial airport.“It has the capacity to\nhandle a huge amount of people and vehicles, leading observers to think that\nthe structure might be used as military base and others even add that it will\nbe used as a civilian concentration camp in the near future.”Matt Chasansky,\nthe Art Program Manager, said in 2012: “You name a conspiracy theory and\nsomehow we seem to be connected to it.“But probably the most common is that\nthere’s an underground city and that it is a part of a network of underground\ncities that the government or some sort of shadow international government, or\naliens, are building, depending on your perspective ... or Masons ...“I can’t\ngive a tour in the airport without at least one person attaching themselves to\nthe tour and starting to ask questions about it.“There’s not [any] evidence\nyou can provide, there are no assurances you can give that the conspiracy\ntheory is wrong, because ... obviously it’s going to be a cover up or\nbrainwashing or chips installed in brains.”_This story originally appeared on\nThe Sun_.__\n\n","title":"The airport which launched a thousand conspiracy theories | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"RT @FoxNewsTravel: Why Denver's airport should creep you out with its thousand conspiracy theories | Fox News | https://t.co/BmtHg9cqcm htt…","date":"Wed Mar 30 14:29:31 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"715184185263009794"},"retweets":46},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1SwRlzC"}

(Stephane de Sakutin, Pool via AP) (The Associated Press)French\nPresident Francois Hollande has decided to abandon a bill that would have\nrevoked citizenship for convicted terrorists and strengthened the state of\nemergency because of a deadlock in parliament.In a rare address to reporters\nfollowing the weekly Cabinet meeting, Hollande said Wednesday he had no\nchoice. France's two houses of parliament disagree on the bill and a\ncompromise \"seems out of reach,\" he said.\"I very much regret that attitude.\"He\nhad submitted the two proposals days after the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris that\nleft 130 people dead.The Socialist president's proposal to revoke the\ncitizenship of convicted terrorists who had dual nationalities prompted a\nheated political dispute, with the far right applauding the idea while some on\nthe left denounced it as a divisive measure.Opponents of the measure say it\nwould create two classes of citizens -- dual nationals who could lose their\nFrench citizenship and French citizens who cannot -- in opposition to the\nprinciple of equality set out in France's constitution.The rule could not be\napplied to people who are French citizens only, as France's obligations under\ninternational law prevent it from leaving a person stateless.The same bill\naimed at introducing the state of emergency into France's Constitution in\norder to adapt the state of emergency to a long-term threat.Under the current\nlaw from 1955, the state of emergency lasts 12 days and can be extended for an\nindefinite period by a vote of the parliament.The \"threat remains higher than\never,\" Hollande said, adding he is committed to \"ensure our country's security\nand protect the French from terrorism\".The country's state of emergency,\nswiftly declared by the government on the night of the attacks, was recently\nextended to May 26. It extends some police powers of search and arrest and\nlimits public gatherings, among other changes.__\n\n","title":"French president Hollande drops plan to revoke terrorists' citizenship | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"#French president #Hollande drops plan to revoke citizenship for convicted terrorists | #FOXNewsWorld | https://t.co/YWAd4N6jK2","date":"Wed Mar 30 14:13:05 +0000 2016","favs":109,"id":{"$numberLong":"715180048848855040"},"retweets":90},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1V4LmV9"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc95906"},"content":"  In the five years since an unlicensed illegal immigrant ran down his son,\nDon Rosenberg has turned his anger and grief into a mission to answer a\nseemingly simple question: How many people are killed each year by drivers who\ndon’t belong in the U.S., much less behind a wheel?Drew Rosenberg, a 25-year-\nold student at Golden Gate University, was riding his motorcycle in San\nFrancisco when Roberto Galo struck him on Nov. 16, 2010. In his frenzied\neffort to flee the scene, Galo ran over his victim twice. The elder Rosenberg\ngot the news no parent should hear from San Francisco General Hospital that\nnight, but what he would learn over the next few years only compounded his\nbitterness.As many as 7,500 Americans -- 20 per day -- are killed annually by\nunlicensed drivers, and Rosenberg calculates that more than half are the\nvictims of illegal immigrants. Now, by testifying before lawmakers, speaking\nto parents who have been through the same ordeal and posting his research on\nhis nonprofit’s website, unlicensedtodrive.org, Rosenberg is shedding light on\na frightening number not readily available from government sources.“Our\narchives are filled with stories of drunk-driving illegals killing U.S.\ncitizens.”- William Gheen, Americans for Legal Immigration“I was stunned at\nwhat I found,” said Rosenberg, who at 63 is semi-retired from the\nentertainment and publishing industry. “Not only were unlicensed drivers\nkilling people in numbers only exceeded by drunk drivers, but many times they\nwere barely being punished and many times faced no charges at all.”Galo, a\nHonduran, who entered the country illegally but earned temporary protective\nstatus, had been cited five months earlier for driving without a license or\ninsurance and heading the wrong way on a one-way street in San Francisco. His\ncar was impounded for a day, he paid a fine for the moving violation and the\nother charges were dropped.Drew Rosenberg, (l.), was killed by a man his\nfather Don, (r.), believes should not have been in the country. (Courtesy: Don\nRosenberg) After he was convicted of manslaughter, Galo served six weeks in\njail and was released. He was deported in 2013 after a years-long legal\nbattle.Because state and federal highway safety officials do not classify\ndeaths by the perpetrator’s immigration stats, tabulating the deadly toll of\nunlicensed, illegal immigrant drivers has been a painstaking effort.\nRosenberg has pored through spreadsheets and studies, piecing together numbers\nthat show his son’s death was neither necessary nor unique. Still, his\nestimate is just that, and it varies from the guesses of other groups.Brandon\nMendoza, (l.), was killed by an unlicensed illegal immigrant, prompting his\nmother, Mary Ann Mendoza, (r.), to become an activist. (Courtesy: Mary Ann\nMendoza) “I’ve learned over time that many jurisdictions do not cite license\nstatus or immigration status when reporting these statistics, so if anything,\nthe numbers are understated,” he said. “For example, San Francisco doesn’t\nreport either criteria, so Drew’s death defaults to having been killed by a\nlicensed driver who was a citizen.”Such imprecise government bookkeeping masks\na frightening and, critics say, preventable danger. The AAA Foundation for\nTraffic Safety, which obtains state-by-state data from the federal government\nFatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) database – found that 20 percent of\nfatal crashes involved an unlicensed driver. From 2010-2014, there was an\naverage of 32,887 road deaths per year, which would mean 6,577 were caused by\nunlicensed drivers. Those drivers include citizens with suspended or revoked\nlicenses, and those who never had licenses. But if half are illegal\nimmigrants, it would be in line with Rosenberg’s estimates.“Our archives are\nfilled with stories of drunk-driving illegals killing U.S. citizens,” William\nGheen, of the Americans for Legal Immigration Political Action Committee, told\nFoxNews.com. “It is our official estimate that more than 3,000 U.S citizens\nlose their lives each year due to the insufficient enforcement of our existing\nborder and immigration law.”Brandon Mendoza was a 32-year-old, Mesa, Ariz.,\npoliceman in 2014 when an unlicensed, illegal immigrant driver drove drunk the\nwrong way on a freeway and killed him. Raul Silva-Corona had been convicted of\ncriminal conspiracy in Colorado 20 years earlier, but never deported.Mendoza’s\nmother believes the government could make the roads safer by at least\ndeporting illegal immigrants who have been convicted of crimes.“I don't\nbelieve it's reality to be able to get all of the illegals out of the country,\nbut I do believe we need to get the criminal element out of here and secure\nthe border so that they cannot continue to keep coming back,” Mary Ann Mendoza\nsaid.Like Rosenberg, Mendoza has turned her grief into activism, starting a\nmemorial foundation to continue her fallen son’s legacy and urging\npolicymakers to take the issue more seriously.“Until you have lost a loved one\nto an illegal criminal, you will never truly understand the other side of this\nissue,” she said.The problem of unlicensed illegal immigrant drivers is most\nsevere in the southwest, according to Peoria, Ariz., Police Detective Chris\nBoughey. Patrolling the streets of the Phoenix suburb, Boughey has encountered\nmany incidents involving unlicensed, illegal immigrant drivers and considered\nit in a national perspective.“With at least 11.4 million unauthorized\nimmigrants in the United States, it can be surmised that a large population\ndrive a vehicle on a regular basis,” Boughey said, adding that enforcing laws\nalready on the books should mean deportation for illegal immigrants caught\ndriving without valid licenses.When government agencies do acknowledge the\ndanger posed by unlicensed drivers, including illegal immigrants, they often\nuse the information to further a pro-illegal immigrant agenda, say critics.In\nthe wake of a 2013 study by the California Department of Motor Vehicles that\nconcluded that unlicensed drivers are almost three times as likely to cause a\ndeadly car accident as a licensed driver, Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation\nallowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver’s licenses. California, which was\nbelieved to have 2 million unlicensed drivers prior to passage of the law, is\nnow one of a dozen states to allow the controversial practice.“States that\nhave worked with undocumented immigrants to enable them to get drivers\nlicenses and insurance see a decrease in uninsured motorist claims,” said\nJanet Ruiz, of the Insurance Information Institute. “The availability of\ndriver’s licenses and insurance promote safer driving and less\naccidents.”Gregory Chen, director of advocacy at the American Immigration\nLawyers Associated, agreed.\"The best way to ensure safety on our nation's\nroads is to make sure everyone who drives has passed a driver's exam, and has\na license and insurance,” he said. “The last thing states and localities want\nis for their law enforcement and emergency teams to arrive at roadside\naccidents where drivers are uninsured and where injured persons arrive at\nhospitals unable to pay.\"But Gheen and other critics say those who combat the\nproblem of unlicensed drivers by awarding them licenses have it backward. A\nbetter solution, he said, is enforcing existing immigration law to the point\nthat people are no longer encouraged to “enter and remain in the U.S.\nillegally.”Rosenberg, who describes himself as a “lifelong liberal,” said the\ncircumstances surrounding his son’s death have left him bitter at the group he\ncalls the “amnesty crowd.” He also wants illegal immigrants caught driving\nwithout a license to be deported. “While I can sympathize with people who want\nto make their lives better, they can’t do it at the expense of others,” he\nsaid. “I am not angry at those who come here to try and better their life or\ntheir children’s, but it can’t be condoned or rewarded.”__\n\n","title":"Dad's grief leads to quest to count deaths caused by illegal immigrant drivers | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Dad's grief leads to quest to count deaths caused by illegal immigrant drivers https://t.co/OUwwplptYw https://t.co/qHRtb455BZ","date":"Wed Mar 30 13:55:14 +0000 2016","favs":534,"id":{"$numberLong":"715175557172842496"},"retweets":337},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1Titwhc"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc9590a"},"content":"  WASHINGTON –  The FBI's announcement that it mysteriously hacked into an\niPhone is a public setback for Apple Inc., as consumers learned that they\ncan't keep the government out of even an encrypted device that U.S. officials\nhad claimed was impossible to crack. Apple, meanwhile, remains in the dark\nabout how to restore the security of its flagship product.The government said\nit was able to break into an iPhone used by a gunman in a mass shooting in\nCalifornia, but it didn't say how. That puzzled Apple software engineers — and\noutside experts — about how the FBI broke the digital locks on the phone\nwithout Apple's help. It also complicated Apple's job repairing flaws that\njeopardize its software.The Justice Department's announcement that it was\ndropping a legal fight to compel Apple to help it access the phone also took\naway any obvious legal avenues Apple might have used to learn how the FBI did\nit. Magistrate Judge Sheri Pym on Tuesday vacated her Feb. 16 order, which\ncompelled Apple to assist the FBI in hacking their phone.The Justice\nDepartment declined through a spokeswoman to comment Tuesday.A few clues have\nemerged. A senior law enforcement official told The Associated Press that the\nFBI managed to defeat an Apple security feature that threatened to delete the\nphone's contents if the FBI failed to enter the correct passcode combination\nafter 10 tries. That allowed the government to repeatedly and continuously\ntest passcodes in what's known as a brute-force attack until the right code is\nentered and the phone is unlocked.It wasn't clear how the FBI dealt with a\nrelated Apple security feature that introduces increasing time delays between\nguesses. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because this person was\nnot authorized to discuss the technique publicly.FBI Director James Comey has\nsaid with those features removed, the FBI could break into the phone in 26\nminutes.The FBI hacked into the iPhone used by gunman Syed Farook, who died\nwith his wife in a gun battle with police after they killed 14 people in\nDecember in San Bernardino. The iPhone, issued to Farook by his employer, the\ncounty health department, was found in a vehicle the day after the\nshooting.The FBI is reviewing information from the iPhone, and it is unclear\nwhether anything useful can be found.Apple said that the legal case to force\nits cooperation \"should never have been brought,\" and it promised to increase\nthe security of its products. CEO Tim Cook has said the Cupertino-based\ncompany is constantly trying to improve security for its users. The company\ndeclined to comment more Tuesday.The FBI's announcement — even without\nrevealing precise details — that it had hacked the iPhone was at odds with the\ngovernment's firm recommendations for nearly two decades that security\nresearchers always work cooperatively and confidentially with software\nmanufacturers before revealing that a product might be susceptible to\nhackers.The aim is to ensure that American consumers stay as safe online as\npossible and prevent premature disclosures that might damage a U.S. company or\nthe economy.As far back as 2002, the Homeland Security Department ran a\nworking group that included leading technology industry executives to advise\nthe president on how to keep confidential discoveries by independent\nresearchers that a company's software could be hacked until it was already\nfixed. Even now, the Commerce Department has been trying to fine-tune those\nrules. The next meeting of a conference on the subject is April 8 in Chicago\nand it's unclear how the FBI's behavior in the current case might influence\nthe government's fragile relationship with technology companies or\nresearchers.The industry's rules are not legally binding, but the government's\ntop intelligence agency said in 2014 that such vulnerabilities should be\nreported to companies and the Obama administration put forward an interagency\nprocess to do so.\"When federal agencies discover a new vulnerability in\ncommercial and open source software — a so-called 'zero day' vulnerability\nbecause the developers of the vulnerable software have had zero days to fix it\n— it is in the national interest to responsibly disclose the vulnerability\nrather than to hold it for an investigative or intelligence purpose,\" the\nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence said in a statement in April\n2014.The statement recommended generally divulging such flaws to manufacturers\n\"unless there is a clear national security or law enforcement need.\"Last week\na team from Johns Hopkins University said it had found a security bug in\nApple's iMessage service that would allow hackers under certain circumstances\nto decrypt some text messages. The team reported its findings to Apple in\nNovember and published an academic paper after Apple fixed it.\"That's the way\nthe research community handles the situation. And that's appropriate,\" said\nSusan Landau, professor of cybersecurity policy at Worcester Polytechnic\nInstitute. She said it was acceptable for the government to find a way to\nunlock the phone but said it should reveal its method to Apple.Mobile phones\nare frequently used to improve cybersecurity, for example, as a place to send\na backup code to access a website or authenticate a user.The chief\ntechnologist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, Joseph Lorenzo Hall,\nsaid keeping details secret about a flaw affecting millions of iPhone users\n\"is exactly opposite the disclosure practices of the security research\ncommunity. The FBI and Apple have a common goal here: to keep people safe and\nsecure. This is the FBI prioritizing an investigation over the interests of\nhundreds of millions of people worldwide.\"__\n\n","title":"Apple still doesn't know how FBI hacked San Bernardino terrorist's iPhone without their help | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Apple still doesn't know how FBI hacked San Bernardino terrorist's iPhone without its help https://t.co/S4bU6KS5h4","date":"Wed Mar 30 11:01:18 +0000 2016","favs":293,"id":{"$numberLong":"715131784288010241"},"retweets":176},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1VT0O7t"}

It’s about changing how we talk about\nthings. The word alien makes undocumented people seem far\nremoved…extraterrestrial.”Officials concluded that the meaning of \"aliens\" is\noften misunderstood and should be replaced with \"noncitizens,\" and that the\nphrase \"illegal aliens\" has become pejorative. The heading \"illegal aliens\" is\nbeing replaced by \"noncitizens\" and \"unauthorized immigration.\"The word alien\nhas been targeted at the state level, such as in California, where last year\nGov. Jerry Brown signed a measure removing the term from the state’s labor\ncode.Also last year, Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, introduced\nlegislation to remove the term – which has been used in U.S. documents since\nthe Naturalization Act of 1790 – from official U.S. regulations, laws, and\ndocuments, among other things.Among the modifications sought by the measure,\ncalled the CHANGE Act, are replacing the term alien with “foreign national,”\nstriking “illegal alien” from federal law and replacing it with “undocumented\nforeign national,” and ensuring that all executive branch agencies stop using\nalien and illegal alien “in signage and literature.”The U.S. government uses\nthe term alien to refer to a person who is not a citizen or national of the\nUnited States._The Associated Press contributed to this report.____Elizabeth\nLlorente can be reached at elizabeth.llorente@foxnewslatino.com.

Dakhlalla pleaded guilty to a similar charge on March 11 and is also\nawaiting sentencing.But far from a case of a love-stricken young girl\nfollowing her beau to a Middle Eastern fantasy, Young agrees with prosecutors\nwho say she was the primary driver of the intended move to Syria and\ncontinually prodded Dakhlalla to speed up their passport approval so they\ncould leave.“I found the contacts, made arrangements, planned the departure,”\nprosecutors said she wrote to her family in a “farewell letter” last August.\n“I am guilty of what you soon will find out.”The couple was arrested Aug. 8\nbefore boarding a flight from Columbus, Miss., with tickets for Istanbul that\nYoung had purchased using her mom’s credit card without permission.Authorities\nbegan tracking Young and Dakhlalla in May when the couple contacted undercover\nfederal agents for help traveling to Syria.Aside from her own admissions and\nactions, prosecutors cited prior online statements from Young expressing\nsupport for ISIS and ISIS-inspired terror attacks. Prosecutors said Young\napprovingly cited a video of a man accused of being gay being thrown off a\nroof to his death by militants. She also expressed joy at the shooting of five\nmembers of the military in Chattanooga, Tenn., by an Islamic militant in\nJuly.“What makes me feel better after watching the news is that an akhi\ncarried out an attack against US marines in TN!

The landing in Larnaca began a bizarre\nsix-hour standoff with authorities, during which Mustafa made a series of\ndemands described as \"incoherent\" by Cyprus's president, before being\narrested. All 72 passengers and crew aboard the plane were released.A Cyprus\ncourt on Wednesday ordered Mustafa’s detention for eight days because of fears\nthat he might flee and the fact that he admitted to the hijacking in a\nvoluntary statement to police.Police prosecutor Andreas Lambrianou said\nMustafa also faces charges including hijacking, illegal possession of\nexplosives, kidnapping and threats to commit violence.Egyptian General\nProsecutor Nabil Sadek's office said Wednesday that he has asked Cyprus to\n\"take necessary measures to extradite Mustafa in order to start an\ninvestigation,\" according to a statement.Innes was one of seven people,\nincluding three passengers, kept on board the plane by Mustafa for hours after\nhe had released most of the passengers.

Police also found an\nunidentified liquid in the suspect's bag as well as numerous documents written\nin Arabic.Innes and the remaining hostages were later released before Mustafa\nwas arrested by anti-terror police.Friends of Innes weren't surprised by the\nstunt, with one telling the Daily Telegraph, \"Ben is a wild man and this is\ntotally in character for him.

The initial eruption continued for about 17 hours\nand put out an ash cloud that reached 37,000 feet.The plume blew northeast and\nby Tuesday had reached Canada, but Dave Schneider, a U.S. Geological Survey\ngeophysicist at the observatory, said activity had calmed from the continuous\neruptive phase.\"Over the last six to eight hours the activity is more\nintermittent,\" he said. \"There are short duration, small explosive events that\nare occurring, as opposed to sort of a continuous plume.\"The original ash\ncloud crossed Bristol Bay, spread into interior Alaska, and stretched into\nnorthern Canada, said Don Moore, meteorologist in charge of the National\nWeather Service Alaska Aviation Weather Unit.\"The extent of the plume is\ncertainly greater but the concentration of the ash is becoming less,\" Moore\nsaid. \"The plume is becoming thinner over time.\"Volcanic ash is angular and\nsharp and can cause a jet engine to shut down. Alaska Airlines canceled 41\nflights within the state Monday, and 28 more Tuesday.Sherry Keever has lived\nin Healy, Alaska, for only a year and was trying to get home from a vacation\nin California when ash from the volcano prompted the cancellation of her\nflight.\"I'm kind of new, and I wasn't even aware there were volcanoes that\ncould affect the flight patterns, and I'm OK with it,\" she said while sitting\nin a waiting area of Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, waiting to\nsee if she could get her flight to Fairbanks on Tuesday.The volcano in the\n8,261-foot mountain is one of Alaska's most active. It has had 40 known\neruptions.Pavlof eruptions in the past 20 years have not been as intense, but\nthe current eruption is not unprecedented for the volcano, Schneider said.The\nlength of the eruption was a major factor in the size of the ash cloud,\nSchneider said. So were the winds and possibly the smaller size of the ash,\nwhich takes longer to fall out of the atmosphere.The observatory took reports\nof ash fall, which can be hazardous to eyes, skin and breathing passages, from\nseveral communities.USGS geologist Kristi Wallace said the most significant\nwas in Nelson Lagoon, a village of 39 people about 55 miles northeast of the\nvolcano. Residents reported one-eighth to two-thirds of an inch of ash.Cpl.\nBarrett Taylor, a village public safety officer in Nelson Lagoon, saw ash\nfalling early Monday.\"It was raining ash for a little bit,\" Taylor said. \"It\nturned everything black, the rooftops, the fuel tanks, homes.\"The ash was\nworse Tuesday, he said, because wind coming in off the ocean was whipping it\naround.The community has put out a health advisory to stay inside until\nWednesday.

These folks should be\nworking.\"Since Kansas reinstated work rules, food stamp rolls **  \n**dropped by 20,000 and the incomes of those who left increased by 127 percent, Wiens said.The state also imposed limits on how recipients could use their benefits after finding some enrollees used their welfare cash and food stamps cards on cruise ships. \"Those benefits should be used for necessities,\" Wiens said. \"You can't use them at casinos, strip clubs, massage or tattoo parlors.\"Maine followed the Kansas lead in 2014. In the first three months, the number of able-bodied adults without children on food stamps fell by almost 80 percent. It also cracked down on recipients using their welfare benefits out of state after finding hundreds of Maine residents used their EBT cash cards at or near Disney World.\"Maine found millions of dollars being spent in Florida,\" said Josh Archambault of the Foundation for Government Accountability. \"That raised all sorts of red flags.\"Another red flag -- a Maine state employee recognized the name of a large state lottery winner. It turned out the state did not require an asset test, allowing food stamp recipients to have vacation homes, multiple cars and lottery winnings and still qualify. After a 2015 state study found 4,000 welfare recipients won more than $22 million in the state lottery funds, Maine imposed a limit on assets.\"An individual could win a half million dollars,\" said Archambault. \"In the month they receive the lump sum they may not qualify because it counts as income. The very next month and every month going forward, they can legally sign up for food stamps.\"Since 2010, nearly 4,000 welfare recipients in Maine won $1,000 or more. Eleven of them won 10 or more times,** **and eight individuals won prizes in excess of $500,000.__William La Jeunesse joined FOX News Channel (FNC) in March 1998 and currently serves as a Los Angeles-based correspondent.\n\n","title":"States moving to restore work requirements for food stamp recipients | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"States moving to restore work requirements for food stamp recipients  https://t.co/BJItxZlDM1 https://t.co/3Wr59Qm0Fc","date":"Wed Mar 30 03:05:05 +0000 2016","favs":630,"id":{"$numberLong":"715011941714911232"},"retweets":218},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1Sv55uF"}

A\nPhiladelphia high school journalist who took on Black Lives Matter in a column\nfor the school paper, only to be driven into home-schooling, says his torment\ndidn't end when he withdrew. It was just before Christmas break when 17-year-\nold University of Pennsylvania-bound Michael Moroz wrote an opinion piece for\nthe Central High school paper, the Centralizer.In it, he criticized the\nracially charged University of Missouri protests at the time and suggested\nthat Michael Brown, the black teenager killed in 2014 by a white police\nofficer in Ferguson, Mo., was \"a delinquent\" who was \"at worst, justifiably\nkilled, and at best, a thug.\"\"If someone who called for me to be shot gets a\nday suspension, then I imagine these students got a stern high five.”- Michael\nMorozWhen the column hit the paper’s Facebook page, threats poured in. Moroz\nsaid he was forced to stay home initially, and when he returned, threats and\nharassment prompted him to withdraw and finish his senior year on home\nstudy.“When everything started to happen, I was surprised,” Moroz told\nFoxNews.com. “Whenever we posted an op-ed, we never got a reaction like I did\nwith this one. In retrospect, I was naive to think that this would have been\nthe same. Now, it’s more disappointing than anything.”Moroz said the\nharassment has continued on social media since he has entered independent\nstudy and claims even his former teachers and staff at Central have taken\npart.In a screengrab provided to FoxNews.com, a student appears to have\ntweeted to one of the teachers at Central a veiled threat against Moroz.In a\nscreengrab provided to FoxNews.com, a student is seen tweeting to one of the\nteachers at Central, in which the educator responds with a laugh “Would you\nstill penalize me if I decided to punch him in addition to using my words?”\nthe tweet read.The teacher tweeted back “yes,” but added \"LOL,\" in a flippant\ndismissal of what Moroz perceived as a threat.Moroz also provided another\nscreen shot of a tweet in which the head of the Social Studies department\naccused Moroz of baiting other students into a fight rather than making a\nsound argument.The original column ran alongside another piece supportive of\nthe University of Missouri demonstrations, which were triggered by claims the\nschool was slow to react to incidents that alienated African-American students\nthere. The demonstrations drew national headlines and resulted in the\nresignation of the school president.the head of the Social Studies department\nalso accused the student on social media of baiting other students into a\nfight rather than making a sound argument. Both op-eds were eventually taken\ndown, but Moroz’s was the first. His opinion piece was pulled from the\nFacebook page by student editors once the backlash began, and the counterpoint\narticle supporting the movement was left alone.“Neither the Centralizer nor\nits members necessarily agree with the content/message of the piece,\" read a\nnoted posted by the Centralizer staff at the time. \"However, the situation has\nescalated such that the writer and editors on the staff have received direct\nthreats.\"Officials for the Philadelphia school district told FoxNews.com that\nthey have accommodated Moroz as much as possible since the beginning of the\nyear and that appropriate action was taken regarding threats against him.“The\nSchool District stands by the numerous supports and accommodations provided to\nMr. Moroz by the Central High School principal and faculty,” Raven Hill, a\nspokesperson for the Philadelphia School District, told FoxNews.com in a\nwritten statement.“His claims were investigated and the students who\nthreatened him were disciplined according to the code of conduct. The school\naccommodated his requests for a police escort and independent study.”Despite\nbeing on independent study, Moroz is still the subject of ridicule amongst\nangry students at Central High School. Moroz said the sniping and threats he\nbelieves he has been subjected to on social media warrant action, too.“If I\nmade threats on Twitter against someone who wrote a pro-Black Lives Matter\ncolumn, I wouldn’t be getting any leniency,\" Moroz said. “It’s been more than\none person and the school isn’t doing anything about it.”__Perry Chiaramonte\nis a reporter for FoxNews.com.

See Latest Coverage →Devine said dozens of\nsuperdelegates have expressed support for the Vermont senator. He acknowledged\ndelegates who are undecided – as opposed to those already backing Clinton –\nare the “best target.”Campaign manager Jeff Weaver also suggested the number\nin the pro-Sanders camp is “higher than what’s publicly available” because\nothers are “not ready to go public yet.”The leaderboard right now still\nreflects a daunting road ahead for Sanders.Clinton leads Sanders in the\npledged-delegate race 1,243-975. That gap grows immensely when superdelegates\nare included; 469 currently support Clinton, while Sanders only has 29 in his\ncorner.It takes 2,383 total delegates to win the nomination.Even as Sanders\nclaims momentum out of his Western state victories this past weekend, the\nClinton campaign is voicing confidence that the race could be over in a matter\nof weeks.“We are going to get to the point where, at the end of April, there\njust is not enough real estate for him to overtake the commanding lead that\nwe’ve built up,” Clinton pollster Joel Benenson told reporters, according to\nthe Los Angeles Times.Weaver, though, said the Sanders campaign is in regular\ncontact with at least some of the roughly 200 still-available superdelegates,\nan effort that includes recently sending them a newsletter and having those\ncommitted to Sanders making calls to the undecided.The campaign is not alone\nin such efforts. The remaining three GOP presidential candidates are in a\nfurious, behind-the-scenes battle for delegates who -- more likely than for\nDemocrats -- could decide the nominee at the July convention. They are eyeing\nboth delegates who backed ex-candidates and those who could become unbound at\na contested convention.Front-runner Donald Trump on Tuesday named as his\nconvention manager Paul Manafort, a political veteran who helped then-\nPresident Gerald Ford in his convention floor fight in 1976.Ohio Gov. John\nKasich has enlisted four veterans: Stu Spencer and Charlie Black, both Reagan\nadvisers, and this week operatives Michael Biundo and Andrew Boucher, to win\nover delegates.In addition, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz reportedly is going to the\nColorado state convention next week, when a majority of the state’s delegates\nwill be picked. And Trump is disputing the delegate allocation in Louisiana’s\nMarch 29 primary, where he reportedly could get fewer delegates than second-\nplace finisher Cruz despite winning the state.The Sanders campaign has a\nsuperdelegate point person, though it’s unclear how aggressive their wooing\noperation will be.Sanders Press Secretary Symone Sanders told FoxNews.com on\nTuesday the campaign has somebody on staff to keep in contact with\nsuperdelegates.“But no, we don’t have anybody picking off folks,” she said.On\nMonday, Sanders pollster Ben Tulchin said an “overwhelming preponderance” of\npolling data shows that his candidate would fare better in a general election\nthan Clinton against any of the three GOP candidates.“This is not a blip,” he\nsaid.Tulchin also said Sanders is “very popular” among independent voters who\nare “absolutely critical for Democrats to win the White House in November.”And\nhe made clear that the polling details are targeted to more than just\nreporters and voters.   “These are things that superdelegates, quite frankly,\nhave to consider quite seriously,” he said.__\n\n","title":"Sanders launches late-stage bid to woo superdelegates | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Sanders launches late-stage bid to woo superdelegates https://t.co/ZhiXUEvMml via @foxnewspolitics https://t.co/E85ESWmC79","date":"Tue Mar 29 21:15:28 +0000 2016","favs":89,"id":{"$numberLong":"714923956591931392"},"retweets":44},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1SuLta8"}

(REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni) The ground east of the Rockies is\nfar more likely to shake this year with damaging though not deadly\nearthquakes, federal seismologists report in a new risk map for 2016. Much of\nthat is a man-made byproduct of drilling for energy.Parts of Oklahoma now\nmatch northern California for the nation's most shake prone. One north-central\nOklahoma region has a 1 in 8 chance of a damaging quake in 2016, with other\nparts closer to 1 in 20.Overall, 7 million people live in areas where the risk\nhas dramatically jumped for earthquakes caused by disposal of wastewater, a\nbyproduct of drilling for oil and gas. That is mostly concentrated in\nOklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Kansas, Colorado and Arkansas.Natural earthquake\nrisk also increased around the New Madrid fault in Missouri, Tennessee,\nKentucky, Arkansas and Illinois.In a first-of-its-kind effort, the U.S.\nGeological Survey on Monday released a map for risks of damaging quakes in the\ncurrent year. Past efforts looked at 50-year risks and didn't include man-made\nquakes. The new risks are mostly based on increases in quakes felt last\nyear.These are not massive quakes that kill hundreds or thousands of people\nand leave devastation in their wake. Instead, these smaller quakes happen more\nfrequently, said Mark Petersen, chief of the National Seismic Hazard Mapping\nProject. They damage but don't topple buildings.\"There's no question that\nthere's a lot of shaking going on in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas,\" Petersen\nsaid in an interview after a press conference Monday. \"These are much higher\nground motions\" than the last time he created the longer-term map, in\n2014.USGS forecast for damage from natural and induced earthquakes in 2016\n(USGS) For example, on that map the risk was low in Dallas; now, after a\ntenfold increase in risk, Petersen said it compares to places in California.\nThe Dallas-Fort Worth area risk is between 2 to 5 percent this year, he\nsaid.\"Oklahoma and Texas have the largest population exposed to induced\nquakes,\" Petersen said.North-central Oklahoma was said to have a 12 percent\nrisk, and it has already been hit: A 5.1 magnitude quake caused some damage\naround Fairview in February.Seismologist Rowena Lohman of Cornell University,\nwho wasn't part of the map team, said the increase around Oklahoma is easily\nnoticeable and scientists are trying to determine whether these man-made\nsmaller quakes lead to larger events.Induced quakes are to blame for much of\nthe problem. They result when wastewater is injected deep underground, said\nUSGS seismologist Justin Rubinstein, the deputy chief of the mapping program.\nThat injection is a byproduct of energy drilling, including hydraulic\nfracturing, a relatively new and controversial process to drill for oil and\ngas. But he said the fracking process itself mostly doesn't cause quakes\nstrong enough to be damaging, while injecting fracking waste does.Rubinstein\nsaid there is a scientific consensus \"that wastewater disposal does cause\nearthquakes.\"Arkansas, Kansas and Ohio saw dramatic reductions in man-made\nquakes when those states tighten restrictions on wastewater injections,\nRubinstein said.In Oklahoma, \"the longer we go, the more we pump down there,\nthe more likelihood we have that we're going to have larger quakes,\" Petersen\nsaid.Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin said the research justifies action taken by\nOklahoma earlier this year to cut back on injections.\"Recent declines in\nproduced wastewater disposal in Oklahoma are not reflected in the USGS map,\"\nFallin said. \"This gives us even a stronger base in going forward and gives\nstate regulators further justification for what they are doing.\"Rubinstein\nsaid it's too early to see any results from Oklahoma's new efforts.The\nincrease in the natural quakes in the New Madrid area remains a mystery,\nPetersen said, but \"it's higher than it's been in several years.\"__\n\n","title":"USGS: Risk of earthquakes in 2016 increases, especially in Oklahoma | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"USGS: Risk of earthquakes in 2016 increases, especially in Oklahoma  https://t.co/asteWBwCuy https://t.co/88QmCpXzqR","date":"Tue Mar 29 20:55:06 +0000 2016","favs":75,"id":{"$numberLong":"714918829927759873"},"retweets":83},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1UyWvPB"}

But that’s only part of the picture,” he said.Dennis\nDeBusschere, senior managing director at Evercore ISI, said in a note Yellen\nhighlighted “every dovish argument” floating around in the markets, but said\nthat she could be exercising caution short term to increase the odds of a rate\nhike later this year: A kind of risk-management strategy.“Otherwise, they risk\ntightening financial conditions too quickly and sending inflation/economic\ngrowth lower,” he explained. “I realize not a single financials/bank investor\nwants to hear that given continued disappointment around the Fed’s ability to\nraise rates, but inflation expectations are moving higher, despite lower oil\nprices, following Yellen’s talk.”  Following her speech and a brief question-\nand-answer session, U.S. equity markets rallied, as did gold prices, while the\nyield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield slid alongside the U.S.\ndollar against a basket of global currencies.  __\n\n","title":"Yellen Reiterates Fed’s Dovish Tone, Remains Cautious on Outlook | Fox Business","twitter":{"body":"Yellen reiterates Fed’s dovish tone, remains cautious on outlook https://t.co/Sy0u2UrL5f via @FoxBusiness https://t.co/KK83sNfHAD","date":"Tue Mar 29 19:40:07 +0000 2016","favs":26,"id":{"$numberLong":"714899959640764416"},"retweets":33},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1Rpqp5Z"}

The impoverished nation of 26 million, which imports 90\npercent of its food, already had one of the highest malnutrition rates in the\nworld, but in the past year the statistics have leaped.The number of people\nconsidered \"severely food insecure\" -- unable to put food on the table without\noutside aid -- went from 4.3 million to more than 7 million, according to the\nWorld Food Program. Ten of the country's 22 provinces are classified as one\nstep away from famine.Where before the war around 690,000 children under five\nsuffered moderate malnutrition, now the number is 1.3 million. Even more\nalarming are the rates of severe acute malnutrition among children -- the\nworst cases where the body starts to waste away -- doubling from around\n160,000 a year ago to 320,000 now, according to UNICEF estimates.Exact numbers\nfor those who died from malnutrition and its complications are unknown, since\nthe majority were likely unable to reach proper care. But in a report released\nTuesday, UNICEF said an estimated 10,000 additional children under five died\nof preventable diseases the past year because of the breakdown in health\nservices, on top of the previous rate of nearly 40,000 children a year.\"The\nscale of suffering in the country is staggering,\" UNICEF said in the report,\nand the violence \"will have an impact for generations to come.\"The Saudi-led\ncoalition launched its campaign on March 26, 2015, aiming to halt the advance\nof Shiite rebels known of Houthis who had taken over the capital, Sanaa, drove\nout the internationally recognized government and stormed south. The Houthi\nadvance was halted. But they continue to hold Sanaa and the north. In the\ncenter of the country, they battle multiple Saudi-backed factions supporting\nthe government that tenuously holds the southern city of Aden.Ground fighting\nand the heavy barrage of airstrikes have killed more than 9,000 people,\nincluding more than 3,000 civilians, according to the U.N. Human Rights\nOffice. More than 900 children have been killed and more than 1,300 wounded,\n61 percent of them in airstrikes, according to UNICEF.Coalition airstrikes\nappear to be \"responsible for twice as many casualties as all other forces put\ntogether,\" Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein said. The coalition argues that the rebels\noften use civilians and civilian locations as shields for their fighters. It\nalso disputes U.N. figures on how many deaths are caused by strikes, saying\nthey are based on statistics from the Houthis.Around 2.3 million people have\nbeen driven from their homes. Strikes have destroyed storehouses, roads,\nschools, farms, factories, power grids and water stations. The naval blockade,\nenforcing a U.N. arms embargo on the rebels, has disrupted the entry of food\nand supplies.The ripple effects from war have tipped a country that could\nalready barely feed itself over the edge. The food, fuel and other supplies\nthat do make it into the country are difficult to distribute because trucks\nstruggle to avoid battle zones, fear airstrikes or need to scrounge for gas.\nUnder control of Houthi fighters, government services from Sanaa are largely\nparalyzed.The fate of Udai illustrated the many factors, all exacerbated by\nwar, that lead to the death of an infant.His family lives off the pension that\nUdai's father, Faisal Ahmed, gets as a former soldier, about $200 a month for\nhim, his wife and nine other children ranging from 2 years old to 16. He used\nto sometimes work construction, but those jobs disappeared in the war. With\nfood prices rising and supplies sporadic, the family eats once a day, usually\nyoghurt and bread, peas on a good day, said Udai's parents, both in their\n30s.The day Udai was born, warplanes from the Saudi-led coalition were\nstriking an army base used by Houthi rebels in their district of Hazyaz, a\nshantytown on the southern edge of Sanaa. Shrapnel hit their one-bedroom house\nwhere Udai's mother was in labor.\"She was screaming and delivering the baby\nwhile the bombardment was rocking the place,\" the father said.Hezzam breastfed\nher newborn son for about 20 days, but then her milk stopped, likely from her\nown malnutrition. Even after childbirth, she had to collect firewood for the\nmud brick stove at the doorstep of her house. Like much of the country,\nelectricity has long been knocked out in their neighborhood, either because of\nairstrikes or lack of fuel, and there's rarely cooking gas.\"I go every day to\nfaraway places to search for the wood then carry it home on my head,\" she\nsaid.The family turned to formula to feed Udai, but it wasn't always available\nand they couldn't always afford it. So every few days, Udai got formula and\nthe other days he would get sugar and water. Water trucks occasionally reach\nthe area, but otherwise his parents had to use unclean water. In the past\nyear, the number of people without regular access to clean water has risen\nfrom 13 million people to more than 19 million, nearly three-quarters of the\npopulation.Within three months, Udai was suffering from diarrhea. His father\ntook him to local clinics but they either didn't have supplies or he couldn't\nafford what they did have. Finally, on March 20, he made it to the emergency\nsection at al-Sabeen Hospital.Udai was suffering from severe malnutrition,\ndiarrhea and a chest infection, said Saddam al-Azizi, head of the emergency\nunit. He was put on antibiotics and a feeding solution through the nose.The AP\nsaw Udai at al-Sabeen on March 22. His arms were convulsing, his emaciated\nlegs motionless, his face gaunt and pale. When he cried, he was too dehydrated\nto produce tears. At around five months old, he weighed 2.4 kilograms (5.3\npounds).\"Unstable,\" his chart read for every day he'd been there.Two days\nlater, his parents took him home. His father told the AP it was because the\ndoctors told them it was hopeless, and he complained the staff was not giving\nhim enough treatment. Al-Azizi said he suspected it was because the family\ncouldn't afford the medicines. The hospital stay is free, but because\nmedicines are in such short supply, families must pay for them, he said.\"It\nwas a mistake to take him out,\" he said. The treatment needed time to\nwork.Still, al-Azizi had given Udai only a 30 percent chance of survival.Al-\nSabeen was already dealing with dozens of malnourished children. In the first\nthree months of the year, it has treated around 150 children with\nmalnutrition, double the same period last year, al-Azizi said. Around 15 died,\nnot counting Udai.Some parents managed to get there from remote parts of the\ncountry. One woman described walking for four days from her mountain village\noutside Sanaa, carrying her emaciated daughter, who at two years old weighed\nonly four kilograms (8.8 pounds).Mohammed Ahmed brought his son here from the\ncity of Ibb because the hospital there had no supplies. He drove the 90 miles\n(150 kilometers) through rebel checkpoints while warplanes struck, he said.\nHis 10-month-old son Marwan, after 15 days in the hospital, now weighs 3.5\nkilograms (7.7 pounds).Hospitals and clinics around the country have suffered\nshortages of medicines and fuel, meaning millions live in areas that have\nvirtually no medical care. UNICEF said nearly 600 health facilities nationwide\nhave stopped working.The Saudi-led coalition allows humanitarian flights\nbringing medical supplies as well food and water in to Sanaa as well as\nshipments into Hodeida port, the closest one to the capital. But getting the\nsupplies around the country is difficult. Even pre-war transportation\ninfrastructure was poor, and now trucks often can't get through battle zones.\nDrivers fear getting hit by airstrikes or have to scrounge to obtain expensive\ngas.Hospitals and clinics have been hit by airstrikes or caught up in\nfighting. In the battlefield city of Taiz, the Yemeni-Swedish Hospital for\nChildren was damaged as rebels and Saudi-backed fighters fought over it.\nParents had to rush their children being treated there back to their homes,\nand their fate is unknown.Udai hardly lasted three hours after being brought\nhome, his parents said. Ahmed, his father, said he blames Saudi Arabia's air\ncampaign for his son's death.\"This is before the war,\" he said, holding up his\n2-year-old son Shehab to show the difference between a child born before the\nwar and after.They buried the infant at the foot of the mountains nearby. His\nfather read the Quran over the tiny grave marked only by rocks, reciting, \"On\nGod we depend.\"__\n\n","title":"Baby's death at 5 months sheds light on hunger crisis in Yemen | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Baby's death at 5 months sheds light on hunger crisis in #Yemen | #FOXNewsWorld | https://t.co/XK87ys86e2","date":"Tue Mar 29 16:58:03 +0000 2016","favs":71,"id":{"$numberLong":"714859177143701504"},"retweets":75},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1Sk9f69"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc95936"},"content":"  The Supreme Court split 4-4 Tuesday on a challenge brought by public school\nteachers who objected to paying union dues, delivering a big win for the\nunions – in the first major case where the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s vote\nwould have proved decisive. The California teachers in the case had challenged\na state law requiring non-union workers to pay “fair share” fees into the\npublic-employee unions to cover collective bargaining costs.The court, with\nits split decision, left in place a lower court ruling favoring the unions.The\nresult is an unlikely victory for organized labor after it seemed almost\ncertain the high court would rule 5-4 to overturn a system in place nearly 40\nyears. The court is operating with only eight justices after the death of\nScalia, who had been expected to rule against the unions.The one-sentence\nopinion Tuesday does not set a national precedent and does not identify how\neach justice voted. It simply upholds a decision from the 9th U.S. Circuit\nCourt of Appeals that applies to California and eight other Western states.\nStill, the original case challenged a system in place for more than 5 million\nworkers in 23 states and Washington, D.C., who are represented at the\nbargaining table by public sector unions. Labor officials worried the\npotential loss of tens of millions of dollars in fees would reduce their power\nto bargain for higher wages and benefits for government employees.The union\ncase is among a handful of high-profile disputes in which Scalia's vote was\nexpected to tip the balance toward a result that favored the conservative\njustices.Since Supreme Court decisions are not final until they are handed\ndown, nothing Scalia did or said in connection with the case before his death\nmattered to the outcome.The group of California teachers backed by a\nconservative group said being forced to pay union fees violated the free\nspeech rights of nonmembers who disagree with the unions' positions. They had\nurged the justices to overturn a nearly 40-year-old Supreme Court decision\nthat allows the unions to collect the fees.The high court had raised doubts\nabout the viability of the 1977 precedent, Abood v. Detroit Board of\nEducation, but it stopped short of overturning it in two recent cases. In\nAbood, the court said public workers who choose not to join a union can be\nrequired to pay for bargaining costs if the fees don't go toward political\npurposes.The lead plaintiff was Rebecca Friedrichs, a public school teacher\nfrom Orange County, California, who said she resigned from the California\nTeachers Association over differences but was still required to pay about $650\na year to cover bargaining costs.Labor leaders called the lawsuit part of a\ncoordinated effort by conservative groups to weaken labor rights. Union\nofficials say the fees are necessary because it has a legal duty to represent\nall teachers at the bargaining table, even those who are not part of the\nunion. _Fox News' Shannon Bream and The Associated Press contributed to this\nreport. ___\n\n","title":"Supreme Court split over teachers' dues delivers win for unions | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Breaking News: Supreme Court split leaves intact unions' power to charge fees to non-members https://t.co/i6mwiro33s\nhttps://t.co/9xYaTH6jC1","date":"Tue Mar 29 14:33:00 +0000 2016","favs":115,"id":{"$numberLong":"714822673574965248"},"retweets":153},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/25ufAFH"}

The flight was scheduled to land in\nCairo. At least 55 passengers were on board.Egyptian passenger Farah el-Dabani\ntold the Dubai-based Al-Arabiyah TV network that the suspect was seated in the\nback of the aircraft and that it was the crew who told passengers that the\nplane was being hijacked. \"There was panic at the beginning, but the crew told\nus to be quiet.

Ten years from now, employers will be covering about 54 percent of those\nunder 65.CBO said part of the shrinkage is attributable to the health care\nlaw: some workers may qualify for Medicaid, which is virtually free to them,\nand certain employers may decide not to offer coverage because a government-\nsubsidized alternative is available. Larger employers would face fines if they\ntake that route. But the agency also noted that employer coverage had been\ndeclining due to rising medical costs well before the health care law was\npassed, and that the trend continues. The CBO also found that more people will\nenroll in Medicaid than previously predicted, though fewer will be covered\nthrough the public insurance marketplaces mandated by the Affordable Care Act.\nThe analysis underscores the view that the health care law is driving the\nnation's gains in insurance coverage, which raises political risks for\nRepublicans who would repeal it._The Associated Press contributed to this\nreport. ___\n\n","title":"ObamaCare may force employers to pull the plug on millions of health plans, CBO report finds | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"RT @foxnewspolitics: ObamaCare may force employers to pull the plug on millions of health plans, report finds https://t.co/xEjOdWY28b https…","date":"Tue Mar 29 11:54:12 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714782709139148800"},"retweets":160},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1UxpFi2"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc9593b"},"content":"  We are now at the point in this political season where everyone is hating on\neveryone else.Think about it: When was the last time you saw a piece or\nwatched a segment in which a candidate was portrayed positively?Presidential\ncampaigns are a tough business where every contender gets roughed up as the\nprice of admission. But the level of vitriol—the pundits against Donald Trump\nand his rivals, and the candidates sliming each other—has spiraled way out of\ncontrol.It hasn’t been Morning in America for a long time. In fact, it’s\npretty close to a dark and stormy midnight.And the hyperspeed news cycle has\nall this unfolding at a head-snapping pace, like an endless feed of Twitter\ntaunts.In the deafening din of the media echo chamber, it sometimes seems like\nthese are the sounds that break through:The latest headlines on the 2016\nelections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage →\\--Donald\nTrump is a fascist threat to our way of life, says racist things and loves to\nattack women over their looks.--Ted Cruz is the most unlikable man in\nWashington, maybe the world, and such a nutty right-winger he’d probably like\nto shut down the government forever.--John Kasich is a cranky spoiler\nimpersonating a nice guy who is staying in the race out of pure ego.--Hillary\nClinton is a deceitful woman who gets on everyone’s nerves, keeps lying about\nher email server and is lucky she’s not in jail.The “war over the wives”\ncontroversy is perhaps the perfect encapsulation of the gutter campaign, with\nTrump blaming Cruz for the posting of a nude magazine photo of his wife, Cruz\nblaming Trump for unsubstantiated mistress allegations in the Enquirer, and\nthe media breathlessly following each twist and tweet.It’s a chicken-and-egg\ngame to assign blame for the campaign’s locker room tone to either the\npoliticians or the journalists. Perhaps it reflects the crude and often mean-\nspirited tone of our culture.  Here, among thousands of possible selections,\nis a sampling. Let’s start with Sunday’s New York Times op-ed page, where\neveryone gets whacked.Ross Douthat, a thoughtful conservative voice, says Ted\nCruz looks like he’s faking it:“The fact that he seems so much like an actor\nhitting his marks fits with the story of how he became Mr. True Conservative\nOutsider in the first place. Basically, he spent years trying to make it in\nWashington on the insider’s track, and hit a wall because too many of the\ninsiders didn’t like him — because his ambition was too naked, his climber’s\nzeal too palpable. So he deliberately switched factions, turning the\nestablishment’s personal disdain into a political asset, and taking his Ivy\nLeague talents to the Tea Party instead.”On such issues as the government\nshutdown over ObamaCare, an exercise in “self-serving cynicism…Cruz has\nproceeded with several fingers in the wind; every time the conservative mood\nhas shifted even a little, he’s shifted quickly too.” He accuses Cruz of first\nbeing obsequious toward Trump, but turning to self-righteousness now that “the\nname-calling and scandal-mongering have been turned against his reputation and\nhis family.”After that, and with a parting shot that “his cynicism can be\nrepellent,” Douthat allows that the hard-working Cruz has earned his standing\nin the primaries.On the liberal side, I have a lot of respect for Nick\nKristof, but in his Times column he buys into an increasingly common myth. The\nheadline is “My Shared Shame: The Media Helped Make Trump”:“Although many of\nus journalists have derided Trump, the truth is that he generally outsmarted\nus (with many exceptions, for there truly have been serious efforts to pin him\ndown and to investigate Trump University and his various business failings).\nHe manipulated television by offering outrageous statements that drew ever\nmore cameras — without facing enough skeptical follow-up questions.“It’s not\nthat we shouldn’t have covered Trump’s craziness, but that we should have\naggressively provided context in the form of fact checks and robust\nexamination of policy proposals.”While the press could always do a better job,\nI’d argue that there has been endless fact-checking and it hasn’t hurt Teflon\nTrump.The second “failure” is that “we wrongly treated Trump as a farce.” Not\nall of us, Nick, but that is especially true among the Huffington Post liberal\ncrowd (though plenty of conservative pundits fell into this trap).But I\nstrongly agree with Kristof’s last point: “We failed to take Trump seriously\nbecause of a third media failing: We were largely oblivious to the pain among\nworking-class Americans and thus didn’t appreciate how much his message\nresonated….We inhabit a middle-class world and don’t adequately cover the part\nof America that is struggling and seething. We spend too much time talking to\nsenators, not enough to the jobless.”Also on the op-ed page, Maureen Dowd\nlooked at President Obama “tangoing into history”—that is, enjoying his trip\nto Argentina and Cuba and failing to reflect the public alarm over the\nBrussels bombings:“Barack Obama started off as a man self-consciously alone on\nstage and that’s how he is exiting. He is, for better and worse, too cool for\nschool. His identity is defined by his desire to rise above the fray.\nUnfortunately, he is in politics, which is the fray…“The president has a\nbristling resistance to what he sees as cheap emotion. (See: flag pin, 2008.)\nThat has led him, time after time, to respond belatedly or bloodlessly in\nmoments when Americans are alarmed, wanting solace and solutions.”Well, how\nabout John Kasich? He hasn’t offended too many people, right?National Review\nEditor Rich Lowry is in the #NeverKasich camp:“This truly is a year when the\nrules don’t apply. If they did, John Kasich would be back in Columbus trying\nto figure out whether he sells his soul to Donald Trump or endorses Ted\nCruz.“Instead, the Ohio governor is still out on the trail running a\ndelusional vanity project masquerading as a presidential campaign. There is no\nappetite for his pragmatic, ‘can’t we all get along’ campaign among\nRepublican-primary voters, who have made that abundantly clear.”Oh, and the\nTimes news section joins the fray by quoting Kasich associates who “recall a\nthree-decade career in government punctuated by scolding confrontations,\nintemperate critiques and undiplomatic remarks.”I could go on and on. Slate\nsays Trump “seeks to destroy people who stand in his way, especially women,\neven if he looks disgusting doing it.”  New York magazine says that\n“unfortunately for Cruz, his logic backfires. Because if real men do not\nattack women, Cruz is fake as hell. In fact, he might be faker than\nTrump.”Maybe, on some level, we get the elections we deserve.This is a reality\nshow campaign in which reality, perhaps in the form of terror attacks,\nsometimes intrudes. It is endlessly entertaining, but often feels like\ntragicomedy with no heroes.__Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host\nof \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc9593d"},"content":"Jacob poses with Dr. Daniel Prevedello, who used an endoscopic endonasal\napproach to extract a tumor that impacted his pituitary gland, and thus his\nhormone function. (Photo courtesy The Ohio State University Wexner Medical\nCenter) Jacob with his family at high school graduation. (The Ohio State\nUniversity Wexner Medical Center)When 17-year-old Jacob Barnes walked into his\nneurosurgeon’s office in January 2012, he didn’t look like a typical boy his\nage. In fact, at 5 feet 2 inches tall and around 145 pounds, and with a smooth\nface he’d never needed to shave, Barnes looked more like he was 11.Growing up,\nhis relatively younger, scrawnier appearance had never bothered him much. But\nwhen Jacob was diagnosed with a rare congenital condition marked by a brain\ntumor on his pituitary gland mere months before, he and his family’s concern\nsurpassed that of a superficial basis.Today, Jacob stands at 6 feet 1 inch\ntall, weighs about 241 pounds and can grow facial hair. After undergoing a\nminimally invasive procedure and regularly taking growth hormones, Jacob is\nhealthy and developmentally back on track.“Now, I just kind of feel normal,”\n21-year-old Jacob, a junior at the University of Findlay, in Findlay, Ohio,\ntold FoxNews.com.**Searching for answers**Barnes was diagnosed with\ncraniopharyngioma in November 2011 after suffering from severe migraines since\nhe was a young boy. The condition is diagnosed most commonly in children and\naffects function of the pituitary gland, which controls water balance, but\nalso all the glands in the body like thyroid hormones, the adrenal glands, and\nsperm and prolactin production. Pea-sized, the pituitary gland is located at\nthe bottom of the brain and the hypothalamus.While vision loss is the most\ncommon early symptom of craniopharymgioma among older people, physical\ndevelopmental delays, extreme thirst and frequent urination usually exhibit\nfirst in younger people with the condition.“All [Jacob’s] hormones were really\nbelow average,” Dr. Daniel Prevedello, an associate professor in the\ndepartment of neurological surgery at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical\nCenter, told FoxNews.com, “so his gland was not working at all.”Prevedello,\nwho heads the center’s Minimally Invasive Cranial Surgery Program and operated\non Jacob, said he sees about five cases of craniopharyngioma a year. Usually,\nthose cases are among children ages 6 to 12.“At that point, you figure out\nthey’re not developing,” Prevedello said. “Most boys will develop at age of\n12, 13, they start having the hair and their voice changes, so when you see\nsomeone at 13, 14 and not developing yet, and at 15 or 16, that’s\nrare.”Jacob’s mom, Deborah Barnes, who lives in Norwalk, Ohio, said migraines\nthroughout youth were the only sign something may have been off with Jacob.\nSometime during grade school, a neurologist gave him a prescription for them,\nbut she couldn’t recall the name of the medication. Jacob was otherwise\nhealthy.“I wasn’t really concerned until his freshman year of high school,”\nDeborah, 59, told FoxNews.com. “He was always shorter than most of the girls,\nand in class pictures he was always in the front row.” Deborah added that\nJacob’s physical developments never impeded on his social life, and that he\nalways had friends. Jacob agreed.“I was never one to be self-conscious about\nhow I looked,” Jacob said.But in his junior year of high school, Jacob began\nhaving unbearable neck pains. One day after school, Deborah recalled him\nsitting on the recliner and crying because the pain was so intense.“I said,\n‘That’s enough, I’m calling someone,’” Deborah remembered.At the time, the\nBarnes family had begun seeing a new physician, who immediately suspected\nsomething was wrong based on Jacob’s appearance relative to his age, and\nreferred them to an endocrinologist. There, he got an MRI that revealed the\n3.4-centimeter-wide brain tumor.“Cancer of course is the first thing you\nthink, and [the endocrinologist] said it’s probably not cancer,’” Deborah\nrecalled from the phone call one night over dinner. “I was pretty upset, and\nI’m sure he was scared.”**Operating by camera**They traveled to Columbus to\nseek treatment at the Cleveland Clinic, where they could have undergone a\ncraniotomy to extract the tumor, which posed a greater risk of compromising\nhis eyesight from contact with the optic nerves, as those nerves are located\ndirectly below the pituitary gland. Performing a craniotomy involves\nsurgically opening the skull and exposing the brain.Doctors at the Cleveland\nClinic referred Jacob to the Ohio Wexner Medical Center, where Prevedello and\nhis team specialize in a minimally invasive procedure called the endoscopic\nendonasal approach, whereby they make a small incision and extract brain tumor\nthrough the nose. Prevedello is one of only a few neurosurgeons worldwide who\nuses this approach.He and an ear, nose and throat (ENT) doctor performed the\n10-hour surgery on Jacob on Feb. 10, 2012. They used a camera, and several\ntools that can pass through the nostrils, including scissors, a suction kit,\ndissectors, a drill and an endoscope, which is akin to a small pen that acts\nlike a microscope and a flashlight. The ENT drives the camera, and Prevedello\nwatches the footage above the patient on a screen at the top of the room as he\nuses his two hands to dissect the tumor.Prevedello said Jacob’s surgery was\nuneventful, and he and the ENT were able to remove the entire tumor. Jacob’s\neyesight, which also had begun to suffer from his diagnosis, was also\nrestored.Jacob was in the hospital for four days and returned to school two\nweeks after he was discharged. He didn’t take painkillers after\nsurgery.Prevedello said the fact Jacob responded well to the growth hormones\nwas lucky and unique because sometimes, if the diagnosis is caught too late,\nindividuals won’t because their bones have already fully developed.**Staying\npositive about Jacob’s future**For now, Jacob attends follow-up appointments\nwith Prevedello once each December, when he gets an MRI and an X-ray of his\nhand to see how his growth platelets are progressing.Because his pituitary\ngland is dead, he must also take about six medications to perform the\nfunctions the gland otherwise would. Those include a steroid for energy and\nimmune support, levothyroxine to assist with thyroid production, desmopressin\nfor diabetes insipidus, and nutropin, an injectable growth hormone.“My\nroommates say, ‘I could never do that!’” Jacob said of the injections, which\nhe self-administers every other day. “I say, ‘You get used to it if you don’t\nhave any options.’ Now, it’s just second nature.”Deborah said Jacob is now\n“mouthier” and “happier” since undergoing the surgery and taking growth\nhormones.“He’s not disrespectful, but he speaks up more,” she said. “He didn’t\nbefore; he was kind of just a quiet kid.”There’s a 30 percent chance the tumor\nwill return even with a successful surgery, Prevedello said. It commonly\nrecurs among young people who take growth hormones.“These tumors have\nreceptors to growth hormones, so if you take the hormones you increase the\nrisk of it coming back,” Prevedello explained.But the Barnes family isn’t\nworried about that just yet.Deborah said despite Jacob’s diagnosis, she\nconsiders their family lucky.“We feel blessed,” she said. “I’ve lost two\nnephews who died at age 31 to diabetes and a nice who died of cancer at 19 …\nif this is the worst thing we go through, I feel blessed.”Jacob said he tries\nnot to let the potential for recurrence weigh on his mind. Plus, he’s too busy\nbeing a typical junior college student—passing his free time with his two\nroommates and playing video games in an on-campus club. He’s also studying\nhard— he’s slated to get his bachelor’s degree in computer science in spring\n2017.“I always like to be optimistic, and I hope it (tumor recurrence) never\nhappens,” Jacob said, \"but if it does, I’ll get it taken care of as easy as\nlast time.”__\n\n","title":"Boy who couldn't age grows taller than 6 feet after innovative surgery | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Boy who couldn't age grows taller than 6 feet after innovative surgery  https://t.co/vZdRPo34y8 via @foxnewshealth https://t.co/ksOnUjS7ST","date":"Tue Mar 29 06:45:09 +0000 2016","favs":156,"id":{"$numberLong":"714704935523192832"},"retweets":60},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1UxhPoz"}

And it’s\nArticle V.”Article V of the Constitution allows a minimum of two-thirds of the\nstates to call for a convention to propose amendments, in turn going around\nCongress. The push to do so has proceeded in fits and starts over the last\nseveral years, driven by a desire for states to debate a range of\nconstitutional changes dealing with everything from campaign finance reform to\nbalanced budgets. So far, six states have signed on — Alabama, Alaska,\nGeorgia, Florida, Indiana and Tennessee. Indiana was the latest to sign on,\napproving a resolution endorsing the effort earlier this month. But organizers\nwould need another 28 to bring their plan to fruition, and call the\nconvention. If they reach that level of support, states would be entering\nuncharted territory.“It has never happened before in the history of the United\nStates,” said Robert Schapiro, dean of Emory University School of Law.In an\nelection cycle that has defied conventional wisdom, though, supporters of a\nconvention of states believe right now may be the very best time to try\nsomething different.“The mood of the public is tired of business as usual,”\nsaid Buzz Brockway, a Republican state representative who sponsored Georgia’s\nconvention of states resolution.Brockway told Fox News he believes such a\nconvention could achieve consensus on such issues as campaign finance reform,\nterm limits and balanced budgets. Even if states fall short of the two-thirds\nsupermajority needed to call for a convention to propose amendments (and the\nthree-quarters required to ratify them), Brockway said the effort itself could\nencourage change.“In the ‘80s, President Reagan actually came out and said he\nwas in favor of a balanced budget convention,” Brockway said. “That spurred\nWashington to act. And they didn’t actually pass a balanced budget amendment,\nbut they came extremely close. So, I think at the worst case, this will spur\nCongress to action. The best case, we’ll have actual amendments that are\nproposed that states can consider.”Schapiro has doubts about how far the\neffort will go.“There have been efforts before to have states call for a\nconstitutional convention. And with regard to certain issues, states have come\nfairly close,” he said. “But, given the divided times which we face, and given\nthe broad brush of these amendments, I think it’s unlikely to garner the kind\nof support that would be necessary actually to reach that two-thirds\nbenchmark.”__Jonathan Serrie joined Fox News Channel (FNC) in April 1999 and\ncurrently serves as a correspondent based in the Atlanta bureau.\n\n","title":"States' rights advocates eye convention to bypass Congress, amend Constitution | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"States' rights advocates eye convention to bypass Congress, amend Constitution https://t.co/bDxW1Ha8Ch via @jonathanserrie @foxnewspolitics","date":"Tue Mar 29 05:16:17 +0000 2016","favs":119,"id":{"$numberLong":"714682571586715648"},"retweets":60},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1SiBwKv"}

When the first water-dwelling creature wriggled\nup onto land about 400 million years ago, it took the first steps down an\nevolutionary path that would eventually lead to a diverse range of tetrapods —\nanimals with backbones and four limbs — that navigate the world in a number of\nways.Now, scientists have discovered a blind cave-dwelling fish that \"walks\"\naround its rocky home, shuffling forward by shifting its pelvis back and forth\nin a way that is unique among fish alive today, but recalls adaptations that\nmay have once allowed ancient fish to transition from water to land, hundreds\nof millions of years ago.This is the first evidence in a living animal that\noffers a real-time glimpse of the mechanisms that may have served as the\nevolutionary foundation for all the different ways that four-limbed animals\nglide, fly, swim, creep and gallop — today, and throughout their evolutionary\nhistory. [Watch: Pelvic 'Boogie' Moves Blind Cavefish] **These hips are made\nfor walkin'**Brooke Flammang, the study's lead author, got her first look at\nthe unusual fish thanks to a colleague across the hall — a cavefish biologist\nwho had recently returned from an expedition to Thailand. Flammang told Live\nScience that Daphne Soares — her co-author of the new study — had captured\nvideo footage of \"this crazy walking behavior\" in one isolated cave\nsystem.\"She just walked into my office and said, 'I have to show you this,'\"\nsaid Flammang, an assistant professor in the Federated Department of\nBiological Sciences at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT). \"And I\ncouldn't believe it. I'd never seen anything like it before.\"The fish, which\nhad no eyes, lived in complete darkness, inhabiting networks of small, fast-\nmoving river systems that flowed over steep and slippery rocks, sometimes at\ndepths of only 0.4 inches. They seemed to shun the still, calm pools of water,\nand were more likely to be found trekking up the steep rocks, Soares had\ndiscovered.Using their pelvises, the fish in the clips generated a rigidly\nrocking momentum that carried them forward through powerful water flows and\nover rocks covered by just a thin layer of water. Their movements — the\ndiagonal opposition, in particular — were reminiscent of how limbs work in\ntetrapods, the study authors wrote. That kind of motion was noticeably\ndifferent from the wriggling that fish such as mudskippers and walking catfish\nuse to move temporarily on land, in which their tails and posteriors do most\nof the work, or the fin-propelled \"walking\" that frogfish and lungfish use\nunderwater.Flammang, who studies how physics interacts with biology in bodies\n— particularly fish bodies — realized right away she was looking at something\nextraordinary. But it wasn't until she was able to analyze computed X-ray\ntomography (CT) scans of the cavefish provided by study co-author Apinun\nSuvarnaraksha at Maejo University in Thailand that she could piece together\nthe structure of the fish's pelvis to understand what it was doing. She used\nthe CT scans to build 3D models of the fish's skeleton. [In Images: The\nExtraordinary Evolution of 'Blind' Cavefish]That's when things really got\ninteresting.**Hippy, hippy shakes** \"If you had shown me these files and\nhadn't told me that it was a fish, I would have immediately assumed it was a\ntetrapod,\" Flammang said, \"because of all the characteristics that is has that\nare specifically good at holding up organisms' weight against the forces of\ngravity.\"Flammang explained that the cavefish had robust pelvic structures and\nstiff supports between their vertebrae that locked the backbones together —\nfeatures common to tetrapods. \"But they're the exact opposite of what you'd\nexpect to find in fish,\" she said, \"because fish need to be able to undulate\ntheir bodies.\"\"When you define what a tetrapod is, one of the characteristics\nthat you use is these interlocking supports among the vertebrae to support\ntheir body weight against gravity,\" Flammang said, \"As well as having a robust\npelvis so that it can transfer forces from the body toward the ground without\ncrumpling.\"**Walk this way**Why the fish are rock-climbing at all is still a\nmystery — for now, at least — though Flammang suggested that they might be\nfollowing a chemical sensory trail related to food or mating. Likely a number\nof factors contributed to this fishy adaptation, Flammang said, but that's one\nof the things that makes studying fish in particular so fascinating.\"Out of\n35,000 species there are so many morphological differences among them that\ngive them some sort of advantage that might be selected for,\" she told Live\nScience. \"You look at their fins — they're all somewhat different, and they\nall do different things with them.\"As far as this particular cavefish is\nconcerned, further studies will investigate the role that its soft tissues —\nthe muscles in particular — play in locomotion, along with its ecology, and\nhow the fish senses and interacts with its environment. And studying a living\nfish that can walk could reveal much to scientists about the earliest stages\nof tetrapod evolution.\"Every time we look at it we see something new,\"\nFlammang said. \"The questions are endless, at this point.\"The findings were\npublished online March 24 in the journal Scientific Reports.__ Copyright 2016\nLiveScience, a Purch company.

(Ashlee\nRezin/Chicago Sun-Times via AP)CHICAGO –  Eddie Johnson didn't apply to become\nChicago's police chief, but his appointment as interim superintendent in line\nfor the top job could address many of the issues facing Mayor Rahm Emanuel and\na city reeling from a police shooting scandal.After firing the previous\nsuperintendent over the shooting, Emanuel has searched for a replacement\nduring a spike in violent crime, low department morale and intensified\nscrutiny of police shootings — in particular the death of Laquan McDonald, a\nblack teen shot 16 times by a white officer. Bypassing three finalists\nrecommended by the police board, the mayor chose an insider who will face\nimmediate pressure to bring about change within a force he's been part of for\n27 years.Johnson was named interim chief Monday and Emanuel has asked him to\napply for the job permanently. He will take over a department criticized for\nlax accountability on police misconduct and a \"code of silence\" culture that\nprotects problem officers.A former commander on the South Side, Johnson is\nblack and a Chicago native, satisfying concerns from some aldermen after two\nconsecutive white superintendents came from outside Chicago. Former colleagues\ncredit Johnson with the ability to unify officers.Johnson said his focus would\nbe rebuilding trust.\"Trust between the police and the people we serve. Trust\nbetween the rank and file and the command staff. Trust between police and\nelected officials and community leaders. And trust among police officers,\" he\nsaid. \"I know the first trust has been broken too often.\"Johnson grew up in\nthe rough Cabrini Green housing project until age 9, when his family moved to\na South Side neighborhood where he still resides. He joined the police\ndepartment in 1988 and held supervisory roles including chief of patrol, where\nhe commanded 8,000 officers.Emanuel said Johnson would both have officers'\nbacks and also hold them accountable.\"He has the command, the character and\nthe capability to lead the department at this critical juncture,\" the mayor\nsaid.The black and Latino caucuses of the City Council said they were pleased\nwith Johnson's selection, but some community leaders raised questions about\nthe choice and criticized Emanuel for sidestepping the finalists.The Revs.\nJesse Jackson and Ira Acree said the mayor's actions undermined the police\nboard. Emanuel won a tough re-election bid last year — in which black and\nLatino votes were key — after vowing to take community concerns into account\nmore. Emanuel has also been accused of a cover-up in the McDonald case for\nreleasing police video of the shooting the video only after a judge ordered\nit.\"You would think that in the aftermath of the Laquan McDonald police\nscandal, that Mayor Emanuel would have learned his lesson and honored his\npledge of giving Chicago ultimate transparency in the pursuit of rebuilding\npublic trust,\" Acree said.Jackson said the police department culture needs\nchanging and the way an insider was chosen \"complicates and compounds the\ncrisis.\"Emanuel, criticized during his five years in office for not always\nlistening to the public, defended his approach as the result of spending\nmonths gathering community input. Johnson said he was best equipped to make\nchanges, and welcomed outside help, including a pending investigation by the\nU.S. Justice Department.\"Because I'm an insider I can fix things from the\ninside out as opposed to coming from the outside and having to fix it from the\noutside in,\" he said.Retired officer Bruce Rottner called the appointment a\n\"brilliant move.\" He worked with Johnson when an off-duty officer was fatally\nshot in 2010. Rottner said Johnson was calm, knowledgeable and had officers'\nrespect. However he said it will hard to change the \"code of silence.\"\"Can he\nhave an impact on that wall of silence? ... To some degree he can, but just to\nsome degree,\" he said.The announcement comes days after the black and Latino\ncaucuses called on Emanuel to seek a minority and someone from within the\ndepartment. The Black Caucus stopped short of endorsing Eugene Williams, a\nblack deputy chief in Chicago who was a finalist.Caucus chairman Alderman\nRoderick Sawyer said he didn't lobby exclusively for Johnson, but believed the\nselection signified that Emanuel heard their concerns.\"I believe he thought\nthe qualities (we wanted) made sense, and maybe he picked somebody who fit\nthose qualities,\" he said Monday.Latino Caucus members had been upset that\ninterim Superintendent John Escalante, who was named to the post after Garry\nMcCarthy was fired and applied for the permanent post, wasn't a finalist.A\ncity ordinance allows Emanuel to appoint an interim chief and ask the board\nfor new finalists. Police Board President Lori Lightfoot said Monday it had no\ncomment on Emanuel's moves but would convene as soon as possible to \"decide\nappropriate next steps.\"__\n\n","title":"Chicago mayor names interim top cop with eye on challenges | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Chicago mayor names interim top cop with eye on challenges https://t.co/SjwNsV3xlV https://t.co/XZ2na7h4Hb","date":"Tue Mar 29 04:55:02 +0000 2016","favs":59,"id":{"$numberLong":"714677223467319296"},"retweets":56},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1Ss93nY"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc95949"},"content":"  SACRAMENTO, Calif. –  Gov. Jerry Brown joined fellow Democrats and labor\nleaders Monday in touting California's proposal to gradually lift the minimum\nwage to $15 an hour as an answer to the growing challenge of income\ndisparity.\"It's a matter of economic justice, it makes sense, and will help\nour entire state do much better for its citizens,\" the Democratic governor\nsaid.Under the proposal, the state's minimum wage would reach $15 an hour by\nJanuary 2022, rising in increments starting with a boost from $10 to $10.50 on\nJan 1, 2017. Businesses with 25 or fewer employees would have an extra year to\ncomply, and the governor could delay annual increases in times of budgetary or\neconomic downturns.Wages would increase to keep up with inflation after\n2023.The increases would benefit 5.6 million workers — 32 percent of the\nstatewide workforce, said Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, D-Los\nAngeles. He called it a \"staggering statistic.\"  \"In the wealthiest state in\nthe wealthiest nation on Earth, no one, no one who works fulltime should be\nforced to live in poverty,\" de Leon said. \"Wages have stagnated for decades\nwhile consumer costs, corporate profits and executive bonuses have\nskyrocketed.\"Lawmakers in the Assembly and Senate could send the bill to\nBrown's desk as early as Thursday, said Sen. Mark Leno, D-San Francisco. They\nwill amend the new version onto Leno's SB3, a less-sweeping minimum wage bill\nthat cleared the Senate last year but stalled in an Assembly committee.The\nbill needs a majority of votes to pass the Legislature, and Democrats control\nboth chambers.The National Federation of Independent Business warned against\nadding to what it called an already onerous burden on small businesses. The\ngroup's California arm said a 50 percent boost in the minimum wage would\nfurther harm the state's already poor business reputation.Assembly Minority\nLeader Chad Mayes, R-Yucca Valley, said in a statement that the move could\nactually harm the communities it is designed to assist by adding to the\noverall cost of living. That may make \"the California dream even less\nattainable for our middle class and low-income families,\" he said.Brown said\nhe thinks business will have little choice and must eventually accept the\nproposed legislation, if only because it is more conservative than\nalternatives pushed by labor organizations.Legislative approval of a minimum-\nwage package would avoid taking the issue to the ballot. One union-backed\ninitiative has already qualified for the ballot, and a second, competing\nmeasure is also trying to qualify.At $10 an hour, California already has one\nof the highest minimum wages in the nation along with Massachusetts. Only\nWashington, D.C., at $10.50 per hour is higher. The hike to $15 in California\nwould make it the highest statewide wage in the nation by far, though raises\nare in the works in other states that might change by the time the plateau is\nreached in 2022.__\n\n","title":"California Gov.

On Monday, Weaver said the campaign was\n“disappointed” Clinton’s team has yet to agree.The latest headlines on the\n2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage\n→Meanwhile, Weaver claimed grassroots fundraising has collected another $4\nmillion since Saturday’s caucus victories which he said would “give us the\nresources to compete in Wisconsin.”Sanders, despite his success over the\nweekend in Washington state and other contests, nevertheless faces the same\nreality he did a week earlier. Clinton maintains a comfortable lead in pledged\ndelegates. And when superdelegates, or party insiders who can back whomever\nthey want, are factored in, the former secretary of state is pulling within\nsight of clinching the nomination.Speaking with The Washington Post, Clinton\ncampaign chairman John Podesta said they “intend to win this thing with a\nmajority of pledged delegates” and -- amid signs that the Sanders campaign may\ncrank up its attacks -- said the senator will have to decide “what kind of\ncampaign he wants to run.”The latest delegate count shows Clinton with a grand\ntotal of 1,712 and Sanders with 1,004.In terms of pledged delegates only,\nClinton has 1,243 to Sanders’ 975. It takes 2,383 to clinch the\nnomination.Sanders’ best shot may be to close the pledged delegate gap just\nenough to try to persuade superdelegates to switch allegiances – a strategy he\nhinted at Sunday.Speaking with CNN’s “State of the Union,” Sanders claimed\n“the momentum is with us” and “a lot of these superdelegates may rethink their\nposition with Hillary Clinton.”Sanders senior strategist Tad Devine said\nMonday that there is ongoing communication with superdelegates, though he\nwouldn’t give names. He claimed “dozens” have committed to Sanders but have\nyet to go public.Sanders still would need an incredible surge to get to that\npoint. He notched three convincing, double-digit victories on Saturday in\nWashington state, Hawaii and Alaska. The wins helped him close the delegate\ngap by at least three dozen, with more delegates from the states still to be\nallocated.But continuing the momentum in Wisconsin and then New York would be\ncritical to have a shot in the next big round of contests in late April, when\nseveral Eastern states will be voting.His campaign got a dose of positive news\nMonday regarding the June 7 primary in California.A USC Dornsife/LA Times poll\nshowed Clinton leading Sanders 45-37 percent – representing a much tighter\nrace than it was last September, when Clinton led 42-26 percent.The poll of\n1,500 voters was conducted March 16-23, and had a margin of error of 2.8\npercentage points.On Monday, Devine said despite the campaign’s losses in a\nstreak of contests earlier this month, “We expect to compete in every single\nstate to the end.”_FoxNews.com’s Joseph Weber contributed to this report.___\n\n","title":"Sanders swings for the fences after caucus sweep, makes play for New York | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Sanders swings for the fences after caucus sweep, makes play for New York  https://t.co/A9Dl87RXPs https://t.co/fDfkq1tAhF","date":"Tue Mar 29 03:30:10 +0000 2016","favs":128,"id":{"$numberLong":"714655865853247496"},"retweets":62},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1SrQLDn"}

The\nofficial would not comment on what FBI may have found on the phone as of\nnow.The official would not disclose any details about the method used to\nunlock the phone or the third party that demonstrated this method to FBI, only\nnoting that the third party was outside the government.The FBI is also has not\ndisclosed what information may have been gleaned from the unlocking of the\nphone.\"From the beginning, we objected to the FBI's demand that Apple build a\nbackdoor into the iPhone because we believed it was wrong and would set a\ndangerous precedent,\" Apple said in a statement. \"As a result of the\ngovernment’s dismissal, neither of these occurred. This case should never have\nbeen brought.\"\"We will continue to help law enforcement with their\ninvestigations, as we have done all along, and we will continue to increase\nthe security of our products as the threats and attacks on our data become\nmore frequent and more sophisticated,\" the statement continued. The surprise\ndevelopment also punctured the temporary perception that Apple's security\nmight have been good enough to keep consumers' personal information safe even\nfrom the U.S. government — with the tremendous resources it can expend when it\nwants to uncover something.The FBI used the technique to access data on an\niPhone used by gunman Syed Farook, who died with his wife in a gun battle with\npolice after they killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California, in December.\nU.S. magistrate Sheri Pym of California last month ordered Apple to provide\nthe FBI with software to help it hack into Farook's work-issued iPhone. The\norder touched off a debate pitting digital privacy rights against national\nsecurity concerns.Apple was headed for a courtroom showdown with the\ngovernment last week, until federal prosecutors abruptly asked for a\npostponement so they could test a potential solution that was brought to them\nby an unidentified party the previous weekend.Technical experts had said there\nmight be a few ways an outsider could gain access to the phone, although the\nFBI had insisted repeatedly until then that only Apple had the ability to\noverride the iPhone's security.The case drew international attention and\nhighlighted a growing friction between governments and the tech industry.\nApple and other tech companies have said they feel increasing need to protect\ntheir customers' data from hackers and unfriendly intruders, while police and\nother government authorities have warned that encryption and other data-\nprotection measures are making it more difficult for investigators to track\ncriminals and dangerous extremists.The withdrawal of court process also takes\naway Apple's ability to legally request details on the method the FBI used.\nApple attorneys said last week that they hoped the government would share that\ninformation with them if it proved successful.The encrypted phone was\nprotected by a passcode that included security protocols: a time delay and\nself-destruct feature that erased the phone's data after 10 tries. The two\nfeatures made it impossible for the government to repeatedly and continuously\ntest passcodes in what's known as a brute-force attack.As to whether DOJ will\napply this method to other cases involving locked iPhones, a law enforcement\nofficial said Monday night that FBI is focused on the San Bernardino case and\nthat they could not comment on the possibility of future disclosures at this\ntime. The official added that it would be premature to say anything about\nDOJ’s ability to access other phones through this method at this point, only\nadding that FBI knows that it works on the iPhone 5C that belonged to the San\nBernardino gunman which was running iOS 9.On working with Apple going forward,\nthe official said that the goal has always been to work cooperatively with\nApple and that DOJ will want to continue to work with Apple in the future _Fox\nNews' Matt Dean and The Associated Press contributed to this report.___\n\n","title":"FBI breaks into San Bernardino gunman's iPhone without Apple's help, ending court case | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"FBI breaks into San Bernardino gunman's iPhone without Apple's help, ending court case  https://t.co/29zhlEnlXh https://t.co/AjuCR4LEJU","date":"Tue Mar 29 03:05:04 +0000 2016","favs":620,"id":{"$numberLong":"714649550271610881"},"retweets":306},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1SrVAfT"}

The police chief said “no\nofficers were injured.”“There is no reason to believe that this is anything\nmore than a criminal act,” he said.The chief’s brief comments helped bring\nsome measure of clarity to the confusion on Capitol Hill, two hours after\nreports first surfaced of shots being fired – all occurring a week after the\nBrussels terror attack put major cities around the world on high alert.The\nchief said the suspect was transported to the hospital and is undergoing\nsurgery. “His condition is unknown at this time,” he said.Fox News is told the\nsuspect has been identified as Larry Dawson. Officials said he is known to law\nenforcement, and Verderosa said he’s frequented the Capitol grounds\nbefore.Capitol Police later identified the suspect as Dawson. He was charged\nwith assault with a deadly weapon and assault on a police officer while\narmed.Dawson, 56, of Antioch, Tenn., was arrested in October following an\noutburst in the House chamber, and a stay-away order was issued, officials\ntold Fox News. A bench warrant was issued for his arrest after he was to\nreturn to court in November, but did not show up.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc95955"},"content":"  The deadly toll of terrorism around the globe has jumped nearly 800 percent\nin the past five years, according to an exhaustive new report that blames the\nalarming expansion of Islamist groups across the Middle East and Africa. The\nnonprofit Investigative Project on Terrorism found that an average of nearly\n30,000 people per year have been killed by terrorists since 2010, when\nterrorism's death toll was 3,284. The authors of the study, which tabulated\nthe numbers through the end of 2015, say that the exponential increase shows\ntwo troubling trends: More attacks are happening, and they tend to be deadlier\nthan ever.“Everyone has known that terrorist attacks have generally been\nincreasing yearly since 9/11,” Steven Emerson, executive director of IPT,\ntells FoxNews.com. “But the magnitude of the increase of the attacks surprised\nus, especially in the past five years. Even if you look back at the annual\nreports issued by the most senior analysts in the top five intelligence and\ncounter-terrorism agencies, there is not one report that predicted or\nforecasted that we would likely see such a massive escalation of\nattacks.”“It’s clear that they are they [terror groups] are focused in in the\nMiddle East and in Africa...And it’s in many of the countries where the U.S.\nhas been involved. They have all become failed states.” - Former House\nIntelligence Committee Chairman Pete HoekstraThe study says that the rise is\ndue, in part, to the fact that Islamist terror groups are operating in more\ncountries than ever, especially in the Middle East and Africa. ISIS, which\nsplit from Al Qaeda in early 2014, now has a presence or affiliation in\nseveral Middle Eastern countries, Africa and Southeast Asia.In addition to\nISIS, groups like Boko Haram in Nigeria and Al Shabaab in Somalia have been on\nthe rise in the last few years. The Taliban has been resurgent in Afghanistan\nand Pakistan, where it took responsibility for Sunday's Easter attack on\nChristians in Lahore; Kurdish-affiliated groups have been blamed for bombings\nin Turkey; Palestinian terrorists have waged at least two uprisings in Israel\nand Al Qaeda has continued to be active in Syria and Yemen, among other\nlocations.The study says that the rise is due, in part, to the fact that\nIslamist terror groups are operating in more countries than ever, especially\nin the Middle East and Africa. ISIS, now has a presence or affiliation in\nseveral countries. The terror groups, particularly those in the Middle East,\nhave new access to deadlier weapons, which they have used to destabilize\ngovernments and terrorize citizens, said Emerson.He cited the descent of Libya\nand Syria into civil war and the willingness of Iran, Russia, North Korea and\nQatar to provide arms to terrorist groups as reasons for the increased potency\nof terror attacks.IPT's report used data collected by the University of\nMaryland’s Global Terrorism Database. Looking at various intervals following\nthe 9/11 attacks, and sorting out deaths caused by clear acts of terrorism --\nnot simply war involving known terrorist groups -- IPT found annual terror\ndeaths have jumped 774 percent since the 2007-11 average.‘[The numbers] are\nstriking when you take into account where the numbers were at the beginning\nperiod,” said Pete Hoekstra, who chaired the House Intelligence Committee when\nhe represented Michigan in the U.S. Congress. \"I don’t think people have\ngrasped how significant these [death toll] numbers are.\"Hoekstra, an IPT\nfellow, helped the IPT analyze data from four separate time periods, between\n2001-2015. From 2001-2006, there was an annual average of 2,508 terror\nfatalities around the world. That number rose to 3,284 between 2007 and 2011.\nDuring 2012-2013, the annual average tripled to 9,537, and, in the past two\nyears, that number tripled again, raising the death toll to a staggering\n28,708 per year, making it the current annual average.Crowds gather in the\nwake of the Belgium terror attacks for a public memorial. (Samantha Hunt\nPhotography - Fox News) The U.S. has had success fighting individual terror\ngroups, including Al Qaeda, but when one is suppressed, others rise, said\nEmerson. What is needed is a comprehensive approach targeting the ideology, he\nsaid.“There has never been a U.S. or allied strategy to go after radical\nIslam,” Emerson said. “There have been, however, strategies to go after\nspecific groups like Al Qaeda or AQAP or ISIS. But these are all subsets of\nradical Islam.”The IPT analysis shows that the growth in terror-related murder\nis not only attributable to the emergence of ISIS, but also to a wider theater\nof operations for terror groups overall. While the Islamic State is\nresponsible for at least 10,780 deaths since 2013, the rise of other extremist\ngroups like Boko Haram and Al Shabbab in Africa has accounted for tens of\nthousands of terror deaths in the past five years.“It’s clear that they\n[terror groups] are focused in the Middle East and in Africa,” Hoekstra said.\n“And it’s in many of the countries where the U.S. has been involved. They have\nall become failed states.”Members of a civil society group light candles\nduring a vigil for the victims of the Lahore suicide bombing, in Karachi,\nPakistan. (AP Photo/Shakil Adil) Alarmingly, IPT expects the wave of terror to\ncontinue to grow in 2016 and beyond. Analysts see continued violence in the\ntrouble spots throughout Africa and the Middle East, with conflict spilling\nover into Jordan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon.They also predict that Asia\nwill see more terror attacks as countries like Thailand, The Philippines and\nIndia are perceived as soft targets, and that due to the migrant crisis,\nviolence in Europe will increase over the next two years as extremists\ncontinue to exploit the immigration system throughout the EU.Ironically,\nsuccess in Iraq and Syria could lead to an expansion of ISIS' footprint, he\nsaid.“With ISIS losing large swaths of territory as well as key commanders,\nits center of operational gravity definitely appears to be shifting to Europe,\nwhere it can recruit among the more than 30 million Muslims who live in\nEurope,\" Emerson said.“Add to this mix the fact that thousands of mosques in\nEurope are controlled by Salfists, Wahabists and the Muslim Brotherhood –\nwhich indoctrinate their followers,\" he said, \"and you have a future recipe\nfor a massive increase in Islamist terrorist violence.”__Perry Chiaramonte is\na reporter for FoxNews.com.

It features a lifted\nsuspension, huge wheel arch extensions, air intake snorkel, heat-extractor\nstyle hood, off-road front bumper with integrated skid plate and winch,\nsafari-style light bar and roof rack, and aggressive off-road tires, including\na spare mounted in the bed. (Chevy)Underneath all of that appears to be a\npreview for an update for the standard global version of the Colorado, which\ndiffers in many ways from the model sold in the United States. Ours is more\nrobust, and trades rectangular wheel arches for the overseas version’s actual\narches, among other changes.Nevertheless, Chevy is expected to introduce a\nhardcore off-road ZR2 version of the Colorado here soon, and the Xtreme may\noffer some hints about what it will look like. Recent spy photos showed Chevy\nengineers out testing a high-riding, camouflaged Colorado with a bumper design\nsimilar to the Xtreme’s. (Chevy)As for the Trailblazer, it’s true! Chevy still\nsells the model in foreign markets. It went on sale in 2012 and is based on\nthe Colorado’s body on frame platform, unlike the unibody Equinox and Traverse\ncrossovers that replaced it here. (Chevy)The Trailblazer Premier gets a\nrefreshed exterior that’s a better fit with the Chevy lineup’s latest style.\nIt looks more upscale than the original design, and is very similar to the\nstyle of Chevy’s domestic SUVs.Hmm.Before it brought the Colorado and GMC\nCanyon back last year, GM was coy about the prospects for selling a midsize\npickup in the United States. Now that the little trucks have been a huge sales\nsuccess, and SUVs are taking over the market again, the question must be\nasked: Will the Trailblazer follow?I recently did just that, and was told by\nGM product chief Mark Ruess that “it’s hard to say.” He insists that truck-\nbased midsize SUVs are a tough sell in the U.S., because they don’t add much\non-road towing capability and get worse fuel economy than crossovers.But what\nabout off-road oriented SUVs?“That’s a different question…maybe we’ll look at\nsomething like that, for sure.”May I suggest a Trailblazer Xtreme.----------\n2016 GMC Canyon Diesel Test Drive\n\n","title":"New Chevy Trailblazer, Colorado concepts revealed | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"New Chevy Trailblazer, Colorado concepts revealed | https://t.co/R6oIjYUUcO https://t.co/CuDSpqsoYU","date":"Mon Mar 28 20:13:28 +0000 2016","favs":149,"id":{"$numberLong":"714545964392919042"},"retweets":58},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1SqH6wI"}

Referring to Obama, he wrote: \"My modest\nsuggestion is that he reflects and doesn't try to develop theories about Cuban\npolitics.\"Obama did not meet with Fidel Castro but met several times with his\nbrother Raul Castro, the current president.Obama's visit was intended to build\nirreversible momentum behind his opening with Cuba and to convince the Cuban\npeople and the Cuban government that a half-century of U.S. attempts to\noverthrow the Communist government had ended.But in his column, titled \"My\nBrother Obama,\" the older Castro all but mocks the U.S. president's efforts.\nHe goes over crucial sections of Obama's speech line by line, engaging in an\nex-post-facto dialogue with the American president with pointed critiques of\nperceived slights and insults, including Obama's failure to give credit to\nindigenous Cubans and Castro's prohibition of racial segregation after coming\nto power in 1959.“Obama delivered a speech in which he used the most honeyed\nwords to say: ‘It's high time to forget the past, let’s leave the past behind,\nlook to the future, let's look at it together, a future of hope. And it will\nnot be easy, there will be challenges, and to those we will give time; but my\nstay here gives me further hope of what we can do together as friends, as\nfamily, as neighbors, together,’” Castro wrote in Granma, the government’s\nnewspaper.“We were supposed to risk a heart attack upon hearing these words of\nthe President of the United States. After a merciless blockade that has lasted\nalmost 60 years? And those who have died in the mercenary attacks on Cuban\nships and ports, an airliner full of passengers detonated in midair, mercenary\ninvasions, multiple acts of violence and force?’ Castro wrote.He added:\n“Nobody should be under the illusion that the people from this noble and\nselfless country will renounce to the glory and the rights, and to the\nspiritual wealth it has earned with the development of education, science and\nculture.”He ends with a dig at the Obama administration's drive to increase\nbusiness ties with Cuba. The Obama administration says re-establishing\neconomic ties with the U.S. will be a boon for Cuba, whose centrally planned\neconomy has struggled to escape from over-dependence on imports and a chronic\nshortage of hard currency.“I warn you that we are capable of producing the\nfood and material wealth we need with the effort and intelligence of our\npeople.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc9595c"},"content":"  Twenty-seven years ago, Iran’s Ayatollah Khomeini called for the death of a\nBritish author, giving new fame to Salman Rushdie and infamy to the term\n“fatwa.”Rushdie, whose “The Satanic Verses” had been deemed offensive to\nMuslims, remains threatened by the Islamic decree, but six American women who\nlack the resources of a best-selling author also have been marked for death by\nMuslim leaders. Some have been driven from their homes and jobs and even\nforced to live the rest of their lives in hiding, with little hope that the\nfatwa will be lifted.“It is not safe, of course, not even in the West, for\nanyone who has a fatwa of death issued against them,” Nonie Darwish told\nFoxNews.com.“I just look over my shoulder in the parking lot.”- Raheel Raza,\nsubject of fatwaDarwish, an Egyptian-born U.S. citizen who was born Muslim and\nlater converted to Christianity, spoke out against radical Islam following the\n9/11 attacks. She has since been the subject of multiple fatwas issued by\nvarious Islamic clerics. Like others who bear a price on their heads, Darwish\nstays below the radar, and constantly looks over her shoulder.“There are\nconstant attempts to silence us by many Islamic organizations,” she said. “We\nare the No. 1 target of jihadists and ISIS sympathizers who are now in all 50\nstates.”Ayaa Hirsi Ali has lived under a fatwa for years for speaking out\nagainst abuses of women in Muslim society. (Reuters) Darwish is cut off from\nher family in Egypt, which disapproved of her decision to speak out. She has\npublished several books, including “The Devil We Don’t Know: The Dark Side of\nRevolutions in the Middle East,” and is the founder and president of “Arabs\nfor Israel.”Molly Norris was a respected newspaper cartoonist in 2010, when\nComedy Central censored a “South Park” episode that featured the prophet of\nIslam, Muhammad, amid outrage from extremists. Norris fought back with free\nspeech, but it cost her her career.Norris drew a cartoon of the religious\nfigure, whom Islamist scholars believe must never be portrayed, on various\nitems such as a teacup, a thimble and a domino. Her work was never formally\npublished, but images went viral on the Internet and helped promote “Everybody\nDraw Muhammad Day.”Suddenly, Norris was deluged with death threats.\nInfluential U.S.-born Muslim cleric Anwar Al-Awlaki issued a fatwa calling for\nher death a year before he was killed by a U.S drone strike in Yemen.Raza\nadmits looking over her shoulder, but tries not to live in fear.\n(HonorDiaries.com) Former FBI counter-terrorism agent David Gomez, who handled\nNorris’ case from the Seattle field office at the time, told FoxNews.com that\nthe bureau advised Norris of the “very legitimate” threats against her. The\nbureau stopped short of telling Gomez to go underground, but advised her to\ntake certain precautions, including changing her appearance.Norris opted to\ndisappear, leaving her job and home and cutting off communication with friends\nand neighbors.“Molly really took the advice to heart,” Gomez said. “She really\nwent dark.”A source told FoxNews.com that Norris is alive and living a new,\nquiet life in an undisclosed location and that the decision to completely\ndisappear was spurred by fear for the lives of her loved ones. However, many\nargue she was hardly given a choice.Nonie Darwish was marked for death after\nconverting to Christianity and speaking out against violence within Islam.\n“People are shocked to realize a journalist inside the U.S. could be forced\ninto hiding by radical Islam,” said author Larry Kelley, founder of the Free\nMolly Norris Foundation. “This issue is a really big one as far as our\nfreedoms are concerned.Kelley’s foundation has raised an undisclosed sum and\nhopes to give it to Norris to help her get by, but hasn’t been able to get in\ntouch with her.And the fatwa against Norris has not faded. She was again\nspotlighted three years ago in Al Qaeda’s “Inspire” magazine on its “Wanted:\nDead or Alive for Crimes Against Islam” list alongside the likes of Rushdie\nand French cartoonist Stephane Charbonnier, known for his irreverent drawings\nof Muhammad.The fatwa against Charbonnier ended Jan. 7, 2015, when two Muslim\nfanatics stormed the offices of his employer, the satirical magazine Charlie\nHebdo, and killed him and 11 others.  If Norris had thought about resurfacing,\nthe attack surely gave her new pause.“I do hope she is okay,” said Mark\nBaumgarten, Norris’ old editor at Seattle Weekly. “But I have no way of\nknowing.”Fatwas are not empty threats, according to experts. Many subjects in\naddition to Charbonnier have been killed by fanatics who believe they win\neternal favor by making good on the threats. Egyptian academic  Forag Foda,\nwho wrote in defense of secularism and Western values, was assassinated in\n1992 after a fatwa from Sheikh Gad al-Haq Ali Gad al-Haq, who at the time was\nthe Grand Imam of al-Azhar, Egypt’s highest authority in Sunni Islamic thought\nand Islamic jurisprudence.After the order went out against Rushdie, the\nBritish-Indian author hired armed guards, traveled under a phony name, wore\ndisguises and rarely saw his own son. Stores that sold his books were burned\nand the Japanese translator of “The Satanic Verses” was murdered.Ayatollah\nRuhollah Khomeini died in 1989, but his fatwa against Rushdie did not.\n(Reuters) Just last month, 40 state-run Iranian media outlets added a reported\n$600,000 to the near $4 million bounty for Rushdie’s head and renewed calls\nfor his death.“Depending on the issue, a fatwa could be permanent or\ntemporary. In the case of established principles like respecting prophet, it\nis permanent,” Daniel Akbari, an Islamic scholar and Shariah-certified lawyer\nfor the Supreme Court of Iran, now an adjunct professor of law at St. Mary’s\nUniversity in Texas, told FoxNews.com. “Going underground and living secretly\nis the first step the targets of fatwa take to avoid the life-threatening\ndanger that could even threaten the life of their families.

But in recent times, less respected scholars and figures with\nless credibility and followers have begun issuing fatwas.Pamela Geller, co-\nfounder of the controversial anti-Muslim extremist American Freedom Defense\nInitiative, is believed to have been the target of two men who tried to storm\na “Draw Muhammad” cartoon competition in Garland, Texas, last year. She had\nalready been threatened with death from various Islamist groups, including\nISIS.Geller has defiantly lived under Islamist death threats since at least\n2006, when her blog, Atlas Shrugs, reprinted cartoon images of Muhammad\noriginally published by the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten. Geller organized\na \"Draw the Prophet\" cartoon contest held May 3, 2015, at the same site in\nTexas where a Muslim group had months earlier held a \"Stand With the Prophet\"\nevent.Two Muslim extremists were killed in a shootout with a Garland\nIndependent School District police officer outside the event.Geller is\nbelieved to have been the target of an attack last year in Garland, Texas. “I\nwas their prime target,” Gellar told FoxNews.com. “Muslims have called for my\ndeath and published on Twitter what they think is my home address. Shortly\nafter the Garland event, ISIS issued a formal fatwa calling for my death.”A\nmonth later, a 26-year-old Muslim man, Usaamah Rahim, was killed by Boston\npolice after charging at them with a military knife. After his death, police\nrevealed that Rahim was an ISIS follower who had planned to behead Geller in\nretaliation for her Muhammad art exhibit.Gellar’s strong stance against\nradical Islam has angered more than just Muslims. She was denied entry into\nthe UK in 2013 as “not conducive to the public good” and has been branded a\nbigot by the Southern Poverty Law Center.Geller, who lives in New York City\nunder constant guard, said she will never give up her campaign to warn the\nworld about radical Islam.“I take nothing for granted. I’m aware of the\nrisks,” Geller noted. “But I would rather die standing up than on my\nknees.”Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a Somali-born, Dutch-American, routinely calls for a\nreformation of Islam, asserting that “we cannot get away from the reality that\nthere is something within Islam that inspires, incites and mobilizes millions\nof people to engage in what our president euphemistically calls ‘violent\nextremism.’”In 2004, Ali worked with Dutch filmmaker Theo van Gogh on a highly\ncontentious short movie “Submission” regarding the subjugation of women under\nIslam. Death threats against the pair ran rampant and Van Gogh was soon\nmurdered in the streets of Amsterdam, a note pinned to his body promising that\nAli would be next.Now a fellow at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of\nGovernment, Ali, whose latest book, “Heretic,” was released last year,\ncontinues to rail against what she sees as the injustice of Islam.Theo van\nGogh, the great-grandson of Vincent van Gogh's brother, was killed by a Muslim\nfanatic in 2004 after working with Ali on the short film \"Submission,\" which\ncriticized the treatment of women in Islam. (Reuters) Like Ali, Raheel Raza\nleft her Islamic homeland and discovered freedom in North America. Twenty-\neight years ago, she moved with her husband and two children from Pakistan to\nCanada, where she is an activist for the rights of Muslim women.“I am most\npassionate about human rights and women’s rights in the Muslim world,” the\nKarachi University graduate and author of “Their Jihad, Not My Jihad: A Muslim\nCanadian Woman Speaks Out” said.Her efforts, which include advocating for a\nburka ban, mixed-gender prayers for Muslims and opposiong plans to build a\nMuslim community center near New York’s Ground Zero, have yielded death\nthreats, hate mail and a fatwa.Raza does not have personal bodyguards, and is\nnot provided protection by the Canadian government.“Many people get full-time\nsecurity, but I just leave it in God’s hands to protect me,” she told\nFoxNews.com. “If I allow myself to be afraid I can’t do the work I do, so I\ndon’t wallow in the luxury of fear.“I just look over my shoulder in the\nparking lot,” she said.__\n\n","title":"The women marked for death by Islamic fatwa face threats with fear, courage | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Women marked for death by Islamic fatwa face threats with fear, courage: https://t.co/coNdzN2J5s by @holliesmckay https://t.co/qf4ZXQHhjg","date":"Mon Mar 28 17:44:17 +0000 2016","favs":169,"id":{"$numberLong":"714508422318665728"},"retweets":166},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1ohav1V"}

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci) (AP)Georgia’s Republican governor stunned the\nstate’s religious community Monday by vetoing legislation that would have\nprotected preachers who refuse to perform LGBT marriages. “It’s open season on\npeople of faith in our state,” said State Sen. Josh McKoon, the author of the\n2014 Religious Freedom Restoration Act. “It’s a slap in the face to\nconservatives, to evangelicals and to the broader faith community,” he told\nme.**Click here to join Todd’s American Dispatch: a must-read for\nconservatives! **Gov. Nathan Deal vetoed the bill under tremendous pressure\nfrom major corporations who threatened to take their business out of the state\nshould he side with Georgia’s religious community.“Our actions on HB 757 are\nnot just about protecting the faith-based community or providing a business-\nfriendly climate for job growth in Georgia,” he said. ‘This is about the\ncharacter of our state and the character of its people.”Deal took religious\nleaders to task for questioning his moral convictions and his personal\ncharacter. Nor did he take kindly to business leaders who threatened to leave\nGeorgia.“I do not respond well to insults or threats,” he said.Simply put –\nthe bill would have protected pastors from having to perform same-sex\nmarriages. Faith-based organizations, like Christian schools, would also have\nbeen extended protection from renting its facilities to any organization that\nwas contrary to its beliefs.However, gay rights groups alleged the legislation\nwould have essentially legalized discrimination.“Discrimination and\nintolerance have no place in the 21st century, and any town, city or state\nthat enshrines it into law will not be judged kindly by history or by the\nAmerican public,” Human Rights Campaign President Chad Griffin said in a\nprepared statement.He called the legislation a “deplorable attack on the\nfundamental civil rights of LGBT people.”Sen. McKoon told me the governor’s\ndecision is “very chilling.”“The message being sent is we are not going to\neven extend protection to the houses of worship, to religious schools,” he\nsaid.  “It’s very, very disturbing and disappointing that the governor would\nveto the bill.”It was even more disappointing because this was a watered-down\nversion of the original legislation.“The governor’s office has been all over\nthe place on this issue – from week to week, from day to day,” McKoon said.But\nit became clear Gov. Deal was more interested in protecting the Almighty\nDollar than he was protecting followers of the Almighty.Big-name businesses\nlike Coca-Cola, Netflix, Apple, Time Warner and Marriott demanded the governor\nside with the LGBT community instead of Christians.The National Football\nLeague strongly suggested that Atlanta’s Super Bowl bid might be\njeopardized.Think Progress reported that Marvel Studios and the Walt Disney\nCo. threatened to “take their business elsewhere” should the legislation\nbecome law.Religious groups mounted fierce support for the bill – with the\nGeorgia Baptist Mission Board and the Faith \u0026amp; Freedom Coalition leading\nthe charge.“The governor’s veto subverts the will of the people of Georgia,”\nsaid Timothy Head, executive director of the Faith \u0026amp; Freedom\nCoalition.Robert White, the executive director of the Georgia Baptist Mission\nBoard, said the governor chose to ignore millions of Christians in the\nstate.“The governor and others have knuckled under to the threats of big\nbusiness and the LGBT lobby group,” he told me.White said he believes\nministers will still be protected under federal law – but he felt like state\nlegislation was needed for additional protection.“This puts us in a more\nprecarious position,” he said. “There’s no doubt about it.”Gov. Deal’s veto\nwas an act of political cowardice and political expedience. He betrayed the\ngood Christian people of Georgia and demonstrated once again why voters are so\nfrustrated with the Republican Party.Instead of bending over for big business,\nthe governor should’ve given Disney and all those other anti-Christian\ncorporate bullies the heave-ho.As we say in the South – don’t let the door hit\nya where the Good Lord done split ya.  \n__Todd Starnes is host of Fox News \u0026amp; Commentary, heard on hundreds of\nradio stations.

See Latest\nCoverage →Beijing cynically undervalues its currency, subsidizes production\nand throws up big barriers to competitive U.S. exports. Americans get cheap\ncoffee makers but also lots of unemployment and debts to pay off by selling\nprized assets.Manufacturing finances a good deal of U.S. industrial R\u0026amp;D,\nand trade deficits slice off enough of that spending—and hammer down adult\nlabor force participation— to account for a significant share of the growth\ngap between the Reagan and Obama eras.Prime age men, who once worked in those\ngritty factories, are now offered free health care, food stamps, bogus\ndisability benefits and other government incentives to opt out of working,\nwhile increasingly women take full-time but temporary jobs in health care and\nother parts of the burgeoning service economy.  Those “gigs” increasingly\nrequire sophisticated skills but offer lower wages, fewer benefits and much\nless job security than permanent employment.Sadly, too many men and women\ndon’t qualify for those temp-jobs, thanks to the liberals that run America’s\nlargely government-subsidized and regulated educational establishment.Four in\nten college graduates lack the critical thinking and reasoning skills required\nfor entry level professional or managerial positions, and only about 40\npercent of high school graduates are prepared to do college work in the first\nplace.Big cities are the creative hubs for the new service economy supported\nby continuous breakthroughs in digital technology, medicine and the like.\nHowever, too many workers are stranded in smaller towns that once supported\nfactories. That's because state and local governments have imposed onerous\nland use regulations and employment licensing requirements that push up\napartment rents and make worker relocation and jobs creation more expensive\nand often too difficult to accomplish.Similarly, urban planners have happily\npromoted policies to relocate the working poor to suburban jurisdictions—out\nof sight for the liberal youth culture that dominates the new service economy\nbut where transportation to employment opportunities are prohibitively costly\nand cumbersome.Bernie Sanders—an avowed socialist—and Donald Trump and Ted\nCruz—easily among the most polarizing personalities to run for president in\nrecent memory—have accomplished so much political traction, because Hillary\nClinton, Jeb Bush and the other establishment Republicans so fantastically\nrepresent (or represented) more of the same failed policies.The Clintons are\nagainst free trade now that Hillary is seeking the presidency but they were\namong its most ardent supporters once inside the Oval Office—Bill campaigned\nagainst NAFTA but pushed it through Congress once he was elected, and he\nnegotiated the terribly flawed deal to admit China into the WTO. And Hillary\nremains a champion of incremental statism—she campaigns on a platform of more\ngovernment benefits and business regulations to keep happy her base of\ngovernment-dependent minorities and middle-aged feminists.Establishment GOP\ncandidates are for free trade all the time but for rolling back government\nonly when running for office. George W.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc95966"},"content":"ASHDOD, Israel (AP) –  Scam artists, drug cartels and gangs from around the\nworld have found a new haven for laundering money: China. The country's well-\ndeveloped underground financial networks have caught the attention of foreign\ncriminals who are using China to clean their dirty money and pump it back into\nthe global financial system — largely beyond the reach of Western law\nenforcement, an Associated Press investigation has found.As China globalized,\nsending people and money abroad, so too did its criminal economy. Gangs from\nIsrael and Spain, cannabis dealers from North Africa and cartels from Mexico\nand Colombia have laundered billions in China and Hong Kong, slipping their\nill-gotten gains into the great tides of legitimate trade and finance that\nwash through the region, according to police officials, European and U.S.\ncourt records and intelligence documents reviewed by the AP.Gilbert Chikli, a\nconvicted French-Israeli con man, understands China's allure. He is widely\ncredited with devising a scam so successful that it has inspired a generation\nof copycats. Called the fake CEO, fake president or business email compromise\nscam, the fraud has cost thousands of companies, many of them American, $1.8\nbillion in just over two years, according to the FBI.\"China has become a\nuniversal passageway for all these scams,\" said Chikli. \"Because China today\nis a world power, because it doesn't care about neighboring countries, and\nbecause, overall, China is flipping off other countries in a big way.\"China's\ncentral bank and police refused repeated requests for comment. In a regular\nbriefing with reporters Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei\nsaid \"is not, has not been, nor will be in the future a center of global money\nlaundering.\"Chikli made millions by impersonating top executives and\nintelligence agents and convincing employees at some of the world's largest\ncompanies to transfer money to his bank accounts, according to French legal\ndocuments. He told the AP he laundered 90 percent of that stolen money through\nChina and Hong Kong.\"It's immense,\" he said in an interview at his sleek,\nthree-story home in Ashdod, a port town on the Mediterranean.A French court\nconvicted Chikli last year of defrauding five companies of 6.1 million euros —\nLa Banque Postale, LCL bank, HSBC, Accenture and Thomson, a French technology\ncompany. He was also convicted of attempting to extract over 70 million euros\nfrom at least 33 others, including Barclays, American Express and the company\nthat runs Disneyland Paris. He was sentenced in absentia to seven years in\nprison and fined 1 million euros.Today he remains a wanted man, but lives\nopenly in Israel, where authorities refused to comment on his case. Israel and\nFrance share no bilateral extradition treaty, but Israel has surrendered\nFrench citizens in some cases.Chikli told the AP his preferred method for\nlaundering money was import-export schemes. He would bounce stolen funds to\nfront companies in Hong Kong, then have the cash withdrawn and used to buy\nmerchandise in China. He'd purchase, say, 20 tons of steel, but bribe the\nvendor to give him a receipt for 100 tons. Then he'd sell the goods and send\nthe money to Israel, where the false invoices made the entire sum look like\nlegitimate trading profit.\"Give me the documents and everything is fine,\" he\nsaid.Such trade-based money laundering is a growing concern to U.S.\nauthorities. Three Colombians based in Guangzhou, China, led a global money-\nlaundering network that moved over $5 billion for Spanish and Mexican drug\ncartels, according to a U.S. Justice Department indictment unsealed in\nSeptember. The network allegedly spanned the United States, Colombia, Spain,\nEcuador and Venezuela.Like Chikli, they processed illegal profits through bank\naccounts in Hong Kong and China and cleaned the money by buying merchandise,\noften counterfeit, which they shipped and sold in Colombia and elsewhere,\naccording to the indictment.Chikli insists he no longer runs fake CEO scams,\nbut a new generation of fraudsters is copying his technique. Like Chikli, they\ndirect stolen funds to China and Hong Kong. The FBI traced fake CEO scam\ntransfers to more than 70 different countries. \"At the very top of that list\nis Hong Kong and China,\" Jay Bienkowski, a supervisory special agent with the\nFBI in Washington, said in an interview with the AP prior to his\nretirement.Police believe some of the networks now running fake CEO scams are\ncollaborating with Chinese migrants in Europe to launder money, using a\nversion of the ancient Chinese value transfer system called fei qian (FAY\nch'ien), or flying money. In June, French police busted a similar operation in\na Chinese wholesale district just north of Paris, where merchants are accused\nof laundering money for North African drug dealers.\"Non-Chinese criminal\ngroups committing CEO frauds are sending money to China because Chinese\ncriminal groups in Europe are giving them cash,\" said Igor Angelini, head of\nfinancial intelligence at Europol, the European Union law enforcement agency.\n\"The scale of this phenomenon is quite substantial.\" Chinese authorities\ngenerally have done little to help Western companies targeted in fake CEO\nscams, according to European intelligence documents reviewed by the AP.The\nU.S. State Department, in a report this month, reproached China for lackluster\nperformance on money-laundering investigations. \"U.S. law enforcement agencies\nnote China has not cooperated sufficiently,\" the report said.Europol also has\nno cooperation agreement with China. Once funds land there, they vanish.\"For\nus it's a blind spot,\" said Angelini. \"What happens after that is a black\nhole.\"_Like us on **Facebook**_**  \n**_Follow us on **Twitter **\u0026amp; **Instagram**_\n\n","title":"China becoming money laundering haven for Mexican and Colombian drug cartels | Fox News Latino","twitter":{"body":"RT @foxnewslatino: #China becoming money laundering haven for Mexican and Colombian drug cartels  https://t.co/ABvQRq8985 https://t.co/TIxz…","date":"Mon Mar 28 14:43:16 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714462868205400064"},"retweets":82},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1UwKlXi"}

All rights reserved. This\nmaterial may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed without\npermission.)Facing threats of a massive economic boycott, Georgia Gov. Nathan\nDeal announced Monday he will veto a controversial religious liberty bill that\ncritics describe as anti-gay and supporters describe as necessary to protect\ntheir religious rights.The Republican governor had been under intense pressure\nto veto the religious liberty bill, which would allow faith-based\norganizations to deny services to those who violate their “sincerely held”\nreligious beliefs. It also would let employers retain the right to fire\nemployees not aligned with those beliefs. “I have examined the protections\nthat this bill proposes to provide to the faith-based community and I can find\nno examples of any of those circumstances occurring in our state,” Deal\nsaid.He added, “I do not think that we have to discriminate against anyone to\nprotect the faith-based community in Georgia.”But supporters like state Sen.\nJosh McKoon told FoxNews.com that the fight was “far from over.”“If anyone\nadvised the governor that this would be a way to end the debate, they were\nmistaken,” he said.McKoon hinted that members of the Georgia General Assembly\nmight ask the governor about convening a special session; a three-fifths\nmajority in both the House and Senate would be needed to do so. If lawmakers\ncan reach that threshold, overriding the governor’s veto would require a two-\nthirds majority in each chamber.But in this case, that might be easier said\nthan done.Republicans don’t hold that margin in either the House or the\nSenate, and all Democrats voted against the bill.If Republicans can’t force a\nspecial session, McKoon pledged they would bring up similar legislation next\nyear.“I expected Gov. Deal would be able to step up to the pressure but\nobviously that didn’t happen,” McKoon said, insisting the bill wasn’t\ndiscriminatory but instead “a modest, watered-down compromise.” Deal made his\nannouncement after facing boycott threats from the movie industry, and\nopposition from other influential businesses. In the past week, nearly three-\ndozen actors, directors and studio companies threatened to pull out of\nlucrative projects in Georgia -- a popular filming location dubbed the\n“Hollywood of the South” -- if Deal signed the bill.Coca-Cola and other\nGeorgia companies joined the National Football League urging Deal to reject\nthe proposal.Supporters like Mike Griffin, a pastor and communications\nrepresentative of the Georgia Baptist Mission Board, told FoxNews.com that\nthreats to pull profits from the state are “nothing but fear mongering.” But\nnot everyone is upset with Deal’s decision.Matt McTighe, executive director at\nFreedom for All Americans, commended Deal on “doing the right thing.”“The\ngovernor understands that while our freedom of religion is of critical\nimportance, it doesn’t mean there’s a need for harmful exemptions that can\nlead to discrimination,” he said in a statement. __\n\n","title":"Georgia governor to veto religious liberty bill amid boycott threats | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"RT @foxnewspolitics: BREAKING: Georgia governor vetoes religious liberty bill  https://t.co/N7c9UNFqnK","date":"Mon Mar 28 14:26:01 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"714458526387572736"},"retweets":91},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1SqPbSa"}

I think it is fair to say that they're shocked.”He also suggested the GOP\ncandidates’ rhetoric is calling into question the United States’\n“reliability.\"Kerry, fellow Democrats and others are particularly upset over\nGOP front-runner Donald Trump calling for an end to the U.S. Visa Waiver\nProgram and suggesting so-called “enhanced” interrogation methods like water-\nboarding for terror suspects.Trump, who has never held elected office, also\nsuggested after the recent Paris bombings, which like the deadly Brussels\nattacks have been connected to the Islamic State terror group, that the United\nStates put a temporary ban on Muslim immigrants.   Cruz has criticized Obama’s\nplan to allow tens of thousands more Syrian refugees into the U.S., over\nconcerns about ISIS infiltrators, and suggested stepped-up policing of Muslim\nneighborhoods across America.He repeated those arguments Sunday and again\ncriticized Obama for continuing his diplomatic trip to Cuba and Argentina\nafter the attacks.He said the president while in Cuba was “toasting a\ncommunist dictator who tortures and murders his citizens and who spreads\nterrorism throughout Latin America.”Earlier in the show, House Permanent\nSelect Committee on Intelligence Chairman Rep.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc9596c"},"content":"  When the National Enquirer first published a 2007 story on John Edwards’\n“shocking mistress scandal,” the mainstream media ignored it, in part because\nthe story was weak and the woman wasn’t named. The same thing happened months\nlater when the tabloid said that Edwards had fathered a love child.The media\ncould still act as gatekeepers in that pre-Twitter age. It wasn’t until the\nsummer of 2008, when Enquirer photographers got pictures of Rielle Hunter with\ntheir baby at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, that he admitted the affair--but not\npaternity--on “Nightline.” Then the story exploded.The Enquirer’s rather weak\nstory alleging that Ted Cruz had five extramarital affairs with unnamed women\nunfolded in dramatically different fashion on Friday—both because of the way\nthe media marketplace has been transformed and the way the Texas senator\nhandled it.Few seamy stories, no matter how half-baked, can stay bottled up\nfor long in a culture where anyone can post anything on Twitter, Facebook,\nInstagram or Snapchat—and then have readers demand to know why the press is\ncovering up the alleged scandal.Cruz, therefore, faced a dilemma. By remaining\nsilent, he ran the risk of allowing those who saw the allegations online to\nbelieve he wasn’t contesting them. But by denouncing them as “garbage” in\nfront of the cameras--without being asked--he gave the mainstream media a\ngreen light to run with the story. All they had to do was endlessly replay his\nsound bites.I have reported extensively on the Enquirer over the years. The\nsupermarket tabloid has plenty of excesses, sometimes makes mistakes and\nboasts of paying for information. On the other hand, the paper broke\nsignificant stories about the O.J. Simpson murder case, the first of Tiger\nWoods’ many mistresses, and Charlie Sheen having HIV and claiming he was being\nextorted. And, of course, its reporting on Edwards trying to cover up that he\nhad fathered an out-of-wedlock baby led to a corruption case, which ended\nafter a mistrial.The latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest\nname in politics. See Latest Coverage →But the Cruz piece is an example of a\nclassic Enquirer tactic: sometimes putting out a half-baked story in hopes\nthat sources will come out of the woodwork, attracted by the lure of a big\npayday, and confirm the sleazy details. The piece quoted unnamed “snitches,”\nspoke of \"rumors\" and said \"private investigators\" were looking into these\nrumors without identifying who they worked for. There were also blurred photos\nof the unnamed women.The Cruz allegations were starting to dribble out on\ncable news on Friday morning. MSNBC asked its new contributor Rick Tyler, a\nspokesman fired by Cruz, about the story and Tyler said he didn’t believe it.\nCNN allowed former Cruz aide turned contributor Amanda Carpenter to be\nembarrassed when Boston Herald columnist and Trump supporter Adriana Cohen\ndemanded on air that Carpenter deny having had an affair with her former boss\n(which Carpenter forcefully did). That was terribly unfair and should have\nbeen cut sooner.By denouncing the allegations on camera, Cruz gave the media a\ngreen light to run with the story. That’s a difficult dilemma for politicians\nbecause staying silent might have been viewed as not challenging the\nallegations.Yet Cruz did more than rip the Enquirer story as a “tabloid\nsmear.” He said “it is a smear that has come from Donald Trump and his\nhenchmen.” There is, however, no evidence of that.Trump said in a statement\nthat he “had absolutely nothing to do with it” and “did not know about it.” In\na passive-aggressive postscript, he said that while the tabloid had been\n“right about O.J. Simpson, John Edwards, and many others, I certainly hope\nthey are not right about Lyin’ Ted Cruz.”The Enquirer said in a statement that\nit’s not influenced by anyone other than its editors and reporters. Roger\nStone, a former Trump adviser and the only person quoted on the record—as Cruz\npointed out—accused the senator of lying about him. Trump is friendly with\nDavid Pecker, the parent company’s CEO, and the Enquirer has endorsed him—but\nneither of those things prove any link to the story.Cruz’s charge against\nTrump is the mirror image of the one that Trump hurled against Cruz when a\ntiny anti-Trump PAC spent $300 on an ad featuring that nude GQ picture of his\nwife Melania. The senator has nothing to do with that political action\ncommittee.What the Enquirer story is lacking is any account from a woman\ninvolved, or emails, texts or photos that would support the explosive\nallegations against Cruz. Once, that might have been enough to keep news\norganizations from touching it. But that age is long gone.This game of smear\nand counter-smear has dragged the campaign into the gutter—and the media along\nwith it.__Howard Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\"\n(Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

(AP Photo/Jeff Martin)ATLANTA –  A\nbattle over background checks for Uber drivers at the world's busiest airport\ncomes as cities like Los Angeles and Austin, Texas, consider more thorough\nscreenings to prevent criminals from getting behind the wheel.Uber has\nobjected to the Atlanta airport's plan to use fingerprints to check criminal\nrecords of its drivers, saying its own record checks are sufficient.But the\ndistrict attorney in Uber's hometown of San Francisco has called the ride-\nbooking firm's process \"completely worthless\" since drivers aren't\nfingerprinted.In Houston, city officials say they found that background checks\nwithout fingerprints allow criminals who have been charged with murder, sexual\nassault and other crimes to evade detection in a variety of ways.Atlanta's\ncity council on Wednesday is set to consider the airport's plan for screening\ndrivers for Uber, Lyft and other ride-booking firms when proposed new rules go\nbefore the council's transportation committee.Uber has agreements with more\nthan 50 U.S. airports, none of which require the fingerprint-based background\nchecks being proposed by Atlanta' s airport, the company said in a statement.\nThose airports include major air hubs in Denver; Los Angeles; Memphis,\nTennessee; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Salt Lake City, Utah.But New York\nCity does fingerprint drivers, and the mayor of Los Angeles this month asked\nstate regulators to allow his city to do so as well.Houston, the nation's\nfourth-largest city, was among the first in the nation to require drivers for\nUber and other ride-booking firms to undergo fingerprint-based background\nchecks using the FBI's database. Houston's program began in November 2014, and\ncity officials there say they're far more thorough than any other way of\nchecking someone's criminal past.\"Public safety is our No. 1 priority — that's\nsomething the city of Houston does not compromise on,\" said Lara Cottingham,\nHouston's deputy assistant director of administration and regulatory affairs.\n\"That's the reason we license any vehicle for hire.\"Since Houston's ordinance\nwent into effect, the city's fingerprint-based FBI background checks have\nfound driver applicants who have been charged with murder, sexual assault,\nrobbery and indecent exposure, among other crimes. Those drivers had already\ncleared the commercial background checks used by ride-for-hire companies,\naccording to a city report released this month.Potential drivers can pass\nbackground checks that don't rely on fingerprints simply by using an alias,\nthe report found. For instance, one driver cleared by a company that does\nbackground checks for Uber underwent Houston's fingerprint check, which turned\nup 24 alias names, 10 listed social security numbers and an active arrest\nwarrant, the report states.Companies that perform background checks for ride-\nhailing firms typically seek to identify counties where they've lived in the\npast, then search public records from those places, the report states. But the\nchecks don't search every county, creating \"a huge potential gap where crimes\ngo undetected,\" the report states.\"The FBI provides the only true nationwide\ncheck,\" the report states.Uber has now been operating in Houston for more than\na year, \"and everything we've seen is that the number of drivers getting\nlicenses continues to grow and their business continues to thrive,\" Cottingham\nsaid.However, Uber maintains that Atlanta's plan would add \"substantial,\nadditional bureaucratic barriers for drivers,\" company spokesman Bill Gibbons\nsaid. Atlanta would use the Georgia Department of Driver Services to help\ncheck the backgrounds of potential drivers, though specific details of how\ndrivers would be screened haven't been released.The ride-booking firm Lyft\nalso says Atlanta's proposal would prove difficult.\"While the Hartsfield-\nJackson staff has recognized the benefits Lyft provides, the current plan as\nproposed will make it extremely difficult for Lyft to operate,\" Lyft said in a\nstatement to The Associated Press.The conflict in Atlanta is the latest in a\nseries of disputes Uber has had over its background checks of drivers.In\nDecember 2014, San Francisco District Attorney George Gascón and Los Angeles\nCounty District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced a lawsuit against Uber, partly\nover its background checks.In Los Angeles, \"registered sex offenders, a\nkidnapper, identity thieves, burglars, and a convicted murderer had passed\nUber's 'industry leading' background check,\" the lawsuit states.\"Uber's\nprocess cannot ensure that the information in the background check report is\nactually associated with the applicant since it does not use a unique\nbiometric identifier such as a fingerprint,\" the lawsuit adds.  \n__\n\n","title":"Airport aims to use Uber drivers' fingerprints to check past | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Atlanta airport's plan for background checks on Uber drivers causes controversy https://t.co/uPsnBtjx9n","date":"Mon Mar 28 08:34:58 +0000 2016","favs":86,"id":{"$numberLong":"714370181133250560"},"retweets":54},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1PzNw8p"}

Bernie Sanders won nearly three dozen delegates more than Hillary\nClinton Saturday in sweeping the Alaska, Washington and Hawaii Democratic\npresidential caucuses, but the strong, comeback victories failed to cut\nsubstantially into the front-runner's big lead.Sanders needs to win 67 percent\nof the remaining delegates and uncommitted super-delegates through June to\nclinch the Democratic nomination. And so far he's winning only 37\npercent.There were 162 delegates at stake Saturday -- Washington with 101,\nfollowed by Hawaii with 25 and Alaska with 16.The Vermont senator won 55\ndelegates, compared to 20 for Clinton. However, more will likely be allocated\nto Sanders in several weeks, when the Washington state Democratic Party\nreleases vote shares by district.Still, Clinton still maintains a wide\nadvantage in delegates, winning 1,243 to Sanders' 975 based on primary and\ncaucuses to date.Her lead is even bigger when including super-delegates, or\nparty officials who can back any candidate they wish. Clinton has 1,712 to\nSanders' 1,004, with 2,383 needed to win.   The latest headlines on the 2016\nelections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage →Still,\nSanders sounded optimistic Sunday about his chances.“Our calculations are that\nin fact we can win the pledge delegates,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”\n“We have the momentum. We have won five out of the six last contests in\nlandslide fashion. … And the reason is the issues that we are talking about --\na corrupt campaign finance system, the disappearance of the American middle\nclass, … kids graduating college $50,000 in debt.”To be sure, Sanders had a\ngood Saturday, which he hopes will give him some momentum as the primary-\ncaucus season moves to the Midwest, Northeast, then to the West Coast,\nincluding California with 546 delegates at stake in June.Sanders won Alaska\n81-to-18 percent over Clinton; 68-32 in Hawaii and 73-26 in Washington, with\nall precincts having reported.The self-described democratic socialist on\nSaturday night acknowledged his struggles in earlier contests across the\nSouth, with its strong conservative voting bloc, but struck an optimistic\ntone.\"We knew things were going to improve as we headed west,\" he said at a\nrally in Madison, Wis. \"We are making significant inroads in ... Clinton's\nlead. ... We have a path toward victory.\"The next Democratic and Republican\nprimaries are April 5 in Wisconsin. Other big, upcoming primaries include\nMaryland, Pennsylvania and New York, Clinton’s home state.Sanders is popular\namong younger and more progressive Americans but continues to struggle to\nconnect with Hispanic and African-American voters.He was expected to do well\nin Washington, considering residents of Seattle, the biggest city in the\nPacific Northwest, are among the most liberal in the country and major\ncampaign contributors.He drew more than 10,000 supporters at an outdoor rally\nFriday evening in Seattle. And the state appeared to have a record voter\nturnout, similar to others that have helped keep alive Sanders’ insurgent\ncampaign.Most of Washington’s Democratic leadership endorsed Clinton,\nincluding Gov.

Seager did not know the cause of\ndeath. Harrison's wife of more than 50 years, Linda King Harrison, died last\nfall.The versatile and prolific author completed more than 30 books, most\nrecently the novella collection \"The Ancient Minstrel,\" and was admired\nworldwide. Sometimes likened to Ernest Hemingway for the range and kinds of\nhis interests, he was a hunter and fisherman who savored his time in a cabin\nnear his Michigan hometown, a drinker and Hollywood scriptwriter who was close\nfriends with Jack Nicholson and came to know Sean Connery, Orson Welles and\nWarren Beatty among others. He was a sports writer and a man of extraordinary\nappetite who once polished off a 37-course lunch, a traveler and teller of\ntales, most famously \"Legends of the Fall.\"\"His voice came from the American\nheartland and his deep and abiding love of the American landscape runs through\nhis extraordinary body of work,\" Grove Atlantic publisher and CEO Morgan\nEntrekin said in statement Sunday.Published in 1979, \"Legends of the Fall\" was\na collection of three novellas that featured the title story about Montana\nrancher Col. William Ludlow and his three sons of sharply contrasting\npersonalities and values, the narrative extending from before World War I to\nthe mid-20th century, from San Francisco to Singapore.\"Late in October 1914\nthree brothers rode from Choteau, Montana to Calgary, Alberta to enlist in the\nGreat War,\" reads Harrison's celebrated opening sentence, which author Vance\nBourjaily would praise for establishing \"both the voice and manner of the epic\nstoryteller, who deals in great vistas and vast distances.\"The book was a\nbest-seller, and Harrison worked on the script for an Oscar-nominated 1994\nfilm of the same name starring Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Aidan Quinn.\nHarrison's screenplay credits also included \"Revenge,\" starring Kevin Costner,\nand the Nicholson film \"Wolf.\" But he would liken the unpredictable and nerve\nwracking process to being trapped in a \"shuddering elevator\" and reminded\nhimself of his marginal status by inscribing a putdown by a Hollywood\nexecutive, \"You're just a writer,\" on a piece of paper and taping it above his\ndesk.Harrison could have been a superb character actor, a bearded, burly man\nwith a disfigured left eye and a smoker's rasp who confided that when out in\npublic with Nicholson he was sometimes mistaken for the actor's bodyguard.\nErudite enough to write reviews for The New York Times and to quote Wallace\nStevens from memory, he also had a strong affinity for physical labor and a\nhistory of writing stories for and about men.\"My characters aren't from the\nurban dream-coasts,\" he told The Paris Review in 1986. \"A man is not a foreman\non a dam project because he wants to be macho. That's his job, a job he's\nevolved into.\"How is it macho that I like to hunt and fish? I've been doing it\nsince I was four.\"Harrison had displayed numerous talents before the general\npublic caught on to him. He was an accomplished poet and sports journalist and\na fiction writer with a strong feel for open spaces and the pull and\nconsequences of history. He set many works in the rural north of his native\nMichigan, including the detective novels \"The Great Leader\" and \"The Big\nSeven,\" and used Nebraska as the backdrop for one of his most acclaimed works,\n\"Dalva.\"His other books included a volume of novellas, \"The River Swimmer\";\nthe poetry collections \"Songs of Unreason\" and \"Returning to Earth\"; and a\nmemoir about food, \"The Raw and the Cooked: Adventures of a Roving Gourmand.\"\nHe was voted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2007.Harrison\nmarried Linda King in 1959 and had two daughters.The grandson of farmers, and\nson of an agricultural extension agent, Harrison grew up in small Michigan\ntowns — Grayling, Reed City, Haslett — where he developed a love of books and\na primal bond with the outdoors, \"bone- and marrow-deep.\" He would associate\nhis childhood with simple pleasures and ongoing loss, a general longing for\nsimpler times and the physical handicap of his blind left eye, injured at age\n7 when a neighborhood girl jammed a bottle in his face.In the 1950s and '60s,\nhe drifted between studies at Michigan State University and the \"Beat\" scene\nin Boston, where he met Jack Kerouac, and New York City, where he taught\nbriefly before returning to rural Michigan. In 1965, he debuted as a poet with\n\"Plain Song.\"Life as an outdoorsman inadvertently made him a novelist. In the\nlate 1960s, he slipped off a bank along the Manistee River in Michigan,\ninjured his back, lapsed into a semi-coma and for some two years was forced to\nwear a corset. His close friend Tom McGuane suggested he try a full-length\nwork of fiction since Harrison \"could no longer do anything to avoid it.\"\n(Through McGuane, he would also meet Nicholson, when Harrison visited the set\nof \"The Missouri Breaks,\" a 1976 movie written by McGuane).Harrison's first\nnovel, \"Wolf: A Fake Memoir,\" came out in 1971 and he followed two years later\nwith a work of fiction about the ecology, \"A Good Day to Die.\" But he was\ndevastated by the commercial failure of his novel \"Farmer\" and was so broke he\nrecalled, he couldn't pay his taxes and couldn't fill out a scholarship form\nfor his daughter because he was required to include records from the IRS.His\nturnaround involved a true Hollywood twist. Harrison was visiting his in-laws'\nhome when he came upon the journals of his wife's great-grandfather, a mining\nengineer named William Ludlow, and was inspired to write a story. The\ncompletion of what became \"Legends of the Fall\" was made possible by a $15,000\nloan from Nicholson.\"And now the one-eyed goofy, the black-sheep poet ... has\ninadvertently struck it rich,\" Harrison later wrote of his mid-life success.\n\"After the first full year of this experience I was sitting on the porch of\nour recently remodeled farmhouse, triple the estimated time and expense and a\nthoroughly enervating process, reading the Detroit Free Press and noting that\nI had made more money in the last year than the President of General Motors,\nHarlow Curtis.\"I idly hoped he was happy in his work.\"\n\n","title":"'Legends of the Fall' author Jim Harrison dead at 78 | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"'Legends of the Fall' author Jim Harrison dead at 78  https://t.co/97kyU1ZYCX https://t.co/I6zt79HnDN","date":"Mon Mar 28 05:15:07 +0000 2016","favs":132,"id":{"$numberLong":"714319886604840961"},"retweets":74},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1PyY8UT"}
{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc95975"},"content":"Faster than the Concorde? Will commercial air passengers once again break the\nsound barrier? It's been over 12 years since the last Concorde flight. Since\nthen, there have been no serious attempts to resurrect the idea of supersonic\npassenger jets. Some airplane manufacturers, including Airbus, have been\ntinkering with projects, but nothing has piqued the airline industry’s\ninterest.That could soon change.A small Colorado-based company called Boom has\nannounced plans to build a supersonic jet that could potentially make it to\nthe commercial market.**Why is Boom getting buzz?**There have been plenty of\noutlandish concepts for high speed jets over the past few years. Most require\nsome sort of technology that has not been invented (or at least perfected)\nyet. Boom’s design, however, calls for materials and engines that are already\non the market. It already has all the parts in the garage, so to speak, so it\njust needs to put them together.Because of this, Boom will be able to build a\nprototype very quickly. The company already has planned out some of the\ndetails. The prototype will be a forty-seat jet that will be able to fly at\nMach 2.2 (just shy of 1,500 mph). The Concorde, by the way, could fly at a top\nspeed of Mach 2.04.Boom’s jet will be made of lightweight carbon fiber\ncomposites. This means it will be lighter and therefore more fuel efficient\nthan the gas-guzzling Concorde. The new materials also mean that it will be\nquieter.**Talented designers and major financial backing**Airlines are already\ninterested. According to Boom, the Virgin Group has taken on an option to\npurchase 10 of Boom’s jets when they are ready for commercial production.\nFurthermore, Virgin’s space travel wing, Virgin Galactic, will be assisting\nwith the prototype design.There is plenty of talent connected to the project\nas well. Some of Boom’s chief designers have worked on fighter jets, while\nothers have a wealth of experience designing commercial airliners. The head\naerodynamics expert at Boom has spent a good deal of time working for both\nNASA and Gulfstream.So Boom’s buzz comes from the fact that it is connected to\na large amount of funding, and it has some of the most talented people in the\naircraft design field working on the project.**It's not science fiction**Boom\nCEO Blake Scholl, a pilot and former Amazon.com executive, explains why his\nidea is better than similar supersonic jet projects currently in the works at\nplaces like Airbus and Lockheed Martin: “This isn’t science fiction. (It would\nbe) if I was telling you it was going to go Mach 4 — but, I’m not. We’re not\nusing any technology that doesn’t already exist, it is just putting it\ntogether in the right way. It will still be tested rigorously.”Scholl is also\ntouting the affordability of flying on Boom’s 40-seat jet. He claims that fuel\ncosts and the size of the jet should mean that tickets will cost around\n$5,000, which is roughly the same as a business class fare.

REUTERS/Stephen Lam - RTSBJ3W Apple’s\nnewest tablet is winning over critics with its amazing display and speaker\nsystem but its $599 price tag probably puts it out of reach for cost-conscious\nconsumers.The display on the 9.7-inch iPad Pro is getting plenty of attention,\nafter Apple unveiled it earlier this week. For instance, on paper, Apple's\nnewest tablet has the most advanced iPad display ever – even besting the\n12.9-inch Pro.“The wide…color gamut, with the TrueTone dynamic [display]…and\nthe record low 1.8 percent screen Reflectance are all major innovations for\nTablets and PCs, and presumably for iPhones in the near future,” wrote Raymond\nSoneira, a display expert and president of DisplayMate Technologies, in a\nresearch note about the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. Translation: the display offers\nmore colors, automatically adapts colors and intensity to the surrounding\nenvironment, and reflects much less light (glare) than displays to date.\nOther drool-worthy tech includes a four-speaker system (which, by the way,\nproduces amazing sound on the larger Pro), Apple’s fastest processor, the A9X,\na better camera, support for Apple Pencil, and the option for a Smart\nKeyboard.**Pricing proposition**But pricing may deter some consumers who may\nnot necessarily obsess about the latest TrueTone tech or a tablet with a\n12-megapixel camera. (Tablets, because of their relative bulk compared to\nsmartphones, are not terribly suitable for photo-taking). The new 9.7-inch\niPad Pro starts at $599 for a Wi-Fi only version with 32GB. The older 9.7-inch\niPad Air (Wi-Fi only), on the other hand, is $499 – $100 less – with more\nstorage (64GB). And if you’re okay with 16GB, the Air 2 is only $399.While\nit's standard practice for Apple to offer new iPads at a higher price than an\nolder version, in the past, a new iPad usually debuted at the same starting\nprice that the earlier version debuted at. For example, the iPad Air 2 debuted\nat a starting price of $499. Ditto on the iPad Air when it was introduced.\nThat drove consumers to upgrade because they had a sense that they were\ngetting better technology for the same price.As with past iPad launches,\ndifferences -- other than a higher price -- may be hard to detect for the\naverage consumer.“The 9.7-inch iPad Pro is a whole lot like an iPad Air 2 in\nmany ways. The size, screen resolution, and weight are all identical,” wrote\nArs Technica in an early hands-on review of the new iPad Pro. “Most\nimprovements are hard to spot unless you're looking for them.” Apple is also\nfacing the persistent challenge of shrinking demand for tablets. The company\nsaw a year-over-year decline in shipments of about 25 percent in the fourth\nquarter, according to IDC.There's also the contrast with the pricing strategy\nfor the iPhone SE -- the other high-profile Apple device announced this week.\nFirst-takes and reviews have been raving about the iPhone SE's low price. At a\nstarting price of $399, the iPhone SE is Apple's cheapest new iPhone yet and a\n$150 less than the next cheapest iPhone, the 4.7-inch iPhone 6, despite\noffering more advanced internal technology than the iPhone 6.  __\\+\nFollow**FoxNewsSciTech** on Facebook\n\n","title":"New iPad Pro: Tech tour de force but is it too expensive? | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"New iPad Pro: Tech tour de force but is it too expensive?  https://t.co/CCMwwuiGv1 https://t.co/zn6732fWcI","date":"Mon Mar 28 04:15:01 +0000 2016","favs":90,"id":{"$numberLong":"714304765534928897"},"retweets":27},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1obBnQR"}

(Reuters)Father Bernard Kinvi is humbled by the prospect of winning\na $1 million peace prize for saving hundreds and possibly thousands of Muslims\nand Christians alike from the sectarian violence that grips his nation.He is\nalso amazed that word of his work has gotten around.The Catholic priest from\nthe Central African Republic is one of four finalists of the Aurora Prize for\nAwakening Humanity, an annual award given by humanitarian initiative 100\nLives, which was formed in honor of those who survived the Armenian Genocide\nover a century ago. The prize is given every year to individuals or groups\nthat commit an extraordinary act of humanity.\"It is my duty as a Camilian\npriest who has dedicated his life to the service those who are ill and those\nwho are suffering, even at if it meant risking my own life.”- Father Bernard\nKinvi“It gives me great emotion,” Kinvi told FoxNews.com, speaking in French\nin an email interview. “I work in a remote corner of the Earth. We don’t do\nany advertising, nor do we look for international recognition.“To see my name\namong the finalists of this award that I did not even know existed is for me a\npleasant surprise.”Kinvi, who was born in Togo, started a church and mission\nhospital three years ago in the northwestern town of Bossemptee, just as\nviolence began to engulf the nation. The region had been in turmoil for more\nthan a decade, but fighting between Christian and Muslim extremists exploded\nin 2013.In March of that year, an alliance of Muslim rebel groups called the\nSéléka overthrew the Christian government headed by François Bozizé\nYangouvonda and installed Muslim Michel Djotdia as president.Kinvi says that\nif he wins, he will use the money to continue his work in Bossemptele and\nexpand serivces at his church and hospital. (Human Rights Watch) Six months\nlater, Djotodia disbanded the militias that had helped put him in power, and\nmembers dispersed into the countryside where they began committing mass\natrocities according to a report from Human Rights Watch.The executions, rape,\nand pillaging by the ex- Séléka members led a civil war with the nation's\npopulation, which is 80 percent Christian, to form militias of their own using\nthe name Anti-Balaka to fight the mostly Muslim Séléka. The fighting between\nthe two groups has led to near genocide during the three-year conflict between\nthe two groups.Hundreds of thousands of people have been killed or displaced\nin fighting before and after Bozize's ouster. He sought to return from exile\nand run for election in November, but was barred from doing so.Kinvi is\ncreditd with harboring more than 1,500 refugees, without regard to their\nreligious beliefs, as they fled the violence.“My presence amongst them has\ngiven them refuge,” Kinvi said. “Those who are injured or sick are all treated\nat my hospital. We feed the hungry and we intervene to free those who have\nbeen captured. We visit those who fled and sought refuge in Cameroon to give\nthem moral support and encourage them not to seek vengeance.\"At home, children\ncan now go to school, which gives us a lot of hope for the future,\" he\ncontinued. \"It’s a profound relief for our people.”Kinvi has been threatened\nby Christian militia members for aiding Muslims, many of whom he helped safely\ncross into neighboring Cameroon.“I did not check their religion before helping\nthem,” Kinvi tells FoxNews.com. “I had in front of me human beings whose lives\nwere in danger. It is my duty as a Camilian priest who has dedicated his life\nto the service those who are ill and those who are suffering, even at if it\nmeant risking my own life.”****If Kinvi wins the Aurora Prize, he intends to\nuse the money to continue his work in Bossemptele.“I will be able to purchase\nmore medicine and continue to visit the most remote villages with a mobile\nhospital to treat the most marginalized people,\" he said.But he was quick to\nadd that others in the church are doing similar work.“There are many priests\nand nuns who carry out the same type of work as I do,\" he said. \"Just like me,\nthey work quietly and do not seek recognition.\"Perry Chiaramonte is a reporter\nfor FoxNews.com.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc9597a"},"content":"John Beckingham (second from the left), who used the Freedom Driver and the\nSynCardia temporary Total Artificial Heart (TAH) before getting a heart\ntransplant in October 2015, poses for a photo with his wife, Diane (far\nright), and two Cleveland Clinic nurses. (Photo courtesy the Cleveland Clinic)\nA graphic of the Freedom Driver and the SynCardia temporary TAH. (Photo\ncourtesy SynCardia Systems Inc.) The shell of the Cleveland Clinic's\ncontinuous-flow TAH. (Photo courtesy the Cleveland Clinic)Every 10 minutes,\nsomeone is added to the national transplant waiting list, and every day, 22\npeople on average die waiting for a match, according to the United Network for\nOrgan Sharing. But, thanks to innovations in bioengineering, all of that could\nchange.Conceived nearly 60 years ago, the total artificial heart (TAH) has\nhelped sustain the sickest biventricular failure patients waiting for a\ntransplant. While the design of the primary TAH used today has mostly remained\nstagnant since the ’80s, when it was first implanted in a patient, new models\nand clinical trials may lead to a better device and, one day, a permanent\nsolution.“We are still many years away from that,” Dr. Nader Moazami, director\nof the Cardiac Transplantation and Ventricular Assist Device Therapy Program\nat the Cleveland Clinic, told FoxNews.com of a permanent artificial heart.\n“Although tremendous strides have been made, biocompatibility will always\nremain a challenge.”The longest an individual has lived with the most widely\nused device worldwide, the SynCardia temporary TAH, was nearly four years.But\nnow, Tucson, Arizona-based SynCardia Systems Inc. is conducting a destination\ntherapy study, whereby it’s analyzing whether its TAH could be used as a more\npermanent solution for biventricular failure. The device is truly a “last\nresort” solution for the study’s 19 participants, who do not qualify for a\ndonor heart transplant.At the Cleveland Clinic and the Texas Heart Institute,\nscientists are exploring how continuous-flow total artificial hearts (CFTAH)\nmay suit patients with biventricular failure who aren’t eligible for an organ\ntransplant, or either don’t have access to the SynCardia temporary TAH or are\nineligible to receive it due to its size. The SynCardia temporary TAH can only\nfit in large chest areas. Researchers at the Cleveland Clinic have completed a\nthree-month study on two calves implanted with their CFTAH, which operates\nwithout a diaphragm or valves, and doesn’t require an external driver like the\nSynCardia temporary TAH.“This is very important from a clinical perspective,\nas there is currently no ideal device for patients with severe biventricular\nheart failure,” lead researcher Kiyotaka Fukamachi, a biomedical engineer in\nthe Cleveland Clinic’s Lerner Research Institute Department of Biomedical\nEngineering told FoxNews.com of the study, which was published in the\nSeptember issue of the _Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery_.The\nlack of an ideal solution may explain the discrepancy between the estimated\nnumber of people who could benefit from a TAH and patients with the implant,\nFukamachi said. According to data from the Interagency Registry for\nMechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS), of the upwards of 40\npercent of patients with end-stage heart failure— a majority of which suffer\nfrom biventricular failure— only less than 3 percent receive a TAH.  Although\nthe SynCardia temporary TAH and mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices\nmay be available short-term solutions for these patients, some patients find\nthe TAH’s external driver to be cumbersome, Fukamachi said, and other experts\nsay the MCS options, which include popular ventricular assist devices (VADs),\npose a risk of leading to other health complications.**The shortage of heart\ntransplants and the need for a solution**In the late 1960s, when patients\nbegan receiving heart transplants, supply was relatively high and demand was\nlow, Donald Isaacs, vice president of communications for SynCardia, told\nFoxNews.com. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) estimates about\n4,000 people wait for donor heart transplants each day, while only about 2,300\nhearts are donated.Heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death in the U.S.,\nclaiming more than 611,000 lives in 2015, according to the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention (CDC).Individuals with end-stage heart failure may get\na left ventricular assist device (LVAD), a battery-operated, surgically\nimplanted device that helps the left ventricle— the main pumping chamber of\nthe organ— send blood to the rest of the body. According to the National\nInstitutes of Health (NIH), LVADs are the most common VAD. However, according\nto the Mayo Clinic, LVADs can lead to a number of health complications,\nincluding internal bleeding, infection and blood clots, among other risks.\nAccording to INTERMACS, right heart failure is the primary cause of death in\n4.7 percent of patients with a VD, and 2.8 percent of patients die of\nintractable arrhythmias and 3.4 percent of congestive heart failure while\nusing MCS devices.Cardiac graft failure is the major cause of death among\nheart-transplant patients, encompassing 44 percent of transplant deaths within\nfive years, according to the International Society of Heart Lung\nTransplantation.When implanting a patient with a TAH, surgeons remove the left\nand right heart ventricles, and the four heart valves— just as is done during\na human heart transplant— and replace them with mechanical versions. Cuffs\nattach the artificial heart to the organ’s natural atria. An external driver\n(either portable and carried by the user, or stationary and used in a hospital\nsetting) powers the SynCardia temporary TAH, and is connected to two large\nlines that stem through the skin to help power the TAH.Ninety-six percent of\nimplanted artificial hearts have been the SynCardia temporary TAH or one of\nits direct predecessors, Isaacs said. SynCardia data shows 1,123 patients have\nbeen implanted with its standard 70cc model.John Beckingham, a 58-year-old\nretired contractor in Rochester, N.Y., got a heart transplant at the Cleveland\nClinic on Oct. 7, 2015. He spent six months on the transplant waiting list.\nDuring that time, he used the a stationary hospital driver until he was stable\nenough to move onto the Freedom Driver, which is portable and weighs 40 pounds\ntotal, including a required backup driver and batteries.“[The Freedom Driver]\nreally helped because it made me more mobile,” Beckingham told FoxNews.com.\n“Anytime I wanted, I would get on a vent basically and go for a walk around\nthe floor. I was able to go to Starbucks, get a cup of coffee with my wife,\nand go outside. And compared with sitting in a hospital, that’s\namazing.”**Beyond bridging the gap to heart transplants**The existing\nSynCardia 70cc only fits in large chest areas, out-ruling eligibility for some\nwomen and all children, Isaacs said. But early findings from an ongoing\nSynCardia study of 23 people implanted with a smaller model of the company’s\n50cc version, which pumps 50 milliliters of blood per beat compared with the\n70 milliliters that the 70cc model pumps per beat, may offer promise for women\nand adolescents.SynCardia also has a destination therapy study underway that\nbegan in early 2015, whereby 19 individuals ineligible for a heart transplant\nbegan using the 70cc device as a long-term solution rather than an immediate\nbridge to transplantation.In their 2014 study at the Cleveland Clinic, lead\nstudy author Fukamachi and his team observed success in calves implanted with\nthe CFTAH for three months— the longest this device, which has been in\ndevelopment for about the last seven years, has sustained the animal,\nFukamachi said.“It was very successful— and without any anti-coagulation, or\n[use of] blood thinner or anti-platelet drugs,” Fukamachi told FoxNews.com.\n“That was a very important milestone for us because this shows the potential\nfor the process of development of the continuous-flow total artificial\nheart.”**A permanent solution for heart failure?**Keefe Manning, an associate\nprofessor of biomedical engineering at Penn State University, said for now, he\nthinks TAHs rather than CFTAHs offer the most immediate promise— primarily\nbecause the latter devices are so novel, and, consequently, there’s a lack of\nresearch on them. Manning’s research has focused on the fluid mechanics of the\ncardiovascular system and the impact that artificial devices may have on\nit.“The big question, which no one knows the answer to, is ‘What are the long-\nterm ramifications of continuous flow in the arterial system?” Manning told\nFoxNews.com, “and that, unfortunately, has not yet been determined because\nthere hasn’t been a study to look at that.”Still, he said he thought the TAH\nitself is a “worthwhile endeavor” and that he wished “there was more\ninvestment from the government.”“Everyone talks about tissue engineering a\nheart— that’s a long way away— so there are people that are desperate for this\ntechnology,” Manning said. “I think it has the potential to save a lot of\npeople’s lives, and with donor hearts not really increasing and in fact\ndecreasing, there’s got to be a solution.”__\n\n","title":"Permanent total artificial heart could eliminate the need for transplants | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Permanent total artificial heart could eliminate the need for transplants https://t.co/dEZiZyO41n https://t.co/7ExAQvzABh","date":"Mon Mar 28 03:15:03 +0000 2016","favs":427,"id":{"$numberLong":"714289671044407296"},"retweets":260},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1ZwYCCp"}

She never regained her full speaking ability and had other, less-severe\nstrokes through the years.Bedridden for months, Mother Angelica was placed on\na feeding tube this fall as her health slowly declined, fellow nuns at Our\nLady of the Angels Monastery said in an announcement released in\nNovember.Although she had been out of the public eye for years and was no\nlonger appearing on her trademark \"Mother Angelica Live\" show, old episodes of\nher show have remained a programming staple on Eternal Word.\"We want you to\nknow how much God loves you, and that's a lot,\" she told viewers at the end of\nan episode taped in November 2000.Mother Angelica displayed both deep devotion\nto Jesus and a comic's timing on the episode, drawing laughs when she couldn't\nreach her Bible during the opening sequence. An unseen aide hands her the book\nfrom off camera.\"That's when you appreciate long arms,\" Mother Angelica\ndeadpanned.Mother Angelica was born Rita Rizzo in Canton, Ohio, in 1923. She\nentered the Poor Clares of Perpetual Adoration monastery in Cleveland at age\n21 and joined other nuns in moving South to open a new monastery in Alabama in\n1962.With only $200, the nun began broadcasting a religious talk show from a\nTV studio put together in the monastery garage in suburban Birmingham in 1981.\nThat show grew into Eternal Word Television Network, which has long had the\nblessing of the Vatican.While critics sometimes accuse Eternal Word Television\nNetwork of being too conservative or too liberal, it says it tries to stick to\nthe leadership of the Vatican. The network reports extensively on statements\nand trips by the pope.Despite its humble beginnings, EWTN Global Catholic\nNetwork calls itself the world's largest religious media network. It has 11 TV\nnetworks that broadcast Catholic programming to more than 258 million\nhouseholds in more than 145 counties and territories.Eternal Word's radio\noperation includes a global shortwave broadcast; satellite and Internet radio\nchannels; and more than 300 Catholic radio affiliates in the United States.\nIts print services include The National Catholic Register newspaper, the\nCatholic News Agency and EWTN Publishing Inc.The nonprofit broadcaster\nreported total revenues of $46 million in 2013, the last year for which tax\nrecords are available. Of that, $45.4 million came from donations.An\nassociated catalog division reported revenues of $2.7 million in 2013, mostly\nfrom sales, records show.“We have all lost a friend, a mentor, a spiritual\nmother, a voice of conscience, and a source of laughter and encouragement,”\nsaid Fr. Frank Pavone, National Director of Priests for Life in a statement to\nFox News. “I was able to thank her again personally for all she has done when\nI said Mass in her room just two weeks ago on March 13th and blessed her with\na first class relic of Pope Saint John Paul II.”\"Her voice and her message\nwill be with us for a long time,” Pavone said. “Thanks to the continued growth\nof the media apostolate she founded -- an apostolate in which we eagerly\nparticipate -- people will be able to learn and laugh with Mother Angelica for\nmany years to come. We should all recommit ourselves today to echoing her\nmessages,\" he added. Reverend Robert J. Baker, Bishop of Birmingham in\nAlabama, said in a statement of WBRC-TV, \"Mother Angelica brought the truth\nand the love and the life of the Gospel of Jesus to so many people, not only\nto our Catholic household of faith, but to many thousands of people who are\nnot Catholic, in that beautiful way she had of touching lives, bringing so\nmany people into the Catholic Faith.\"_The Associated Press contributed to this\nreport._**Click for more from WBC-TV.**__\n\n","title":"Mother Angelica, founder of EWTN, dead at 92 | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Mother Angelica, founder of EWTN, dead at 92  https://t.co/31pNuLnQWH https://t.co/0LWv1a1nmx","date":"Mon Mar 28 02:25:04 +0000 2016","favs":636,"id":{"$numberLong":"714277095904452608"},"retweets":369},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1PzubnQ"}

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc95980"},"content":"  Few people in Washington think House Republicans this year will complete a\nbudget.That’s a little astonishing.Republicans have batted around dozens of\nideas. They’ve conducted closed door meetings. Entertained options. And still,\nHouse Republicans aren’t much closer to solving the budget riddle than they\nwere when conversations began over the winter.“The leadership has been on a\nlistening tour for three months,” said Rep. Dave Brat, R-Va. “We have to go\nback to constituents and say we made up for the crap sandwich. Made up for the\nbarn cleaning.”What Brat refers to is a plan President Obama forged last fall\nwith then-House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to “clean the barn” for the next\nspeaker.Both houses of Congress approved the package, and Obama signed it into\nlaw. Only 79 House GOPers voted in favor of the measure in late October --\nincluding new House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.The deal established what’s\ncalled “discretionary” spending numbers for this fiscal year and fiscal 2017,\nwhich begins in October 1.“We are being asked to validate a spending level\nthat the vast majority of Republicans in the House and Senate opposed months\nago,” said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. “Let’s do a budget and spend less money. I\nthink that’s what voters are demanding after what you’ve seen in the\npresidential contest. We make this stuff way too complicated.”A brief dive\ninto the complicated stuff:All federal spending is allocated into two chunks.\n“Mandatory” spending is what the government has to spend on entitlement\nprograms such as Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and interest on the\ndebt.Congress long ago passed laws that put these programs on automatic pilot.\nMandatory spending consumes more than two-thirds of all federal dollars each\nyear. That money just floats out the door without anyone raising a\nfinger.“Discretionary” spending is the rest. It’s discretionary because\nlawmakers have discretion over how much to spend and on what programs.\nDiscretionary dollars account for the remaining third of all annual government\nspending.In Boehner’s barn cleaning, the duo set discretionary spending for\nfiscal 2016 at $1.067 trillion. They raised it for fiscal 2017 to $1.070\ntrillion.But here’s the issue: Congressional conservatives are pushing for $30\nbillion in reforms to mandatory spending programs. That could reduce the\ndiscretionary number to $1.047 trillion. That would make it challenging for\nthe House to approve annual spending bills to fund the government after\nOctober 1.Conservatives have pushed for deep cuts and reductions since\nRepublicans claimed the House in 2010. They made minimal progress in the debt-\nceiling agreement of 2011 that resulted in sequestration -- deep, required\nspending limitations on the discretionary side of the ledger.But the mandatory\nspending side is much larger than the discretionary side. That’s why reforms\nto entitlements make more impact. And conservatives want proof that savings\naren’t fiscal fairy dust.“It needs to be real,” Jordan said.What counts as\n“real?” A plan Obama would in fact sign into law.“That would be pretty real,”\nRep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said when asked about moving a measure that would\nearn the president’s signature.“It’s got to be this year,” said Rep. Tim\nHuelskamp, R-Kansas. “Real cuts that actually get signed into\nlaw.”Conservatives think the GOP-led House has never made good on promises\nlawmakers made to constituents to reduce overall federal spending. Hence,\nthat’s why they want to show they’re making amends for Boehner’s barn\ncleaning.That’s why Republicans can’t cobble together the votes to approve a\nbudget. The Republican brass needs the help of at least some of the 40-plus\nmembers who comprise the House Freedom Caucus. But there will be no budget if\nparty divisions remain this deep.Harley-Davidson stopped manufacturing\nmotorcycle sidecars five years ago. Most bartenders can mix a sidecar cocktail\nwith cognac, Grand Mariner and lemon juice. It’s unclear if House Republican\nleaders are devotees of Easy Rider or experienced mixologists. But if the\nHouse will produce a budget this year, the production of budgetary “sidecars”\nare key to the entire enterprise.“That’s getting warm,” said Brat of the\nsidecar possibilities. “We’re willing to go there.”One sidecar option is for\nthe House to approve a budget for fiscal 2017 at the $1.070 trillion level,\nbut include a separate package that mines $30 billion in cuts from mandatory\nprograms. There is also conversation about approving a budget at a lower\nspending threshold -- with an agreement that Obama would sign actual spending\nbills into law with higher dollar figures.Conservatives feel burned before on\nbroad agreements. It’s customary for policymakers to commit to spending cuts\nbut postpone the hard stuff well into the future.Conservatives want to get\naway from that kind of gimmickry.“We could have $30 billion (in cuts) over ten\nyears with most of the savings in the ninth and tenth years,” said Huelskamp\nwith a smirk, knowing the way Washington usually does things.Notably,\nHuelskamp wasn’t endorsing punting the savings until the out years.The House\nBudget Committee last week approved a budget that balances the books in a\ndecade and slashes spending by $6.5 trillion.Included in that budget is a\nrepeal of ObamaCare. But keep in mind that congressional budgets aren’t\nbinding and not signed into law. They’re aspirational. The panel passed the\nbudget. However, Budget Committee Chairman Tom Price, R-Ga., knew there were\nseveral GOPers who voted yes in committee who would vote no on the budget on\nthe floor. Dave Brat and Rep. Marlin Stutzman, R-Ind., voted no in\ncommittee.There’s a problem with not doing a budget. Failing to agree to an\noverall topline for mandatory and discretionary spending makes it virtually\nimpossible for lawmakers to begin approving annual appropriations bills that\nfund the government.There is a parliamentary failsafe that Ryan could deploy\nto help initiate the appropriations bills. It’s possible the House could\nsimply hook some language to another measure and “deem” that it passed a\nbudget -- even if it really hasn’t.In Congress, “deeming” a budget at least\nstarts the appropriations process. But Ryan is ruling out such a tactic.“No,”\nhe said. “We need to do a budget.”Regardless, the House Appropriations\nCommittee prepared its first spending bill of the year a few days ago.The\ncommittee sketched a plan to spend $81.6 billion on military construction\nprojects and fund the Department of Veterans Affairs. The bill represents $1.2\nbillion less than what Obama requested but is $1.8 billion above what\nlawmakers spent last year.Of course, if the House can’t OK a budget at all --\nor even deem a budget -- it’s likely Congress is stuck and must approve a\ngigantic interim spending bill in September to avoid a government\nshutdown.Only some Republicans would be likely to vote for it. The GOP leaders\nwould probably again turn to Democrats to bail them out.And this is precisely\nwhat got Boehner in trouble with House Republicans: leaning on Democrats all\nthe time to do the tough stuff.A stopgap spending bill means the military\nconstruction/VA measure gets less money -- as do all of the other\nappropriations bills in the big, catchall bill.That’s because not doing a\nbudget and relying on old spending figure kicks the total discretionary figure\nback to what the government is spending this year: $1.067 trillion -- a cut of\n$3 billion.As former House Budget Committee chairman, Ryan is the high priest\nof budgets. He authored multiple fiscal blueprints that Republicans embraced.\nHe chastised Democrats when they failed to produce budgets.This is why Ryan\nand Republicans know why it’s so important to produce a budget and adopt it on\nthe floor. This is all on them. But as speaker, Ryan can only attest to the\nvirtues of budgeting. This fight is internal, Republicans on Republicans.Last\ntime, they blamed Boehner. But he isn’t here anymore.“Once Obama leaves\noffice, there is nobody left to blame,” Huelskamp said.__\n\n","title":"After big promises, House GOP facing reality of not passing budget, and backlash | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"After big promises, House GOP facing reality of not passing budget, and backlash  https://t.co/XaeM692Fiv https://t.co/YbDSQnLej4","date":"Mon Mar 28 00:15:04 +0000 2016","favs":243,"id":{"$numberLong":"714244376709324801"},"retweets":173},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1UvsYpT"}

Five years later, they confirmed it was indeed\nthe Conestoga.Related: Site of 1503 shipwreck tied to Vasco da Gama found off\nOmanModern painting of the USS Conestoga (AT 54) on its final voyage pounding\nthrough large waves during a gale off Southeast Farallon Island in March 1921.\n(Artist Danijel Frka © Russ Matthews Col ) “Thanks to modern science and to\ncooperation between agencies, the fate of Conestoga is no longer a mystery,”\nDennis McGinn, the assistant secretary of the Navy for Energy, Installations\nand Environment, said. “In remembering the loss of the _Conestoga_, we pay\ntribute to her crew and their families, and remember that, even in peacetime,\nthe sea is an unforgiving environment.”Originally built to tow coal barges for\nthe railroad, the Navy purchased Conestoga in 1917 for World War I service.\nThe tug operated on the Atlantic coast and off the Azores, performing convoy\nand other duties before being assigned to harbor service in Norfolk, Virginia,\nin 1919.Ordered to duty in American Samoa, _Conestoga_ steamed from Mare\nIsland Naval Shipyard in California at 3:25 p.m. on March 25, 1921, headed for\nPearl Harbor. After leaving the Golden Gate, the tug, possibly towing a barge,\ndisappeared.Multibeam sonar image of the shipwreck site. ( Fugro/NOAA) While\nthe cause of the disaster remains unresolved, weather appears to be a critical\nfactor.Weather logs around the time of Conestoga’s departure indicated that\nwind in the Golden Gate area almost doubled to 40 miles per hour, and the seas\nwere rough. A garbled radio transmission from Conestoga relayed later by\nanother ship stated the tug was “battling a storm and that the barge she was\ntowing had been torn adrift by heavy seas.”Based on the location and\norientation of the wreck in 189-foot-deep water, NOAA believes _Conestoga_\nsank as officers and crew attempted to reach a protected cove on the\nisland.Related: Civil War-era shipwreck found off North Carolina coastThe\nConestoga’s triple expansion steam engine. ( Photo: NOAA/Teledyne SeaBotix)\n“This would have been a desperate act, as the approach is difficult and the\narea was the setting for five shipwrecks between 1858 and 1907,” according to\nNOAA’s report on the Conestoga discovery. “However, as Conestoga was in\ntrouble and filling with water, it seemingly was the only choice to\nmake.”Video, from cameras mounted on remotely operated vehicles used to\nexplore the wreck site, shows the wreck lying on the seabed and largely\nintact. The size of the wreck and many of its features - the four-bladed,\n12-foot 3-inch diameter propeller; the steam engine and boilers a large steam\ntowing winch with twisted wire on the drum; two porcelain marine heads; and a\nsingle, 3-inch, 50-caliber gun that was mounted on the main deck in front of\nthe pilot house – helped NOAA confirm this was the Conestoga.No human remains,\nhowever, were discovered at the site.   __\\+ Follow**FoxNewsSciTech** on\nFacebook\n\n","title":"Navy tug, lost for nearly a century, found in waters off California | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Navy tug, lost for nearly a century, found in waters off California  https://t.co/iB3qRvJbym via @fxnscitech https://t.co/Zukdh07Mrm","date":"Sun Mar 27 20:45:07 +0000 2016","favs":209,"id":{"$numberLong":"714191543834271746"},"retweets":104},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1ZuS1IO"}

They don’t like to discuss [religion]. They don’t like to\ndebate; I love that stuff. If it wasn't for the fact that my family was under\na close scrutiny I would probably want to run for [political office] someday\nor something.  I am always the one at dinner parties where people are like\n‘don't talk about religion or politics’ and I’m like ‘can we please talk about\nreligion or politics?’ I love debating and I love hearing other perspectives\non everything.”Hart said she is “flabbergasted” by the presidential candidates\nnow.“I am flabbergasted by everything going on…I don’t believe one of them\n(the politicians),” she said. “I am just floored by everything going on and\nhonestly just praying daily for this country and everything going on that the\nright thing happens.”The 39-year-old star also teaches the importance of\nprayer to her sons as she herself learns more about her faith from her Bible\nstudy.“I think [prayer is] really important; I just read recently a scientific\nstudy on prayer how people that do pray and pray avidly tend to have more\npeace of mind,” she said. “I always believed in God… I always understood Jesus\nand believed in him but then questioned a lot about Jesus. I finally realized\nI do believe in Jesus as my Lord and Savior. But recently I discovered the\nHoly Spirit and I think it’s so funny now when people find this ‘meditation’—\nwhich I think is prayer— they think they have an intuition and I’m like that’s\nThe Holy Spirit!”In “God’s Not Dead 2,” Hart plays a history teacher whose\nfaith comes under attack when she responds to a question from a student about\nJesus with scripture. Hart revealed this role was unlike anything she has\ntaken on before.“It was an interesting character for me to play because she is\nnot opposite of me but her personality is very different,” she explained. “It\nwas a challenge but it was really fun to be able to do that—to sit on a set\nand not have to go wild with dialogue and action…but at the same time I do\nrelate to her struggle, while she is faithful she is also wondering ‘where are\nyou God? I need you, don't forsake me.’”But unlike her character, Hart is\ncompletely confident.“I really truly believe in my heart that at the age I am\nat, and what I have seen, and what I have done —raising children— I know who I\nam and I know what I stand for and what I believe in.”“God’s Not Dead 2” hits\ntheaters April 1st.\n\n","title":"Melissa Joan Hart wants to talk about religion and politics | Fox News","twitter":{"body":".@MelissaJoanHart teaches the importance of prayer to her sons. https://t.co/fY4bK3QEls https://t.co/hmXSkB1fMB","date":"Sun Mar 27 19:34:18 +0000 2016","favs":869,"id":{"$numberLong":"714173720311369728"},"retweets":212},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1RQRvPu"}

Watch **Friday March 25 at 10 p.m.\nET**, Saturday, March 26 at 1 a.m., 5 a.m., 5 p.m. and midnight ET._This is a\ntough question to ask on Good Friday: “Is this any way to fight a war?”For\nChristendom, Easter is the holiest of holidays. Yet, graphic images of a mass\nmurder perpetrated by suicidal ISIS terrorists in Brussels, Belgium are\nflashing around the world. More than 30 are dead and hundreds more are\nwounded. Consider the response from the Obama administration:In Cuba, the\npresident of the United States shows his concern by doing “The Wave” at a\nbaseball game beside one of the last two Communist dictators on the planet.\nThen, to ensure we get the point about America leading from behind, he jets\noff to Argentina for tango lessons. It’s not just surreal. It’s\ndangerous.POTUS tells us ISIS isn’t an “existential threat.” In the next\nbreath the O-Team informs us “defeating ISIS” is the president’s “number one\npriority.” That’s a relief. Until now we thought it was the dreaded enemy,\nClimate Change.Unfortunately, all this is a consistent pattern of behavior\nfrom our commander-in-chief – even when ISIS targets Americans. For\nexample:November 2009: Nidal Hasan murders 13 and wounds 30 at Fort Hood. The\nObama administration calls the attack, “workplace violence.”December 2011:\nObama ignores advice from his military commanders and orders all U.S. military\npersonnel out of Iraq. The troops call it “The Obama Bug-Out.” He claims he’s\nfulfilling a campaign pledge because “Iraq is now a stable democracy.” It’s\nanything but.June 2014: The ISIS army, 30,000 strong, swarms out of Syria,\ncapturing broad swaths of Iraq and declares a “Caliphate.” Obama calls ISIS a\n“JV Team,” says it will be “degraded and destroyed” and later tells us ISIS is\n“contained.” It’s none of the above. Instead, more than 25,000 young Muslim\nmen and women from around the globe join ISIS.August 2014: ISIS broadcasts the\nbrutal murder of American journalist James Foley. Our president promises\n“criminals” who perpetrate atrocities like this “will be brought to justice.”\nHe then goes off to play golf. No one is brought to “justice.”July 2015:\nMuhammad Youssef Abdulazeez murders four Marines and a Navy Sailor in\nChattanooga, TN. Our Commander-in-Chief refuses to call the killer a jihadi;\nbut pledges to stop “lone wolf extremists.”December 2015: Syed Farook and his\nwife, Tashfeen Malik murder 14 and wound 22 at a holiday party in San\nBernardino, CA. Mr. Obama calls it a “tragedy” and claims there is “no\nevidence the killers were directed by a terrorist organization overseas.” He\ndoes note the attack is “a reminder of how easy it is for dangerous people to\nobtain guns in this country.\"Barack Obama’s comments in the aftermath of these\nevents indicate he has no grasp of what needs to be done to protect the\nAmerican people from ISIS – or any of the radical Islamist terror\norganizations that have declared war against us.Our enemies aren’t just\n“criminals” or “extremists.” They are radical Islamist jihadis – using “trade-\nnames” like Al Qaeda; ISIS; Al-Shabaab; Jemaah Islamiah; Abu Sayef; Hezbollah;\nHamas and a host of other titles. No matter the sobriquet – these franchises\nfrom hell are one in their goals: force all “Westerners” to withdraw from the\n“Lands of the Prophet” – and destroy our ally, Israel.More uncomfortable\nfacts:ISIS wouldn’t even exist but for the 2011 “Obama Bug-Out” from Iraq and\nhis flaccid response to Bashir Assad’s brutal civil war in Syria.ISIS isn’t\n“contained.” The organization and its affiliates now operate from safe havens\nin 13 countries: Syria, Iraq, Libya, Egypt, Yemen, the Philippines, Algeria,\nAfghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, Kenya, Mali and Nigeria. The Obama-Clinton-\nKerry legacy: genocide.  Ancient Christian and Yazidi communities are being\nannihilated. Over a quarter million unarmed men, women and children have\nalready perished. More than 14 million human beings have been driven from\ntheir homes in Southwest Asia, Africa and the broader Middle East. The\ncatastrophic number of dead and displaced – the largest since World War II –\nhas already cost over $5 billion and overwhelmed international relief\norganizations.Other than the effectiveness of their propaganda and\ncommunications, the ISIS “way of war” is extraordinarily brutal and cruel, but\nhardly sophisticated. ISIS terrorists prefer “soft targets.” They employ local\ncells to identify their prey, plan operations and commit mass murder – usually\nwith suicidal adherents.Western intelligence services rely heavily on\nintercepting communications so ISIS operatives use encrypted voice and data\nmessages and “throw-away” cell phones. Because we are so poor at collecting\nHUMINT – human intelligence – we’re “shocked and surprised” by their\nattacks.None of these problems are intractable if we hire a commander-in-chief\nworthy of the title – and a Congress willing to fulfill the principal\nresponsibility of government: protecting the lives and liberty of the American\npeople. Some first steps:**1\\. Define the Enemy:** radical Islamists waging\nwar against us.**2\\. Define Victory:** No safe havens – anywhere – for those\nwaging war against us. This doesn’t require landing the 1st Marine Division or\nthe 82nd Airborne in Syria but it will oblige our next president to directly\narm the Kurds and build a coalition of Sunni Arabs [e.g., Egypt, Jordan,\nTurkey, UAE \u0026amp; Saudi funding] to destroy ISIS in Syria. Without a safe\nhaven to recruit, train and transmit vicious propaganda, suicidal jihad will\nbecome much less attractive.  **3\\. Reinvigorate the CIA and DIA to collect\nhuman intelligence overseas.** Here at home Encourage task forces like those\ncreated by former Police Commissioner Ray Kelly in the NYPD to penetrate\nradical Islamist organizations.**4\\. Stop telling our enemies things they\ndon’t need to know.** Don’t “chest-thump” about successes – like Obama did\nwith the killing of Usama bin Laden – and the Belgians bragging about how\n“Salah Abdeslam is talking…”**5\\. Video profile “soft targets” – mass transit\nsites and other “crowd venues.”** The cameras are already there. A trained and\nattentive security officer should have noted the three Brussels terrorists\nstrolling through the airport. Had a K-9 unit been dispatched when they walked\nbeneath that camera, many lives could have been saved.**6\\. Allow only fully\n“vetted” Middle East refugees into the U.S. **It’s a “no brainer.”**7\\. Forget\nabout closing “Gitmo” and stop releasing Jihadis to return to their war\nagainst us.**Will these seven steps end the threat of radical Islam? Not\nimmediately. But to start, “We The People” must hire a commander-in-chief as\ncourageous as the soldiers, sailors, Airmen, Guardsmen and Marines who\nvolunteered to protect us all.__Lt Col Oliver L.

Bernie Sanders was projected to win the Alaska, Washington and Hawaii\nDemocratic presidential caucuses -- victories he hopes will spark a Western\nstates comeback and help him cut into frontrunner Hillary Clinton’s\nsubstantial lead.The Associated Press projected Sanders the winner of the\nAlaska and Washington contests Saturday, while the results of Hawaii's\npresidential contest weren't announced until early Sunday morning.\"We knew\nthings were going to improve as we headed west,\" Sanders said at a rally in\nMadison, Wis. \"We are making significant inroads in ... Clinton's lead ... We\nhave a path toward victory.\"Clinton leads by roughly 300 pledged delegates,\nwith 142 up for grabs Saturday. Washington had the biggest prize, 101\ndelegates, followed by Hawaii with 25 and Alaska with 16.Sanders, a democratic\nsocialist, on Saturday acknowledged his struggles in recent contests across\nthe South, with its strong conservative voting bloc. But he remained\noptimistic about upcoming contests in the more liberal West including those in\nOregon and California, which alone offers 546 delegates.The next Democratic\nand Republican primaries are April 5 in Wisconsin.The latest headlines on the\n2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage →Sanders\nis popular among younger and more progressive Americans but continues to\nstruggle to connect with Hispanic and African-American voters.He will win at\nleast nine delegates in Alaska. And all of them are elected to the state\nDemocratic convention, not the party's national nominating convention in July\nin Philadelphia.Going into Saturday, Clinton had a 1,223-to-920 lead on\nSanders in so-called pledged delegates, who are bound to candidates by their\nstates' elections.It takes 2,383 delegates to clinch the nomination.Sanders\nwas expected to do well in Washington, considering residents of Seattle, the\nbiggest city in the Pacific Northwest, are among the most liberal in the\ncountry and major campaign contributors.He drew more than 10,000 supporters to\na rally Friday evening at Safeco Field in Seattle. And by Saturday afternoon,\nthe state appeared to be having a record voter turnout, which has helped keep\nalive Sanders’ insurgent campaign.In Spokane, a huge line of caucus attendees\nhad already snaked around a high school parking by Saturday morning.\"I think\none of the biggest things is free tuition for students and getting big money\nout of politics,\" said Savannah Dills, 24, a college student who supports\nSanders. \"He's not paid for by billionaires.\"Top Sanders adviser Ted Devine\nrecently told FoxNews.com that he was optimistic about the campaign cutting\nClinton’s lead this weekend to under 300 delegates “with a couple of thousands\nmore delegates to go.”Most of the Washington’s Democratic leadership had\nendorsed Clinton, including Gov. Jay Inslee, Seattle Mayor Ed Murray and Sens.\nPatty Murray and Maria Cantwell.Still, Sanders entered Saturday’s contests\noptimistic after winning more delegate than Clinton in three contests earlier\nthis week -- nearly 20 in the Idaho and Utah caucuses, despite losing the\nmarquee Arizona primary to the former secretary of state.Sanders has done\nsignificantly better in caucus contests, now winning nine of the last 11.Most\nof his 14 primary-season wins have been in states with largely white\npopulations and in the caucus contests, which tend to attract the most active\nliberal Democrats.Yet Sanders still needs a dramatic surge to catch Clinton or\neven hold her under the number needed to clinch the nomination, despite the\noptimism and fundraising numbers, which also include collecting more than $140\nmillion from 2 million donors.Clinton did not hold a public event after the\nAlaska and Washington results were announced.While Sanders faces a steep climb\nto the nomination, a string of losses for Clinton would highlight her\npersistent vulnerabilities, including concerns about her trustworthiness and\nweak support among younger voters.Clinton’s delegate advantage, before\nSaturday, increases to 1,692-to-949 once the superdelegates, or party\nofficials who can back either candidate, are included.Based on that count,\nSanders still needs to win 58 percent of the remaining delegates from\nprimaries and caucuses to have a majority of those delegates by June's end.His\nbar is even higher when the party officials are considered. He needs to win\nmore than 67 percent of the remaining delegates overall -- from primaries,\ncaucuses and the ranks of uncommitted superdelegates -- to prevail.Because\nDemocrats allocate their delegates on a proportional basis, meaning that the\npopular vote loser can still pick up a share, his Saturday victories netted\nSanders a gain of at least 27 delegates to at least five for Clinton.Clinton\nhas been looking past the primary contests and aiming at potential Republican\nchallengers. In interviews, rallies and speeches this week, she largely\nfocused on Tuesday's deadly attacks in Brussels, casting GOP front-runner\nDonald Trump and Texas Sen.

He\nis a true leader and will bring the fundamental changes CPD needs right now. I\nlook forward to getting to work with Eddie right away.\"Anabel Abarca, a\nspokeswoman for Alderman George Cardenas, a prominent member of the Chicago\nCity Council's Latino caucus, also told AP Sunday that Emanuel reached out to\nthe alderman with news of Johnson's selection.Emanuel's spokeswoman Kelley\nQuinn declined to comment on whether Johnson is the mayor's pick, but said he\nhas made a decision and has informed the three nominees. She said Emanuel\nwould announce his decision within days.\"While each of the finalists had\nstrong qualifications, the mayor did not feel that any of them were the\ncomplete package that Chicago needs at this time and thus none were offered\nthe position,\" Quinn said. \"The mayor called each of them individually late\nSaturday to let them know of his decision.\"A city ordinance allows Emanuel to\nappoint an interim chief and ask the police board for a new list of\nfinalists.One of the board's initial nominees, Cedric Alexander, told AP on\nSunday that Emanuel offered him the job on Thursday during a meeting in\nWashington, D.C., and that the mayor told him he intended to make Johnson his\nfirst deputy. But he said Emanuel phoned him Saturday night to say he had\nchanged his mind.\"He did offer me the position in D.C. on Thursday, and last\nnight he called and said he's going in a different direction,\" said Alexander,\nthe public safety director in Georgia's DeKalb County. NBC5 in Chicago first\nreported that Alexander said he'd been offered the position.Alexander told AP\nthe plan had been for him to fly to Chicago on Monday and that the\nannouncement was to have come Wednesday.\"I would like to thank the Chicago\nPolice Board for giving me the opportunity to apply,\" Alexander said. \"Clearly\nthe mayor is going in another direction, and I would just like to wish the\nvery best for the people of Chicago.\"Chicago City Council's black caucus said\nlast week that they would prefer a local African-American for the job. But\nthey stopped short of endorsing Eugene Williams, a black deputy chief in\nChicago who was among the police board recommendations.

Businesses with fewer than 25 employees would\nhave an extra year to comply.At $10 an hour, California already has one of the\nhighest minimum wages in the nation along with Massachusetts. Only Washington,\nD.C., at $10.50 per hour is higher. The hike to $15 would make it the highest\nstatewide wage in the nation by far, though raises are in the works in other\nstates that might change by the time the plateau is reached in 2022.Some\nstates have passed higher minimums for government employees and state-\ncontracted workers, and some cities including Seattle have already passed $15\nan hour increases.And Oregon officials approved a law earlier this month that\nwill increase that state's minimum wage to nearly $15 in urban areas over the\nnext six years.California union leaders, however, said they would not\nimmediately dispense with planned ballot measures.Sean Wherley, a spokesman\nfor SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, confirmed that his group was involved\nin the negotiations.

The actor\nrevealed he has a child with autism and said he had hoped to provide an\nopportunity for conversation. “My intent in screening this film was to provide\nan opportunity for conversation around an issue that is deeply personal to me\nand my family,” De Niro said in a statement. “But after reviewing it over the\npast few days with the Tribeca Film Festival team and others from the\nscientific community, we do not believe it contributes to or furthers the\ndiscussion I had hoped for.”The film festival sparked some outrage earlier\nthis week when it announced it would screen “Vaxxed” at this year’s festival.\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, the movie alleges that the U.S. Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention has covered up the notion that measles,\nmumps and rubella vaccines increase the risk of autism.The trailer for the\nfilm also asks if “our children are safe” over the image of smoke bellowing\nout of a syringe, according to The Guardian.Michael Specter, a medical\njournalist from the New Yorker, told the LA Times that it was \"disgraceful\" to\nallow the film in the festival.\"This is a criminal who is responsible for\npeople dying,\" Specter said.Wakefield's position has been widely discredited\nby the scientific community and has been criticized for leading to a dangerous\ndrop in MMR vaccinations. De Niro received much criticism on social media for\nincluding the move in the festival and for giving Wakefield a chance to speak\nat a post-screening event.“The festival doesn’t seek to avoid or shy away from\ncontroversy. However, we have concerns with certain things in this film that\nwe feel prevent us from presenting it in the Festival program.

(AP) The Obama\nadministration is emptying the military’s Guantanamo Bay detention facility of\navowed terrorists captured fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, but several\nAmerican service members languish in another military prison for actions on\nthose same battlefields that their supporters say merit clemency, if not\ngratitude.Among the prison population at Fort Leavenworth, in Kansas, are\nremaining members of the so-called “Leavenworth 10,” convicted service members\ndoing terms ranging from 10 to 40 years for heat-of-the-battle decisions their\nsupporters say saved American lives.“The very people who protect our freedoms\nand liberties are having their own freedoms and liberties taken away,” said\nretired U.S. Army Col. Allen West, a former congressman and political\ncommentator. “I think it’s appalling and no one is talking about this\nissue.\"The \"Leavenworth 10\" is the name given to a fluctuating number of men\nhoused at Leavenworth for actions in Iraq and Afghanistan that their\nsupporters say were justified. Over the years, a handful have been paroled,\nand more have been incarcerated.Among the more well-known cases is that of\nArmy First Lt. Clint Lorance, who is serving a 20-year sentence for ordering\nhis men to shoot two suspected Taliban scouts in July 2012 in the Kandahar\nProvince of Afghanistan. Lorance had just taken command of the platoon after\nthe prior leader and several others were killed days before. The Taliban\nsuspects were on motorcycles and matched descriptions given by a pilot who\nflew over the area earlier and spotted them as scouts.“The very people who\nprotect our freedoms and liberties are having their own freedoms and liberties\ntaken away.”- Col. Allen WestA Facebook page devoted to Lorance’s case has\ndrawn more than 12,000 likes, and supporters have launched a website,\nFreeClintLorance.com, dedicated to winning his release. A WhiteHouse.gov\npetition calling for Lorance to be pardoned garnered nearly 125,000\nsignatures, but the White House has not taken action.Critics say Lorance was\ngiven a military trial, and his conviction was based in large part on the\ntestimony of men serving under him.It was September of 2010 when Sgt. Derrick\nMiller of Maryland, on a combat mission in a Taliban-held area of Afghanistan,\nwas warned the unit’s base had been penetrated. An Afghan suspected of being\nan enemy combatant was brought to Miller for interrogation and wound up dead.\nMiller claimed the suspect tried to grab his gun and that he shot him in self-\ndefense. But he was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.1st Lt. Clint\nLorance was found guilty of two counts of murder for the July 2012 killing of\ntwo suspected Taliban fighters. His defense team argued that the village they\nwere patrolling was under Taliban rule with constant incidents of violence.\nU.S. Army Master Sgt. John Hatley -- a highly decorated, 20-year vet who\nserved in Operation Desert Storm and did another three tours during the Iraq\nWar -- also is serving a life sentence at Leavenworth. His conviction stems\nfrom an April, 2007, incident in Iraq in which he and his unit captured\nenemies following a firefight. He radioed a U.S. detention facility to notify\nofficials he was bringing in four prisoners, but was ordered to let them go,\naccording to his legal team.Two years later, a sergeant who had served with\nHatley, Jesse Cunningham, was facing charges for assaulting another officer\nand falling asleep at his post. As leverage for a plea deal, he told\ninvestigators that Hatley and two other officers had taken the insurgents to a\nremote location, blindfolded them and shot each in the back of the head. He\nclaimed their bodies were dumped in a canal, though none was ever\nfound.Hatley, now 47, insists he and his men let the insurgents go, but\nbelieves he was punished in the interest of the government’s relations with\nBaghdad.“When concerns over appeasing a foreign country are allowed to\ninterfere with justice for the purpose of the U.S. government or the military\ndemonstrating that we, the military or the U.S. government will hold our\nsoldiers accountable using a fatally flawed military judicial system, it\ndoesn’t matter what the truth is; it matters only that there is only the\nappearance of the truth,” he wrote in a message to supporters posted on\nfreeJohnHatley.com.Law experts say military service members face a daunting\ntask once accused of committing crimes in the heat of war.“Killing on the\nbattlefield is not the same as [a police officer] killing someone on the\nstreets,” Dan Conway, an attorney who specializes in military law, told\nFoxNews.com. “When a cop uses force, there’s a line of duty investigation.\nWhen a soldier uses force, it is investigated as criminal, and non-infantry\ninvestigators handle the case, many who have no combat experience.“If you had\nexperts handling the investigation, you’d have much more balance,” he\nadded.While the military rightly holds its soldiers to a high standard of\njustice, detainees housed at Guantanamo Bay have been freed even with no\nmitigating circumstances or reasonable belief of rehabilitation. The release\nof Gitmo detainees began during the presidency of George W. Bush in 2005 when\nnearly 200 detainees were released before any tribunals were held.According to\na March 2015 memo released by the Office of the Director of National\nIntelligence, of the 647 detainees transferred or released, 17.9 percent were\nconfirmed of re-engaging in extremist activity with another 10.7 percent\nsuspected of doing the same.The military prison located of the grounds of Fort\nLeavenworth, Kansas is the largest such facility in the country. Said Mohammad\nAlim Shah was repatriated to Afghanistan in March 2004. After his release, he\nwas responsible for kidnapping two Chinese engineers, took credit for a hotel\nbombing in Islamabad and orchestrated a 2007 suicide attack that left 21\npeople dead.Abdullah Ghoffor went back to Afghanistan at the same time and\nbecame a high-ranking Taliban commander who planned attacks against U.S. and\nAfghan forces before being killed in a raid.Abdallah Salih al-Ajmi, a former\ndetainee from Kuwait, committed a successful suicide attack in Mosul, Iraq, in\nMarch 2008. That came three years after he had been freed from Guantanamo and\ntransferred to Kuwait, where a court acquitted him of terrorism charges.West\nagrees that U.S. soldiers who commit crimes should be punished severely. But\nhe said the military owes at least as much to men and women who risk their\nlives fighting for their country as it does to the unrepentant terrorist at\nGuantanamo Bay.Ibrahim al Qosi spent over a decade at Guantanamo Bay prison\nbefore he was released. It is believed that he currently holds a key position\nof leadership in Al Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula. “The rules of engagement\nshould be coming from the bottom up and not the other way around, to protect\nthem against the scores of non-state combatants and enemies,” West said.\n“Gitmo is seen as this place of recruitment for jihadists and there are those\ntrying to make us believe that Leavenworth is the same.”__Perry Chiaramonte is\na reporter for FoxNews.com.

The caption on the post\nsaid: “I went to Yakima today. Now I know why [Republican presidential\ncandidate Donald] Trump wants to build a wall.”Then, Parks added on the post:\n“Wait until he sees pasco!”Sanders stopped in Yakima on Thursday to rally\nsupporters before Saturday's Washington Democratic caucuses.

About 48 percent of Yakima’s population is Hispanic while 56\npercent of Pasco’s population is Latino, according to the Seattle Times.The\npost, which was public but later taken down, set off a series of nasty\nexchanges between Parks and Pasco Mayor Matt Watkins, according to the\nTimes.“You managed to trash Yakima, Pasco and Latinos all at once.

Brinker\n(Daneli Photography llc)Today in America we need more women willing to throw\ntheir hats in the political ring.In order to have more women involved we must\nunderstand the challenges women face in politics today.I have been approached\nmany times about running for office, so I know firsthand the obstacles women\nface. They are institutional, financial and operational.According to the\nlatest census: there are approximately 158.6 million women in the United\nStates and the number of men is approximately 151.4 million. So, women make up\na majority of the U.S. population.The majority in population however does not\ntranslate in majority congressional representation as women in the U.S.\nCongress in 2015 have only 104 of the 535 seats broken out as 76 Democrats and\n28 Republicans. That comprises 19.4 percent** **of the 535 members; 20 women\n(20 percent) serve in the United States Senate, and 84 women (19.3 percent)\nserve in the United States House of Representatives.It’s ironic that women are\na majority of our population and vote in higher numbers than men, but we still\nlag way behind in the number of elected officials. We have outvoted men in\nevery presidential election** **since 1980, and the gap has widened over time.\nIn 2012, 63.7 percent of women and 59.8 percent of men voted, a difference in\nturnout of nearly 4 percentage pointsThe latest headlines on the 2016\nelections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage →Data shows\nthat when a woman does run for office she has the same chance of winning as a\nman and that women win at the same rate as men.So where is the disconnect?The\nbottom-line is you can’t vote for a woman if she is not on the ballot. And, a\nwoman cannot get on the ballot unless their party of affiliation gives women\nthe same opportunity as men to run for office.Political parties now need to\nincorporate more women within party leadership and infrastructure on the\nnational, on the state and on the local levels. Parties should operate like\nheadhunting firms – constantly on the lookout for party leaders and candidates\n-- creating opportunity for both. This can best be accomplished through\ninstitutional recruitment, training and the funding of women candidates.To\ndate incumbency has put a chill on more women running for office and thus\nhaving the opportunity to be elected. Since most men are incumbents and well\nfinanced – it makes it much more difficult to unseat them in a primary or for\nthem to step down to give others the opportunity to serve.There is no doubt in\nmy mind that qualified women are out there and available to serve they just\nneed to be tapped, welcomed, given the chance and financially supported to the\nsame extent as male candidates.In this election cycle for president, Senate\nand the House both parties are not offering the electorate enough qualified\nwomen candidates. It is not just about the top of a ticket it is about the\nentire ballot.All we need to is to be given a fair deal. We can take it from\nthere.___Nancy G. Brinker is founder of Susan G.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc95999"},"content":"  Even as then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was warning department\nemployees about the threat from cyber-attacks, she opted to skip a special\n2011 cyber briefing that the department security team put together just for\nher, according to congressional investigators and an unclassified letter from\nthe State Department.The briefing was a sign of how serious the cybersecurity\nthreat to U.S. government systems had become. The briefing was drawn up during\nthe same year an internal 2011 State Department cable from Clinton, first\nreported by Fox News, told State Department employees not to use personal\nemail because of the hacking threat.Yet, Clinton was conducting all official\ngovernment business on her unsecured personal account. And in mid-February,\nJulia Frifield, the assistant secretary for legislative affairs, confirmed to\nCongress the existence of the 2011 cyber briefing and the fact that Clinton\nskipped it. The details were revealed in a March 3 congressional letter to\nSecretary of State John Kerry.The letter says: \"On February 18, 2016, Ms.\nJulia Frifield, the Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs, sent us that\nclassified PowerPoint presentation used in the cybersecurity briefing, along\nwith an unclassified cover letter. The unclassified cover letter noted that\n'although the PowerPoint indicated the briefing was for former Secretary\nClinton, we understand from the testimony of the briefers, that she was not in\nattendance.'\"The letter is part of the ongoing oversight of the State\nDepartment by Republican Sens. Ron Johnson and Chuck Grassley, who signed the\nletter to Kerry. Grassley is asking that the PowerPoint presentation be\ndeclassified. The senator’s investigation of State Department practices began\nfour years ago and is not limited to current questions about Clinton's use of\npersonal email for government business. In the last year since the email\naccount became public, more than 2,000 messages containing classified\ninformation have been identified by the intelligence community and State\nDepartment, including another 22 emails considered too damaging to national\nsecurity to release under any circumstances.The latest headlines on the 2016\nelections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest Coverage →A State\nDepartment spokesman had no information on the skipped 2011 session when asked\nThursday, but emphasized there are consequences when cybersecurity and\nclassified information training are not completed.\"We all have to undergo\nthat, and it's considered mandatory,\" spokesman Mark Toner said. \"I don't know\nthe specifics of this case. Not so much punishment, but you know, access to\ncomputers, that kind of thing, might be affected.\"In an ongoing federal\nlawsuit under the Freedom of Information Act, conservative watchdog group\nJudicial Watch sued for all records documenting that Clinton -- and top aides\nHuma Abedin and then-State Department chief of staff Cheryl Mills -- took the\nrequired training on the identification and handling of classified\ninformation. Judicial Watch was recently told by the State Department that no\nrecords exist to confirm the training was completed.\"The State Department\ncan't find any documents that they took this course, so now it's up to Clinton\nto explain why she didn't take this training and why she thought she was above\nthe law,\" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton told Fox News. The Daily Caller\nalso reported that, in three of her four years at the helm of the department,\nClinton received no security briefings on handling classified information.\nAccording to the report, her only briefing was on Jan. 22, 2009, right after\nshe was confirmed to the post. The only related documents of record are the\nnon-disclosure agreements for classified and top secret intelligence which\nClinton signed in January 2009, right after becoming secretary of state. The\nsigned agreements said Clinton understood \"classified information is marked or\nunmarked … including oral communications.\" Clinton also confirmed that she\nunderstood there were potential criminal violations under the Espionage Act\nfor breaking the agreements.Cyber experts say the compromise of Clinton's\nserver is not just a hypothetical. While Clinton IT specialist Bryan\nPagliano’s security logs showed no evidence of a compromise, in March 2013 it\nwas revealed the email account of Clinton adviser Sidney Blumenthal was\naccessed by the Romanian hacker \"Guccifer\" -- first exposing an account that\nappeared to belong to Clinton at \"Clintonemail.com.”The Department of Justice\nrecently confirmed that Guccifer is being extradited to the federal court in\nthe Eastern District of Virginia.  \"I find it highly coincidental that\n[Guccifer] is in the United States at the same time this [FBI] investigation\nis coming to a head,\" cybersecurity expert Morgan Wright said. “It takes a lot\nto get somebody internationally extradited. They jump through a lot of hoops.\n... I go back to what's in common and that's the exposure. It started all with\nSidney Blumenthal and the hack of his email that exposed Secretary Clinton's\nemail. That's the nexus, that's where Bryan Pagliano, that's where all these\nother players are coming. … There's more than coincidence here.\"Asked recently\nabout the case, a spokesman for the Virginia court had no update on Guccifer's\narrival in the U.S. or his first court appearance.Fitton told Fox News they\nhave spent $625,000 on staff attorneys between March 2015 and March 2016\nseeking documents under the Freedom of Information Act because they had to sue\nfor them. It is not public how much the State Department, and by extension the\nAmerican taxpayer, has spent on the FOIA lawsuits.Clinton campaign aides Brian\nFallon and Nick Merrill were asked for comment on the 2011 cyber briefing and\nany records that might show Clinton and her team took the required classified\ninformation training. There was no immediate comment.__Catherine Herridge is\nan award-winning Chief Intelligence correspondent for FOX News Channel (FNC)\nbased in Washington, D.C.

{"_id":{"$oid":"5700a817dea3b36a5fc9599a"},"content":"FILE - Inmates walk past correctional officers at the Washington Corrections\nCenter in Shelton, Wash. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson) One Easter weekend, I\naccompanied my father, Charles Colson, to a prison in South Carolina. We held\na worship service on Death Row, and about 20 men came out of their cells to\nsing songs and listen to my dad give a message about the resurrection of\nJesus.My father, whose books on Christian life and thought have sold more than\n5 million copies, could have spent Easter weekend in more influential pulpits.\nHe could have commanded an audience of thousands of Christians who were well-\nresourced and well-connected, rather than men in prison jumpsuits. But\ninstead, every Easter for decades following his release from prison in 1975\nfor a Watergate-related crime until his death in 2012, he chose to go back\nbehind bars to celebrate with the incarcerated.My father understood that if we\nwant to change the world, we must start behind bars.The criminal justice\nsystem may not seem like the place to initiate cultural renewal, but no place\ncould be better. When our nation’s 2.2 million prisoners are held in\nconditions that do little to help address the roots of criminal behavior, they\nremain likely to continue in a criminal lifestyle after they are released.\nPrisoners might seem like improbable standard bearers for cultural\ntransformation, but my dad believed wholeheartedly that whenever prisoners are\ntransformed, they will transform the culture of their prisons and society at\nlarge.Of the more than 600,000 prisoners who are released each year, two-\nthirds will be re-arrested within three years. When their parents come home\nfrom prison stuck in the same criminal behaviors, the one in 28 American\nchildren with an incarcerated parent continue to suffer. New victims are\ncreated. Communities remain stuck in cycles of crime, incarceration and\npoverty.There is a better way. Prison officials, departments of corrections,\nfaith groups and other organizations can work together to create a more\nrestorative prison culture—one that offers the perpetrators of crime an\nopportunity to face proportional accountability for their actions, make amends\nand prepare to be good citizens and good neighbors upon their release. For\nexample, Prison Fellowship’s Warden Exchange convenes corrections\nprofessionals who exchange innovative ideas and best practices for the moral\nrehabilitation of prisoners. These practices create correctional environments\nthat respect human dignity, improve safety and reduce the likelihood that\nreleased prisoners will commit new offenses.Prisons are full of untapped\npotential. Under the right conditions, many people—like my father—can pay\ntheir debt to society, prepare for a new future and make the most of their\nsecond chance. A variety of prison programs that address the roots of criminal\nbehavior through education, mentoring, substance-abuse treatment and more have\nbeen shown to reduce recidivism. Legislation based on restorative values can\nsupport this goal. The Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, now making its\nway through Congress, would require the Federal Bureau of Prisons to implement\nand incentivize programming to reduce rates of re-offense. This is good news\nnot just for prisoners but for everyone affected by crime and incarceration.\nWhen recidivism rates go down, more children grow up seeing their parents\noutside of a prison waiting room. There are fewer victims. Communities have a\nchance to flourish as they benefit from the contributions of members who are\nsuccessfully reintegrating.At the first Easter, mourners gathered at the tomb\nof a man who had been executed with criminals. There seemed to be no future\nfor his followers, a small group of poorly educated misfits with no worldly\npower or influence. And yet, the nascent Christian movement transformed the\nculture of the Roman Empire and the entire modern history of the world.When my\ndad spent “Resurrection Sunday” behind bars with prisoners, including those\ncondemned to die, he often invoked that first Easter, where the hope of the\nGospel emerged from a sealed tomb that was supposed to be as secure as any\nprison. Prisoners might seem like improbable standard bearers for cultural\ntransformation, but my dad believed wholeheartedly that whenever prisoners are\ntransformed, they will transform the culture of their prisons and society at\nlarge.Many people have already emerged from correctional environments to make\nsignificant contributions to society. My father founded the nation’s largest\nministry to prisoners, former prisoners, and their families after pleading\nguilty to obstruction of justice. A woman who was once featured on the FBI’s\nTen Most Wanted List founded Angel Tree, the Prison Fellowship program that\nhas brightened Christmas for millions of children. Meanwhile, our\norganization's senior vice president of advocacy, who fights every day for a\nmore restorative criminal justice system, is a recovering alcoholic with an\narrest record.Many more people with a conviction in their past have great\ncontributions still to make in the future. A more constructive prison culture\ncan help give them a chance to improve their communities and our country. As\nEaster reminds us, the change the world most needs sometimes comes from\nunexpected places. __Christian Colson serves on the board of directors of\nPrison Fellowship, the nation’s largest outreach to prisoners, former\nprisoners and their families.  \\+ Follow**FoxNewsOpinion** on Facebook\n\n","title":"To change the world, start with prisons | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"RT @fxnopinion: To change the world, start with prisons | via @prisonfellowshp | https://t.co/gIeEbLcOzp","date":"Sat Mar 26 12:49:43 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"713709517750583296"},"retweets":54},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1Rk37OJ"}

It might be hard to sustain this pace on foot, but it's\ncertainly possible by car. [Big Blasts: History's 10 Most Destructive\nVolcanoes]The findings were published March 7 in the journal Nature\nCommunications.\"It's really interesting how you can have such a violent\neruption producing such slow-moving flows,\" said Valentine, co-author of the\nnew study. \"They still devastate a huge area, but they're slow and\nconcentrated and dense,\" he told Live Science. His collaborators include\nOlivier Roche, of Blaise Pascal University in France and David Buesch, of the\nU.S. Geological Survey.Of course, the safest way to deal with any rumbling\nvolcano is to get as far away as possible. Lots of distance can prevent the\nmost common cause of death associated with volcanoes: being trapped and\nsuffocated by a torrent of ash, rocks and superhot gas that explode out at\nspeeds of up to 300 mph. These \"pyroclastic flows\" are the real volcanic\nkiller, not lava.

But it's hard to know what will happen when a\nsupervolcano the size of Yellowstone blows its top. The last supereruption on\nEarth was 74,000 years ago, in Toba, Indonesia. Looking at the rocky remains\nof past supereruptions can reveal how and why supervolcanoes erupt.When a\nsupervolcano blew in Arizona 18.8 million years ago, the ash spread more than\n100 miles.

(A tuff is a volcanic rock made of solidified ash.)The researchers\nmeasured rocks at the bottom of the tuff in Arizona that were carried in the\nflow. They matched unique rock types back to their source, and found that many\nof the rocks, whether fist-size or boulders, were carried no farther than a\nfootball field.Accounting for the size and position of these rocks helped the\nresearchers build a model of how fast and thick the ash flow was as it\ntraveled. It turns out that only a dense, slow-moving pyroclastic flow could\nsuck up the rocks from the surface and trundle them along. A fast, relatively\nthin flow would have to reach impossible speeds — up to 1,454 mph — to carry\nthe rocks, the researchers found.\"I think it's plausible but speculative,\"\nsaid Calvin Miller, a volcanologist at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, who\nwas not involved in the study. \"It will be interesting to see how the\n[scientific] community responds to it. Even if they're right for the Peach\nSprings Tuff, this is just part of a continuum of eruption styles,\" Miller\ntold Live Science.The origins of the Peach Springs Tuff can be spotted in\nsouthwestern Arizona's Black Mountains, near the town of Oatman. The eruption\nleft behind a very large crater called a caldera, though it has been mostly\nobliterated by erosion and faulting.The caldera, called Silver Creek, spewed\nmagma for several days, releasing a volume of about 1,000 times the\nMississippi River's daily flow at New Orleans, Valentine said. \"If you think\nabout 1,000 Mississippi Rivers coming out of the ground, you can see how [the\nash] would have spread out across a huge area,\" he said.However, one expert on\nthe Peach Springs Tuff doesn't buy the scenario. Charles Ferguson, a research\ngeologist with the Arizona Geological Survey, said there are outcrops that\nsuggest the ash moved quickly and energetically, like a typical pyroclastic\nflow.\"I think their hypothesis is more problematic than explanatory,\" Ferguson\ntold Live Science.**Southwestern supervolcanoes**The Peach Springs Tuff covers\nparts of Arizona, Nevada and California, from Barstow, California, to Peach\nSprings, Arizona. Geologists use the creamy white and pink rock as a unique\nmarker in the region.The western United States suffered at least 100 of these\nhuge eruptions starting about 40 million years ago (a consequence of shifting\ntectonic plates). It's not clear whether every one of these supervolcanic\nblasts sent out slowly moving ash flows, but Valentine said he sees similar\nevidence in other areas.The powerful Peach Springs eruption ejected 72 cubic\nmiles of pulverized rock into the air. For comparison, the 1980 eruption of\nMount St. Helens in Washington blasted out 0.24 cubic miles of material. And\nthe 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines spewed 2.4 cubic miles\nof material.Any supereruption will likely come with a fair amount of warning,\nsimilar to the bulge that foreshadowed the Mount St. Helens eruption. The new\nfindings suggest that people living near a supervolcano might have a few hours\nto evacuate once the disaster starts, the researchers said.__ Copyright 2016\nLiveScience, a Purch company.

This weekend, make way for\nthe top dogs.North Carolina, Virginia, Kansas and Oregon have all flexed their\ncollective top-seeded muscle with dominant victories that not only flaunted\ntheir superiority so far, but showed an all-No. 1 Final Four is a legitimate\npossibility in Texas.The most intriguing roadblocks come Saturday in a pair of\n1-2 matchups.Oklahoma (28-7) takes on No. 1 Oregon (31-6) in the West\nRegional.KU (33-4) plays No. 2 Villanova (32-5) in the South Regional.\"Both of\nus are playing our best basketball right now, and both of us have played\npretty well during the season,\" Villanova coach Jay Wright said. \"It's one-\nseed, two-seed and teams that I think feel very good about how they're\nplaying. So I would say that's a heavyweight matchup.\"Much like in the jumbled\nalphabet soup of boxing organizations, there are quite a few heavyweight\ncontenders left on Sunday.Virginia (29-7) plays No. 10 Syracuse (22-13) in the\nMidwest Regional final.The top-seeded Tar Heels stomped Indiana on Friday\nnight and move on to play sixth-seeded Notre Dame (24-11) in the Elite\nEight.\"The Irish don't lose on Good Friday or Easter Sunday,\" Notre Dame coach\nMike Brey told his team in the locker room after beating Wisconsin. \"Can I get\nan Amen!\"Notre Dame might need a few amens and a handful of Hail Marys on\nSunday — Notre Dame's 31-point loss to UNC in the ACC tournament on March 11\nwas the worst ever for the Irish under Brey.No wonder the tourney is dubbed\nMarch Madness. The NCAA Tournament has only once sent all four No. 1 seeds to\nthe Final Four, in 2008 when Kansas, Memphis, North Carolina, UCLA advanced\nand the Jayhawks topped the Tigers for the national championship.Four No. 1\nseeds have reached the Elite Eight seven times since seeding began in 1979,\naccording to STATS LLC.— 1987; Georgetown, Indiana, North Carolina, UNLV.—\n1993; Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina.— 2001; Duke, Illinois,\nMichigan State, Stanford.— 2003; Arizona, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Texas.— 2007;\nFlorida, Kansas, North Carolina, Ohio State.— 2008; Kansas, Memphis, North\nCarolina, UCLA.— 2009; Connecticut, Louisville, North Carolina,\nPittsburgh.With the Tar Heels, Cavaliers, Jayhawks and Ducks joining the list\nthis season, it's truly the Elite \"Eighth\" time the 1s are still on the\nline.The Wildcats have won three tournament games by an average of 24 points,\nincluding a 23-point win over No. 3 Miami in the Sweet 16. Villanova is\nshooting nearly 60 percent from the field in the tournament.\"They're on fire\nright now,\" said Kansas coach Bill Self, who noted his Jayhawks have been just\nas dominant.Oregon might be the No. 1 seed most susceptible to a loss, though\nboth the Ducks and the Sooners rely on deep, balanced rosters of athletic\nplayers surrounding an elite scorer: Oklahoma's Buddy Hield and Oregon's\nDillon Brooks.The Sooners' core four of Hield, Ryan Spangler, Jordan Woodard\nand Isaiah Cousins will start its 104th consecutive game together, along with\n36 straight starts by Khadeem Lattin. OU is after its first Final Four trip\nsince 2002.\"We ride and fight all together, so I think ending on a good note\nwould be special for us,\" Hield said.Even before the ball is tipped April 4 in\nHouston for the national championship, the true No. 1 is already stamped ACC.\nNorth Carolina and Notre Dame will determine one of two guaranteed Atlantic\nCoast Conference spots in the Final Four. The Fighting Irish beat Wisconsin\n61-56 on Friday.It will be the same case in the Midwest Regional, where the\nVirginia-Syracuse matchup ensures at least half the Final Four will be from\nthe ACC. The conference will also have a team play for the national\ntitle.\"That's good, but at the end of the day, I'm a Carolina basketball\nplayer so as long as we're advancing and we're that No. 1 seed that keeps on\nmoving, that's all I care about,\" North Carolina guard Joel Berry III said__\n\n","title":"NCAA Tournament 2016: All No. 1 seeds remain as Elite 8 nears | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"All No. 1 seeds remain as #Elite8 nears https://t.co/14szIRB0KX https://t.co/upRu9hohqG","date":"Sat Mar 26 10:16:28 +0000 2016","favs":205,"id":{"$numberLong":"713670949774630912"},"retweets":71},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1MIl7gs"}

(Danielle Guerra/Daily Chronicle via AP, File)An Illinois\nprosecutor said Friday that new evidence proves that a man convicted in the\n1957 abduction and murder of a 7-year-old girl couldn’t have committed the\ncrime.DeKalb County State’s Attorney Richard Schmack said his court-ordered,\nsix-month review of the case included new evidence that reaffirmed an alibi\nfor Jack McCullough, who was initially cleared in the case but was then\ncharged in 2011.Schmack said evidence convinced him that McCullough couldn’t\nhave been anywhere nearby when Maria Ridulph vanished on Dec. 3, 1957, while\nshe was playing outside in the snow near her home in the community of\nSycamore.The girl was choked and stabbed to death in an alley, and her body\nwas found months later, dumped in the woods more than 100 miles away and her\nmurder remained unsolved for decades.McCullough was a neighbor at the time of\nthe murder. He had long ago been cleared by authorities before a renewed\neffort was launched to solve the case. He was found guilty in 2012 and was\nsentenced to life in prison.Schmack said in a court filing that he joined in\nthe defendant's motion to set aside the guilty verdict. A hearing is scheduled\nfor Tuesday.Some of the new evidence includes a recently subpoenaed phone\nrecords that proved McCullough made a collect call to his parents from a phone\nbooth in the lobby of a Post Office in Rockford, about 35 miles from Sycamore.\nThe call was placed minutes after the abduction was said to have taken\nplace.That had always been McCullough's professed alibi, though the precise\nlocation of the phone had previously come under doubt.Testimony that the\nabduction had taken place earlier was also discredited, Schmack said, meaning\nthere was no possibility McCullough could have committed the crime and driven\nto Rockford in time to place that call.\"I know there are people who will never\nbelieve that he is not responsible for the crime,\" said Schmack, whose own\nfamily has lived for 30 years in the small Sycamore neighborhood where the\ncrime occurred. \"But I cannot allow that to sway me from my sworn\nduty.\"Schmack said the findings also cast doubt on the fairness of a photo\narray that authorities prepared for a witness who identified McCullough as the\nsuspect a half-century later.\"We're very pleased,\" said McCullough's attorney,\npublic defender Tom McCulloch.Their appeal will be back in court on Tuesday,\nand McCulloch, now 76, is hopeful his client could be released soon.\"Given\nthis filing, hopefully this comes to a rapid and favorable conclusion,\" he\nsaid.Schmack’s conclusions are based off FBI reports from 1957 and 1958 which\nwere ruled inadmissible during the 2012 trial, according to the DeKalb Daily\nChronicle. He also claims the state’s timeline falls apart when compared to\nfederal authorities’ reports.But Maria's sister remains convinced that\nMcCullough is guilty.\"It's all very upsetting for us,\" said Patricia Quinn of\nEl Paso, Illinois, her voice cracking with emotion. \"We're just trusting in\nwhat the judge will do Tuesday at the hearing.\"McCullough's conviction had put\nto rest some of the decades of anguish endured by Maria's family and\nfriends.At his sentencing in 2012, McCullough turned to them in the courtroom\nand proclaimed his innocence.\"I did not, did not, kill Maria Ridulph,\" said\nthe silver-haired McCullough, who grew up in Sycamore and was 17 when Maria\ndied. \"It was a crime I did not, would not, could not have done.\"_The\nAssociated Press contributed to this report.___\n\n","title":"Illinois prosecutor says new evidence proves man didn't murder girl in 1957 | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Illinois prosecutor says new evidence proves man didn't murder girl in 1957 https://t.co/WUbIeLIQC3 https://t.co/dcPHHocOoJ","date":"Sat Mar 26 08:00:07 +0000 2016","favs":147,"id":{"$numberLong":"713636638484598784"},"retweets":74},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1Taw9la"}

Ted Cruz,\ntold Fox News' \"The O’Reilly Factor.\" “Donald's approach on foreign policy is\none of weakness and isolationism,” Cruz added. “That's his position\nconsistently across the globe.”Trump took on the NATO issue during a meeting\nearlier this week with The Washington Post editorial board. He said the U.S.\n“shouldn’t be nation building anymore,” and NATO has become too expensive,\nwith too little commitment from allies, to fully invest in. He accused Germany\nand other allies of not doing enough on Ukraine, which is locked in a regional\npower struggle with Russia.“We certainly can’t afford to do this anymore,” he\ntold the paper, adding later, “NATO is costing us a fortune, and yes we’re\nprotecting Europe with NATO, but we’re spending a lot of money.”  The latest\nheadlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics. See Latest\nCoverage →This prompted Democratic presidential front-runner and former\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton to sound off. “If Mr. Trump gets his way,\nit will be like Christmas in the Kremlin,” she said Wednesday in a Stanford\nUniversity speech. For his part, Trump stood by his comments, calling NATO\n“obsolete” on Twitter, though he stopped short of saying the U.S. needed to\nget out completely. Instead, he said NATO “must be changed to additionally\nfocus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on.\n... We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of NATO. Why? It is time to\nrenegotiate, and the time is now!\" Trump did not cast his comments as in any\nway a concession to Russia. But Trump and Putin famously have been making\nfavorable comments about one another dating back months. “I've always felt\nfine about Putin. He's a strong leader, he's a powerful leader,” Trump told\nMSNBC in December. “He's actually got popularity within his country.”Russian\nauthorities seem to be having fun with the political back-and-forth, with a\nRussian foreign ministry spokesman telling Reuters this week that Trump’s\nlatest comments were welcome in that they showed the global alliance, which\ngrew in the 1950s and '60s in reaction to the rise of the Soviet Union, in\ncrisis. Russia has maintained that NATO abrogated agreements it made with\nRussia not to expand into former Soviet countries, including the Baltic\nStates.Trump and Putin are similar, the ministry told Reuters. “They are both\nopen-minded, pragmatic, and say what they think.”The \"bromance\" has caused\nsome problems for Trump on the campaign trail. He took heat in January when he\nseemed to second-guess a British government investigation that found Putin’s\ngovernment likely poisoned former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko in\nLondon.\"First of all, he says he didn't do it. Many people say it wasn't him.\nSo who knows who did it?\" Trump said at the time.Gary Schmidtt, security\nstudies analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, told FoxNews.com that\nCruz and Clinton were “on the mark” in their retort to Trump’s comments.“It‘s\ncertainly true he plays into Putin’s larger strategic plans, which have been\npretty obvious,” in that he would like to reduce NATO’s influence, if not\n“deconstruct the security architecture that has been in place for\ndecades.”NATO currently has 28 member states and has been credited, said\nSchmidtt, with ending ethnic cleansing with its involvement in the Bosnian\nwar, as well as praised for its work in the initial invasion and\ncounterinsurgency in Afghanistan, among other recent joint security\noperations.Trump isn’t the first to criticize NATO, however. As he was leaving\noffice, former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, too, questioned the\ndisproportionate investment in the security organization.In a 2011 speech in\nBrussels, he said that America's military alliance with Europe faces a \"dim,\nif not dismal\" future, mostly because of European allies who are \"willing and\neager for American taxpayers to assume the growing security burden left by\nreductions in European defense budgets.\"At the time, the U.S. was contributing\nbetween one-fifth and one-quarter of NATO's budget. In fiscal 2010, that\ncontribution totaled $711.8 million.Schmidtt acknowledged there have been\ncalls for reform -- and there is nothing wrong with that.“Of course now we’re\ndealing with a resurgence of Russia,” he pointed out. “Is there room for\nimprovement and reforms? Yes. But you can’t be like a child and and just pick\nup your toys and run away because you are not satisfied with your allies’\nbehavior.”Brian Katulis, a national security fellow at the Center for American\nProgress, said Trump would unlikely be able to disengage from NATO even if he\nwere to win the White House in November. Put simply, the alliances are\nimportant.“You can’t throw the baby out with the bathwater,” he said,\n“especially with all the tangible benefits of work with NATO in Europe and the\nreally force multipliers these alliances actually are.”__\n\n","title":"Trump accused of Putin favors with NATO criticism | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Trump accused of Putin favors with NATO criticism https://t.co/6d5z2Llw2d via @foxnewspolitics https://t.co/drZlg3omPq","date":"Sat Mar 26 03:04:03 +0000 2016","favs":158,"id":{"$numberLong":"713562128943153152"},"retweets":106},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1obS4LP"}

The flurry of activity in the closely-tied European\nnations strengthened suspicions one ISIS-directed cell was responsible for\nattacks that rocked their capitals.“The removal of this ISIL leader will\nhamper the organization’s ability to conduct operations both inside and\noutside of Iraq and Syria.\"- US Defense Secretary Ash CarterAs raids were\ncarried out in Europe, U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter announced that ISIS’\nNo. 2 man, Abd al-Rahman Mustafa al-Qaduli, had been taken out in a Thursday\nraid in Syria. Elimination of the terror group’s money man was prompted by\nTuesday’s attacks in Brussels that killed 31 and injured 270, and could cut\noff funding for subsequent operations, Carter said.“The removal of this ISIL\nleader will hamper the organization’s ability to conduct operations both\ninside and outside of Iraq and Syria,\" Carter said.   The French suspect, Reda\nKriket, had been convicted in absentia of terrorist activities last year along\nwith Abdelhamid Abaaoud, the suspected ringleader of the deadly Nov. 13\nattacks in Paris. Prosecutors said both men took part in a recruiting network\nfor jihad in Syria. Abaaoud was killed in France in November in a raid\nfollowing the attacks he masterminded.Kriket's arrest in France led to a sweep\nin Belgium Friday. Kriket was in the \"advanced stages\" of a plot to attack a\ntarget in France, according to French Interior Minister Bernard\nCazeneuve.Tuesday’s coordinated attacks in Belgium, first at Zaventem Airport\noutside Brussels, where 11 people were killed, and then, 79 minutes later, at\na metro station, where 20 were killed, left another 270 injured. The November\nattacks in Paris killed 130.ISIS has claimed credit for both attacks, and the\nclose ties of the bombers and suspects involved in each suggests the attackers\nmay have been part of the same cell, according to authorities.Brussels police\non Friday arrested three suspects with ties to Kriket. They were nabbed in\ndifferent districts of the Belgian capital -- Schaerbeek, Forest and Saint-\nGilles. One suspect was shot by police in Schaerbeek in a dramatic takedown\ncaptured on cellphone video.A memorial to the Belgium terror victims in\nBrussels Wednesday. (Fox News) State broadcaster RTBF quoted mayor Bernard\nClerfayt as saying the unidentified suspect had been “neutralized,” but did\nnot say if he was killed or merely wounded.Also Friday, German prosecutors\nsaid they were investigating whether a Moroccan man detained in central\nGermany had any connection to the Brussels attacks.Prosecutors in Giessen said\nFriday the 28-year-old, whom they didn't identify, was picked up early\nThursday because he didn't have valid ID. They said they found documents\nindicating that he had been in the Brussels area recently and seized a\ncellphone that they are now evaluating.Der Spiegel magazine and two public\nbroadcasters are saying the man received two suspicious text messages on the\nday of the Brussels attacks. Officials established that he had previously\nentered Germany under various aliases and sought asylum, and that he is known\nto police in Italy, according to prosecutors.Investigators say a man arrested\nin Belgium Thursday is believed to be one of two remaining “mystery men” from\nTuesday’s attacks – a man seen in the metro station and believed to have\nsurvived the attack. That leaves one other man suspected of direct involvement\nin the attacks at large, the man seen in an airport surveillance photo\nalongside two suicide bombers moments before at least two blasts ripped\nthrough the airport, killing dozens of people including at least two\nAmericans.Known to have been killed in the two attacks are Ibrahim El Bakraoui\nand Najim Laachraoui, who blew themselves up at the airport, killing 11; and\nEl Bakraoui's brother, Khalid El Bakraoui, who blew himself up in the metro\nstation and was seen with an accomplice.In all, seven people have been\narrested in Belgium in connection with the attacks.

(AP)Chelsea Clinton, in an implicit swipe at the\nimpact of President Obama's health care law, recently told voters that many\nAmericans still are facing \"crushing costs\" from health insurance even under\nthe Affordable Care Act. The comments were captured in a video posted this\nweek. In her remarks, Clinton said her mother -- presidential candidate\nHillary Clinton -- could use executive action to curb those costs. “We can\neither do that directly or through tax credits. And, kind of figuring out\nwhether she could do that through executive action, or she would need to do\nthat through tax credits working with Congress. She thinks either of those\nwill help solve the challenge of kind of the crushing costs that still exist\nfor too many people who even are part of the Affordable Care Act,” she said in\nthe video, initially flagged by The Weekly Standard.The video appears to be\nfrom a Hillary Clinton town hall event this past Tuesday at the Advanced\nTechnology Center at Bates Technical College in Tacoma, Wash. It's just the\nlatest controversial comment from a member of the Clinton family; former\nPresident Bill Clinton lamented the “awful legacy of the last eight years”\nearlier this week while stumping for his wife, though a spokesman later said\nhe was referring to Republicans during the Obama administration. On health\ncare, Hillary Clinton herself has staunchly defended the Affordable Care Act,\nwhile saying she would take any steps necessary to fix problems in the system.\nThe latest headlines on the 2016 elections from the biggest name in politics.\nSee Latest Coverage →In a January debate, she said, “As president, I'll defend\nthe Affordable Care Act, build on its successes, and go even further to reduce\ncosts. My plan will crack down on drug companies charging excessive prices,\nslow the growth of out-of-pocket costs, and provide a new credit to those\nfacing high health expenses.”In December, Hillary Clinton was asked by a\nquestioner at a town hall event why companies are favoring part-time\nemployment over full-time employment. Clinton responded by saying, “the\nAffordable Care Act. You know, we got to change that because we have built in\nsome unfortunate incentives that discourage full-time employment.”A report\nfrom Freedom Partners released earlier this month states that the cost of\nhealth care premiums have outgrown both wages and normal inflation, resulting\nin an average rise of 28 percent from 2009 to 2014.“With health care costs\nstill rising faster than inflation six years after passage of the Affordable\nCare Act, it is clear that the law is not helping lower the burden of health\ncare expenses for American families,” the report states._FoxNews.com's Danny\nJativa contributed to this report.___\n\n","title":"Chelsea Clinton laments 'crushing' health care costs despite ObamaCare | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"RT @foxnewspolitics: Chelsea Clinton laments 'crushing' health care costs despite ObamaCare  https://t.co/wXlpRFN9cR #FNPolitics https://t.…","date":"Fri Mar 25 16:48:09 +0000 2016","favs":null,"id":{"$numberLong":"713407130598936576"},"retweets":87},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1pM5CPX"}

He\nwas never formally charged during his two years in detention. (AP\nPhoto/Mohamed el Raai) (The Associated Press)An Egyptian youth arrested two\nyears ago for wearing a T-shirt with a slogan against torture was released\nearly Friday, his brother said.Mahmoud Mohammed Ahmed, 20, was freed from a\nCairo police station more than 12 hours after a court in the Egyptian capital\nupheld another court's order to release him. The prosecution had appealed the\nearlier ruling.Wearing a white T-shirt and a matching baseball cap, he stepped\nout of the station to a welcome by his brother, Tarek Mohammed Ahmed, and a\nsmall crowd of lawyers, rights activists and friends.Mahmoud was 18 and a high\nschool student when he was arrested on Jan. 25, 2014 -- the third anniversary\nof the uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak and a day that saw deadly\nstreet clashes between police and protesters.He was detained on his way home\nfrom a rally marking the anniversary, at a checkpoint north of Cairo, and\naccused by police of taking part in unauthorized demonstrations, possession of\nexplosives and paying money on behalf of the now-banned Muslim Brotherhood\ngroup to others to take part in protests. He was never formally charged.When\narrested, he was wearing a T-shirt with the slogan \"A nation without torture\"\n-- which turned his case into a cause celebre for Egyptian rights activists\ncampaigning for an end to police abuses.His brother and one of his lawyers,\nMukhtar Munir, have maintained that Mahmoud was tortured in the early stages\nof his detention and deprived of many of his rights. He had leg surgery in\n2010 for a condition stemming from a bad childhood fall. In detention, the\ncondition of the leg deteriorated because of lack of adequate medical\nattention, they said. He now limps and walks slowly, using a cane for\nsupport.Since Mahmoud's arrest, his older brother Tarek, also an activist, has\ncampaigned for his release, using social media, TV appearances and press\ninterviews.Mahmoud's letters to friends and relatives smuggled out of prison\nand seen by the AP testify to both his young age and activism. They are\nadorned by drawings of Mickey Mouse, smiley faces or flowers. One letter to\nhis brother says: \"I am positive that the day will come when we will do\neverything without fearing prison or oppression.\" In another note, he wrote:\n\"We will die when we stop dreaming.\"His detention was part of the crackdown\noverseen by President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi who the year before, as military\nchief, led the July 2013 ouster of Egypt's elected president, the Islamist\nMohammed Morsi, following mass protests against his divisive rule.The\ncrackdown has primarily targeted Morsi's Brotherhood supporters but secular,\npro-democracy activists have not been spared. Mahmoud's case drew the\nattention of rights groups at home and abroad, mostly because of his young age\nand the circumstances of his arrest.Amnesty International in January said his\ndetention was an \"utter disgrace\" and an \"affront to justice.\"\"No one should\nbe arrested or detained simply because of slogans on the T-Shirt or scarf they\nhave chosen to wear, let alone imprisoned for two years and facing torture and\nother ill-treatment in detention,\" said Said Boumedouha, Amnesty's deputy\ndirector for Mideast and North Africa.__\n\n","title":"Egypt frees 20-year-old arrested for anti-torture T-shirt | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"#Egypt frees 20-year-old arrested for anti-torture T-shirt | #FOXNewsWorld | https://t.co/t9a05t1y70","date":"Fri Mar 25 15:57:04 +0000 2016","favs":97,"id":{"$numberLong":"713394276076429312"},"retweets":48},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1pLX7nU"}

(AP/SANA)Syrian government forces\nrecaptured a Mamluk-era citadel in Palmyra from the extremist Islamic State\ngroup on Friday, Syrian state media and monitoring groups said, as the fierce\nbattle for control of the historic town entered its third day.Syrian and\nRussian warplanes struck at least 56 targets inside IS-held areas of the city\nand pro-government militias supported the army's advance, said the Syrian\nObservatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based monitoring group.Palmyra has\nbeen controlled by the extremist group since May.

(AP)SEOUL, South\nKorea –  An American detained in North Korea said he had spied against the\ncountry and asked for forgiveness at a media presentation Friday, nine days\nafter a U.S. tourist was sentenced to 15 years in prison with hard labor for\nsubversion.Kim Tong Chol told a press conference in Pyongyang that he had\ncollaborated with and spied for South Korean intelligence authorities in a\nplot to bring down the North's leadership and tried to spread religious ideas\namong North Koreans.Describing his acts as \"shameful and ineffaceable,\" Kim\nsaid he feels sorry for his crime and appealed to North Korean authorities to\nshow him mercy by forgiving him.He was born in South Korea and became a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen. In an interview with CNN in January, Kim said he\nlived in Fairfax, Virginia, before moving in 2011 to Yangji, a city near the\nChinese-North Korean border. He said he commuted daily to Rason, a special\neconomic zone in North Korea, where he was president of a trade and hotel\nservices company.He said in the Pyongyang press conference that he was\ndetained in Rason last October.North Korean authorities often arrange press\nconferences for U.S. and other foreign detainees in which they read statements\nto acknowledge their wrongdoing and praise the North's political system. Those\ndetainees have said after their releases that they were coached or coerced on\nwhat to say.South Korea's National Intelligence Service, the country's main\nspy agency, said Kim's case wasn't related to the organization in any way and\noffered no further comment.On March 16, North Korea's highest court sentenced\nOtto Warmbier, a 21-year-old University of Virginia undergraduate, to prison\nafter he confessed he tried to steal a propaganda banner as a trophy for an\nacquaintance who wanted to hang it in her church. He tearfully confessed at\nhis press conference to the attempted theft, which would be grounds in North\nKorea for a subversion charge.The U.S. government condemned the sentence and\naccused North Korea of using such American detainees as political pawns.The\nNorth's actions on the two American detainees came as it faces mounting\npressure from the United States, South Korea and their allies following its\nnuclear weapons test and long-range rocket launch earlier this year. In recent\ndays, North Korea's state media has conducted weapons launches and issued\nwarlike rhetoric to attack Seoul and Washington in response to ongoing annual\nmilitary drills between the allies that it sees as an invasion\nrehearsal.Outside analysts say North Korea often attempts to use foreign\ndetainees to wrest outside concessions. North Korea in the past released some\nU.S. detainees after high-profile American figures visited the country.North\nKorea is currently holding three South Koreans and a Canadian pastor for what\nit calls espionage and attempts to establish churches and use religion to\ndestroy the North's system.  \n__\n\n","title":"North Korea presents another American detainee in front of media | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"North Korea presents another American detainee to the media https://t.co/WQ7H3BMAz6","date":"Fri Mar 25 10:27:55 +0000 2016","favs":36,"id":{"$numberLong":"713311441940418560"},"retweets":82},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1pLq836"}

See Latest Coverage →Bill Whalen, politics\nresearch fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, said the\nbattle will be waged across a diverse population, which ranges from the Latino\nstrongholds of Southern California to the wealthy Silicon Valley tech elites\nin the north to the socially conservative evangelicals of the \"inland\nempire.\"The successful candidate here will have to navigate those ramparts and\neverything in between. The most recent poll shows front-runner Trump with the\nedge. According to a Public Policy Institute of California poll of likely\nvoters taken in the 12-day period leading up to Marco Rubio’s departure from\nthe race on March 15, Trump had a comfortable lead in the state with 38\npercent, followed by Ted Cruz with 19 percent and John Kasich with 12 percent.\nAfter Rubio suspended his campaign, the PPIC recalculated, taking Rubio out of\nthe mix and working in voters' second choice. This gave Cruz a bump to 27\npercent and Kasich to 14 percent, while Trump remained at 38 percent. Whalen,\nthough, said Cruz could have an advantage. “There’s going to be a premium on\nthe ground organization and that favors Cruz,” he said.As of this week’s\ncontests, Trump has 739 delegates, Cruz has 465, and Kasich has 143. One of\nthese candidates has to reach 1,237 to win the nomination outright, or else\nthe process moves to a contested convention this summer. The way California's\nprimary system is set up, the winning candidate there has the potential to\ntake home a huge stash of delegates. That's because the 172 delegates will be\nawarded by congressional district, meaning the three delegates in each of the\n53 districts go to the winner of that district -- plus 13 bonus delegates to\nthe candidate who gets the most votes statewide.“I think California is going\nto matter a lot,” Gonzales said, adding, “It’s going to be a challenge for\nthese candidates. There are hundreds of miles of opportunity to make their\nmark.” Candidates stand to win or lose not only in the state’s few GOP\nbastions like the Central Valley 23rd District -- home to House Majority\nLeader Kevin McCarthy -- but in congressional districts that are typically a\nno-go for Republicans, like the 13th, which includes Berkeley and Oakland and\nwent 87 percent for President Obama in 2012.It doesn’t matter the district;\neach has three delegates in play. While candidates will have difficulty\ntraveling to each district and television media in the state is expensive,\nresources will have to concentrate on direct mail and targeted email, Internet\nadvertising and social media, said Gonzales. Candidates will need a game plan\nto solidify the voters already in their corners, and reach out to new ones who\ncould help tip the scales on June 7.California also is a closed primary, which\nmeans only Republicans can vote -- a potential plus for Cruz, who has done\nbetter in closed state primaries and caucuses.So what does the California\nRepublican look like?According to David Brady, political science professor at\nStanford University, it depends where you go.“California Republicans are\nsomewhat divided, with the majority being fiscal conservatives, but more\nsocially liberal than Republicans in other regions of the country,” he said.\n“This is particularly true in the coastal populated regions while the interior\nhas more social conservatives which is associated with evangelicals.”He\npredicted \"Cruz will do well in the interior regions\" and could pick up\nsupport from voters opposing Trump. \"However, in terms of pure ideology, most\ncoastal Republicans are closer to Kasich,” he said.As far as issues go, Whalen\nnoted that what plays in the rest of the country is resonating in California,\ntoo. “The California Republican Party is a microcosm of the national GOP,” he\nsaid. “The party is struggling over immigration.” Brady added that the economy\nand terrorism continue to be hot-button issues in the state, with the water\nshortage of local importance.\n\n","title":"Plot twist: Long ignored, California could be deciding factor in GOP race | Fox News","twitter":{"body":"Plot twist: Long ignored, California could be deciding factor in GOP race  https://t.co/nS6aIzPS8H https://t.co/BVrf6To1P7","date":"Fri Mar 25 03:57:03 +0000 2016","favs":261,"id":{"$numberLong":"713213077840203777"},"retweets":114},"topic":"all","source":"FoxNews","link":"http://fxn.ws/1ZxNiWL"}
