VWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama on Saturday once called again for tighter\u000acontrols on "weapons of war" after a gunman killed three people and wounded\u000anine more Friday at a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado.In a statement,\u000aObama said the gunman used an assault weapon, "terrorizing an entire\u000acommunity" and killing a police officer and two people he had sought to\u000aprotect."This is not normal," Obama said. "We can't let it become normal. If\u000awe truly care about this \u2014 if we're going to offer up our thoughts and prayers\u000aagain, for God knows how many times, with a truly clean conscience \u2014 then we\u000ahave to do something about the easy accessibility of weapons of war on our\u000astreets to people who have no business wielding them. Period. Enough is\u000aenough."Obama has regularly issued calls for tighter restrictions on weapons\u000aafter mass shootings. Last month, Obama expressed frustration with the ready\u000aavailability of such weapons after a gunman killed 10 people after opening\u000afire in a classroom at a community college in Oregon. That shooting was the\u000afourth since August on a college campus.Obama, visibly angry, told reporters\u000ain October that the United States is "the only advanced country on earth that\u000asees these kinds of mass shootings every few months."The president concluded\u000ahis statement Saturday by praising the police officer from the University of\u000aColorado-Colorado Springs, Garrett Swasey, 44, who died while responding to\u000athe shooting."May God bless Officer Garrett Swasey and the Americans he tried\u000ato save \u2014 and may he grant the rest of us the courage to do the same thing,"\u000aObama said.\u000a\u000a

VPresident Obama said Wednesday's mass shooting in California is another moment\u000aof U.S. infamy that could have been prevented with stronger gun control\u000alaws."We have a pattern now of mass shootings in this country that has no\u000aparallel anywhere else in the world," Obama told CBS News after the shooting,\u000awhich left at least 14 dead and another 17 wounded. "There's some steps we\u000acould take, not to eliminate every one of these mass shootings, but to improve\u000athe odds that they don't happen as frequently."The killers in Wednesday's\u000ashooting walked into the meeting room at the Inland Regional Center, a state-\u000arun facility for individuals with developmental disabilities, and opened fire.\u000aThe motive for the shootings is unknown.Since 2006, there have been more than\u000a200 mass killings in the United States, according to a USA TODAY analysis of\u000aFBI and police data."We have a no-fly list where people can't get on planes\u000abut those same people who we don't allow to fly could go into a store right\u000anow in the United States and buy a firearm and there's nothing that we can do\u000ato stop them," Obama said. "That's a law that needs to be changed."In the wake\u000aof mass shootings, Obama has often spoken of his wish for tighter gun control.\u000aHe said the country needs "common-sense gun safety laws" and stronger\u000abackground checks on people buying guns."There are steps we can take to make\u000aAmericans safer and that we should come together in a bipartisan basis at\u000aevery level of government to make these (shootings) rare as opposed to\u000anormal," Obama said. "We should never think that this is something that just\u000ahappens in the ordinary course of events, because it doesn't happen with the\u000asame frequency in other countries."\u000a\u000a

VWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama announced a series of executive actions on guns\u000aTuesday, focusing on the victims of gun violence in a White House event\u000aintended to prod Congress to take further action.Speaking to an East Room\u000aaudience packed with the families of gun violence victims, gun owners and gun\u000acontrol advocates, an often emotional Obama broke into tears when talking\u000aabout the 20 first-graders gunned down at Sandy Hook Elementary School in\u000aConnecticut three years ago."First graders," he said, pausing to wipe away\u000atears and compose himself. "Every time I think about those kids, it gets me\u000amad."The executive actions \u2014 first previewed by the White House on Monday \u2014\u000awould attempt to clamp down on unlicensed gun sellers who exploit an exception\u000afor hobbyists and collectors in order to avoid having to run criminal\u000abackground checks on gun purchasers. Many of those sellers, Obama said, are\u000arunning a business by selling guns at gun shows and online."The problem is\u000athat some gun sellers have been operating by a different set of rules," he\u000asaid. "That doesn't make sense."Obama said the administration is also beefing\u000aup enforcement, streamlining the background check system, investing $500\u000amillion in mental health care and researching "smart gun" technology."If a\u000achild can't open a bottle of aspirin, we should make sure they can\u2019t pull a\u000atrigger on a gun," he said.Obama said the actions he's taking are consistent\u000awith gun rights."I believe in the Second Amendment. It\u2019s there written on\u000apaper. It guarantees the right to bear arms. No matter how much people try to\u000atwist my words around, I taught constitutional law. I know a little bit about\u000athis. I get it," he said. "This is not a plot to take away everybody's\u000aguns."But Obama argued that just like the First Amendment doesn't allow\u000asomeone to yell "fire" in a crowded theater, there are common-sense measures\u000athat could keep guns out out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them.\u000aAnd he argued that Second Amendment rights shouldn't infringe on the rights of\u000apeople to safely worship in Christian churches, Jewish synagogues, Sikh\u000atemples and Muslim mosques \u2014 all of which have been targets of gun violence in\u000arecent years. "They had rights, too," he said.Congressional Republicans had a\u000amixed reaction to Obama's announcemen**t**. \u201cThe president\u2019s actions are out\u000aof bounds and vastly exceed his executive authority," said House Oversight\u000aCommittee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who promised vigorous oversight\u000ahearings. But House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called the\u000aadditional guidance on firearms licenses a "weak gesture" that falls short of\u000awhat Obama really wanted to accomplish. Obama called on Americans to "demand a\u000aCongress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby's lies.""Instead of\u000afocusing on how to solve the problem, this has become one of out most\u000apolarized, partisan debates," Obama said a tone that moved from exasperation\u000ato incredulity. "How did we get here? How did we get to the place where people\u000athink expanded background checks is an excuse to take away people's guns?"\u000a\u000a

VPresident Obama says he will meet with Attorney General Loretta Lynch on\u000aMonday to discuss ways to use executive action to make it more difficult for a\u000a"dangerous few" to gain access to firearms.The president, who is vacationing\u000ain Hawaii, called the "epidemic of gun violence" one piece of "unfinished\u000abusiness" for his final year in office during his weekly radio address\u000aFriday."I get letters from responsible gun owners who grieve with us every\u000atime these tragedies happen; who share my belief that the Second Amendment\u000aguarantees a right to bear arms; and who share my belief we can protect that\u000aright while keeping an irresponsible, dangerous few from inflicting harm on a\u000amassive scale,\u201d Obama said."The gun lobby is loud and well-organized in its\u000adefense of effortlessly available guns for anyone," he said. "The rest of us\u000aare going to have to be just as passionate and well-organized in our defense\u000aof our kids."The president does not spell out any specific measures, but\u000arecently directed White House staff to look into potential executive actions,\u000asuch as expanding background checks.While federally licensed firearms dealers\u000amust seek background checks on potential firearm purchasers, there is no such\u000arequirement for those who sell firearms at gun shows, which are not federally\u000alicensed.A source familiar with the administration's efforts said Obama is\u000aexpected to take executive action next week that would set a "reasonable\u000athreshold" for when sellers have to seek a background check, the Associated\u000aPress reported. That person didn't know whether it would be based on the\u000anumber of guns sold or revenue generated through gun sales.The source, a\u000amember of a gun control advocacy group, was not authorized to discuss details\u000abefore the announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity. White House\u000aofficials won't confirm the timing, the AP reported.The Obama administration\u000ais also expected to** **impose tighter rules for reporting guns that get lost\u000aor stolen on their way to a buyer, _Politico_ reported**.**The National Rifle\u000aAssociation opposes expanding background check systems. The organization's\u000aInstitute for Legislative Action (ILA) says studies show that people sent to\u000astate prison because of crimes involving firearms typically get the weapons\u000athrough theft, the black market or family and friends."Facts tell us that\u000acriminalizing private transfers of firearms among family members and friends\u000aunder a universal background check system would do nothing to prevent 'gun\u000aviolence,' and importantly, would not have prevented the profound tragedies\u000athat gun banners use to promote such a system," the ILA said. "Perpetrators of\u000athose acts either successfully passed background checks to get the guns or\u000athey stole the guns."The group adds that many purchases of firearms by\u000acriminals are carried out by straw purchasers who pass background checks. "No\u000aamount of background checks can stop these criminals," says the group's\u000awebsite.Obama has often spoken out about gun violence, particularly after such\u000amass killings at the Sandy Hook school shootings in Newtown, Conn., in 2012\u000athat left 26 people dead, and the fatal shooting of nine people at a black\u000achurch in Charleston last summer."Last month, we remembered the third\u000aanniversary of Newtown,\u201d Obama said in his radio address, referencing the\u000amassacre that he has called the worst day of his presidency. "This Friday,\u000aI\u2019ll be thinking about my friend Gabby Giffords, five years into her recovery\u000afrom the shooting in Tucson. And all across America, survivors of gun violence\u000aand those who lost a child, a parent, a spouse to gun violence are forced to\u000amark such awful anniversaries every single day.\u201dHe notes that a bipartisan\u000abill from three years ago requiring background checks for virtually everyone\u000ahad huge support, including among a majority of NRA households. But the Senate\u000ablocked it. Since then, he said, tens of thousands of Americans have died as a\u000aresult of gun violence."Each time, we're told that commonsense reforms like\u000abackground checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before\u000athat, so we shouldn't do anything," he said. "We know that we can't stop every\u000aact of violence. But what if we tried to stop even one?"\u000a\u000a

VTalk of tighter gun control rules is giving a boost to gun stocks.Following\u000athe recent spate of mass shootings in California, Paris and other areas,\u000afirearms are back in the sights of politicians. That's stoking demand for guns\u000aby anyone who might want one and now fears they will get harder to\u000aobtain.Shares of three publicly traded stocks with the heaviest concentration\u000aon firearms --  Sturm, Ruger (RGR), Smith &amp; Wesson (SWHC) and ammo maker\u000aVista Outdoor (VSTO) --  have jumped 70% on average this year as investors\u000athink already-strong demand for guns could continue to increase as buyers rush\u000ato buy more.The gun companies' share growth has surpassed the 0.9% gain by the\u000aStandard &amp; Poor's 500 this year.Just Monday, their shares rose an average\u000aof of 5.2% as the broad market fell.That comes one day after New York City\u000aMayor Bill de Blasio put out a statement that advocated for the stop of "the\u000aflow of both public pension funds and private U.S. dollars into the hands of\u000agun manufacturers who make and market the assault weapons used by terrorists,\u000acriminals and the mentally ill."Investors are betting consumers afraid of new\u000agun rules will load up now for fear that new, more restrictive rules will be\u000apassed."The increased call for firearms laws, restrictions and regulations\u000aleads to the increased demand," for firearms, says  Brian Ruttenbur, analyst\u000aat BB&amp;T.Firearms sales are up 4.7% this year compared with the same period\u000ain 2014, Ruttenbur says, citing data from National Instant Criminal Background\u000aCheck System for consumer background gun checks.More Americans had their\u000abackgrounds checked purchasing guns on Black Friday than any day on record,\u000aaccording to data released by the FBI. The criminal background system\u000aprocessed 185,345 requests on Nov. 27, one of the largest retail sales days in\u000athe country.Background checks for handguns are up 12.3% this year compared\u000awith the same period last year, Ruttenbur says. The majority of both Smith\u000a&amp; Wesson and Sturm, Ruger's business come from handguns, he says.The surge\u000ain demand this year is largely the result of 2014 being a soft year for gun\u000asales. Gun sales weakened in 2014 following a massive jump in demand in 2013.\u000aThe Dec. 2012 mass shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown,\u000aConn. sparked a rush to arm up ahead of new gun control rules, which never\u000amaterialized."Surges in firearms sales are driven by the perceived threat of\u000agovernmental restrictions and regulations on firearms," Ruttenbur says.Smith\u000a&amp; Wesson and Sturm, Ruger are up 116% and 66% this year, respectively.\u000aThese companies have been direct beneficiaries from exceptionally strong\u000ahandgun demand.Analysts are especially bullish on demand for Smith &amp;\u000aWesson firearms. The company's revenue is expected to hit $613.7 million this\u000acalendar year, up 13% from last year, says S&amp;P Capital IQ. Analysts are\u000acalling for revenue at Sturm, Ruger to drop 2.1% this calendar year, but\u000abounce back 5.8% in calendar year 2016 to $563.7 million.That's not to say\u000amaking money on gun-related stocks is a certainty. Shares of Olin (OLN), which\u000ahas a number of chemicals businesses in addition to its Winchester gun unit,\u000aare down 16% this year. Cabela's (CAB), a retailer of a variety of outdoor\u000agear, including guns, has seen its shares slide nearly 14%.Additionally, much\u000aof the money for gun-stock investors has already been made by investors who\u000ajumped in before events in California. For instance, Sturm, Ruger shares have\u000abeen so strong that at $57.50 they've already blasted past the $53 price\u000atarget investors have for the stock in 18 months.But no matter what, news\u000arelated to the shootings only stokes a recovery in demand that was already\u000aoccurring. "We continue to believe that the firearms industry is in the\u000ainitial stages of a recovery in demand," Ruttenbur says._Contributing: Nick\u000aPenzenstadler_\u000a\u000a

VHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders faced off on Sunday night in Flint, Mich.,\u000aon the debate stage for the seventh time, just two days before the Michigan\u000aprimary.Here are all of the highlights; all times are Eastern.**10 p.m.:\u000a**Closing statements. Sanders focuses on his economic message and the crises\u000aaffecting Flint, adding, though, \u201cIt\u2019s not just in Flint, Mich.."\u201cIt is too\u000alate for establishment politics and establishment economics," he said. He also\u000ahit on the theme that's animated his campaign: \u201cWe need in this country a\u000apolitical revolution.\u201dClinton said her campaign was about taking on the many\u000abarriers facing many Americans, from student debt to \u201csystemic racism."**9:53\u000ap.m.**: A few questions about religion. Sanders is asked about his Judaism,\u000asaying "I am very proud to be Jewish, and being Jewish is so much of what I\u000aam." He cites the impact the Holocaust had on his family, saying his faith is\u000aan \u201cessential part of who I am as a human being."Clinton is asked who she\u000aprays for and says she prays for people she knows and those going through\u000aspecific difficult periods in their lives.She added: \u201cI pray for the will of\u000aGod to be known so that we can know it and to the best of our limited ability\u000atry to follow it and fulfill it.\u201d**9:49 p.m.**:Clinton is asked about her\u000aemails, which Trump promises to talk about daily. \u201cHis bigotry, his bullying,\u000ahis bluster are not going to wear well on the American people,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u000awill look forward to engaging him.\u201d Sanders cites polls showing him beating\u000aTrump by larger margins than Clinton does.**9:37 p.m**.:Clinton is asked\u000awhether she supports fracking. \u201cI don\u2019t support it when any locality or any\u000astate is against it,\u201d Clinton says, outlining conditions for fracking. There\u000aprobably aren\u2019t many places where it should be taking place, she says. My\u000aanswer is a lot shorter, says Sanders, explaining that he doesn\u2019t support\u000afracking.**9:25 p.m**.:The issue is education. The U.S. has one of the highest\u000achild poverty rates, says Sanders. \u201cThat is a disgrace,\u201d he says. The wealthy\u000awill start paying their fair share of taxes to make sure every child gets the\u000aquality education they need. Clinton wins applause when she says she would end\u000athe emergency management of the city of Detroit and turn schools back to local\u000aofficials. She would also support more federal help, she said, to bring more\u000ateachers into schools.Sanders said his campaign is about \u201cthinking big.\u201d He\u000abelieves public colleges should be tuition-free.**9:14 p.m.:**How would you\u000aimprove race relations?Sanders says Obama has given us a good base and\u000afoundation. He would make sure the Department of Justice investigates every\u000asuspicious killing, ends \u201cmilitarization of police departments,\u201d ends minimal\u000asentencing and give judges more discretion. Clinton is asked about her\u000aprevious comments calling some kids \u201csuper predators,\u201d and she says while she\u000awas referring to some drug cartels, that she regrets using the language.\u000aSanders uses the opportunity to hit her on another 1990s piece of legislation:\u000awelfare reform. Clinton said she disagrees with the way it was applied and\u000athat a lot of provisions were stripped out by Republicans.**9:05\u000ap.m**.:Sanders is asked what experiences he\u2019s had that help him understand\u000aother cultures. He mentions his early work on desegregating Chicago schools,\u000ato applause. Clinton goes back to when she was 14 years old and listened to\u000aDr. King speak, not directly answering the question. \u201cI know I\u2019ve never had\u000athe experience that so many people in this audience have had,\u201d she said. She\u000asaid she\u2019s asking white people to try to understand what it\u2019s like to be the\u000amother of an African-American child shot to death. \u201cIt is incredibly\u000ahumbling,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause I have not had the experience you have had.\u201d**9\u000ap.m**.:Clinton is asked about her husband\u2019s crime legislation that led to an\u000aunprecedented increase in incarceration of black males. Aspects of it \u201cwere a\u000amistake,\u201d she said. Sanders, too, supported the legislation. \u201cIn that bill\u000athere were some good provisions,\u201d including the Violence Against Women Act, he\u000asaid. \u201cAt the end of my first term we will not have more people in jail than\u000aany other country,\u201d he said.**8:50 p.m**.:The issue is guns. The father of a\u000ayoung girl shot by an Uber driver asks about what new laws should be passed.\u000a\u201cI don\u2019t want to hear anything about tougher laws for mental health or\u000abackground\u201d checks \u201cbecause that doesn\u2019t work,\u201d he said.Clinton hits Sanders\u000aon his vote for granting immunity for gun makers in a 2005 vote. \u201cWe should\u000avery seriously move to repeal that,\u201d she says.Sanders says no one can\u000aguarantee another mass shooting won\u2019t happen. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do everything we\u000apossibly can,\u201d he said, citing his D- rating from the NRA. He also cites his\u000aprior support for an assault weapons ban and agreed with Clinton on closing\u000athe so-called Charleston loophole that allowed shooter Dylann Roof to acquire\u000aa weapon before completing a background check.Does Sanders agree with the\u000aSandy Hook family lawsuit against the maker of the gun used in the massacre?\u000aSanders said if a gun company is knowingly selling guns into crime areas\u000athat\u2019s one thing, but suing any gun maker whose weapon happens to end up in\u000athe hands of someone who is mentally ill would effectively shut down gun\u000amanufacturing in the U.S., he said. Clinton said the gun industry is the only\u000aone in the U.S. with absolute immunity. "The gun companies sell guns to make\u000aas much money as they can," she says.**8:35 p.m**.:Sanders keeps up his\u000aassault on trade policies. Detroit went from being one of the richest cities\u000ain the 1960s to today one of the poorest. Wages are down even adjusted for\u000ainflation, he said. Clinton subtly raps him for focusing on the 1990s instead\u000aof the future and defends her husband\u2019s economic record and the U.S. Export-\u000aImport Bank. Sanders calls it the \u201cBank of Boeing.\u201d He says \u201cDemocrats have\u000anot always been right,\u201d including \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d and \u201cdisastrous trade\u000apolicies.\u201d**8:30 p.m.**:Sanders goes on the offense again, calling on Clinton\u000ato release transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street banks. Clinton\u000areprises her talking points on how she has talked tough to Wall Street and\u000asays current law allows the government to break up big banks if necessary. \u201cI\u000ahave said I would use the tools\u201d to break up big banks if they pose a systemic\u000athreat.**8:23 p.m.:**The issue is trade. Clinton touts her \u201cclawback tax\u201d to\u000apunish companies that move jobs overseas. Sanders takes a swipe at Clinton for\u000a\u201cgetting religion\u201d on trade. He says he was out protesting with unions in the\u000aearly 1990s to oppose free trade. Clinton counterpunches by saying that she\u000asupported the auto bailout and Sanders didn\u2019t.That draws a fierce rebuke from\u000aSanders, who calls it the \u201cWall Street bailout\u201d that ruined the economy.\u000aClinton says as a senator she voted against the only trade agreement that came\u000abefore her in the Senate. She again defends her vote on the auto bailout by\u000asaying it\u2019s what the state\u2019s two senators and President Obama wanted. \u201cThe\u000aauto industry would have collapsed, taking 4 million jobs with it,\u201d she\u000asaid.**8:16 p.m.:**The question is whether people should go to jail for what\u000ahappened in Flint. Clinton and Sanders say they\u2019ll support whatever the\u000aoutcome of the investigations are.Another Flint resident asks Clinton why\u000ashould the people of Flint believe \u201cyou aren\u2019t just using the crisis to score\u000apolitical points?\u201d Clinton cited her longtime advocacy on behalf of kids and\u000afamilies and the fact that she was meeting with residents as soon as the\u000acrisis became public. \u201cWhen I am president it will always be a priority for\u000aaction for me,\u201d she said.Sanders is also asked \u201cwhat took you so long?"\u000aSanders said he met \u201cprivately\u201d with parents and kids and cites a town hall\u000ameeting \u201cas nonpolitical as I could make it\u201d to tell the world through the\u000amedia what is happening. His whole career, he said, he\u2019s stood with poor\u000apeople and the unempowered.**8:10 p.m.:**The moderator asks why is more\u000agovernment the answer?\u201cMaybe you should let Wall Street come in and run the\u000acity,\u201d Sanders quips. Clinton says if EPA officials at any level were\u000aresponsible they should be fired. Sanders agrees, answering the question more\u000adirectly.**8:05 p.m.: **The first question is from a Flint resident about\u000awhat\u2019s needed to restore the trust of the city\u2019s residents in their water\u000asource. Clinton says everything that\u2019s done needs to be triple-checked to\u000aregain trust. \u201cYou bathe in it, you drink it, you wash food,\u201d she said.\u000aClinton said she\u2019s supporting a program to pay people in Flint to deliver the\u000awater while the pipes are being fixed. As president, she said she would also\u000aconcentrate resources for economic development, health and education.Sanders\u000aagain said \u201cwhat is going on is a disgrace beyond belief.\u201d He said if local\u000aand state government don\u2019t have the resources or fail to act, the federal\u000agovernment must act. The government should also come in and examine the\u000achildren to measure their lead levels.**8:03 p.m.:**Clinton begins her opening\u000astatement and also calls for Snyder\u2019s resignation, drawing applause. She says\u000aboth the state and federal government should be sending money to help the\u000acity. \u201cIt is raining lead in Flint and the state is derelict in not coming\u000aforward with the money needed.\u201d**8 p.m.:**Cooper gives a primer on Flint\u2019s\u000awater crisis, including the state government\u2019s failure to prevent lead-tainted\u000awater from flowing into the homes of the city\u2019s residents. Sanders was up\u000afirst and, in his opening statement, he talked about his meetings with city\u000aresidents affected. \u201cWhat I heard and what I saw literally shattered me and\u000awas beyond belief,\u201d  Sanders said. They \u201care being poisoned.\u201d Sanders repeated\u000ahis call on Gov. Rick Snyder to resign for \u201cdereliction of duty.\u201d He then\u000apivoted to his stump speech including income inequality and the need to\u000arebuild the nation\u2019s infrastructure grid.**7:57 p.m.: **CNN moderator Anderson\u000aCooper calls for a moment of silence for former first lady Nancy Reagan, who\u000apassed away earlier Sunday.Unlike past debates that were a bit slow to begin,\u000athe candidates are already on stage minutes before the debate's scheduled\u000astart.\u000a\u000a

VLONDON \u2014 Britain's Prince Charles said that climate change could be one of the\u000acauses of the civil war in Syria, terrorism and Europe's refugee\u000acrisis.Charles, a known environmental campaigner, is scheduled to give a\u000akeynote speech at the opening of the United Nations conference on climate\u000achange in Paris next week.In an interview with Sky News due to be aired\u000aMonday, the heir to the British throne said he was concerned that disaster\u000awould follow if issues such as global warming are not addressed more\u000aurgently.The interview was filmed three weeks ago, before the terror attacks\u000ain Paris that killed 130 people, Sky said."We're seeing a classic case of not\u000adealing with the problem, because, I mean, it sounds awful to say, but some of\u000aus were saying 20 years ago that if we didn't tackle these issues, you would\u000asee ever greater conflict over scarce resources and ever greater difficulties\u000aover drought, and the accumulating effect of climate change, which means that\u000apeople have to move," the prince told the broadcaster."And, in fact, there's\u000avery good evidence indeed that one of the major reasons for this horror in\u000aSyria, funnily enough, was a drought that lasted for about five or six years,\u000awhich meant that huge numbers of people in the end had to leave the\u000aland."Asked if there is a link between climate change, conflict and terrorism,\u000ahe said: "It's only in the last few years that the Pentagon has actually\u000astarted to pay attention to this. I mean, it has a huge impact on what is\u000ahappening."He also said he doubted whether the 118 leaders attending the Paris\u000atalks will be able to reach a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions.There's\u000abeen so many of these conferences that have happened over the years and I\u000athink I go back quite a long way on all this," he said.At least 250,000 people\u000ahave been killed and more than 4 million refugees have been forced to flee\u000aSyria \u2014 according to the UN \u2014 since the civil war started in 2011.\u000a\u000a

V**Here is a look at the major global conferences on climate change over the past 23 years:****Rio de Janeiro 1992:** For the first time, countries agree at an Earth Summit that climate change represents a \u201cserious worldwide risk.\u201d The UNFCCC, the United Nation's climate organization, was created.**Berlin 1995:** The first U.N. Conference of the Parties, or COP-1, summit is held.Children play around a big globe in Kyoto, Japan, on Nov. 29, 1997 in advance of the opening of the 3rd Conference of Parties to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. (Photo: Associated Press)**Kyoto 1997**: At the COP-3 summit, countries agree to terms for the Kyoto Protocol, which seeks to limit greenhouse gas emissions from 36 industrialized countries for the period 2008-12.**Bali 2007:** At the COP-13 talks, delegates agree to finalize a legally binding successor to the Kyoto Protocol within two years.Philippines President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo speaks in Copenhagen on Dec. 17, 2009, at the COP15 U.N. Climate Change Conference. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images)**Copenhagen 2009:** Despite great hype, including attendance from 119 heads of government, the COP-15 summit collapses with no treaty but establishes the long-term goal of keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). It says wealthy countries should provide $100 billion per year by 2020 to help poor countries adapt to climate change.**Durban 2011:** At COP-17 in South Africa, countries agree to make another attempt at finalizing a global climate deal by 2015.South Africans light up a Baobab tree in Durban on Nov. 30, 2011 as part of a renewable energies display during the U.N. Climate Change Conference. (Photo: AFP/Getty Images)**Paris 2015:** The COP-21 summit draws 195 countries and 147 government heads for two weeks of talks aimed at limiting global warming to \u201cwell below 2 degrees\u201d Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit),  provide poor countries with financing to meet the target temperature beyond 2020 and plan progressively lower emissions of climate-warming pollutants over time.\u000a\u000a

VAnthropogenic, or human-caused, climate change is widely discussed and being\u000awidely addressed by people, businesses, and governments alike. But what about\u000ahuman-caused weather?Nuclear and coal-fired power plants, because of the\u000aintense steam they emit, can produce in the areas surrounding them micro\u000ablizzards. Construction equipment such as towering cranes in urban areas can\u000afoster strong winds if not tornadoes. Data centers and black-top roofs,\u000adriveways, parking lots and road surfaces can create heat waves. Even the\u000aclothes on our backs can induce severe weather: manufacturing plants in China,\u000awhere much of our goods are made, spew pollution that travels across the ocean\u000aand exacerbates thunderstorms in the Pacific Northwest. From forest fires\u000abegun by people that blanket the atmosphere and cause cold waves, to condo\u000adevelopments that disturb water tables and feed hurricanes, the human\u000afingerprints on nature\u2019s weapon \u2014 weather \u2014 abound.The first-ever red alert\u000afor pollution issued in China this week due to the unhealthy air quality in\u000aBeijing is testimony to the fact that we humans are doing more than just\u000aabstractly damaging over time our climate and the environment, causing\u000aatmospheric conditions to change in myriad ways, including a steady rise in\u000aglobal temperatures. We are foiling conditions now.Resiliency and adaptation\u000aefforts need to be centered more fully in the spotlight. At the United Nations\u000aclimate negotiations in Paris, Secretary of State John Kerry announced that\u000athe U.S. will double its funding to $800 million a year by 2020 in grants to\u000avulnerable countries to help reduce climate risks. Still, funding for adaption\u000ameasures has fallen far short of commitments. At the U.N. climate meeting in\u000aCancun in 2010, $100 billion in funding had been targeted. A research report\u000aby the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates\u000athat only $62 billion has been committed.The reason the world needs more\u000ainvestment in infrastructure, agriculture, health and water services is that\u000aapproximately 7.3 billion people are at physical risk and subject to imminent\u000adanger due to climate change. Yes, that is the entire global population. And\u000amany \u2014 nearly two billion people \u2014 are in the direct line of fire. They are\u000aamong the world\u2019s poorest who live in more vulnerable places. It\u2019s in these\u000aareas that large, industrial and utility operations also make their homes\u000abecause land values are inexpensive and it\u2019s cheaper to operate. The cycle of\u000adestruction and repercussion isn\u2019t hard to imagine or see for yourself.When I\u000avisited Linfen, China \u2014  for years called the world\u2019s dirtiest city because of\u000aits poor air quality \u2014 I could barely see my own hand in front of my face at\u000acertain times of the day, mostly at dusk when pollution is universally at its\u000aworst. Millions of people live in the Shanxi province where Linfen is located\u000aand are affected.You don\u2019t have to travel to Mongolia to experience this\u000aplight. Winds carry pollutants from there to the U.S. West Coast, so much so\u000athat efforts need to be nearly doubled to combat ozone level rise in the\u000aregion.To be sure, we should acknowledge the climate in general is changing\u000aand do something about it. Let\u2019s not forget about weather vulnerability due to\u000aour own actions, too.The Federal Emergency Management Agency has devised a\u000adisaster plan to ready the nation for what may be record severe weather this\u000awinter on account of the strong El Niño. Mind their advice; no matter if by\u000ahuman hand or nature\u2019s wrath, both can be responsible._Thomas M.

VWASHINGTON \u2014 Millennials have a message for the next president.Get serious\u000aabout converting to renewable energy, the under-35 generation says by an\u000aoverwhelming margin, and require every gun buyer to undergo a background\u000acheck. They endorse putting body cameras on police officers and accepting\u000arefugees from war-torn countries such as Syria.A USA TODAY/Rock the Vote\u000aMillennial Poll finds an emerging generation that is more pragmatic than\u000aideological and not yet firmly aligned with either political party. Donald\u000aTrump leads the Republican field among millennials, and Vermont Sen. Bernie\u000aSanders the Democratic one \u2014 especially among millennial women. Across\u000apartisan lines, millennials have reached a generational consensus on some of\u000athe major issues that have proved divisive for their elders.What is less\u000acertain, the national survey shows, is whether they'll bother to vote in 2016,\u000aeven in an election where they identify an agenda they call crucial.President\u000aObama is preparing to deliver his State of the Union Address before a joint\u000asession of Congress on Tuesday night, and the contests to win the Democratic\u000aand Republican nominations to succeed him begin in just three weeks \u2014 an apt\u000amoment to look at attitudes of a demographic tide that over time is likely to\u000areshape American politics. The poll is part of USA TODAY's One Nation\u000ainitiative, a series of forums across the country on the most important issues\u000aof 2016.USA TODAY Network's One Nation is a series of 10 forums in 10 cities\u000aon topics shaping the presidential election. (Photo: USA TODAY)The online\u000asurvey by Ipsos, the first of four this year in conjunction with Rock the\u000aVote, was taken last Monday through Thursday of 1,141 adults, ages 18 through\u000a34. The credibility interval, akin to a margin of error, is plus or minus 3.5\u000apercentage points."I'm a voter," declares Stephanie Acs, 27, a Navy veteran\u000anow attending school in Albuquerque who was among those polled. "If I have a\u000aview on something, I don't just post it on Facebook or Twitter." But Dewayne\u000aSmithy, 33, of Baldwin, Miss., dismisses the idea that casting a ballot is\u000alikely to make a difference. "I can't really find a candidate that I like, for\u000aone thing," he said in a follow-up phone interview.The top issue by far for\u000amillennials is the economy, including concerns about jobs, the minimum wage\u000aand paid leave. On that, millennials have the same pocketbook focus as baby\u000aboomers and Gen Xers. "I want to make sure the economy is flourishing," says\u000aMisha Shah, 32, of Chicago, an account executive for a tech firm that sells\u000anetworking and storage. "When the economy slows down, it's a domino effect.\u000aThat's when companies start getting leaner" and layoffs can threaten.The\u000aeconomy also matters to Yendri Badilla, 26, of Lakewood, N.J., now juggling\u000athree jobs to make ends meet.Their second-ranking issue is specific to their\u000astage of life: college affordability and student debt. That's followed closely\u000aby foreign policy and terrorism, health care and guns. A combination of those\u000awho cite climate change and those who cite energy puts that issue in the top\u000arank as well.Brianne Stone, 29, of Huntsville, Ala., says her biggest concern\u000ais global warming. "We aren't going to take any actions, and by the time that\u000awe do, it's going to be the point that it's too late," she says. She wants the\u000acandidates "first and foremost to admit that it's a real thing.""If we don't\u000ahave a place to live, then it doesn't really make sense to worry about\u000aanything else," agrees Scott McGeary, 34, of Seattle, citing the threat of\u000aclimate change to the future of the planet.By an overwhelming 80%-10%, those\u000asurveyed say the United States should transition to mostly clean or renewable\u000aenergy by 2030, an ambitious goal that would surely require the leadership of\u000athe next president. By more than 2-1, they say the government should invest\u000amore heavily in buses and rail.By a lopsided 82%-12%, millennials support\u000abackground checks for all gun purchasers. While that's an issue that splits\u000acongressional Democrats and Republicans, there is almost no partisan divide on\u000ait among millennials: 89% of young Democrats and 83% of young Republicans\u000aendorse universal background checks.By double digits, those surveyed say\u000astricter gun laws would help prevent gun violence, though they blame failures\u000ain the mental-health system, not gun laws, for mass shootings. And a 58%\u000amajority want to protect the Second Amendment right of Americans to buy\u000aguns."I'm all for the Second Amendment and protecting it," says Jorge Antonio\u000aVillasenor Llamas, 31, of Tujunga, Calif., but he was shocked when he heard\u000aabout the so-called gun show loophole that allows some purchasers to bypass\u000abackground checks. "It kind of scares me," he says.When it comes to public\u000apolicy, millennials aren't reliably liberal or conservative.On economic\u000aissues, more call themselves conservative (38%) than liberal (33%). By a wider\u000amargin, on foreign policy, they also are inclined to describe themselves as\u000aconservative (37% to 28%). It is on social issues that they lean left: 42% say\u000athey're liberal, 32% call themselves conservative on questions including race\u000arelations and gay rights.Even so, voters under 35 have a partisan tilt: 41%\u000aidentify with the Democratic Party, just 28% with the GOP. That presumably\u000ameans the Republican Party's stance on social issues is undercutting its\u000apotential appeal to millennials on foreign policy and the economy."They are\u000ajust campaigning based on hate and intolerance and not anything positive and\u000anot anything constructive," says Robert Pelletier, 34, of Blairs, Va. He\u000aprobably will support Democrat Hillary Clinton. "The other side isn't giving\u000ame any options."Donald Trump easily leads the field among younger Republicans\u000aand independents, at 26%, but that is a lower level of support that the\u000abillionaire businessman now holds in the overall electorate. He is backed by\u000a34% of GOP voters in the RealClearPolitics average of recent national\u000asurveys."I'm not really sure where I stand on him right now," says Acs, the\u000astudent from New Mexico and a Republican. Trump's support nationwide and in\u000akey states means "he must be doing something right," she says, "but I don't\u000aknow if I would vote for him."No other Republican contender seems to have\u000abroken through, at least not yet. Retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson,\u000aFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Texas Sen. Ted\u000aCruz are bunched within 3 points of one another. Other contenders are in low\u000asingle digits.Donald Trump poses with supporters after a campaign rally on\u000aDec. 21, 2015, in Grand Rapids, Mich. (Photo: Carlos Osorio, AP)On the\u000aDemocratic side, among the overall electorate in national polls, Clinton now\u000aleads Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by close to 20 percentage points. But\u000aSanders, the oldest candidate running, has captured the allegiance of younger\u000avoters. The 73-year-old democratic socialist from the Green Mountain State is\u000aleading Clinton, 46%-35%, among millennial Democrats and independents."The\u000aBernie Sanders thing has really got me on board," says McGeary, an IT\u000aprofessional from Seattle. "I was pretty cynical at first about the whole\u000amovement \u2014 I mean, I supported it, but I had no idea it would pick up this\u000akind of steam." He praises Sanders' reliance on small donors and lumps Clinton\u000ain with the Republican field as "people who keep protecting corporations\u000ainstead of people."Indeed, he says he might leave the country if Sanders isn't\u000aelected because of his frustration that the United States isn't doing more to\u000aaddress issues such as social inequality and health care.There is an age\u000adivide within the millennial generation. Among those 18 to 25 years old,\u000aSanders has a big lead. Among those 26 to 34, Clinton has a small edge.There\u000ais a gender gap as well \u2014 and not the one that favors Clinton among baby\u000aboomer women. Men under 35 support Sanders by 4 percentage points. Women back\u000ahim by almost 20 points. The possibility of breaking new ground by electing\u000athe first female president apparently carries less persuasive power among\u000ayounger women than their mothers' generation.Stone is ready to support\u000aClinton, though she prefers Sanders. "He's actually talking about breaking up\u000athe big banks and helping income inequality," she says, "and given that I'm\u000acurrently unemployed, income inequality is pretty important."By 2-1,\u000amillennials see police violence against African Americans as a problem, and\u000athree-fourths say the government should require police officers to wear body\u000acameras to protect citizens. Two-thirds support reducing the prison sentences\u000afor people convicted of non-violent crimes such as drug possession.There is\u000aless consensus when it comes to fighting terrorism: 47% say the United States\u000ashould commit troops on the ground to combat the self-proclaimed Islamic\u000aState; 37% disagree. On this issue, there is a partisan divide: a 69% majority\u000aof Republicans support deploying ground forces; a 45% plurality of Democrats\u000aoppose the idea.By 53%-37%, younger Americans say the United States should\u000aaccept refugees from foreign conflicts such as in Syria, a question that has\u000ainflamed the Republican presidential contest. On that, Democratic millennials\u000asupport the idea by more than 2-1; a majority of Republicans oppose it.\u000aDemocrats overwhelmingly say the United States should help alleviate extreme\u000apoverty in other countries as a way to combat extremism; Republicans split\u000aevenly on the question.The threat of terrorism by radical extremists has\u000ahelped shape the millennial generation the way the Cold War shaped baby\u000aboomers. The millennials were between 4 and 20 years old when the 9/11\u000aattackers struck in 2001; now some have served themselves in the wars in Iraq\u000aand Afghanistan.The rising generation is distinctive in other ways as well \u2014\u000afrom adopting new technology to dealing with an economy in which wages have\u000along been stagnant for most workers. The U.S. Census Bureau says millennials,\u000anow numbering 75.3 million, in 2015 surpassed baby boomers as the largest\u000aliving generation.Other national polls have found fears that the classic\u000aAmerican dream is imperiled. If so, this is the generation most likely to\u000asuffer the consequences.Alex Martinson, of Westport, Conn., peels off an "I\u000aVoted" sticker to hand out to residents leaving a polling place on Nov. 4,\u000a2014. (Photo: Charles Krupa, AP)That said, the USA TODAY/Rock the Vote poll\u000afound a generally upbeat attitude: 57% say they are optimistic about the\u000afuture of the United States; 34% are pessimistic.They see many ways in which\u000aan individual can bring about change, including volunteering in their\u000acommunity or running for office themselves. But the message they send about\u000avoting is mixed: Only a third say they're likely to vote in the Republican\u000aprimaries. Four in 10 say they're likely to vote in the Democratic primaries.\u000aSix in 10 say they are likely to vote in November.Fifty-five percent agree\u000a"there are better ways to make a difference than voting." But three of four\u000aalso say voting is a way to change things in their communities and have an\u000aimpact on issues they care about. A majority say their vote could decide an\u000aelection."These poll numbers should put to rest the notion that Millennials\u000aare unaware of the value of their vote," said Ashley Spillane, president of\u000aRock the Vote. "But the numbers also underscore how critical the work we do to\u000aengage young people in the entire civic process \u2014 from demystifying\u000aregistration and voting to providing key information about candidates and\u000aissues. It's on all of us to make sure new voter to know how much critical\u000athey are to the future of our democracy.""You are getting something given to\u000ayou and it's a gift; a lot of people in other countries don't have that\u000aright," says Badilla, the New Jersey woman who is working three jobs \u2014 as a\u000areceptionist at a car dealership and at a coffee shop during the week, then as\u000aan accountant for her uncle on weekends. Her parents were immigrants. "I was\u000araised to believe that every vote makes a difference. You never know if yours\u000ais the one vote that will tip the scales for the right president."\u000a\u000a

VDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 European leaders warned Thursday that the continent's\u000arefugee crisis is growing, and if it's not brought under control by spring, it\u000acould push the region past the breaking point."We see today that in the first\u000athree weeks of the year, there were 35,000 people crossing the (Aegean Sea to\u000aGreece) from Turkey," Mark Rutte, Holland's prime minister, said. "Last year,\u000ait was only 1,600 in the full month of January. When spring comes, the numbers\u000awill quadruple. We can't cope with these numbers any longer."Millions of\u000amigrants from the Middle East have made their way through Turkey en route to\u000anorthern Europe.Rutte said the European Union has six to eight weeks to get a\u000agrip on the crisis, echoing similar remarks made this week by European Council\u000aPresident Donald Tusk."When spring comes, the number of refugees coming out of\u000aTurkey and Lebanon and other countries through Greece and the Western Balkans\u000aand into the rest of European Union (will rise)," Rutte said.He spoke at a\u000apanel discussion on Europe's future during the World Economic Forum's annual\u000ameeting.Rutte said the immediate priority for policymakers is to make a\u000asuccess of an EU plan with Turkey to limit the number of people trying to\u000areach Europe from its territory. He said it was  necessary to ensure that\u000ameasures to more equitably redistribute asylum seekers across the 28-nation EU\u000awere working. The EU has admitted they are not.Alexis Tsipras, Greece's prime\u000aminister, was on the same panel. "What is happening in the Aegean is a great\u000ashame for our common European culture and civilization. On a daily basis we\u000aare faced with a death toll in the sea because (people) traffickers are\u000aworking there unimpeded," he said.German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble\u000asaid the entire European political leadership agreed the influx was too high,\u000abut  it would be a "disgrace if Europe were turned into a fortress."Nearly\u000a4,000 people drowned trying to reach Europe in 2015, the United Nations'\u000arefugee agency estimated. This year, 95 people have died crossing the\u000aMediterranean Sea, according to the International Organization for\u000aMigration.After a separate presentation on the subject by the Swedish\u000adelegation, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven told USA TODAY  he was not "naive\u000aenough to think that" getting all 28 EU member states to live up to their\u000aresponsibilities over the crisis "was going to be easy." Löfven was flanked by\u000aMorgan Johansson, his migration minister, who said Sweden had not discussed\u000athe idea of putting a "ceiling" on the number of asylum seekers it\u000aaccepts."What do you do when you reach that ceiling? We are bound by the\u000aGeneva Convention on our duty to accept refugees," he said.Sweden has taken in\u000a160,000 refugees, double the amount it allowed in during the Balkan Wars in\u000athe 1990s. On a per capita basis, the country has absorbed more refugees than\u000aGermany, which has let in 1 million people fleeing conflict zones from\u000aAfghanistan to Eritrea to Syria.In the past four months, Johannson said,\u000a26,000 unaccompanied minors have crossed into Swedish territory.Löfven,\u000aSweden's leader, downplayed a recent spat with Denmark after the two nations\u000aaccused each other of exacerbating the crisis by imposing border controls."I\u000ahave a very good relationship with the Danish prime minister," Löfven said.\u000a"We phone one another and send text messages."\u000a\u000a

VDAVOS, Switzerland \u2014 European leaders warned Thursday that the continent's\u000arefugee crisis is growing, and if it's not brought under control by spring, it\u000acould push the region past the breaking point."We see today that in the first\u000athree weeks of the year, there were 35,000 people crossing the (Aegean Sea to\u000aGreece) from Turkey," Mark Rutte, Holland's prime minister, said. "Last year,\u000ait was only 1,600 in the full month of January. When spring comes, the numbers\u000awill quadruple. We can't cope with these numbers any longer."Millions of\u000amigrants from the Middle East have made their way through Turkey en route to\u000anorthern Europe.Rutte said the European Union has six to eight weeks to get a\u000agrip on the crisis, echoing similar remarks made this week by European Council\u000aPresident Donald Tusk."When spring comes, the number of refugees coming out of\u000aTurkey and Lebanon and other countries through Greece and the Western Balkans\u000aand into the rest of European Union (will rise)," Rutte said.He spoke at a\u000apanel discussion on Europe's future during the World Economic Forum's annual\u000ameeting.Rutte said the immediate priority for policymakers is to make a\u000asuccess of an EU plan with Turkey to limit the number of people trying to\u000areach Europe from its territory. He said it was  necessary to ensure that\u000ameasures to more equitably redistribute asylum seekers across the 28-nation EU\u000awere working. The EU has admitted they are not.Alexis Tsipras, Greece's prime\u000aminister, was on the same panel. "What is happening in the Aegean is a great\u000ashame for our common European culture and civilization. On a daily basis we\u000aare faced with a death toll in the sea because (people) traffickers are\u000aworking there unimpeded," he said.German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble\u000asaid the entire European political leadership agreed the influx was too high,\u000abut  it would be a "disgrace if Europe were turned into a fortress."Nearly\u000a4,000 people drowned trying to reach Europe in 2015, the United Nations'\u000arefugee agency estimated. This year, 95 people have died crossing the\u000aMediterranean Sea, according to the International Organization for\u000aMigration.After a separate presentation on the subject by the Swedish\u000adelegation, Prime Minister Stefan Löfven told USA TODAY  he was not "naive\u000aenough to think that" getting all 28 EU member states to live up to their\u000aresponsibilities over the crisis "was going to be easy." Löfven was flanked by\u000aMorgan Johansson, his migration minister, who said Sweden had not discussed\u000athe idea of putting a "ceiling" on the number of asylum seekers it\u000aaccepts."What do you do when you reach that ceiling? We are bound by the\u000aGeneva Convention on our duty to accept refugees," he said.Sweden has taken in\u000a160,000 refugees, double the amount it allowed in during the Balkan Wars in\u000athe 1990s. On a per capita basis, the country has absorbed more refugees than\u000aGermany, which has let in 1 million people fleeing conflict zones from\u000aAfghanistan to Eritrea to Syria.In the past four months, Johannson said,\u000a26,000 unaccompanied minors have crossed into Swedish territory.Löfven,\u000aSweden's leader, downplayed a recent spat with Denmark after the two nations\u000aaccused each other of exacerbating the crisis by imposing border controls."I\u000ahave a very good relationship with the Danish prime minister," Löfven said.\u000a"We phone one another and send text messages."\u000a\u000a

VWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama approved an unprecedented increase of refugee aid\u000aWednesday, authorizing $70 million from a special fund set up by Congress to\u000aresettle refugees in the United States.In both size and scope, the\u000apresidential declaration was the largest expansion of the program, known as\u000aEmergency Refugee and Migration Assistance, in at least 20 years. Obama last\u000atapped the fund in 2014 to provide $50 million to deal with a refugee crisis\u000ain South Sudan.Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday the the Obama\u000aadministration was responding to "the worst refugee crisis that the world has\u000aseen since the Second World War." The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees\u000aestimates there were 19.5 million refugees globally at the end of 2014, up 2.9\u000amillion from the previous year.Kerry said the State Department plans to expand\u000arefugee aid to help families and individuals from El Salvador, Guatemala, and\u000aHonduras, allowing them a safe and humane alternative to human smuggling and\u000amodern slavery.Citing an "unprecedented number of refugees in need of\u000aresettlement," Obama signed a presidential determination allowing him to tap a\u000aspecial fund set up by Congress for refugee emergencies. Congress replenished\u000athe fund in the budget agreement signed into law last month.But unlike similar\u000apresidential declarations in the past, the determination Obama signed\u000aWednesday is the first that contains no geographical restrictions, meaning the\u000arefugee aid could be spent on refugees worldwide.Through a similar declaration\u000alast year, Obama raised the ceiling on the number of refugees allowed into the\u000aUnited States from 70,000 in fiscal year 2015 to 85,000 in 2016 and 100,000 in\u000a2017."The refugee crisis is not just a Syrian problem, nor a Middle Eastern\u000aproblem, or a European or an African problem is a global challenge of historic\u000aproportions and dimensions, and it tests our values, our self-confidence, and\u000aour very humanity," Kerry said Wednesday in a speech to the National Defense\u000aUniversity in Washington. He later went to the Washington suburb of Silver\u000aSpring, Md. to meet with refugee familiesPresident Obama will host a refugee\u000asummit at the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York in September, the\u000aState Department announced.\u000a\u000a

VPresident Obama is taking a dramatic step to show he opposes Republican\u000aefforts to slow or halt the admission of refugees over terrorist concerns: He\u000ahas invited a Syrian refugee to attend his State of the Union Address.Refaai\u000aHamo, 55, a native of Syria now living in Detroit, will sit in first lady\u000aMichelle Obama's box in the House of Representatives gallery for Tuesday\u000anight's speech. Hamo drew international attention last month after he was\u000afeatured in the popular blog "Humans of New York."The scientist fled Syria's\u000acivil war in 2013 after his family home was destroyed by a bomb, killing his\u000awife, daughter and five other relatives. He developed stomach cancer and had\u000atrouble getting treatment in Turkey, where he and millions of other Syrians\u000ahave fled. After two years, he was approved for refugee status in the United\u000aStates and arrived in Detroit last month.His ordeal prompted Obama to call him\u000a"an inspiration," and actor Edward Norton organized a fundraising drive for\u000ahim."I was thrilled when I heard that President Barack Obama is welcoming us\u000ainto the United States," Hamo said in a statement. "I felt that hope was\u000arevived as well as the strength to continue my dreams and ambition in my new\u000acountry. I am so proud and honored to be in this country and look forward to\u000aone day becoming an American citizen so that we can be part of making America\u000aa strong and great country."The invitation creates a sharp contrast to\u000aRepublicans who want to block refugees from war-ravaged Middle East nations\u000abecause Islamic State radicals and other terrorists might try to sneak into\u000athe country by claiming refugee status.Republican presidential front-runner\u000aDonald Trump has called for a temporary ban on admitting Muslims until the\u000aU.S. government can "figure out what is going on." House Republicans passed a\u000abill in November to temporarily halt Syrian and Iraqi refugee programs and to\u000ascreen future applicants more carefully.Those fears ramped up when a group of\u000aSyrians was caught along the southwestern border and another group of\u000aU.S.-bound Syrians was stopped in Honduras using fake passports. Last week,\u000athe arrest of two Iraqi-born refugees in the United States on terrorism\u000acharges brought the issue back to the forefront."It's like my grandfather\u000asaid, if there's a hole in the bucket, turn the spigot off first, then fix the\u000abucket," Rep. Richard Hudson, R-N.C., co-author of the SAFE Act passed by the\u000aHouse, said on MSNBC's _MTP Daily_ on Friday.The White House says such a delay\u000ais unnecessary because the screening process for people from Syria, Iraq and\u000aother countries inhabited by Islamist extremists is already strong enough to\u000aensure the security of the homeland. Refugees from Syria, for example, go\u000athrough 18 to 24 months of interviews and background checks before they're\u000agranted refugee status in the U.S.The State Department says that the vast\u000amajority of Syrian refugees admitted are women and children and that only a\u000atiny fraction fit the typical terrorist profile: single, young men.On Friday,\u000aWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said any attempt to halt that program\u000aand screen people based on "some sort of religious test" is wrong."It doesn't\u000arepresent who we are as a country," Earnest said. "And most importantly, it's\u000anot going to keep us safe."\u000a\u000a

VBANGKOK, Thailand \u2014 Southeast Asia is bracing for a new \u201csailing season.\u201d It\u2019s\u000aa benign-sounding expression for one of the region\u2019s most perilous annual\u000aevents.Starting late in the year, when monsoons recede and seas grow calmer,\u000atens of thousands of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar make a grim decision. They\u000achoose to sail eastward on creaky boats run by callous smuggling syndicates.\u000aTheir goal: securing underground work in Thailand or Malaysia, even though\u000aboth nations warn them to stay away.Many die at sea. Those who do not are\u000aoften swept into mafia-run human trafficking rings infamous for rape,\u000aextortion and burying those who can\u2019t pay ransoms in jungle graves.But the\u000arisk is deemed worth it among many Rohingya who, in recent years, have decided\u000athe danger is preferable to remaining in their homeland.In Myanmar, the\u000aRohingya have been subjected to ethnic cleansing, local mob massacres and a\u000agovernment that derides practically all 1 million Rohingya inhabitants as\u000ainvaders from Bangladesh. More than 140,000 are confined to bleak government-\u000arun camps after pogroms, stoked by radical Buddhist monks, purged them from\u000atheir homes.As the West copes with a highly politicized influx of families\u000afleeing Syria and Iraq, this lesser-known Asian crisis still simmers.It is\u000amuch smaller in scale: roughly 100,000 have fled the Rohingya\u2019s native Rakhine\u000aState and neighboring Bangladesh by sea in recent years, according to the\u000aUnited Nations, while Syria has produced a staggering 4.3 million refugees.But\u000athere are parallel horrors faced by both sets of escapees \u2014 from starvation\u000aand abuse by people smugglers to the wrath of citizens in their destination\u000acountries.  \u000a\u201cIt\u2019s been happening for years but, unfortunately, the world never paid much\u000aattention,\u201d says Khin Maung Myint, a Rohingya activist. \u201cIt\u2019s an unbearable\u000asituation. They\u2019re forced to flee their ancestral lands.\u201d He compared some of\u000aMyanmar\u2019s most abusive security forces to \u201cNazi Gestapo.\u201dMonsoons over the\u000aRohingya exodus route, the Bay of Bengal, have only recently subsided. So far,\u000aat least 1,000 are known to have sailed through these waters since September,\u000aaccording to Vivian Tan, a spokesperson for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.More\u000aare expected to flee in coming months.Myanmar is a dazzlingly diverse country\u000awhere ethnic minorities make up more than 30% of the population. But it is\u000aeconomically and militarily dominated by majority Buddhist Bamar. The nation\u2019s\u000aall-powerful army has a long history of grinding down minorities through\u000ajungle warfare.In response, practically every sizeable ethnic group has\u000aassembled an armed guerrilla defense force \u2014 except for the Rohingya. It\u2019s no\u000acoincidence that, in recent years at least, they have suffered more than any\u000aother group in Myanmar.\u201cThey\u2019re a target of many people\u2019s affection,\u201d says\u000aAnthony Davis, a Bangkok-based security analyst with Jane\u2019s Defence Weekly.\u000a\u201cThey are, if you like, the baby seals of the Southeast Asian Islamic world\u000awhose main claim to fame is getting clubbed over the head on a regular\u000abasis.\u201dSome dream of assembling a force to defend the vulnerable Rohingya.\u000aIslamic radicals in the Southeast Asia have repeatedly expressed a desire to\u000ahelp them fend off mistreatment.But to date, Davis says, vows to mount an\u000aarmed struggle have yet to come to anything.\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of that\u000ahappening,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause the baby seals basically want out and are\u000alooking for jobs in Malaysia. They\u2019re not looking to raise the black flag of\u000ajihadist struggle.\u201dThat hasn\u2019t stopped Myanmar\u2019s government and even Western\u000amedia from attempting to connect the Rohingya to terrorism. Most of these\u000awarnings cite the Rohingya Solidarity Organization, a tiny armed group set up\u000ain the 1980s that is now \u201cessentially defunct,\u201d according to the International\u000aCrisis Group.There is no armed wing \u201cworth its salt\u201d within the Rohingya\u000adiaspora, says Sidney Jones, an expert on Southeast Asian extremism with the\u000aInstitute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta. She warns that \u201cif there\u000awas ever an extremist operation that Indonesian jihadis could join in Myanmar,\u000ait would be off like a flash\u201d but \u201cit\u2019s not there now.\u201dThat leaves Myanmar\u2019s\u000aleague of famous anti-tyranny dissidents, led by the idolized Aung San Suu\u000aKyi, to demand better treatment for the Rohingya.Her party, the National\u000aLeague for Democracy, swept historic November elections and will dominate a\u000anew government when it takes power in March 2016. Cheered on by the White\u000aHouse, they are the self-proclaimed voice of the oppressed citizenry and have\u000apromised to heal the bloody rifts between minorities and the government.That\u000apledge, however, may not extend to the Rohingya. The Rohingya are still\u000aconsidered unwanted foreigners even among Myanmar\u2019s otherwise enlightened pro-\u000ademocracy crowd.One of Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s chief confidantes previously told\u000aGlobalPost that she believes the word Rohingya is a \u201cmade-up name of the\u000aBengali,\u201d which is a term \u2014 implying as it does that Rohingya belong in\u000aBangladesh \u2014 used by the government to insist they have no rightful home in\u000aMyanmar.Asked after the elections about the Rohingya\u2019s plight, another\u000aspokesman from her party told _The Telegraph_ that they \u201chave other\u000apriorities.\u201dMeanwhile, the Rohingya continue to endure dismal conditions in\u000acamps guarded by government security forces. Apartheid-esque laws seek to\u000aprevent them from traveling from town to town, having more than two children\u000aand voting in the recent elections.\u201cThe government denies that Rohingya even\u000aexist,\u201d says Shwe Maung, a Rohingya parliamentarian prohibited from running as\u000aan incumbent in the latest election. \u201cThis reinforces the perception among\u000aRohingya that we\u2019re unwanted and have no future in Myanmar.\u201cNo wonder so many\u000aRohingya try to flee.\u201d_The article originally appeared on GlobalPost.

VIsis Pharmaceuticals, which develops drugs for rare diseases, said Friday it\u000achanged its name to Ionis Pharmaceuticals.While it didn't specify the reason\u000afor the name change, ISIS is the acronym for Islamic State of Iraq and al-\u000aSham, an Islamic fundamentalist terrorist group."We decided to change our\u000acompany name because, when people see or hear our name, we want them to think\u000aabout the life-saving medicines we are developing," said Lynne Parshall, chief\u000aoperating officer at Ionis Pharmaceuticals, in a statement.The Carlsbad,\u000aCalif.-based company is also changing its ticker symbol to IONS from the\u000acurrent ISIS. The new ticker  takes effect Dec. 22. Its shares trade on the\u000aNASDAQ Global Select Market.\u000a\u000a

VDonald Trump (Photo: AP)Hillary Clinton will not be apologizing to Donald\u000aTrump for her comment that he has become the Islamic State's "best recruiter,"\u000aher campaign said Monday."Hell no," said Clinton campaign spokesman Brian\u000aFallon. "Hillary Clinton will not be apologizing to Donald Trump for correctly\u000apointing out how his hateful rhetoric only helps ISIS recruit more\u000aterrorists."Trump had said he would "demand" an apology from Clinton for her\u000aclaim about the Islamic State, telling NBC's TODAY show. "She lies about\u000aemails, she lies about Whitewater, she lies about everything. She will be a\u000adisaster about everything as president of the United States."Trump has called\u000afor a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States until the government\u000agets a better handle on the terrorist threat.During Saturday's Democratic\u000adebate, Clinton said the U.S. needs to make sure that "the really\u000adiscriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don't fall on\u000areceptive ears. He is becoming ISIS's best recruiter. They are going to people\u000ashowing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit\u000amore radical jihadists."While counter-terrorism analysts say the Islamic State\u000acould use Trump's comments to support their claim that the West is waging war\u000aon Islam, fact-checkers say there is no evidence of any ISIS videos featuring\u000athe Republican front-runner.\u000a\u000a

VAlready notorious for its public and gruesome executions, a member of the\u000aIslamic State killed his own mother in front of a crowd in Syria this week\u000aafter she tried to get him to leave the terrorist organization, according to\u000areports.The man, identified as Ali Saqr, 21, executed her in front of hundreds\u000aof people in the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, according to the Syrian\u000aObservatory for Human Rights and another Syrian rights group cited by The New\u000aYork Times.The groups said that she confronted her son and urged him to flee\u000awith her out of fear that coalition forces would soon sweep in and wipe out\u000aISIS, the observatory said. Saqr turned her in to ISIS authorities, who then\u000aordered Saqr to execute her in front of the post office where she worked,\u000aaccording to the observatory.The execution is the latest example of the\u000aIslamic State's high-profile executions, which have included beheadings of\u000aAmerican citizens, foreign journalists and others captured by the group. The\u000aU.S. struck a retaliatory blow in November when the Pentagon said it was\u000a"reasonably certain" it had used a drone strike to kill Mohammed Emwazi, known\u000aas "Jihadi John," an English-speaking militant who had appeared in a series of\u000agrisly videos executing prisoners.Still, the group has continued to operate\u000athroughout Syria and northern Iraq, prompting U.S. officials to add more\u000aspecial operations forces on the ground.According to the Times, ISIS has\u000aforced its members to kill their parents before. Much like this case in Raqqa,\u000aa Lebanese father went to Syria last year to bring back his son and three\u000aother fighters whom the son had recruited to the fight. The son reported his\u000afather to ISIS authorities, and later executed him, according to the Times.\u000a\u000a

VThe attacks in Paris that killed at least 129 people Friday night suggest the\u000aIslamic State has broadened its reach beyond the Middle East and is capable of\u000aexecuting devastating attacks in the West.\u201cIt suggests a major shift in the\u000aorganization\u2019s global strategy,\u201d said William McCants, an analyst at Brookings\u000aInstitution and author of _The ISIS Apocalypse_.French President Francois\u000aHollande blamed the attacks on the terror group and vowed to step up military\u000aaction against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. France has\u000aparticipated in the U.S.-led air campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq\u000aand Syria.In a statement, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the\u000amassacre, calling Paris \u201cthe capital of prostitution and obscenity\u201d and\u000apledged further attacks. \u201cThis attack is the first of the storm,\u201d the\u000astatement said. The statement could not be independently verified.Previous\u000aattacks in the West, such as the January attacks that included an assault on\u000athe satirical newspaper _Charlie Hebdo_ and left 20 people dead including\u000athree attackers, appear to have been inspired by the Islamic State.What\u000adistinguishes the Paris attacks is the complexity of the attack, which appears\u000ato have involved extensive planning and preparation and suggests they were\u000adirected from the group\u2019s central leadership. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of operation\u000ayou would expect from a group of guys who had never traveled abroad or\u000areceived training,\u201d McCants said.Hollande said the slaughter is \u201can act of war\u000athat was prepared, organized, planned from abroad with internal help.\u201dThe\u000aterror organization\u2019s statement said the attacks were carried out by eight\u000aterrorists armed with assault rifles and wearing suicide vests.The attack\u000acomes in the wake of at least two other recent bombings in which the Islamic\u000aState had reached beyond its traditional stronghold in Syria.The group claimed\u000aresponsibility for the downing of the Russian airliner over Sinai last month\u000athat killed all 224 passengers and crew aboard.It also claimed to be behind\u000abombings in Beirut on Thursday that killed 43 civilians in a neighborhood\u000acontrolled by Hezbollah, a Shiite group backed by Iran. The Islamic State is a\u000aSunni organization that considers Shiites the enemy.\u201cAll of this coming in\u000arapid succession suggests they are willing to take the fight to the enemy\u201d\u000amore globally, McCants said.\u201cYou would guess they had least one more in the\u000abag,\u201d he said. \u201cMy worry is the one more would be in the United States.\u201dEven\u000abefore the Paris attacks, analysts questioned President Obama's claim that the\u000aU.S. had contained the terror group. \u201cHow do you explain the expansion of the\u000aIslamic State into Sinai, Afghanistan and Libya,\u201d said Michael Rubin, an\u000aanalyst with the American Enterprise Institute."I don't think they're gaining\u000astrength," Obama said in an interview with ABC's _Good Morning America\u000a_broadcast Friday. "What is true, from the start our goal has been first to\u000acontain and we have contained them." Obama said the strategy has not yet\u000adecapitated the group's command and control structure.The U.S. military\u000astrategy to counter the Islamic State is centered on using local ground forces\u000ain Iraq and Syria backed by a U.S.-led coalition air campaign, to battle the\u000amilitants. The United States has also targeted the Islamic State directly with\u000aairstrikes. The Pentagon said it had launched an airstrike Friday in Libya\u000atargeting Abu Nabil, an Islamic State leader.The Islamic State\u2019s rise as a\u000adeadly terror group has been rapid. Its de facto capital is in Raqqa, Syria,\u000abut it began to emerge as a global threat last year when it attacked Iraq,\u000aseizing large swaths of territory, including Mosul, Iraq\u2019s second largest\u000acity.Islamic State fighters in Raqqa, Syria, in 2014. (Photo: Uncredited,\u000aAP)The group has said it seeks to create a caliphate, a state ruled under\u000aIslamic law, across Iraq and Syria. The Islamic State has regularly\u000aslaughtered and abused people in lands it controls. When it drove the Yazidis,\u000aa religious minority, from their home in northern Iraq last year, they pressed\u000amany of the women and girls into sexual slavery.What has set Islamic State\u000aapart from al-Qaeda and other terror groups is its ability to hold terrain.\u000aPlanning and directing large attacks far from its base in Syria would\u000arepresent a new capability.The apparent shift comes as al-Qaeda has changed\u000aits own tactics. In 2013 al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri warned against\u000aindiscriminate bombings and attacks that might kill innocent Muslims or non-\u000acombatants.The Islamic State\u2019s new aspirations could be part of its\u000acompetition with al-Qaeda or been part of a long-term plan, McCants said.\u201cWe\u000adon\u2019t know yet,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe we won\u2019t know for several years.\u201d\u000a\u000a

VSAN FRANCISCO \u2014 While the Islamic State has had much success using social\u000amedia to get its message out, a loose band of activists who go by the name\u000a"hunters" are just as busy trying to shut it down.The hactivist group\u000aAnonymous, the most well-known of these hunters, tweeted Wednesday that more\u000athan 6,080 Islamic State Twitter accounts had been disabled due to its\u000aefforts.Ghost Security Group, which goes by the name GhostSec, collects\u000areports of Islamic extremist groups and works to remove their content.These\u000asometimes overlapping groups are called "hunters," said Veryan Khan, editorial\u000adirector with the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium, a private firm\u000athat collects information on terrorism."Hunting groups are volunteer cyber\u000amilitias," she said. Based all over the world, "they like to play\u000aWhack-a-Mole, their funnest thing in the whole world is to go in and take\u000athese groups down."**Cyber word-fare**An Anonymous account claimed to have\u000alaunched concerted online attacks against radical Islamic terrorists in\u000aJanuary after the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris.The war of words and\u000aactions online has heated up again after the terrorist attacks that killed 129\u000apeople in Paris on Friday.A discussion channel on the messaging service\u000aTelegram that appeared to be devoted to the Islamic State called Anonymous\u000a"idiots" on Wednesday.Anonymous has, in turn, posted guides giving readers\u000ainstructions on how to hack into Islamic State-affiliated systems.Supporters\u000aof the Islamic State have posted their own guide detailing how to work around\u000ahactivist efforts to shut down its social media work, in Arabic.While no\u000aonline vigilante group can entirely block something as amorphous as the\u000aIslamic State, it can slow down the efforts of terrorist groups targeting\u000ayoung people for recruitment through social media and the Internet.Because it\u000ais so dependent on social media to get its message out, these online efforts\u000ahave been able to slow the Islamic State's efforts, said Gabriella Coleman, a\u000aprofessor of communication at McGill University in Montreal who studies\u000aAnonymous.She has been monitoring online discussions about the efforts and\u000asees a very broad range of people working on the anti-Islamic State campaigns.\u000aThey include French hackers, military geeks, Syrians who are being harmed by\u000athe Islamic State, some Tunisians and some Palestinian hackers who live\u000aoverseas."The more of these sites we can disable, the less voice they have in\u000athe community," said Scott White, director of computing and security\u000atechnology at Drexel University in Philadelphia.However, he warned that\u000ashutting down the avenues of communication is a double-edged sword. It stems\u000aIslamic State propaganda, but also takes away a venue where the intelligence\u000acommunity can collect information.The FBI declined to comment on the\u000aactivities of the cyber vigilantes.**Terms of Service**Most social media sites\u000atake down terrorist postings as soon as they become aware of them. Last year\u000aIslamic State supporters threatened Twitter employees with death for removing\u000atheir accounts.But while Twitter, Facebook, Google and others all monitor for\u000asuch material, given their sheer size it's difficult to find all such\u000apostings. Hactivists aid in that effort by reporting breaches of a site's\u000aterms of service, said White.For example Telegram, a popular instant messaging\u000aservice that emphasizes privacy, posted Wednesday that it had blocked 78\u000aIslamic State-related chat channels across 12 languages, which had been\u000areported to it.Facebook said it worked aggressively to ensure there were no\u000aterrorists or terror groups using the site and removed any content that\u000apraised or supported terrorism.The site's 1.5 billion users flag content that\u000ais inappropriate and it has a global team responding to those reports around\u000athe clock. Terrorism-related reports are prioritized for immediate review, the\u000acompany said in an emailed statement.**More to come**Anonymous on Sunday\u000areleased a video in French saying it would punish the Islamic State, which has\u000aclaimed responsibility for the attacks in Paris on Friday.Wearing the group's\u000atrademark Guy Fawkes mask, an unidentified man called the terrorists "vermin"\u000aand said "Anonymous activists from all over the world will hunt you down.""So\u000aget ready for a massive reaction from Anonymous. Know that we will find you\u000aand we will never let up. We're going to launch the biggest ever operation\u000aagainst you. Expect very many cyber attacks against you. War is declared," the\u000aannouncer says.\u000a\u000a

VNews that not even UnitedHealth Group (UNH) can make money on the Obamacare\u000aexchanges is rattling the entire healthcare industry.Five health-care stocks\u000ain the S&amp;P 500, including hospitals Tenet Healthcare (THC) and HCA Holding\u000a(HCA) and insurers Aetna (AET), Anthem (ANTM) and UnitedHealth were down 5.6%\u000aor more Thursday, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data from S&amp;P\u000aCapital IQ.These are certainly outsized reactions \u2014 even as the entire health-\u000acare sector reels from the fresh concerns about the long-term viability of the\u000aAffordable Care Act, often nicknamed Obamacare due to President Obama's\u000asupport of the legislation. The S&amp;P 500 Health Care Services sector index\u000ais down 3.1%.Investors are punishing these stocks following a surprising\u000arevelation by UnitedHealth it's having trouble making money on the health-care\u000aexchanges created by Obamacare. Many investors, for instance, thought\u000ahospitals were going to be big winners since they would have to treat fewer\u000auninsured patients. Many health insurers including UnitedHealth were initially\u000abullish on the plan as more consumers would presumably purchase health\u000ainsurance. Instead, UnitedHealth says it is considering to stop offering\u000ainsurance plans through the public exchanges created by the law.UnitedHealth\u000acut its 2015 projected profit to $6 a share, down from a previous range of\u000abetween $6.25 and $6.35, citing the increased costs associated with offering\u000ainsurance through the exchanges. The warning gives credibility to warnings\u000afrom critics of the law who have said the exchange would attract consumers who\u000atend to have the most health issues, and therefore are more costly. A basic\u000atenet of public health insurance is that the pool of customers should to be\u000abroad-ranging from younger and healthier patients to older ones that need more\u000ahealth services - in order to spread the risk.**HARDEST HIT STOCKS IN HEALTH-\u000aCARE SECTOR THURSDAY****Company, Symbol, % Ch.

VFor tax year 2015, millions of Americans will be getting a new tax form\u000arelated to health care reform measures.Will you know what to do with yours\u000awhen it arrives?The Affordable Health Care Act, colloquially known as\u000a\u201cObamacare,\u201d mandated three new tax forms to be used as a kind of proof of\u000ainsurance so taxpayers may avoid paying a penalty for failure to be covered.\u000aThey are:While Form 1095-A debuted last year after Americans began purchasing\u000ainsurance on exchanges and qualifying to related tax credits, tax year 2015\u000awill be the first time the B and C version are mailed out to insured\u000aemployees.But if you\u2019re intimidated by the prospect of more paperwork, don\u2019t\u000abe. In fact, you don\u2019t even have to wait for the tax form to arrive in the\u000amail if you know you were covered for all of 2015, said Debra Hammer,\u000aspokeswoman for tax preparation giant Intuit TurboTax.\u201cGo ahead and file your\u000ataxes before the form arrives. And when you do get a form, just review it for\u000aaccuracy,\u201d Hammer said.You may have to dig that 1095-B or 1095-C out of the\u000afiling cabinet if you get audited, she adds, so don\u2019t throw it away. But\u000aotherwise it\u2019s just a \u201ccheck the box\u201d exercise on your form 1040, then you\u2019re\u000adone.Of course, things are trickier if you do not have health insurance, or if\u000ayou were only covered for part of tax year 2015.The purpose of the forms,\u000aafter all, is to prove you have insurance and, therefore, avoid paying a\u000apenalty that is sometimes referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201dThat penalty\u000ais going up in for tax filers this April to $695 per adult or 2.5% of\u000ahousehold income, whichever is higher, up from $325 per adult or 2% of\u000ahousehold income previously. The penalties for children under 18 have also\u000arisen to $347.50 from $162.50, and the household cap on fines has more than\u000adoubled to $2,085 annually from $975.If you weren't insured for every month in\u000atax year 2015, it\u2019s worth exploring any exemptions you might have before\u000apaying any related penalties. In fact, the Internal Revenue Service said about\u000a300,000 people paid a penalty last year but likely qualified for some kind of\u000aexemption. If you are facing a fine, visit healthcare.gov/exemptions-tool to\u000asee if there\u2019s a way to reduce or eliminate that penalty.All in all, Hammer of\u000aTurboTax said that the new Affordable Act Tax forms are straightforward and\u000athat taxpayers shouldn\u2019t panic.\u201cGiven that people don\u2019t have to wait until\u000athey have the B's and C's to file their taxes, it shouldn\u2019t be a difficult\u000ayear,\u201d she said. And given that Form 1095-A is now a year old and the\u000aexchanges have been running for some time, both preparers and the IRS itself\u000ashould easily be able to process filings without a hitch this year.**But are\u000abusinesses prepared?**However, while individuals may have an easy go of it,\u000asmall businesses may find compliance with the new tax rules a bit troublesome\u000aon their end, said Vic Saliterman, senior vice president of health care reform\u000aat payroll service provider ADP.Some employers with 50 or more full-time\u000aworkers may be subject to \u201cshared responsibility\u201d fines if they don\u2019t offer\u000aemployees insurance \u2014 or if their plans are too costly or don\u2019t offer a\u000aminimum amount of coverage. That means they have to keep accurate records and\u000areport their insurance plans to the IRS or else suffer big fines of their\u000aown.\u201cThe 1095 form is really the mechanism that the IRS is going to use to\u000aassess whether or not each person has the required coverage, and it\u2019s what the\u000aindividual is going to use to demonstrate that they\u2019ve got the coverage,\u201d\u000aSaliterman said. \u201cThen the IRS will marry the two up.\u201dIn other words, if\u000ayou\u2019re a small-business owner and miss some forms, discrepancies may raise\u000aflags or result in fines with the IRS.ADP recently conducted a survey of\u000abusinesses to see how prepared they are, and more than half of businesses with\u000a50 to 999 workers said they\u2019re not sure if they are in compliance. More than 4\u000ain 10 businesses with 1,000 or more workers also aren\u2019t sure.Saliterman said\u000athat the study shows that the smaller the company, the more at risk it\u000ais.\u201cThey are so focused on running their business, they just don\u2019t have the\u000aadditional resources to focus on things of this nature,\u201d he said.And,\u000aunfortunately, Saliterman added, small businesses may have their hands full\u000afor some time because \u201cit\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ve seen the final chapter\u201d in tax\u000achanges related to the Affordable Care Act. He pointed to debates over the so-\u000acalled \u201cCadillac tax\u201d on premium insurance plans as just one sticking point\u000aemployers will have to watch.\u201cWith something as broad and complex as the ACA\u000aand with so many political interests, things will remain very fluid,\u201d\u000aSaliterman said._Jeff Reeves is the editor of InvestorPlace.com and the author\u000aof The Frugal Investor's Guide to Finding Great Stocks._\u000a\u000a

V_Corrections and clarifications:  An earlier version misstated the number of\u000apeople who would be affected if UnitedHealth pulled out of the Affordable Care\u000aAct exchanges. _The nation's largest health insurer warned Thursday that it\u000amay pull out of the Obamacare exchanges after 2016 \u2013 forcing more than a half\u000amillion  people to find other coverage \u2013 after low enrollment and high usage\u000acost the company millions of dollars.The possible move by UnitedHealth Group\u000araises new questions about the viability of President Obama's signature health\u000alaw and follows the departure of more than half of the non-profit insurance\u000acooperatives this year. If UnitedHealth drops out, consumers would lose one of\u000athe lowest-cost plans available in much of the country, and some wonder how\u000asmaller insurers could fill the void. .\u201cIf they can\u2019t make money on the\u000aexchanges, it seems it would be hard for anyone,\u201d said Katherine Hempstead,\u000awho heads the insurance coverage team at the Robert Wood Johnson\u000aFoundation.UnitedHealth (UNH) downgraded its earnings forecast, bemoaning low\u000agrowth projections for Obamacare enrollment and blaming the federal health\u000acare law for giving individuals too much flexibility to change plans.  People\u000awho purchase insurance through the public exchanges are typically heavy users\u000aof their plans, draining insurers' profits, analysts say.In a sharp reversal\u000aof its previously optimistic projections, UnitedHealth suspended marketing of\u000aits Obamacare exchange plans for 2016 \u2014 which the company has already\u000acommitted to offer \u2014 to limit its exposure to additional losses.\u201cWe see no\u000adata pointing to improvement" in the financial performance of public-exchange\u000aplans, UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley said on a conference call, though he\u000aadded that "we remain hopeful" the market will recover.The move comes amid\u000aindications that insurers are absorbing steeper costs than they expected from\u000aplans offered to individuals through the public exchanges, which are purchased\u000aonline.The average premium for medium-benefit plans offered to 40-year-old\u000anon-smokers will rise 10.1% in 2016, according to the Kaiser Family\u000aFoundation.UnitedHealth warned investors that it would reap $425 million less\u000ain revenue during the fourth quarter than it had previously expected,\u000atranslating into 26 cents in earnings per share in losses attributed to a\u000aworse outlook for the quarter and all of 2016.The company lowered its full-\u000ayear 2015 earnings-per-share forecast to $6, down from $6.25 to $6.35, and\u000ashares of UnitedHealth stock fell 5.7% to close at $110.63.Other health care\u000astocks took a hit, too. Tenet Healthcare (THC) fell 8%, and HCA Holding (HCA)\u000adropped 6.9%. Insurers Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM) fell 6.5% and 6.9%,\u000arespectively.Privately-held Kaiser Permanente said Thursday that it won't\u000aabandon the ACA exchanges. Kaiser is both a health care provider and insurer\u000aand sells plans on the exchanges for eight states plus Washington, D.C."At\u000aKaiser Permanente, we remain strongly committed to continuing to participate\u000ain the health exchanges," CEO Bernard Tyson said in an emailed statement.\u000a"While there have been challenges at times, we believe at the end of the day\u000athey are causing healthy disruption, and are forcing the health care industry\u000ato respond better to consumer needs."S&amp;P Capital IQ analyst Jeffrey Loo\u000asaid in a research note that he was "a bit surprised" by the revelation\u000abecause UnitedHealth had previously "indicated optimism" about the\u000aexchanges.But Hemsley said patients are using their plans more than the\u000acompany had expected and dropping coverage when they're healthy, slamming\u000aprofits.The Obama administration argued that the health care marketplace would\u000astabilize after a normal period of changes in the early years following the\u000alaw's implementation. An average of 10 insurers per state are offering plans\u000afor 2016, up from nine in 2015 and eight in 2014.In the exchanges' third year,\u000athe number of plans offered "continues to grow, giving millions of Americans\u000aaccess to quality affordable insurance," Ben Wakana, a spokesman for the U.S.\u000aDepartment of Health and Human Services, said in an emailed statement."The\u000areality is we continue to see more people signing up for health insurance and\u000amore issuers entering the Marketplaces, and at the end of January, we believe\u000awe\u2019ll be looking at another successful open enrollment \u2014 just like the last\u000atwo," Wakana said."This year, people looking for coverage in the Marketplace\u000acontinue to have a robust number of plan choices and as the data shows the\u000aMarketplace is stable, vibrant and a growing source of coverage for new\u000aconsumers," he added. "Today\u2019s statement by one issuer is not indicative of\u000athe Marketplace\u2019s strength and viability."Even though UnitedHealth wasn\u2019t a\u000amajor player yet on the ACA exchanges, the fact that it priced plans\u000aconservatively and entered cautiously made its statements more significant,\u000aHempstead said.More than half of the 23 non-profit insurance co-ops\u000aestablished under the ACA will shutter by the end of this year, but\u000aUnitedHealth is the largest single insurance carrier in the United States.\u000aUnited\u2019s comments about the health of exchange-plan holders also run counter\u000ato what was expected. Experts including Hempstead assumed the sickest people\u000awould get insurance first, and then the \u201crisk pool\u201d would improve as more\u000ahealthy people bought plans.While UnitedHealth\u2019s statement is significant,\u000aKaiser Family Foundation Senior Vice President Larry Levitt said it "matters\u000amore for what it says about what industry as a whole thinks about\u000aObamacare.""If they exited (the exchanges), it wouldn\u2019t matter that much to\u000athe functioning of the ACA, but it would show why increasing enrollment is so\u000aimportant," Levitt said. "This market is not yet profitable for insurers, but\u000ait could become profitable if enrollment grows."An exit could, however, affect\u000aprices on the exchanges. For 2016, UnitedHealth sells one of the two lowest-\u000acost silver plans available to more than 40% of the counties in the 38 states\u000athat use the federal Healthcare.gov exchange, Levitt said.The Obama\u000aadministration\u2019s low predictions for 2016 enrollment may also have "spooked\u000athe insurance industry a bit," Levitt said. "More enrollees (means) more\u000abusiness for insurers and that more healthy people are coming into the\u000amarket."UnitedHealth executives told investors in a conference call that\u000ainsurance holders who sign up after the open enrollment period are\u000aparticularly expensive. Those patients, who are able to obtain coverage after\u000aa life event such as losing a job or having a child, have been among the most\u000aactive users of the insurance plans.Obamacare established a network of federal\u000aand state exchanges through which individuals who do not have insurance\u000athrough their employer can obtain coverage \u2014 often with federal tax credits\u000aand subsidies. Insurers\u2019 participation in the exchanges is optional._USA TODAY\u000areporter Matt Krantz contributed to this story.__Follow USA TODAY reporter\u000aNathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey._\u000a\u000a

VWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate voted Thursday to repeal key provisions of Obamacare\u000aand strip federal funding from Planned Parenthood, approving legislation that\u000ais sure to be vetoed by President Obama.Senators voted 52-47 to pass the bill.\u000aTwo moderate Republicans \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine and Mark Kirk of Illinois \u2014\u000ajoined Democrats in opposing the bill. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was\u000aabsent.The legislation still must be approved by the House, which passed a\u000adifferent version in October. The White House said Wednesday that Obama will\u000aveto the bill if it reaches his desk.Democrats say the 2010 Affordable Care\u000aAct \u2014 better known as Obamacare \u2014 has helped 17.6 million Americans gain\u000amedical coverage and has stopped insurance companies from refusing to insure\u000apatients with pre-existing conditions."Everybody knows (repeal) is a gesture\u000ain futility," said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., before the vote.\u000a"Let's move on from repeal and start making the Affordable Care Act work even\u000abetter for the American people."Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,\u000asaid Obamacare has raised health care costs, limited patients' ability to\u000achoose their doctors, and hurt the already struggling middle class."I think\u000aDemocrats have a particular responsibility to the millions their law has hurt\u000aalready to help pass (the repeal)," McConnell said. "I think the president has\u000aa particular responsibility to the millions his law has hurt already to then\u000asign it."Senate Republicans have tried more than a dozen times before to pass\u000alegislation to repeal Obamacare, but they could not get the 60 votes needed to\u000aovercome Democratic filibusters. In Thursday's vote, Republicans were able to\u000aprevent a Democratic filibuster by using a budget procedure known as\u000areconciliation that allowed them to pass the bill with a simple majority.The\u000abill would gut key sections of the health care law, including the mandate for\u000aindividuals to buy health insurance and for employers with more than 50\u000aworkers to provide it. It eliminates all fines for people and companies that\u000afail to comply with the mandate.It also would eliminate federal subsidies to\u000aabout 6 million low- and moderate-income Americans buying their own insurance.\u000aAnd it would halt Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid for the poor, which has\u000abeen adopted by more than 30 states. Those two provisions would take effect in\u000atwo years, giving Republicans until after the 2016 election to come up with a\u000anew plan to replace the existing program.Senators voted 90-10 to pass an\u000aamendment by Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., that would repeal taxes set to be\u000aimposed in 2018 on expensive "Cadillac" insurance plans provided by employers.\u000aThose taxes are supposed to be used to help pay for medical coverage for\u000auninsured people. Critics said the taxes would hurt workers by reducing the\u000abenefits their employers provide or raising the amount of money that employees\u000amust pay for their coverage.The bill also would strip federal funding for one\u000ayear from Planned Parenthood, which has been under attack by conservatives\u000asince anti-abortion activists released undercover videos earlier this year\u000aallegedly showing group officials talking about selling tissue from aborted\u000afetuses. Planned Parenthood has denied making any profit from the sale of\u000afetal tissue. The group announced in October that it would immediately stop\u000ataking reimbursement for supplying the tissue for medical research."It's time\u000ato take a stand for the rights of all human life, including the unborn, and\u000astart doing more to protect the well-being of women, mothers, and their\u000afamilies," said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.Senators blocked efforts by Democrats\u000aand by Collins to remove the language targeting Planned Parenthood."It seems\u000aimplausible that less than a week after a tragic shooting at the Planned\u000aParenthood health center in Colorado Springs some in Washington chose politics\u000aover compassion," said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned\u000aParenthood Federation of America. She was referring to last Friday's shooting\u000ain which a gunman killed three people, including a police officer.\u000a\u000a

VWASHINGTON \u2014 The Senate voted Thursday to repeal key provisions of Obamacare\u000aand strip federal funding from Planned Parenthood, approving legislation that\u000ais sure to be vetoed by President Obama.Senators voted 52-47 to pass the bill.\u000aTwo moderate Republicans \u2014 Susan Collins of Maine and Mark Kirk of Illinois \u2014\u000ajoined Democrats in opposing the bill. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was\u000aabsent.The legislation still must be approved by the House, which passed a\u000adifferent version in October. The White House said Wednesday that Obama will\u000aveto the bill if it reaches his desk.Democrats say the 2010 Affordable Care\u000aAct \u2014 better known as Obamacare \u2014 has helped 17.6 million Americans gain\u000amedical coverage and has stopped insurance companies from refusing to insure\u000apatients with pre-existing conditions."Everybody knows (repeal) is a gesture\u000ain futility," said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., before the vote.\u000a"Let's move on from repeal and start making the Affordable Care Act work even\u000abetter for the American people."Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,\u000asaid Obamacare has raised health care costs, limited patients' ability to\u000achoose their doctors, and hurt the already struggling middle class."I think\u000aDemocrats have a particular responsibility to the millions their law has hurt\u000aalready to help pass (the repeal)," McConnell said. "I think the president has\u000aa particular responsibility to the millions his law has hurt already to then\u000asign it."Senate Republicans have tried more than a dozen times before to pass\u000alegislation to repeal Obamacare, but they could not get the 60 votes needed to\u000aovercome Democratic filibusters. In Thursday's vote, Republicans were able to\u000aprevent a Democratic filibuster by using a budget procedure known as\u000areconciliation that allowed them to pass the bill with a simple majority.The\u000abill would gut key sections of the health care law, including the mandate for\u000aindividuals to buy health insurance and for employers with more than 50\u000aworkers to provide it. It eliminates all fines for people and companies that\u000afail to comply with the mandate.It also would eliminate federal subsidies to\u000aabout 6 million low- and moderate-income Americans buying their own insurance.\u000aAnd it would halt Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid for the poor, which has\u000abeen adopted by more than 30 states. Those two provisions would take effect in\u000atwo years, giving Republicans until after the 2016 election to come up with a\u000anew plan to replace the existing program.Senators voted 90-10 to pass an\u000aamendment by Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., that would repeal taxes set to be\u000aimposed in 2018 on expensive "Cadillac" insurance plans provided by employers.\u000aThose taxes are supposed to be used to help pay for medical coverage for\u000auninsured people. Critics said the taxes would hurt workers by reducing the\u000abenefits their employers provide or raising the amount of money that employees\u000amust pay for their coverage.The bill also would strip federal funding for one\u000ayear from Planned Parenthood, which has been under attack by conservatives\u000asince anti-abortion activists released undercover videos earlier this year\u000aallegedly showing group officials talking about selling tissue from aborted\u000afetuses. Planned Parenthood has denied making any profit from the sale of\u000afetal tissue. The group announced in October that it would immediately stop\u000ataking reimbursement for supplying the tissue for medical research."It's time\u000ato take a stand for the rights of all human life, including the unborn, and\u000astart doing more to protect the well-being of women, mothers, and their\u000afamilies," said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.Senators blocked efforts by Democrats\u000aand by Collins to remove the language targeting Planned Parenthood."It seems\u000aimplausible that less than a week after a tragic shooting at the Planned\u000aParenthood health center in Colorado Springs some in Washington chose politics\u000aover compassion," said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned\u000aParenthood Federation of America. She was referring to last Friday's shooting\u000ain which a gunman killed three people, including a police officer.\u000a\u000a

VOn Tuesday night, the Eagles of Death Metal finished the concert they began in\u000aParis on Nov. 13, when terrorists interrupted their performance at the\u000aBataclan theater in a brutal attack that killed 90 concert-goers. In total,\u000a130 people died across the city, and many more were injured.Performing at the\u000aOlympia Concert Hall on Boulevard des Capucines, the rough-and-tumble\u000aCalifornia rock band invited all of the survivors of the November attacks to\u000aattend; many were in the audience. \u201cIt\u2019s the first concert of the rest of my\u000alife,\u201d one of them, Emilie, told Le Monde.Although not all of them could make\u000ait through the entire performance \u2014 some, visibly distressed, left midway\u000athrough, carrying signs in honor of lost loved ones \u2014 it was an evening\u000aultimately devoted to the enduring strength of Paris itself.Jesse Hughes, the\u000aband\u2019s frontman, held up a shirt at one point that read: \u201cLive for Paris.\u201d As\u000ahe told the audience: \u201cYou\u2019re stuck with me: I\u2019m Parisian now.\u201dThat would make\u000aHughes only the latest in a long line of Americans who have proclaimed \u2014\u000afollowing famous words of the expatriate writer Gertrude Stein \u2014 that \u201cAmerica\u000ais my country, and Paris is my home town.\u201d But the rock musician\u2019s outspoken\u000apolitical opinions, specifically on the question of gun control, run the risk\u000aof alienating him from fellow denizens of the City of Light.In an interview\u000awith the French TV station iTélé, Hughes, a National Rifle Association\u000asupporter and gun enthusiast, had the following to say on the subject: \u201cI\u2019ll\u000aask you: Did your French gun control stop a single [expletive] person from\u000adying at the Bataclan? And if anyone can answer yes, I\u2019d like to hear it,\u000abecause I don\u2019t think so.\u201d As he continued: \u201cIt just seems like God made men\u000aand women, and, that night, guns made them equal. Maybe until nobody has guns,\u000aeverybody has to have them.\u201dIn an interview with Le Parisien, his remarks were\u000aslightly more neutral: \u201cI support the right of all to carry a weapon to defend\u000athemselves,\u201d he said. \u201cArms help people defend themselves, no?\u201d As elsewhere\u000ain Europe, firearms are heavily regulated in France. But perhaps Hughes\u2019s\u000aunwavering stance comes from an originalist interpretation of \u201cLa\u000aMarseillaise,\u201d the national anthem of his newfound community, which explicitly\u000aexhorts citizens \u201caux armes.\u201dHe, at least, has answered that call. As he told\u000aiTélé: \u201cI can\u2019t let the bad guys win.\u201d**Read more: **22-year-old offers most\u000avivid account yet of surviving Bataclan massacreHorrified survivors recount\u000aBataclan slaughter: \u2018It looked like a battlefield\u2019\u000a\u000a

VThe personalized license plate features seven characters \u2014 the maximum,\u000aaccording to the Minnesota Department of Public Safety.\u201cFMUSLMS,\u201d it says.The\u000aapplication for the plate, which the state agency released this week amid\u000aoutcry over its message, notes that \u201cFMUSLMS\u201d \u2014 along with the applicant\u2019s\u000asecond and third choices, \u201cPETALOL\u201d and \u201c8LGTHG\u201d \u2014 are the \u201cname of a musical\u000aband he is in.\u201dA prominent U.S. Muslim civil rights group thinks it\u2019s\u000asomething else entirely: \u201cA symptom of the unfortunate mainstreaming of\u000aIslamophobia in our society,\u201d according to Ibrahim Hooper, a national\u000aspokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\u201cIn an overall\u000aatmosphere in which anti-Muslim bigotry is rising, it\u2019s somehow seen as, \u2018This\u000ais OK for me to do,'\u201d Hooper told the St. Cloud Times.The Minnesota Department\u000aof Public Safety now says it\u2019s sorry for having approved and issued the\u000a\u201cFMUSLMS\u201d plate, which is being revoked.Officials are working to take\u000apossession of the plate, according to an agency statement that called the\u000aplate \u201coffensive and distasteful.\u201d\u201cThe Department of Public Safety apologizes\u000afor this error,\u201d said the statement, sent to The Washington Post on Tuesday.\u000a\u201cThe Driver and Vehicle Services Division is reviewing its process for\u000aapproving personalized license plates today and will immediately provide\u000aadditional review and oversight of applications.\u201dIn a separate statement, Gov.\u000aMark Dayton (D) said he was \u201cappalled that this license plate was issued by\u000athe State of Minnesota. It is offensive, and the person who requested it\u000ashould be ashamed. That prejudice has no place in Minnesota.\u201dDayton also\u000acalled for a closer look at department policies, saying: \u201cI have instructed\u000athe Commissioner of Public Safety to retrieve this plate as soon as possible\u000aand re-review agency procedures to ensure it does not occur again.\u201dThe\u000aapplication for the personalized plate went through a deputy registrar\u2019s\u000aoffice in Foley, a city about 15 miles from St. Cloud; the plate was issued in\u000aJune.The Minneapolis Star Tribune reports that the decision to revoke the\u000aplate came after it was spotted in St. Cloud and pictures spread online. (You\u000acan find a photo of it here.)The newspaper reports:Some young St. Cloud\u000aSomali-Americans sent cellphone photos of the plate to Haji Yusuf, a community\u000aactivist for #UniteCloud, a group trying to ease racial tension in the city.\u000aYusuf posted the photo to social media, after which residents began demanding\u000athat the Department of Public Safety revoke the license plate, said Natalie\u000aRingsmuth, founder and executive director of #UniteCloud.When applying for\u000apersonalized plates in the state of Minnesota, drivers complete an application\u000athat includes a section in which they are asked to explain their plate\u000achoices. \u201cThis MUST be completed or plates will not be issued,\u201d the form\u000areads.According to CBS affiliate WCCO, the public safety agency released the\u000aoriginal application for the controversial plate on Tuesday, and it indicated\u000athat \u201cFMUSLMS\u201d was a band name. No band by that name showed up in a series of\u000aGoogle searches that included various spellings.Likewise \u201cPETALOL\u201d \u2014 a\u000apossible reference to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.The state\u2019s\u000aapplication notes that a personalized plate that \u201coffends public morals or\u000adecency may not be issued.\u201d**Want more stories about faith?

VGun control works, but you have to be smart about it.That's the takeaway from\u000aa major new analysis out this month in the journal Epidemiologic Reviews.\u000aColumbia University's Julian Santaella-Tenorio and a team of researchers pored\u000aover the results of 130 studies on gun control legislation passed in 10\u000adifferent countries to find out which policy interventions worked, which ones\u000adidn't and on what issues the jury was still out.Big caveat up front: Sussing\u000aout cause from effect in the policy realm is a complicated task. Most of the\u000astudies we have on gun violence are able to describe _associations_ \u005c-- after\u000ayou pass X law, Y effect happened. But that doesn't necessarily tell you that\u000aY happened _because_ of X. Researchers can control for various other factors\u000athat might also cause Y to happen, like changes in economic situation or\u000ademographics, but you can't eliminate uncertainty completely.Still, by looking\u000aat the totality of available research, like this analysis, you can usually get\u000aa reasonably good picture of the associations between laws and outcomes. Its\u000aNo. 1 conclusion was that comprehensive gun legislation packages -- which\u000ainclude an array of different policy changes -- seem to be associated with\u000areductions in gun deaths."The simultaneous implementation of laws targeting\u000amultiple elements of firearms regulations reduced firearm-related deaths in\u000acertain countries," Santaella-Tenoria and his colleagues conclude.The research\u000asuggests that a package of various gun law reforms is better than the sum of\u000aits parts. For instance, Australia's National Firearms Agreement (NFA) of 1996\u000abanned the ownership of certain types of guns, implemented a mandatory buyback\u000aprogram for some weapons and included provisions on background checks,\u000alicensing and mental health requirements. Overall, the research Santaella-\u000aTenoria and his colleagues surveyed found that "following the implementation\u000aof the NFA, a decline in firearm deaths and firearm suicides, as well as an\u000aabsence of mass shootings, occurred."Similar effects were found after multi-\u000apronged gun reforms were implemented in Brazil and South Africa.But results\u000awere more mixed when it came to individual pieces of legislation. The United\u000aStates's famous assault weapons ban? "No association between the law and\u000ahomicide rates in 15 states," one study found. The research on concealed-carry\u000alaws is all over the place -- some has shown that more guns lead to more gun\u000acrime, while other research shows precisely the opposite. Studies also showed\u000athat voluntary gun buyback programs also appear to have little effect on\u000ahomicide rates.On the other hand, one particular policy intervention seems to\u000ahave a profound effect on reducing accidental gun deaths among children -- so-\u000acalled "child access prevention" laws, which mandate safe storage of firearms\u000aand penalize gun owners who leave firearms out in the reach of children. "Most\u000astudies in the United States show that additional laws allowing for felony\u000aprosecution of offenders are associated with greater reductions in\u000aunintentional deaths among children," the authors found.Another area where the\u000aresearch was largely in agreement was gun background checks -- specifically,\u000abackground checks that included checks on domestic violence restraining\u000aorders. "Studies on background checks suggest that the quality of systems used\u000ato review applicants, in terms of the access to local and federal information\u000aon mental health conditions and criminal and domestic violence history, is a\u000acritical component of these laws," the researchers found.One key point that\u000aSantaella-Tenorio's team stressed is that the existing body of gun violence\u000aresearch is still largely incomplete. "Improving data on non-fatal gun-related\u000ainjuries will give us a much better understanding of the scope of the impact\u000aof these laws," he told me in an email. "Current research focuses mostly on\u000athe impact of firearm laws on gun-related deaths only, not on non-fatal\u000ainjuries."Most research focuses only on gun-related deaths, since those tend\u000ato leave a big paper trail that experts can analyze later. But firearm-related\u000ainjuries are at least twice as prevalent as fatalities, meaning that most of\u000athe existing research is blind to one of the biggest effects of gun\u000aviolence.**More from Wonkblog:**Tennessee\u2019s new official state rifle is so\u000apowerful it can \u2018destroy commercial aircraft\u2019People are getting shot by\u000atoddlers on a weekly basis this yearWe've had a massive decline in gun\u000aviolence in the United States. Here's why.\u000a\u000a

VA prestigious medical journal just published a new study of gun deaths with\u000ashocking results: if just three gun control laws were adopted nationwide, the\u000aresearchers found, deaths from firearms could be cut by more than 90\u000apercent.It's a reduction so staggering that it sounds hard to believe. And\u000aaccording to two outside scientists, we shouldn't."That\u2019s too big -- I don\u2019t\u000abelieve that," said David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at the\u000aHarvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. "These laws are not that strong. I\u000awould just be flabbergasted; I\u2019d bet the house if you did [implement] these\u000alaws, if you had these three laws and enforced them really well and reduced\u000agun deaths by 10 percent, you'd be ecstatic.""Briefly, this is not a credible\u000astudy and no cause and effect inferences should be made from it," Daniel\u000aWebster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy &amp; Research\u000awrote in an e-mail.The lead author, epidemiologist Bindu Kalesan of Boston\u000aUniversity, said that the study published in The Lancet provides policymakers\u000athe hard evidence they need to prioritize individual gun control laws that\u000awould have the biggest impact: background checks for gun and ammunition buyers\u000aand ballistic fingerprinting that allows bullets to be matched to the guns\u000athat fired them. Implementing background checks for gun buyers at the federal\u000alevel, alone, would cut firearm deaths in half, the study found.If ammunition\u000abackground checks and ballistic fingerprinting were also implemented at the\u000afederal level, the study finds, the 2010 rate of death in the U.S. from\u000afirearms, 10 per 100,000, could drop to less than 1 per 100,000."We know\u000athat's a stretch, but we still think we can," Kalesan said.To critics who do\u000anot believe a 90 percent decline is realistic, she points to two states:\u000aLouisiana and Massachusetts. In Louisiana, 19 of 100,000 people died of\u000afirearm deaths in 2010. In Massachusetts, which has stricter gun control laws,\u000athat rate is 4 per 100,000. She and colleagues controlled in the study for\u000amany of the factors that could influence likelihood of gun death beyond gun\u000acontrol policies -- including unemployment, gun ownership, gun export rates\u000aand non-firearm homicides."The validity has to be established with the next\u000asteps. We provide the first evidence that the three laws may reduce gun death\u000arates. Now for the next step. Seldom is research a 1-stop process," Kalesan\u000awrote in an e-mail.But Webster and Hemenway -- who both say there is a growing\u000aand compelling body of evidence that gun control, and particularly background\u000achecks, do work \u005c-- cautioned against reading too much into some of its\u000aspecific findings.Why the impasse?As anyone who has read a medical study\u000aknows, trying to parse cause and effect merely by observing the world around\u000aus is complex. Does coffee make us healthier, or is there something subtly\u000adifferent about coffee drinkers and those who don't partake?Well, the same\u000athing applies to understanding gun control laws. People may have very\u000adifferent inherent risks of death by firearm simply depending on whether they\u000alive in a rural or urban area. And while gun control laws may affect death\u000afrom firearms, so will other factors, such as urban environments, poverty and\u000agang violence.Kalesan's team made an effort to account for differences that\u000acould change risk of firearm death in different states. But Webster and\u000aHemenway said that there were many other factors that can influence a person's\u000alikelihood of dying by gunshot.Hemenway pointed out that this isn't a flaw\u000aunique to this study -- the entire literature on gun policy comes with\u000ainherent limitations due to the nature of the data, and he suggested it is\u000abest to think of this new study as a part of the whole instead of as a policy\u000aprescription for how to do away with gun deaths. Taken together with a bunch\u000aof other research, it supports the broad idea that gun control laws work.Some\u000aof the particulars of the study, however, are less clear. For example, the\u000astudy found that ballistic fingerprint laws that require bullets to be able to\u000abe traced by guns had the third biggest effect on reducing overall firearm\u000adeaths and the strongest effect on preventing suicide death. Webster said that\u000athose fingerprinting laws aren't even currently being implemented, raising the\u000aquestion of how they would prevent gun deaths -- and particularly in suicides\u000awhere tracing the bullet to the gun hardly seems like a deterrent. Kalesan\u000asaid that that the laws would result in fewer guns, and said the study wasn't\u000adesigned to distinguish how policy contributions to suicide or homicide\u000adeaths.In an accompanying comment, Hemenway pointed out possible statistical\u000aproblems and questioned its finding that nine minor laws might increase\u000afirearm fatalities, such as police inspection of firearm dealers or required\u000atheft reporting by gun dealers.Instead of assigning too much importance to\u000athose findings, he thinks its reasonable to look at the study as yet another\u000apiece of supporting evidence for the broader idea gun control works.But\u000aWebster took a different perspective, noting that any research on the effects\u000aof gun control policy can be politicized and that a high-profile study that is\u000aflawed but in favor of gun control laws could shake people's faith in the\u000ascience and fuel critics to question the study's ultimate conclusion that gun\u000acontrol works. He said he frequently finds himself explaining to policy makers\u000aand the public that they should be cautious in accepting research that hasn't\u000abeen peer-reviewed and published in a journal."What I find both puzzling and\u000atroubling is this very flawed piece of research is published in one of the\u000amost prestigious scientific journals around," Webster said in an\u000ainterview."Something went awry here, and it harms public trust."_This story\u000ahas been updated._**Read More:**The death toll from guns no one talks\u000aaboutWe\u2019ve had a massive decline in gun violence in the United States.

VFLINT, Mich. \u2014 Sunday night\u2019s Democratic presidential debate here focused\u000aheavily on the lead crisis in this majority African American city, as well as\u000adifferences between the candidates on issues of trade, jobs, guns and\u000afracking.There were also points of agreement on policy \u2013 former secretary of\u000astate Hillary Clinton joined Sen. Bernie Sanders in his previous call for\u000aMichigan\u2019s Republican governor to resign in the midst of Flint\u2019s water crisis\u000a\u2014 and few mentions of the emerging GOP field, including front-runner Donald\u000aTrump. \u201cWe have our differences and we get into vigorous debate about issue,\u000abut compare the substance of this debate with what you saw on the Republican\u000astage last week,\u201d Clinton said to applause. Sanders chimed in: \u201cWhen you watch\u000athese Republican debates, you know why we need to address the mental\u000ahealth.\u201dBut throughout the night, Sanders remained unrelenting in attacking\u000aClinton for her connections to Wall Street and her positions on past trade\u000adeals. Clinton criticized the Vermont senator for his position on gun\u000amanufacturer liability and investing in exports.Much of Sunday night\u2019s debate\u000ain Flint has been about points of contrast between the two Democratic\u000acandidates, including intricacies of gun control approaches and trade\u000apolicies, while they also noted points of agreement, such as dismantling\u000ainstitutional racism.Clinton has a clearer path to the Democratic nomination\u000athan Sanders and leads him by double-digit margins in Michigan polls.\u000aRegarding fracking, Clinton offered what she cast as a measured approach which\u000aultimately would result in few \u201cplaces in America where fracking will be able\u000ato take place.\u201dBut when Sanders was asked whether he supported fracking, he\u000aresponded: \u201cMy answer is a lot shorter: No, I do not support fracking.\u201d In a\u000aDemocratic primary contest in which African American voters will play a\u000acrucial role, Clinton and Sanders were both also asked about their racial\u000ablind spots by CNN\u2019s Don Lemon, and about their support for a two-decades-old\u000acrime bill. Both candidates noted that they had indeed voted for the 1994\u000acrime bill, which has been blamed for furthering racial disparities in the\u000acriminal justice system, while emphasizing that they want to reform the\u000acriminal justice system. The 1994 bill also included provisions for harsher\u000apenalties regarding violence against women.\u201cI can\u2019t pretend to have had the\u000aexperience you\u2019ve had,\u201d Clinton told Lemon, \u201cand that others have had, but I\u000awill do everything that I possibly can, to do the best I can, to not just\u000aunderstand and empathize but to tear down the barriers of systematic\u000aracism.\u201dSanders echoed Clinton regarding racial blind spots, talking about his\u000ahistory in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. \u201cWe must be firm in making\u000ait clear that we will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal\u000ajustice system,\u201d Sanders said.The debate also covered the issue of guns, after\u000athe father of one of the victims of the Kalamazoo shooting rampage asked the\u000acandidates about what they would do to curb the tide of gun violence in\u000aAmerica.Clinton called for ending the gun show loophole, and criticized\u000aSanders for his position against holding gun manufacturers legally liable\u000afollowing mass shootings. \u201cI voted against giving them immunity, but I think\u000awe should very seriously move to repeal that,\u201d she said.Sanders agreed on the\u000aneed to expand background checks, but disagreed with holding manufacturers\u000aliable, unless \u201cthey understand that they\u2019re selling guns into an area that\u000ait\u2019s getting into the hands of criminals.\u201dSanders also criticized Clinton for\u000aher past support of trade deals, and the former secretary of state opened a\u000aline of attack on Sanders for his opposition to the Export-Import Bank.\u201cI\u000athink we\u2019re in a race for exports,\u201d Clinton argued. \u201cHere in Michigan, there\u2019s\u000abeen $11 billion in recent years used to support exports, primarily from small\u000abusiness. I favor it, he opposes it.\u201dSanders, the lone member of the\u000aDemocratic caucus in the Senate to oppose the Export-Import Bank, fired back,\u000adescribing the Export-Import Bank as \u201cthe Bank of Boeing\u201d and a source of\u000amoney for major corporations.\u201cDemocrats are not always right,\u201d Sanders said.\u000a\u201cDemocrats have supported corporate welfare.\u201d Earlier in the debate, Sanders\u000aand Clinton sparred over trade and jobs, after questions turned from the Flint\u000alead water crisis. Sanders had hammered Clinton for her previous support of\u000atrade deals. She responded by laying out a series of proposals to create\u000aincentives for companies to invest and stay in the United States, and\u000acriticizing Sanders for voting against the auto bailout.Sanders, responding\u000athat the vote was actually one against a Wall Street bailout, cut off Clinton:\u000a\u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m talking,\u201d he said, prompting \u201coh\u2019s\u201d from the audience.Clinton\u000aresponded: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to talk then tell the whole story.\u201dThe debate\u000abegan with both candidates calling for Snyder\u2019s resignation and describing\u000aFlint\u2019s lead water crisis as an outrageous failure of governance.It\u2019s a call\u000athat Sanders has made previously and repeated Sunday night. Clinton joined him\u000aSunday, saying Snyder should be recalled or should resign.Clinton also said\u000athe state should use its \u201crainy day\u201d fund to help residents in the city. \u201cIt\u2019s\u000araining lead in Flint and the state is derelict for not coming forward to\u000ahelp,\u201d Clinton said.News that Sanders won the Maine Democratic caucus Sunday\u000acame as the two faced off in Flint. Sanders was expected to do well in Maine,\u000aand has already won other northeastern states, including his home state of\u000aVermont and New Hampshire, while Clinton won in Massachusetts. Sunday\u2019s\u000avictory in Maine means he will win at least 14 delegates of Maine\u2019s 25 pledged\u000adelegates, and Clinton will win at least six, according to the Associated\u000aPress.Not including Maine\u2019s delegates, Clinton has at least 1,123 total\u000adelegates, while Sanders has 484, including superdelegates. The race continues\u000ato 2,383, the number of delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.The\u000adebate, which began at 8 p.m. Eastern time and is being televised on CNN, was\u000aadded to the Democrats\u2019 schedule after Sanders emerged as a stronger-than-\u000aexpected challenger. Clinton and Sanders are facing off here in Flint, which\u000awas chosen to highlight a two-year-old poisoned-water crisis that has\u000aparalyzed the majority-African American city.Both candidates have campaigned\u000ahard in Michigan, which they consider a bellwether for the fall election. The\u000astate will serve as a test of Clinton\u2019s institutional support from workers\u2019\u000aunions and of Sanders\u2019s appeal with the working class.Sanders drew a large\u000acrowd for a rally in Warren, Mich., on Saturday, while Clinton held a small\u000asession with African American ministers in Detroit before addressing state\u000aDemocrats at a dinner.Hours before Sunday\u2019s debate began, Sanders called an\u000aimpromptu news conference where he announced the endorsement of Flint native\u000aand former U.S. senator Don Riegle. There, Sanders acknowledged that he trails\u000aClinton in Michigan, in part because he has continued to struggle to reach\u000aAfrican American voters, who represent about 14 percent of Michigan\u2019s\u000apopulation.\u201cWe started off way, way down here, and I think that gap is\u000aclosing,\u201d Sanders said at Sunday\u2019s news conference. \u201cThe black vote in\u000aMichigan, the black vote all over the country, is enormously important,\u201d he\u000aadded. But Sanders noted that he believes the divide has been greater along\u000agenerational lines than along racial lines: \u201cOur campaign is doing quite well\u000awith younger whites, younger African Americans and younger Latinos.\u201dSunday\u000anight is the first time the candidates have debated since the Super Tuesday\u000acontests, when Clinton emerged with a lead of nearly 200 pledged delegates\u000aover Sanders. She slightly expanded her delegate lead after a crucial win in\u000aLouisiana on Saturday, while Sanders claimed victories in Nebraska and\u000aKansas.The Sanders campaign believes that the primary map becomes more\u000afavorable to their candidate as the race shifts out of the South, but his\u000awindow to overtake Clinton is narrowing. Top Sanders strategists tried to make\u000athe case last week that the self-described democratic socialist from Vermont\u000astill has a path to the Democratic nomination, which involves winning Michigan\u000aand other delegate-rich targets such as New York and California.But Clinton\u2019s\u000aadvisers hope that by April, her delegate advantage will make it virtually\u000aimpossible for Sanders to claim the nomination. And Clinton has already begun\u000ashifting her focus on the campaign trail to a potential general election\u000amatchup against the Republican front-runner, Donald J. Trump. In recent days,\u000ashe has pitched supporters with warnings about the GOP field.\u201cWe are the last\u000aline of defense against Trump succeeding President Obama as our 45th\u000apresident, and we have got to be ready to fight him with every last thing\u000awe\u2019ve got,\u201d Clinton told supporters in a fundraising email. Michigan holds its\u000aprimary Tuesday and is the first of the delegate-rich industrial Midwest\u000astates to vote. Sanders views the state as winnable despite Clinton\u2019s steady\u000aand comfortable lead in state polling.A Detroit Free Press-WXYZ poll released\u000alate Saturday shows her leading Sanders 56 percent to 31 percent, a gap that\u000a\u201csuggests it may be too late for him to battle back to a victory here despite\u000aa strong effort in recent days,\u201d the newspaper wrote.The Democratic candidates\u000apounced on the Flint water crisis when it exploded in the public\u2019s\u000aconsciousness in January.The crisis dates to April 2014, when the city, at the\u000atime under state oversight, changed its water source from Detroit\u2019s system to\u000athe Flint River to save money. Corrosion-control additives were not added to\u000athe water supply, which allowed lead from aging pipes to leach into the water\u000aused by the people in Flint.Complaints about the smell and taste of the water\u000aemerged almost immediately, but revelations emerged this year that the\u000aMichigan Department of Environmental Quality and other parts of Republican\u000aGov. Rick Snyder\u2019s administration dismissed those complaints. Both Clinton and\u000aSanders have said that the crisis would never have happened in a richer,\u000awhiter city.To Democrats, both in Michigan and nationally, the refusal to\u000aacknowledge the problem and the negligence that created it is emblematic of\u000aRepublican-led government failure. That Flint is predominantly poor and black\u000aexacerbated a narrative about Republicans being less concerned about\u000aminorities.Both Clinton and Sanders have made much of the Flint crisis. The\u000aformer secretary of state was first, making contact with Flint\u2019s mayor in\u000aJanuary and incorporating references to the matter in virtually every speech\u000asince. Clinton first mentioned the Flint crisis during a debate with Sanders\u000ain South Carolina, where a majority of Democratic voters are black. She also\u000aleft a losing campaign in New Hampshire for one day in February to hold a\u000acommunity meeting in Flint, and she and her daughter, Chelsea, returned again\u000ain February.Sanders, who opened a campaign office in Flint, also has visited\u000aand has been running a television ad in recent weeks highlighting his dismay\u000aat the situation. Clinton, who has enjoyed strong support among African\u000aAmerican voters in the South, is expected to do well among black voters in\u000aMichigan, too. In 2008, 23 percent of voters who participated in Michigan\u2019s\u000aDemocratic primary were African American, according to exit poll data\u000apublished by CNN.The senator has increasingly hammered his opponent on trade,\u000ajobs and ties to Wall Street. On Friday, Sanders criticized Clinton\u2019s support\u000aof trade agreements dating to the North American Free Trade Agreement, passed\u000aunder her husband. \u201cIf the people of Michigan want to make a decision about\u000awhich candidate stood with workers against corporate America and against these\u000adisastrous trade agreements, that candidate is Bernie Sanders,\u201d he said\u000aFriday.\u201cWith another double-digit victory, we have now won by wide margins in\u000astates from New England to the Rocky Mountains and from the Midwest to the\u000aGreat Plains,\u201d the Sanders campaign said in a statement after the Maine win\u000awas announced. \u201cThis weekend alone we won in Maine, Kansas and Nebraska. The\u000apundits might not like it, but the people are making history. We now have the\u000amomentum to go all the way to the Democratic National Convention in\u000aPhiladelphia.\u201dAnd the Sanders campaign maintains that Michigan is ripe\u000aterritory for the senator. Michigan has large numbers of working-class and\u000astruggling middle-class white voters and union members, a constituency that\u000ahas gravitated toward Sanders elsewhere.Clinton delivered a speech on jobs and\u000atrade on Friday, telling workers at a woman-owned Detroit auto parts\u000amanufacturer that she opposes President Obama\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership\u000atrade deal with Asian nations because it does not offer enough protection for\u000aAmerican workers.But she warned that protectionism is not the answer,\u000aeither.\u201cThere are people in both parties who think we can just shut ourselves\u000aaway,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut even if the United States never signs another trade\u000adeal, globalization isn\u2019t going away.\u201dMichigan Democratic Party Chairman\u000aBrandon Dillon said the state\u2019s Democrats are pleasantly surprised to be\u000aplaying a significant role in the nominating contest this year. Although\u000aMichigan offers 147 delegates, one of the biggest delegate prizes during the\u000afirst two months of voting, Dillon said Democrats here had assumed that the\u000arace would effectively be over by now. When the primary calendar was set last\u000ayear, Clinton held a double-digit lead over all potential challengers.\u201cThere\u2019s\u000aa lot of excitement, especially around the debate and because when this\u000astarted, people didn\u2019t think much attention was going to be paid to Michigan,\u201d\u000aDillon said.Izadi reported from Washington. Steve Friess in Flint contributed\u000ato this report.\u000a\u000a

VHumans are making global warming worse, all right \u2014 but in more ways than you\u000athink.That\u2019s the result of an important new study in Nature, which finds that\u000athe Earth\u2019s land \u201cbiosphere\u201d \u2014 defined as all the plants, animals and\u000amicroorganisms living on the surface of the Earth (excluding the oceans) \u2014 is\u000anow a \u201cnet source\u201d of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Thus, the biosphere\u000ais now adding to global warming in much the same way that all of our fossil\u000afuels are.The research, which was led by Hanqin Tian of Auburn University with\u000aa long list of 22 co-authors, points the finger at phenomena like animal\u000aagriculture, rice cultivation and waste disposal as key features of climate\u000achange that don\u2019t get much attention, but that overall are causing the Earth\u000ato heat up even more than it would otherwise.It\u2019s yet another finding that\u000aunderscores the importance of a sector that has, somewhat surprisingly,\u000alargely escaped attention in the climate debate: global agriculture. And the\u000aworld will need to produce even more food to keep up with growing populations,\u000asays Tian.To understand the new study, you have to consider that greenhouse\u000agases that warm the planet are far more numerous than carbon dioxide, which\u000agets the lion\u2019s share of the attention. There\u2019s also methane, which causes\u000amuch  more warming over a 10-year time horizon (but dissipates far more\u000aquickly), and nitrous oxide, to name a few.And these gases pack quite a punch.\u000a\u201cThe methane global warming potential is 28 times larger than carbon dioxide,\u201d\u000asays Tian. \u201cAnd nitrous oxide is 265 times greater than carbon dioxide, in\u000aterms of global warming potential\u201d over 100 years, he added.\u201cThese two gases\u000aare really important non-CO2 greenhouse gases,\u201d Tian said.Methane doesn\u2019t just\u000aemerge from leaks from oil and gas operations \u2014 it is also belched by\u000aruminants (i.e., cows) and emerges from wetlands, landfills and much more.\u000aNitrous oxide, meanwhile, is emitted from nitrogen fertilizers used in\u000aagriculture, among other sources.In the new study, the researchers calculated\u000aa comprehensive, worldwide inventory of how much methane, nitrous oxide, and\u000acarbon dioxide the land biosphere is pulling in each year vs. how much it is\u000areleasing. And they found that while land-based living things are still\u000apulling in more carbon dioxide each year than they themselves are giving off \u2014\u000arendering the biosphere a carbon dioxide \u201csink\u201d \u2014 they are a net source of\u000aboth methane and nitrous oxide.Moreover, when you then convert the three gases\u000ato a comparable unit based on their potential to warm the planet over a\u000a100-year time frame, the planet\u2019s biosphere works out to be a net source of\u000agreenhouse gases, causing a warming comparable to the effect of between 3.8\u000aand 5.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. That\u2019s close to\u000awhat the U.S. itself emits annually.\u201cHuman actions not only are emitting\u000agreenhouse gases based on our own activities, but also are causing plants and\u000aanimals and microbes to be net emitters of greenhouse gases as well,\u201d said\u000aAnna Michalak, a co-author of the study with the Carnegie Institution for\u000aScience in Stanford, Calif.This overturns prior assumptions that the Earth\u2019s\u000aland is a carbon \u201csink,\u201d which did not take into account these other\u000agreenhouse gases.The picture would be a lot worse were it not for the fact\u000athat, at least for now, the research calculates that the biosphere is still\u000apulling in more carbon dioxide than it is releasing. However, there are fears\u000athat, due to factors like worsening wildfires or carbon dioxide emissions from\u000aArctic permafrost, this could change in the future, causing even more global\u000awarming gases to flow from the land to the atmosphere.Surprisingly, the\u000aresearch finds that when it comes to these human-driven methane and nitrous\u000aoxide emissions, a key driver is Southern Asia, and rice cultivation in\u000aparticular.\u201cSouthern Asia has about 90% of the global rice fields and\u000arepresents more than 60% of the world\u2019s nitrogen fertilizer consumption, with\u000a64%\u201381% of CH4 emissions and 36%\u201352% of N2O emissions derived from the\u000aagriculture and waste sectors,\u201d the study says. \u201cGiven the large footprint of\u000aagriculture in Southern Asia, improved fertilizer use efficiency, rice\u000amanagement and animal diets could substantially reduce global agricultural N2O\u000aand CH4 emissions.\u201dRice fields emit methane because microorganisms in these\u000awetlands are simply very good producers of the gas, when the field is under\u000awater.One caveat to this analysis is that it depends on converting three very\u000adifferent gases \u2014 carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide \u2014 into the same\u000aunits based on their \u201cglobal warming potential\u201d over 100 years. However,\u000amethane only lives in the atmosphere for 12 years. Nitrous oxide lives there\u000afor 114 years, and as for carbon dioxide, some of it lasts thousands of\u000ayears.So if we\u2019re worried about warming in 2016 or 2017, or even 2050, all of\u000athese gases are a very big deal. But if we\u2019re worried about warming over the\u000avery long term, of the sort that causes seas to rise and ice sheets to melt,\u000acarbon dioxide surges in importance.Nonetheless, for this century, the results\u000aare a very big deal \u2013 and point to ways that we can weaken global warming\u000awithout even targeting carbon dioxide.\u201cA lot of these additional emissions are\u000aones that can be managed if we alter the ways in which we do things like\u000aagriculture,\u201d Michalak said.**More at Energy &amp; Environment:**Before his\u000atragic death, nature photographer shot iconic images of climate change\u2019s\u000athreatChina vowed to peak emissions by 2030.

V_Update: The subject of climate change came up again during Thursday night's\u000aRepublican debate, which was also held in Miami. We are re-upping the below\u000apost from earlier in the day._At the moment that I write this, the measured\u000awater levels at Virginia Key, Fla., are about eight inches above predicted\u000alevels. In January, levels were regularly a foot or more above predicted\u000alevels.The sensor station at Virginia Key is located just off the coast of\u000aMiami, just south of Miami Beach, where rising sea levels mean that the\u000astreets flood regularly. So regularly that it's been covered by The Post, the\u000aTimes and the Miami Herald \u2014 and likely many others."The city of Miami Beach\u000afloods on such a predictable basis," Elizabeth Kolbert wrote for the New\u000aYorker last December, "that if, out of curiosity or sheer perversity, a person\u000awants to she can plan a visit to coincide with an inundation." The day the\u000aissue was released, sea levels were eight inches above the projection.Miami is\u000aalso where the most recent Democratic debate was held on Wednesday night, and\u000athe topic of climate change came up.At its root, the flooding is a function of\u000aclimate change. Warmer temperatures caused by the greenhouse effect cause\u000aglaciers to melt, increasing the amount of water in the ocean. Those warmer\u000atemperatures also cause the water in the ocean itself to expand, the same way\u000athat the surface level of water heated on a stove will rise in a saucepan. Sea\u000alevels have risen several inches near Miami since 1960, according to data from\u000athe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.At the debate, The\u000aWashington Post's Karen Tumulty, serving as a moderator, noted that two dozen\u000aFlorida mayors had requested that candidates address the subject in a debate.\u000aThey wrote an open letter, asking for candidates to answer three questions:\u000aWhat investments will you make to protect our coastal assets and economy from\u000athe growing impacts of sea level rise and climate change?, What are specific\u000apolicies you would put in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? and What\u000apolicies would you put in place to ensure that America delivers on its\u000acommitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?Tumulty's question was more\u000adirect, posed to Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) first. Since Republicans refuse to\u000aact on climate change \u2014 a function of skepticism in their base and among their\u000aallies \u2014 how can climate change be addressed?Sanders suggested that\u000aRepublicans were afraid to address the subject because they were worried about\u000alosing campaign funding. Later, he called for a "tax on carbon" and for heavy\u000ainvestments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy. He also called for an\u000aend to fracking.It's worth explaining each of those things. A "carbon tax" is\u000abasically what it sounds like. For large sources of carbon dioxide emissions \u2014\u000amostly coal-burning power plants \u2014 there would be a fee associated with those\u000aemissions. (Scientists believe that carbon dioxide emitted from burning fossil\u000afuels stays in the atmosphere, preventing heat from escaping into space.) This\u000ais not as controversial as it sounds; a number of oil companies have backed\u000asuch a tax. Energy efficiency comes at a reduction in greenhouse gases from\u000athe other side. Since energy use means more electricity production and,\u000atherefore, more burning of coal, or since more heat means more heating oil,\u000aefforts to reduce the amount of energy we use will indirectly reduce the\u000aamount of fuel we burn. Sustainable energy is wind and solar, forms of\u000agenerating electricity without burning coal.These are some of the most\u000acommonly considered ways to reduce the long-term effects of climate change.\u000aBut they don't do much for Miami Beach right now.Tumulty then offered the same\u000aquestion to Hillary Clinton. Clinton dropped some local knowledge about Miami\u000aBeach and mentioned the need to transition from coal to natural gas to\u000arenewable energy sources. This is her response to Sanders's no-fracking\u000ademand: Natural gas emits far less greenhouse gas when burned, making it\u000apreferable to coal. The problem is that natural gas itself is a very potent\u000agreenhouse gas that often escapes into the atmosphere as it's removed from the\u000aground. (Also, the wastewater from fracking is injected into high-pressure\u000awells underground, a process that has been linked to earthquakes.)Clinton\u000asummarized her strategy: "Invest in resilience and mitigation while we are\u000atrying to cut emissions." Cutting emissions and mitigation point to the things\u000awe just discussed. She specifically referred to President Obama's Clean Power\u000aPlan which, among other things, would mandate that existing power plants limit\u000acarbon dioxide emissions.It's the "resilience" here that's particularly\u000ainteresting. The government has a toolkit to help individuals and cities\u000aprepare for the effects of climate change. Here, for example, a video about\u000ahow Denver is preparing to deal with having less snow in the\u000aRockies.Resilience plans are necessarily localized, as this might suggest.\u000aMiami doesn't need to know what to do in the event of less water; it has too\u000amuch. (Actually, that's not entirely true. Rising seas threatens to pollute\u000aMiami's freshwater supply.) Miami Beach has a robust plan, nicely outlined by\u000aFusion, that includes sea walls, more trees, raised streets and elevated sand\u000adunes \u2014 all of which could help block incoming sea water.This was a level of\u000adetail we shouldn't expect from a presidential candidate in the middle of a\u000adebate, but it's critical to include in any plan. Sanders mentioned\u000ainfrastructural investments that could produce new jobs; the project Miami\u000aBeach is considering certainly qualifies, but would like come further back on\u000athe priority list. Republicans and other members of Congress who are loathe to\u000aact on climate change will likely be similarly slow to bump Miami Beach's sea\u000awalls ahead of repairing a bridge on I-80.Shortly after Hurricane Sandy, the\u000aNew Yorker's James Surowiecki noted a critical political problem for any\u000aclimate action. Referring to a report from economist Andrew Healy and\u000apolitical scientist Neil Malhotra, he writes:Politically speaking, it\u2019s always\u000aeasier to shell out money for a disaster that has already happened, with\u000aclearly identifiable victims, than to invest money in protecting against\u000asomething that may or may not happen in the future. Healy and Malhotra found\u000athat voters reward politicians for spending money on post-disaster cleanup,\u000abut not for investing in disaster prevention, and it\u2019s only natural that\u000apoliticians respond to this incentive.Of the answers offered by Clinton and\u000aSanders, Clinton's was more robust. But neither really answered Tumulty's\u000aquestion: How do you _do_ it? How do you actually keep Miami Beach from being\u000aflooded every time the moon gets full?Perhaps they didn't answer it, because\u000athe answer is too easy: Maybe you can't \u2014 until there's a disaster.\u000a\u000a

V_Update: The subject of climate change came up again during Thursday night's\u000aRepublican debate, which was also held in Miami. We are re-upping the below\u000apost from earlier in the day._At the moment that I write this, the measured\u000awater levels at Virginia Key, Fla., are about eight inches above predicted\u000alevels. In January, levels were regularly a foot or more above predicted\u000alevels.The sensor station at Virginia Key is located just off the coast of\u000aMiami, just south of Miami Beach, where rising sea levels mean that the\u000astreets flood regularly. So regularly that it's been covered by The Post, the\u000aTimes and the Miami Herald \u2014 and likely many others."The city of Miami Beach\u000afloods on such a predictable basis," Elizabeth Kolbert wrote for the New\u000aYorker last December, "that if, out of curiosity or sheer perversity, a person\u000awants to she can plan a visit to coincide with an inundation." The day the\u000aissue was released, sea levels were eight inches above the projection.Miami is\u000aalso where the most recent Democratic debate was held on Wednesday night, and\u000athe topic of climate change came up.At its root, the flooding is a function of\u000aclimate change. Warmer temperatures caused by the greenhouse effect cause\u000aglaciers to melt, increasing the amount of water in the ocean. Those warmer\u000atemperatures also cause the water in the ocean itself to expand, the same way\u000athat the surface level of water heated on a stove will rise in a saucepan. Sea\u000alevels have risen several inches near Miami since 1960, according to data from\u000athe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.At the debate, The\u000aWashington Post's Karen Tumulty, serving as a moderator, noted that two dozen\u000aFlorida mayors had requested that candidates address the subject in a debate.\u000aThey wrote an open letter, asking for candidates to answer three questions:\u000aWhat investments will you make to protect our coastal assets and economy from\u000athe growing impacts of sea level rise and climate change?, What are specific\u000apolicies you would put in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? and What\u000apolicies would you put in place to ensure that America delivers on its\u000acommitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?Tumulty's question was more\u000adirect, posed to Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) first. Since Republicans refuse to\u000aact on climate change \u2014 a function of skepticism in their base and among their\u000aallies \u2014 how can climate change be addressed?Sanders suggested that\u000aRepublicans were afraid to address the subject because they were worried about\u000alosing campaign funding. Later, he called for a "tax on carbon" and for heavy\u000ainvestments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy. He also called for an\u000aend to fracking.It's worth explaining each of those things. A "carbon tax" is\u000abasically what it sounds like. For large sources of carbon dioxide emissions \u2014\u000amostly coal-burning power plants \u2014 there would be a fee associated with those\u000aemissions. (Scientists believe that carbon dioxide emitted from burning fossil\u000afuels stays in the atmosphere, preventing heat from escaping into space.) This\u000ais not as controversial as it sounds; a number of oil companies have backed\u000asuch a tax. Energy efficiency comes at a reduction in greenhouse gases from\u000athe other side. Since energy use means more electricity production and,\u000atherefore, more burning of coal, or since more heat means more heating oil,\u000aefforts to reduce the amount of energy we use will indirectly reduce the\u000aamount of fuel we burn. Sustainable energy is wind and solar, forms of\u000agenerating electricity without burning coal.These are some of the most\u000acommonly considered ways to reduce the long-term effects of climate change.\u000aBut they don't do much for Miami Beach right now.Tumulty then offered the same\u000aquestion to Hillary Clinton. Clinton dropped some local knowledge about Miami\u000aBeach and mentioned the need to transition from coal to natural gas to\u000arenewable energy sources. This is her response to Sanders's no-fracking\u000ademand: Natural gas emits far less greenhouse gas when burned, making it\u000apreferable to coal. The problem is that natural gas itself is a very potent\u000agreenhouse gas that often escapes into the atmosphere as it's removed from the\u000aground. (Also, the wastewater from fracking is injected into high-pressure\u000awells underground, a process that has been linked to earthquakes.)Clinton\u000asummarized her strategy: "Invest in resilience and mitigation while we are\u000atrying to cut emissions." Cutting emissions and mitigation point to the things\u000awe just discussed. She specifically referred to President Obama's Clean Power\u000aPlan which, among other things, would mandate that existing power plants limit\u000acarbon dioxide emissions.It's the "resilience" here that's particularly\u000ainteresting. The government has a toolkit to help individuals and cities\u000aprepare for the effects of climate change. Here, for example, a video about\u000ahow Denver is preparing to deal with having less snow in the\u000aRockies.Resilience plans are necessarily localized, as this might suggest.\u000aMiami doesn't need to know what to do in the event of less water; it has too\u000amuch. (Actually, that's not entirely true. Rising seas threatens to pollute\u000aMiami's freshwater supply.) Miami Beach has a robust plan, nicely outlined by\u000aFusion, that includes sea walls, more trees, raised streets and elevated sand\u000adunes \u2014 all of which could help block incoming sea water.This was a level of\u000adetail we shouldn't expect from a presidential candidate in the middle of a\u000adebate, but it's critical to include in any plan. Sanders mentioned\u000ainfrastructural investments that could produce new jobs; the project Miami\u000aBeach is considering certainly qualifies, but would like come further back on\u000athe priority list. Republicans and other members of Congress who are loathe to\u000aact on climate change will likely be similarly slow to bump Miami Beach's sea\u000awalls ahead of repairing a bridge on I-80.Shortly after Hurricane Sandy, the\u000aNew Yorker's James Surowiecki noted a critical political problem for any\u000aclimate action. Referring to a report from economist Andrew Healy and\u000apolitical scientist Neil Malhotra, he writes:Politically speaking, it\u2019s always\u000aeasier to shell out money for a disaster that has already happened, with\u000aclearly identifiable victims, than to invest money in protecting against\u000asomething that may or may not happen in the future. Healy and Malhotra found\u000athat voters reward politicians for spending money on post-disaster cleanup,\u000abut not for investing in disaster prevention, and it\u2019s only natural that\u000apoliticians respond to this incentive.Of the answers offered by Clinton and\u000aSanders, Clinton's was more robust. But neither really answered Tumulty's\u000aquestion: How do you _do_ it? How do you actually keep Miami Beach from being\u000aflooded every time the moon gets full?Perhaps they didn't answer it, because\u000athe answer is too easy: Maybe you can't \u2014 until there's a disaster.\u000a\u000a

VThey had tried criticizing him, interrupting him, insulting his tan and\u000amocking his fingers. On Thursday night \u2014 after nothing else worked \u2014 the\u000arivals of Donald Trump seemed to try another tactic: They would try .\u2009.\u2009.\u000anothing at all.The result was a low-key, civil debate, where the Republican\u000afront-runner was often given free reign to muse. In some cases, that meant\u000acontradicting himself \u2014 Trump excoriated visas for high-skilled workers but\u000asaid he used them. He lamented that Democrats would not change Social Security\u000aand then said he, too, wouldn\u2019t change it. He attacked the current system of\u000abig-money campaign finance but then said that as a donor he had used it \u2014 and\u000amight soon use it again, by possibly soliciting big donations as a general-\u000aelection candidate. He said he wanted to be neutral in negotiations between\u000aIsraelis and Palestinians. Except that he would be really pro-Israeli. Except\u000athat he\u2019d say he was neutral so that the Palestinians would trust him.At one\u000apoint, Trump hinted that he would change his mind far more often as president,\u000ahinting that he would be \u201cflexible\u201d on a variety of topics after a campaign\u000abuilt on hard-line, taboo-breaking proposals. A moderator asked: Flexible\u000aabout what? \u201cIt depends on what comes up,\u201d Trump said.His rivals rarely\u000apointed out when Trump had contradicted himself. The moderators often let him\u000aoff without follow-ups, in contrast to the probing questions Trump got from\u000aFox News last week.Even Trump himself seemed surprised. \u201cSo far, I cannot\u000abelieve how civil it\u2019s been up here,\u201d he said at one point.Would civility be\u000athe thing that finally took Trump down? It doesn\u2019t seem likely. But nothing\u000aelse about this campaign has, either.\u201cSometimes, being positive isn\u2019t all that\u000ainteresting,\u201d said Ohio Gov. John Kasich at the debate\u2019s end. Kasich, like the\u000aothers, had largely spared Trump as the night went on. Now, he was making his\u000afinal closing argument before his home state votes Tuesday, and he was\u000aadmitting that many people might not find him very exciting. \u201cBut it\u2019s very\u000ainteresting to my family\u201d and friends, Kasich said.The other two candidates\u000aonstage \u2014 Sens. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.) \u2014 seemed to take on\u000aTrump only on the issues, not his character.When Trump said that he does not\u000acondone violence against protesters at his rallies \u2014 but also seemed to excuse\u000athe anger that motivated them, Rubio said: \u201cI\u2019m concerned about violence in\u000ageneral in this society.\u201dKasich\u2019s criticism was relatively oblique: \u201cElections\u000aare important. But the unity of this country really matters.\u201dAnd Cruz turned\u000ahis attack instead on President Obama. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen for seven years, a\u000apresident who believes he\u2019s above the law, who behaves like an emperor,\u201d Cruz\u000asaid. He turned to the crowd: \u201cHow many of y\u2019all feel disrespected by\u000aWashington. Washington isn\u2019t listening to the people. And that\u2019s the\u000afrustration that is boiling over.\u201dThat seemed to reinforce Trump\u2019s statement\u000awhen he was asked about an altercation at a rally between a protester and one\u000aof his supporters, who on Thursday was charged with assault.\u201cPeople come with\u000atremendous passion and love for the country. And when they see protesters,\u201d\u000aTrump said, then trailed off. \u201cWhen they see what\u2019s going on with this\u000acountry, they have anger that is unbelievable.\u201dHe was asked by a moderator\u000aabout statements the candidate himself had made from the stage, suggesting\u000athat protesters might be punched, or roughed up by the crowd. Trump responded\u000aby saying that the violence was often started by protesters.\u201cWe have some\u000aprotesters who are bad dudes. They have done bad things. They are swinging,\u000athey are really dangerous, and they get in there and they start hitting\u000apeople,\u201d Trump said.Earlier, Trump gave an unusually wide-ranging denunciation\u000aof Islam and Muslims in Thursday\u2019s GOP debate, saying that \u201ca lot of \u2019em\u201d hate\u000aAmerica.\u201cI will tell you, there\u2019s something going on that maybe you don\u2019t know\u000aabout, maybe a lot of other people don\u2019t know about, but there\u2019s tremendous\u000ahatred,\u201d Trump said, after he was asked about a comment he made this week that\u000a\u201cIslam hates us.\u201d Rubio criticized Trump in his most forceful attack of the\u000anight, saying that Trump\u2019s comments would hurt America\u2019s interests by\u000aalienating Muslims overseas. Trump stood by it, and expanded with his own\u000acriticism of Islam\u2019s treatment of women.\u201cYou can be politically correct if you\u000awant. I don\u2019t want to be so politically correct. I like to solve problems,\u201d\u000aTrump said. \u201cIslam. Large portions want to use very, very harsh means. Let me\u000ago a step further. Women are treated horribly. You know that, you do know\u000athat.\u201dThat brought a rebuttal from Cruz, who had mocked Trump several times in\u000athe debate with caveman-like over-simplifications of policy arguments.Islamic\u000aterrorism was a huge threat, Cruz said, and he blamed President Obama for\u000aunder-playing and under-estimating the threat. \u201cThat is maddening,\u201d Cruz said.\u000a\u201cBut the answer is not simply to yell, \u2018China bad! Muslims bad!\u2019\u201dThen Cruz\u000aturned to an argument that, in essence, Trump\u2019s harsh rhetoric belied his\u000aactual policy positions on the Middle East, which Cruz believed were not hard-\u000aline enough. For instance, Cruz believed that Trump was not sufficiently pro-\u000aIsrael and would give away too much by seeking to be a neutral broker in\u000afuture talks between Israel and Palestinians.Prior to the exchange, the most\u000aspectacular arguments were between Trump and \u2014 himself. In two instances,\u000aTrump outlined a policy that he said was bad \u2014 and then explained how he\u000ahimself embraced it.On the question of immigration, for instance, Trump said\u000athat the system of H-1B visas, meant for highly skilled foreigners, was\u000aharmful to U.S. workers. But he still uses it at his businesses.\u201cIt\u2019s\u000asomething that I frankly use. And I shouldn\u2019t be allowed to use. And we\u000ashouldn\u2019t have it,\u201d Trump said of the H-1B program. \u201cIt\u2019s sitting there\u000awaiting for you. But it\u2019s very bad .\u2009.\u2009. for our workers. And it\u2019s very unfair\u000afor our workers.\u201dAnd then, on the subject of Social Security, Trump seemed to\u000acriticize Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for saying\u000athey didn\u2019t want to change Social Security, and even wanted to expand it.Trump\u000athen said that he, too, did not want to change Social Security.\u201cI will do\u000aeverything in my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it\u000ais,\u201d Trump said, after Rubio had said he wanted to gradually change Social\u000aSecurity so that future generations of retirees would retire later. \u201cIt\u2019s my\u000aabsolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is.\u201dIt was an almost\u000apost-apocalyptic debate, in which Trump rivals who had been blasting him a\u000aweek earlier seemed to see little point in fighting anymore. As the debate\u000awent on, Trump even seemed to turn the heat up gradually against Cruz, saying\u000athat he had supported \u201camnesty\u201d for undocumented immigrants. It was one of the\u000aworst insults of this campaign so far. Cruz just laughed, and the debate moved\u000aon. At another moment, a moderator noted that Cruz had mocked Clinton for\u000asaying something that Trump had just said right in front of him \u2014 that Social\u000aSecurity could be salvaged by cutting only \u2018Waste, fraud and abuse\u201d \u2014 and not\u000aany benefits that people actually need.Did he just compare Trump to Hillary\u000aClinton? A moderator asked.Cruz, even then, didn\u2019t bite. \u201cI will let Donald\u000aspeak for himself,\u201d Cruz said.Social Security is a major issue in Florida,\u000awhere Thursday\u2019s debate was held. That the debate was held in Florida was\u000arecognition that the biggest prize at stake on Tuesday is the Sunshine State,\u000awhere 99 delegates will be awarded to the winner, regardless of the voting\u000apercentages.On Thursday, a Washington Post-Univision News poll showed Trump\u000aleading Rubio by 38 percent to 31 percent among likely Republican voters in\u000aFlorida. That actually is good news for Rubio: Previous polls have shown him\u000alosing to Trump by double digits. But still, he would come away empty handed\u000aif he lost his home state.On another key issue in Florida, climate change,\u000aRubio took a strong stance, although one that may not prove popular in Miami.\u000aHe rejected the idea of adopting new policies to fight climate change, saying\u000athat the U.S. government could do nothing that would make a difference.Rubio\u000awas asked by a moderator about a statement from Miami\u2019s mayor, a Republican\u000awho has endorsed Rubio, worrying that rising sea levels would swamp parts of\u000ahis city. Rubio responded with skepticism that climate change was really a\u000aman-made phenomenon, saying that the climate was always changing. Rubio then\u000apivoted to a slightly different argument \u2014 saying, in essence, that U.S.\u000apolicies could not stop climate change because other countries were already\u000apumping out so many greenhouse gases.\u201cI am not going to destroy the U.S.\u000aeconomy for a law that will do nothing for the environment,\u201d Rubio said. It\u000awas a remarkable contrast from the Democratic debate the night before, when\u000aboth Democratic candidates spoke about climate change as an urgent problem and\u000aarticulated an urgent need to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.Kasich responded\u000aby saying, \u201cI do believe\u201d that man-made climate change is occurring. Trump and\u000aCruz were not asked their opinion.Thursday night\u2019s debate contrasted sharply\u000awith previous few weeks encounters, when the GOP nominating process became\u000asurreal as Trump\u2019s challengers turned desperate.Rubio, in particular, had\u000asought to copy Trump\u2019s insult-comic style, mocking the front-runner\u2019s tan and\u000ainsulting the size of his fingers. Trump responded in the next debate with an\u000aeven more surreal moment: to reassure anyone who would draw implications from\u000athe size of his hands, he volunteered onstage that there was \u201cnot a problem\u201d\u000awith the size of his genitals.If that moment hurt Trump, it didn\u2019t hurt him\u000amuch: He has won five of the seven states that have voted since then.Losing\u000aFlorida would be devastating not just to Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign, but\u000aalso to his political career. Rubio is leaving the Senate, and he would have\u000ato face the next phase of his life with Trump\u2019s epithet \u201cLittle Marco\u201d\u000ametaphorically hung around his neck.For Kasich, who as in previous debates\u000atried to stay out of the fighting, the firewall is his home state, Ohio, which\u000awill be almost as big a prize as Florida, with 66 delegates for the winner and\u000azero for everybody else. Polls show Kasich in a close race with Trump in Ohio,\u000awhere the GOP apparatus is strongly behind the governor and he has a fairly\u000ahigh approval rating. If he can beat Trump anywhere, Ohio is it.Trump so far\u000ahas won GOP contests in 15 states. He has accumulated about 458 Republican\u000adelegates, 99 more than Cruz, his closest rival. Trump needs 1,237 delegates\u000ato win the nomination.During the debate, Trump said he would be the best at\u000aundoing the damage done to American workers by foreign trade deals \u2014 and his\u000aargument was that, as a businessman, he has exploited those very laws\u000askilfully.\u201cNobody knows the system better than me,\u201d Trump said when debate\u000amoderator Anderson Cooper asked about Trump\u2019s hiring of foreign workers for\u000ahis businesses. Trump also has been criticized for having his name-branded\u000aclothing and other products made overseas, despite his campaign-trail rhetoric\u000abemoaning the loss of American manufacturing jobs. \u201cI will take advantage of\u000ait \u2014 they\u2019re the laws. But I\u2019m the one who knows how to change it,\u201d Trump\u000asaid.The subject of foreign trade has become a powerful issue in both the\u000aRepublican and Democratic presidential primaries, with Trump and Democratic-\u000aprimary candidate Bernie Sanders appealing to white working-class voters by\u000ablaming long-serving politicians for the trade deals that shipped jobs away.In\u000aThursday\u2019s GOP debate, the two candidates who are in the Senate sounded\u000astrongly skeptical of deals that allow freer trade, which have long been\u000afavored by Republicans in Washington. Both accused the Obama administration of\u000aessentially failing to hammer out trade deals that worked well and failing to\u000aproperly enforce what had been agreed to before.\u201cThere are great trade deals,\u000aand there are bad ones,\u201d Rubio said.\u201cWe\u2019re getting killed in international\u000atrade right now,\u201d Cruz said.Another Washington deal issue came up during the\u000adebate: Cuba.Trump appeared to make up his policy on Cuba on the spot, pausing\u000afor a moment to decide that he would undo President Obama\u2019s decision to reopen\u000athe U.S. Embassy in Havana.\u201cI would probably have the embassy closed,\u201d Trump\u000asaid, after being pressed by CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. He said the closure would be\u000atemporary, while he renegotiated the terms of America\u2019s rapprochement with\u000aCuba. \u201cMake a deal. It would be great. But it\u2019s got to be a great deal. Not a\u000abad deal by the United States.\u201dWhat followed was one of Rubio\u2019s best moments\u000aof the night \u2014 a chance to defend a hard-line policy toward Cuba\u2019s communist\u000aregime, which was a key part of his platform during his rise in Florida\u000apolitics. Rubio is the son of Cuban immigrants.\u201cHere\u2019s a good deal. Cuba has\u000afree elections. Cuba stops putting people in jail\u201d for political reasons,\u000aRubio said, listing the details he would demand in a future deal with the\u000aisland\u2019s communist government. \u201cYou know what? Then we can have a relationship\u000awith Cuba. That\u2019s a good deal.\u201dTrump opened the debate by saying that his\u000aparty\u2019s establishment should embrace him \u2014 not fight him \u2014 because he is\u000abringing new voters into the primary process.\u201cThey\u2019re voting out of\u000aenthusiasm. They\u2019re voting out of love. Some of these people, frankly, have\u000anever voted before,\u201d Trump said, calling his success in the GOP primaries one\u000aof the biggest political stories around the globe. He said that the GOP\u000aestablishment should accept him, because he could defeat a Democrat in the\u000afall: \u201cWe\u2019re going to beat them soundly.\u201dEarlier in the day, reports indicated\u000athat Trump will soon be endorsed by a candidate who was involved in earlier\u000amain-stage debates \u2014 retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.Later in the debate,\u000aTrump was asked whether he would give up a pledge to \u201cself-fund\u201d his campaign\u000aif he became the Republican nominee and needed an influx of cash to take on a\u000aDemocratic candidate.\u201cI have not made that decision yet,\u201d Trump said. \u201cMy\u000adecision was that I would go through the entire primary season\u201d without taking\u000alarge contributions, Trump said. Despite his rhetoric, he is still taking\u000adonations, including from people who use the \u201cDonate\u201d button on his website.He\u000alater condemned the very system he was now considering joining. \u201cThey make\u000alarge contributions to politicians, and they have total control over those\u000apoliticians. I don\u2019t want anybody to control me, but the people right out\u000athere\u201d he said, meaning the debate audience.Trump then returned to a tactic he\u000aemployed several times Thursday night: citing his political impurities as a\u000aprivate citizens as proof that he can purify the system as a politician.\u201cI\u000aknow the system is broken,\u201d Trump said, speaking of campaign finance as\u000asomeone who has given large amounts to politicians from both parties.\u000a\u201cFrankly, I know the system better than anybody else. And I\u2019m the only up here\u000awho\u2019s going to be able to fix that system.\u201dToward the end of the debate, Trump\u000aseemed to sum up his approach to governing in one sentence: despite his\u000apromises of a hard-line stance on a variety of subjects, he would be flexible\u000awhen actually setting policy. Flexible on what? \u201cIt depends on what comes up,\u201d\u000ahe said.\u000a\u000a

VMarvin Odum, president of Shell Oil, was attending a meeting of the parent\u000acompany\u2019s executive committee in Singapore when word trickled in that an\u000aexploration well drilled in Alaska\u2019s Chukchi Sea \u2014 the crowning step in a\u000amulti-year $7 billion quest \u2014 was a dry hole. Maybe not bone dry. In a recent\u000ainterview, Odum wouldn\u2019t say. But in the oil business glossary, a dry hole is\u000aone that can\u2019t pay off commercially, and Shell\u2019s hole definitely qualified.\u000aThe parent company, Royal Dutch Shell, abruptly dropped any further drilling \u2014\u000aa setback for the industry, though a relief for environmentalists. For years,\u000athey had fought a vigorous, litigious and politically intense battle over the\u000aChukchi. Meanwhile Shell, lured by potentially rich rewards, had overcome a\u000acouple of embarrassing rig mishaps at sea and patiently navigated the courts\u000aand the Obama administration\u2019s permitting process. Now, geology had rendered\u000aits verdict. Odum, who subsequently announced that he would be retiring at the\u000aend of this month, said the news about the well didn\u2019t hit all at once, but\u000athat the drilling results and analysis came in small, painful drips over\u000aseveral days of the executive committee meeting. Odum knows all too well the\u000aelement of chance that drives the oil-drilling business. The mechanical\u000aengineer has spent his entire 34-year working life at Shell and has overseen\u000asuccessful exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. (About a third of\u000aShell\u2019s capital spending goes to North America.) The tools of the trade have\u000agrown more sophisticated over time, with computer-aided seismic surveys that\u000acan give exploration companies detailed three-dimensional, multicolored maps\u000aof the subsurface. Still, at the end of the day, there is only one way to find\u000aout for certain whether oil or natural gas is lurking deep in the\u000aEarth.\u201cThrough geology and seismic surveys, we had reduced the risk to where\u000athe only way to reduce it more was to put down a well,\u201d Odum said, adding that\u000aShell put it \u201cwhere we thought there was the highest prospect\u201d of a discovery.\u000aIf they had been correct, Odum said, the reward could have been fields as rich\u000ain oil as the Gulf of Mexico, which produces 1.6 million barrels a day worth\u000a$22 billion a year, even at today\u2019s depressed prices.\u201cThe size of the prize\u000awas always big enough to take that next step and find out for sure,\u201d he said.\u000aOdum took time to reflect during a recent visit to the University of\u000aPennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. Odum\u2019s departure has saddened many at Shell who\u000asee him as, well, a nice guy. He says now is a logical time to leave Shell,\u000awhich hired him on the spot during the one and only job interview of his life.\u000aHis father also did some work for Shell, devising a specially fitted type of\u000asteel pipe that made drilling easier \u2014 and which NASA later used, too. But\u000anow, Royal Dutch Shell is undergoing a massive reorganization to gird itself\u000afor a more climate-conscious world, but one that Shell says will still need\u000avast quantities of fossil fuels. With the recent $52 billion acquisition of\u000athe British BG Group, Royal Dutch Shell is making liquefied natural gas a\u000abigger part of its future. It also picked up alluring deepwater oil fields off\u000aBrazil. It has reorganized its lines of management by function, rather than\u000ageography. And it is planning to sell $30 billion in assets over the next\u000athree years, twice the normal rate. That could include some items in North\u000aAmerica. To many analysts, it looked like Odum was pushed into leaving. \u201cHe\u2019s\u000aa very competent guy. Very low key and sure of himself,\u201d said Fadel Gheit, oil\u000aanalyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. \u201cBut unfortunately for him, the results\u000awere pretty bad. It\u2019s basically on his watch.\u201d Gheit said the drilling rig\u000amishaps at sea cost hundreds of millions of dollars and, back on the mainland,\u000aShell had to write down the value of shale oil and gas properties. But, he\u000aadded, these setbacks were \u201cnot entirely his fault.\u201dOdum says that while he\u2019s\u000anot rushing into anything, he plans to find new work in the oil business. He\u000aalso plans to spend more time with his new grandson, his golf clubs, his cello\u000a(an eight-year-old Christmas present he\u2019s just learning) and his three\u000amotorcycles \u2014 a Harley-Davidson, a BMW and a Ducati. \u201cI love riding. It\u2019s the\u000aengineer in me,\u201d he said. The night before Odum arrived at the University of\u000aPennsylvania, students from the Penn Sustainability Review, an environmental\u000apublication, met to figure out how to pressure the university into selling the\u000aendowment\u2019s investments in fossil fuel companies. Last year, 88 percent of\u000aPenn undergraduates who voted in a referendum favored divestment from fossil\u000afuels. (A third of undergraduates voted.) Similar measures are sweeping across\u000acollege campuses, efforts that in some ways resemble the anti-apartheid\u000adisinvestment campaigns aimed at South Africa.Fossil Free Penn, which launched\u000athe referendum, has called for the university to stop new investments in the\u000afossil-fuel industry, sell off holdings in the top 200 fossil-fuel companies\u000awithin five years and reinvest a portion of the funds into renewable energy.\u000aThe group estimates that 4\u2009percent of Penn\u2019s $9.6 billion endowment is\u000ainvested in fossil-fuel companies.Royal Dutch Shell is a big target not only\u000abecause it produces oil and gas to satisfy global demand, but also because of\u000aits record in places such as Nigeria\u2019s Niger Delta, where thieves and local\u000ainsurgents frequently siphon oil from pipelines, sometimes causing leaks or\u000aexplosions. Community leaders and environmental groups have accused the\u000acompany of ruining the environment; the company has been selling or reducing\u000aits troubled operations onshore and sticking to those offshore.And in the\u000aUnited States, the push to drill in the Alaskan Arctic drew sharp opposition.\u000aUnder Odum, \u201cthe company consistently demonstrated a lack of preparedness and\u000aa willingness to push the limits of the law, technology and common sense,\u201d\u000asaid Michael LeVine, a lawyer with Oceana, which opposes all offshore\u000adrilling. \u201cShell\u2019s misadventures in the Arctic Ocean should serve as a\u000acautionary tale for other oil companies considering investments in remote and\u000adangerous places.\u201dIf ever the oil industry needed a human face, however, Odum\u000ahas been it, representing Shell in a coalition that supported the Obama\u000aadministration\u2019s cap-and-trade climate strategy back in 2009. At Penn, he said\u000athe Obama administration\u2019s Clean Power Plan \u2014 which would favor gas over coal\u000a\u2014 was \u201cnot perfect, but it\u2019s a good reasonable place to start\u201d and he was\u000a\u201csupportive.\u201d He said he would prefer an economy-wide carbon tax if it were\u000aever politically feasible, even though it would raise retail prices of oil\u000aproducts.\u201cI intellectually understand it,\u201d he said during a class in which a\u000astudent asked about the divestment movement. \u201cIf your point is to divest from\u000afossil fuel companies, just be very clear what you want to accomplish. If it\u2019s\u000aa symbolic move \u2014 \u2018we want to voice our position\u2019 \u2014 I say, \u2018fine.\u2019 I\u2019d much\u000arather say there is an opportunity here, particularly with companies like\u000aShell, to co-create a solution with a company that deeply understands energy\u000amarkets.\u201dOdum said, \u201cThe idea that you can turn fossil fuels off and other\u000asources on and all will be well in 10 years, it\u2019s just wrong.\u201d He said,\u000atherefore, that \u201cif you\u2019re going down that route [toward divestment], then I\u000awould ask you to look at differences between companies out there. I think\u000awe\u2019re trying to do the right things.\u201dShell has long basked in a bit of\u000aclimate-sensitive sunshine because of Odum\u2019s revelation (at a Washington Post\u000aevent) that the company factors in a $40-a-ton carbon price when it does the\u000aeconomic analysis on a new project, an adjustment that would penalize\u000aproposals that are the worst from a climate change point of view. Asked about\u000athe Paris climate accord, he said \u201cwe will never get this transition going at\u000athe pace people want without a price on carbon.\u201dA Penn professor had an astute\u000aquestion: Does Shell assign a carbon price only to the energy the company uses\u000ato extract oil or gas? Or does it apply the price to the end use on all oil\u000aand gas found? Odum clarified that it applied only to the amount used in\u000aextraction \u2014 a tiny sliver of the overall climate impact of a project. Odum\u000adeflected a question about whether Shell should use part of its huge annual\u000acapital budget, now about $33 billion after the BG merger, to promote\u000arenewable energy. He said that shareholders of a company like Shell might\u000aprefer if Shell stuck to what it knew \u2014 finding oil and gas \u2014 and let\u000ashareholders take other money and invest it in firms specializing in renewable\u000aenergy. Odum said that Shell is considering investing in large-scale biofuels,\u000awind and solar, but most likely side-by-side with and complementing Shell\u000anatural gas projects; Shell is not going to start manufacturing solar panels.\u000aDivestment is not the only hot-button issue at the University of Pennsylvania.\u000aWhen Odum arrived earlier in the day at the Wharton School\u2019s radio station to\u000ado an interview, the producer offered to screen out callers who were\u000aparticularly irate about shale gas drilling, which has been a huge issue in\u000aPennsylvania, where many residents say wells have contaminated drinking water.\u000aOdum told her not to worry. And when the subject didn\u2019t come up, he brought it\u000aup himself. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened in the back yard here in Pennsylvania has changed\u000athe world,\u201d Odum said of the giant Marcellus gas reserve in the state that has\u000alowered prices and made it possible to replace dirty burning coal-fired power\u000aplants with gas-fired ones. But he added, \u201cthere is a right way to develop\u000athis gas\u201d and then there are the pollution hazards residents worry about.\u000a\u201cThose are not difficult problems to solve,\u201d he said. Shell is part of a group\u000aof companies cooperating with the Environmental Defense Fund to measure potent\u000amethane leaks that could negate climate benefits of burning gas instead of\u000acoal. \u201cI come out in favor of very clear, very strong regulations,\u201d Odum said.\u000a\u201cFrom the perspective of a company like us, it protects us because everybody\u000athen has to do it the right way.\u201dBut most of the students who saw him in a\u000aclassroom, and later at an open event, zeroed in on business decisions steered\u000aby the price of oil, which has tumbled about 70 percent since July 2014. Shell\u000ahas slashed capital spending to about $20 billion from about $35 billion, and\u000ait has shelved its planned Carmon Creek oil sands project in Canada. Instead\u000aof exploring for shale oil in two dozen basins, he said the company is down to\u000asix \u201csweet spots.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re in a commodity business, and when you\u2019re in a down\u000acycle, everything is difficult to decide,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep your\u000abalance sheet strong. Not just to remain solvent but able to make strategic\u000amoves when everyone else is suffering.\u201dWhen deciding on a project, he said,\u000aShell looks at its economics, its \u201cresilience\u201d if economic conditions go bad,\u000apolitical factors, country risk and environmental issues. He said that before\u000athe steep price drop, Royal Dutch Shell had been weighing on six or seven big\u000aprojects a year, but in the past year had signed off on only two. \u201cYou don\u2019t\u000amake multibillion-dollar choices lightly,\u201d he said, when asked about his\u000atoughest decisions. \u201cI could pick an easy one: Alaska. We spent many billions\u000aof dollars exploring off Alaska,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the final answer comes from\u000athe drill bit when the oil that we needed for it to be viable wasn\u2019t there.\u201d\u000a\u000a

VAccording to new data, the number of migrant and refugee arrivals in Italy and\u000aGreece has already passed more than 100,000 this year, which points to an\u000ainflux that could dwarf numbers from 2015.As of the beginning of this week,\u000a"Greece alone had received some 102,547 arrivals since the beginning of the\u000ayear," read a statement from the International Organization for Migration. "In\u000acomparison, in 2015, migrant arrivals topped 100,000 in June."#Migrant &amp;\u000arefugee arrivals in Greece &amp; Italy in 2016 exceeded 100,000. 413 deaths\u000arecorded https://t.co/xKnKOJ8vS1 pic.twitter.com/cdloumGzW2\u2014 IOM (@IOM_news)\u000aFebruary 23, 2016The influx is part of a perhaps unprecedented surge of\u000amigrants risking the dangerous crossing to Europe. Hazardous  winter weather,\u000acompounded sometimes by the duplicity of people smugglers, have led to\u000ahundreds of deaths in the first few months of of the year.The migrant\u000alandfalls in Europe this year have mostly been on Greek islands off the\u000aTurkish coast. The majority of those documented in January comprised refugees\u000afrom Syria and Afghanistan. A survey published by the U.N.'s refugee agency\u000athis week found that 94 percent of Syrians who made the crossing to Greece and\u000a71 percent of Afghans claimed they were fleeing persecution and violence.The\u000ascale of the arrivals here is startling, given the numbers from preceding\u000ayears:All the while, the global response to the crisis remains muddled.\u000aEuropean officials have engaged in extended talks with Turkey over an aid\u000apackage that could compel Ankara to tighten its border controls. Turkey is\u000acoping with trying to support more than 2 million Syrian refugees within its\u000aborders, at a cost of billions of dollars in unbudgeted funds.And the backlash\u000aagainst European leaders who initially championed the plight of refugees\u000acontinues to grow. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, feted last year as TIME\u000amagazine's Person of the Year, is particularly in the crosshairs. A recent\u000apoll found that 40 percent of Germans believe Merkel should resign for her\u000aearlier welcoming stance to refugees.**More on WorldViews**Europe's fear of\u000arefugees echoes the anti-Semitism of the 1930s1,000 American rabbis sign\u000aletter welcoming Syrian refugees\u000a\u000a

VPARIS \u2014 A court in Lille has authorized the French government\u2019s plan to\u000ademolish portions of Calais\u2019s infamous refugee camp, the \u201cJungle.\u201d Nearly two\u000aweeks ago, French officials announced that as many as 1,000 refugees would be\u000aevicted from the Jungle\u2019s southern area, its most densely populated sector,\u000aand relocated to nearby shelters or to other refugee centers across France.\u000aLast week, a group of 200 refugees \u2014 along with eight British and French\u000anongovernmental associations \u2014 filed an injunction to delay destruction,\u000aalleging that local officials did not have sufficient alternative plans to\u000ahouse the refugees facing displacement. On Thursday, a judge gave the French\u000agovernment a green light to begin destruction, although it is not yet known\u000awhen demolition will begin. Although the government has claimed that only\u000aabout 800 to 1,000 refugees will be evicted, a census conducted last week by\u000athe organization Help Refugees estimates that as many as 3,400 people from\u000aAfghanistan, Ethiopia, Sudan, Syria and other places are living in the\u000aJungle\u2019s southern section. This figure includes 445 children, 305 of them\u000aliving alone without their families. The vast majority of the refugees are\u000adesperately waiting for clearance to enter Britain, just over 20 miles from\u000aCalais. In their eyes, leaving Calais would mean abandoning their chances to\u000across the English Channel. \u201cWe are pleased,\u201d Philippe Mignonet, Calais\u2019s\u000adeputy mayor, said of the court\u2019s decision. \u201cWe\u2019ve been asking for that for\u000aages.\u201dAs for concrete plans to destroy the camp, Mignonet added that, for now,\u000a\u201cit\u2019s wait and see.\u201d Before any demolition begins, however, the refugees and\u000acharitable and relief agencies \u2014 including L\u2019Auberge des Migrants, Secours\u000aCatholique and Care4Calais \u2014 said they will appeal. \u201cObviously, we are very\u000adisappointed, because the case really showed that the authorities didn\u2019t have\u000asufficient alternatives for the people,\u201d said Clare Moseley, the founder of\u000aCare4Calais. \u201cI\u2019m almost certain that we\u2019ll be appealing it to the European\u000aCourt of Human Rights.\u201d Mignonet disputed the accusation that the authorities\u000adid not provide sufficient alternatives for the refugees to be displaced. The\u000agovernment\u2019s plan for displaced refugees is to send them to new container\u000aunits built on the side of the Jungle or to other centers across France.\u000a\u201cThere are a lot of spaces available,\u201d he said. \u201cAll the migrants in that area\u000acan be driven somewhere in the country. But migrants have got to understand\u000athat it\u2019s impossible to stay in Calais forever.\u201d Earlier on Thursday, French\u000aInterior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve was quick to dispel the image of\u000agovernment violence against helpless refugees. \u201cThere was never any question\u000aof the French government sending bulldozers onto the site,\u201d he said. The\u000ajudge\u2019s order prohibits French authorities from using force against the\u000arefugees, and the demolition is slated to be a \u201chumanitarian operation\u201d that\u000awould spare public areas such as the Jungle\u2019s mosques, churches and schools.\u000aMignonet said the aim will instead be \u201cpersuasion.\u201dBut if refugees ignore the\u000acall to leave, he added, and authorities still do not use force, \u201cit will be a\u000asign of the state\u2019s loss of power.\u201d **Read more:** Migrants find doors\u000aslamming shut across Europe Spring could bring a fresh surge of refugees.

VThousands of people in cities across Germany marched against the refugee\u000ainflux last weekend. But what struck observers most were not the slogans but\u000arather the origins of those chanting them.Many protesters, according to German\u000amedia reports, were themselves immigrants and former refugees.That Germany's\u000anewest citizens are also among the country's most outspoken critics of\u000amigrants has flabbergasted experts and politicians alike.A widely cited survey\u000afrom several weeks ago showed that about one in four migrants thinks Germany\u000ashould stop taking in refugees altogether, whereas support for refugees is far\u000ahigher among all Germans, according to the polling institute infratest dimap.\u000aOverall, only 4 percent of all Germans agreed that refugees fleeing war should\u000anot be granted asylum.According to the country's statistical office, about 10\u000amillion immigrants (about 12 percent of the population) lived in Germany in\u000a2014, the year before the country took in more than 1 million refugees.There\u000aare two reasons that could explain why migrants are particularly opposed to\u000athe refugee influx.**1\u005c. Fear of negative repercussions **Muslim migrants,\u000aparticularly, fear that the influx of refugees could have negative\u000arepercussions for them -- both economically as well as on a more subtle level.\u000aIn an interview with German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, German sociologist\u000aFriedrich Heckmann recently explained that the aggressive reactions were part\u000aof "competition between established migrants and newcomers over the same or\u000asimilar resources."For instance, Heckmann referred to state subsidies, which\u000aare limited. However, the New Year's Eve incidents at Cologne's main station\u000ain which several migrants were alleged to have assaulted women have led to\u000amore fears: Some migrants believe that Germans could ultimately turn against\u000aall refugees and fail to differentiate between criminals and established and\u000aassimilated migrants.**2\u005c. Fabricated coverage**A significant number of those\u000amigrants opposed to the current refugee influx have Russian origins, according\u000ato German newspaper Die Welt. German politicians have recently accused Russian\u000astate media of broadcasting a deliberately falsified picture of how the\u000acountry handles the refugees.As my colleague Adam Taylor explained, an alleged\u000arape of a young girl recently made headlines -- but only in Russia. German\u000aauthorities later said that the story was fabricated. Many Russians living in\u000aGermany still rely on Russian media outlets and consequently organized\u000aprotests in front of the chancellor's office in Berlin, for instance.German\u000aauthorities now accuse Russia of falsifying coverage and inciting tensions\u000awithin Germany. According to the respected German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung,\u000athe German government launched an investigation into the matter after its\u000aintelligence agency BND accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of reportedly\u000asowing "the seeds of discord in Europe by weakening Germany and Angela\u000aMerkel."In a statement, Christiane Wirtz, Germany's deputy government\u000aspokeswoman, acknowledged that authorities were "closely monitoring the\u000acurrent spike in Russian media activity."**Also read: **Hitler\u2019s \u2018Mein Kampf\u2019\u000ais now a bestseller in GermanyWhy Germany allows certain sex offenders to go\u000aunpunished\u000a\u000a

VZAATARI REFUGEE CAMP, Jordan \u2014 As the Syrian crisis ­approaches its fifth\u000aanniversary, not far across the border in ­Jordan an altogether more hopeful\u000amilestone is being celebrated.The Zaatari refugee camp has just seen the birth\u000aof the 5,000th baby at its U.N. Population Fund-supported clinic. As aid\u000aworkers, government officials and family members gathered Tuesday to mark the\u000aoccasion, baby Rima Salameh watched the events quietly in the back of the\u000aroom, swaddled in a colorful blanket.Although she was the camp\u2019s 5,000th baby,\u000aRima was her parent\u2019s second. \u201cIt was easier this time than the first,\u201d her\u000amother, 21-year-old Kholoud Suliman from Daraa in southern Syria, told\u000areporters.Rima may be just a week old, but her presence in Zaatari is being\u000ataken as a sign that life is indeed continuing for Syrian refugees in the\u000acamp. In a speech at the party, Edward Kallon, the U.N. resident and\u000ahumanitarian coordinator, dubbed her birth an \u201causpicious occasion,\u201d while\u000aPopulation Fund officials used it to highlight the fact that there had been no\u000amaternal deaths in all these childbirths.Rima\u2019s parents are clearly grateful\u000afor the help: After they were informed that their daughter was the 5,000th\u000achild, they named her after their doctor in the clinic.As dramatic as it may\u000asound, the 5,000 figure may understate just how much life is going on in\u000aZaatari. U.N. officials estimate that the total number of births for those in\u000athe camp is closer to 10,000; several nongovernmental organizations offered\u000achildbirth facilities before the clinic opened in 2013, and over 1,000 cases\u000athat required more-advanced medical techniques have been referred to a nearby\u000ahospital run by the Moroccan military.Zaatari\u2019s population surged in the early\u000ayears after the fighting started in Syria, at one point soaring to more than\u000a100,000 people \u2014 enough to make the camp the fourth-largest \u201ccity\u201d in\u000aJordan.After many families moved to escape the crowding and live outside the\u000acamp, the population dropped to around 80,000. Now, many argue that the camp\u000ais getting better and better \u2014 and that it may even evolve into a real city\u000awithin a few years.\u201cThey have created something that is approaching normalcy,\u201d\u000aAoife McDonnell, the U.N. refugee agency\u2019s Jordan spokeswoman, said of the\u000arefugees in the camp.At the event Tuesday, Rima\u2019s father showed off some of\u000athat normalcy, bringing plates of falafel from the restaurant he works at in\u000athe camp to pass out to guests. Mohammed Salameh, 22, argued that the falafel\u000ais the best in Zaatari. He may well be right, but there is plenty of\u000acompetition: Zaatari\u2019s central street, dubbed the Champs-Elysees, is full of\u000aplaces to eat. There are estimated to be thousands of small businesses\u000aoperating in the camp, with shops selling wares as varied as wedding dresses\u000aand bicycles.Back in a small trailer that Salameh shares with his extended\u000afamily, it is clear that although things may have stabilized in the camp, the\u000aproblems are far from over.Salameh says he earns just 5 Jordanian dinar a day\u000afor a 12-hour shift at the restaurant, barely $7. Over the course of the\u000amonth, he makes around $210, a figure that is stretched extremely thin as he\u000ais the sole breadwinner for his large extended family.Despite the new start in\u000aZaatari, the family still faces daily challenges. Salameh\u2019s father, who\u000asuffered a stroke, needs medical attention. One of Salameh\u2019s sisters was\u000akilled by a barrel bomb in Syria. Her infant son, Fahad, now lives with\u000aSalameh in Zaatari; the family says he survived in the rubble for hours before\u000abeing found. Another sister has a young child named Sham, an Arabic word that\u000arefers to a part of Syria \u2014 the homeland where new mother Kholoud Suliman\u2019s\u000aentire family remains, despite the risk and the distance from their\u000adaughter.In the end, Salameh explained, the hope is that Rima and her sister\u000awon\u2019t go through all this. What he and his wife want for their daughters is\u000ajust \u201ca better chance than we did in our lives.\u201d **Read more:** Most of the\u000arefugees stuck in Greece are now women and children French court gives okay to\u000ademolish Calais\u2019s \u2018Jungle\u2019 refugee camp Germany seeks North African help to\u000aspeed migrant deportations Today's coverage from Post correspondents around\u000athe world\u000a\u000a

VAZRAQ REFUGEE CAMP, JORDAN \u2014 The sprawling Azraq refugee camp east of Amman\u000awas designed with the benefit of hindsight.Before it opened in 2014, most\u000aSyrian refugees who arrived in Jordan ended up in chaotic situations, either\u000aat the densely packed Zaatari camp or in informal urban arrangements. But the\u000aAzraq camp\u2019s ordered design and planned construction promised something\u000abetter.Today, Syrian refugees who arrive in Jordan are taken to the camp,\u000awhere they live in bare-bones homes and receive food and medical care.\u201cIt\u2019s\u000aanother life,\u201d said Abdullah Ahmad, a 32-year-old who arrived just days ago\u000aafter fleeing Islamic State-held territory near Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city.\u000a\u201cWe hadn\u2019t even tasted the joys of life before we arrived here.\u201dYet some\u000avisitors to the camp are likely to be struck by something else. Despite its\u000asize, tight security and the obvious amounts of money that have gone into\u000abuilding it, large parts of Azraq are essentially empty. According to the\u000alatest United Nations figures, fewer than 20,000 refugees live in the camp,\u000aeven though it was designed to hold up to 100,000. Of Azraq\u2019s four residential\u000a\u201cvillages,\u201d just two are occupied. Another planned village has not been\u000aconstructed yet.In a way, it\u2019s hindsight that caused the problem.When Azraq\u000awas proposed, it was based on the assumption that the flow of Syrians would\u000acontinue in the same tumultuous way that created the need for the Zaatari\u000acamp.It did not.That doesn\u2019t mean fewer Syrians are trying to reach Jordan.\u000aWhile Azraq sits partly empty, tens of thousands of refugees sit on the border\u000ain a no man\u2019s land known as \u201cthe Berm,\u201d a dusty, desolate patch of land barely\u000ainside Jordanian territory.Jordanian authorities say these people are leaving\u000aIslamic State-controlled territory and need stringent security checks before\u000athey can enter Jordan.Hala Shamlawi, spokeswoman for the International\u000aCommittee of the Red Cross in Jordan, one of the few groups with consistent\u000aaccess to the area, said that there have been several waves of arrivals since\u000aSeptember 2013 and that it is unclear how long some have been there. Recent\u000aarrivals to Azraq describe having to wait for as long as five months.Jordan\u2019s\u000arefusal to take in these refugees may also be a sign of a broader problem.\u000aLong a country that has been willing to accept large numbers of refugees from\u000athe Syrian war, Jordan may finally be reaching its limit. Almost 700,000\u000aSyrians are registered as refugees in Jordan, but the government estimates the\u000atotal number in the country at considerably more than 1 million.In a country\u000aof just 6.5 million, that\u2019s a significant proportion of the population, and\u000amany Jordanians are frustrated. They say that refugees push wages down and\u000aprices up and that they take up a substantial amount of government spending.\u000aAnd with Turkey and Europe slowly becoming more difficult and risky options\u000afor Syrians, there is a worry that letting masses of people through the border\u000awill only encourage more Syrians to view Jordan as their best bet.Children\u000aplay at the Zaatari camp in Jordan on March 1, 2016. (Photos by Lorenzo\u000aTugnoli for The Washington Post)Figures released recently by the Jordanian\u000aBorder Guards with the U.N. refugee agency indicate that the number of\u000arefugees on the border had reached 26,000. But aid agencies are reluctant to\u000atalk about the situation at the Berm, concerned that their already limited\u000aaccess to the refugees in the area may be curtailed. With few exceptions,\u000ajournalists are refused entry to the border area, which is technically\u000aclassified as a military area.The government had been reluctant to discuss the\u000asituation but has become more open. \u201cIf you want to take the moral high ground\u000aon this issue, we\u2019ll get them all to an air base and we\u2019re more than happy to\u000arelocate them to your country,\u201d King Abdullah II said in an interview with the\u000aBBC last month.Nazmieh Azadeen Amoreh, a 57-year-old Syrian, arrived at Azraq\u000afrom the Berm two weeks ago. When asked how many people are stuck on the\u000aborder, she repeated, \u201cSo many, so many, so many.\u201d She then added her own\u000aexaggerated guess: 10 million.Often the families allowed through include women\u000awho are in the late stages of pregnancy.Franjiah al-Ali, a 33-year-old woman\u000afrom Idlib, arrived at the camp less than a month ago and gave birth in Azraq\u000atwo weeks later. She and her family had been stuck at the border for five\u000amonths, she says, with the Jordanian military repeatedly telling them it was\u000asimply following a \u201cprocedure.\u201d While her son, Muhammad, is healthy, staff at\u000athe hospital where the baby was born say that Ali was dangerously malnourished\u000awhen she arrived. \u201cThey saved my life,\u201d Ali said.Compared with Zaatari, a\u000abustling yet chaotic camp that is closer to the Syrian border, Azraq can seem\u000alifeless. The camp was built in the middle of a desert, away from Jordanian\u000atowns. Syrians who live in Zaatari or outside the camps often set up their own\u000abusinesses, but Azraq is run in a top-down system \u2014 food is generally bought\u000afrom an on-site supermarket. Security is notably tighter in Azraq than in\u000aZaatari.Some Syrians eventually flee the camp, deciding to try their luck in\u000acities. A considerable number are granted permits to leave the camp to visit a\u000acity. Many do not come back. Andrew Harper, the U.N. refugee agency\u2019s\u000arepresentative to Jordan, said that this in itself may be a security risk that\u000athe Jordanian government is not willing to accept. \u201cWe may put up fences if\u000athat is the issue that allowed refugees to be able to come in,\u201d he said.But\u000afor many new arrivals in the camp, it\u2019s still better than what they escaped.\u000aEven in Azraq, Ahmad grimaces when he thinks of his time in Islamic State-\u000acontrolled territory, where he was ordered to take a course on Islam after he\u000awas seen talking to a woman who wasn\u2019t a relative.Ahmad said he and his family\u000aspent four months on the border after their escape from Aleppo. He doesn\u2019t\u000aknow why he was allowed into Jordan, but he\u2019s glad he was. Now his family,\u000aincluding his wife and five children, is settling into life in Azraq.\u201cI would\u000alike to thank the Jordanian people,\u201d he says. \u201cLong live the king.\u201d**** Syrian\u000arefugees are pawns in a wider war Today\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents\u000aaround the world\u000a\u000a

VA Swedish teenager who was rescued from the clutches of the Islamic State by\u000aKurdish militias in Iraq has spoken out to local media about her time among\u000athe jihadists.Marlin Stivani Nivarlain, a 16-year-old from the town of Boras,\u000adescribed her ordeal to a Kurdish television station in the northern Iraqi\u000acity of Erbil, the capital of the semi-autonomous Kurdish regional government.\u000aNivarlain said she had been duped by her boyfriend, who persuaded her to\u000aaccompany him to join the extremist group.She linked up with the 19-year-old\u000ain 2014.\u201cFirst it was good together, but then he started to look at ISIS\u000avideos and speak about them and stuff like that,\u201d she said in the interview\u000awith Kurdistan 24, using another name for the Islamic State."Then he said he\u000awanted to go to ISIS, and I said, \u2018Okay, no problem,\u2019 because I did not know\u000awhat ISIS meant or what Islam was \u2014 nothing.\u201dAccording to her narrative of\u000aevents, last May the couple left a foster home in Sweden and journeyed by\u000atrain and bus to Turkey, where they then crossed over into Syria from the\u000asouthern Turkish city of Gaziantep. There, the jihadists eventually moved them\u000ato the Iraqi city of Mosul.Not long after, Nivarlain, who was apparently also\u000apregnant, started to regret her decision.\u201cIn Sweden we have everything, and\u000awhen I was there, I did not have anything,\u201d she said in the interview.\u201cI did\u000anot have any money either. It was a really hard life. When I had a phone I\u000astarted to contact my mum and I said: \u2018I want to go home.\u2019\u201dThe circumstances\u000aof her rescue from a house outside of Mosul are not totally clear. Nor does\u000athe Kurdish report detail what happened to Nivarlain\u2019s newborn child. She is\u000ain the process of being repatriated to Sweden.Her story is hardly unique.\u000aNumerous would-be jihadists and smitten girlfriends have traveled from Europe\u000ato the Islamic State\u2019s territories in Iraq and Syria only to discover that\u000athings weren\u2019t quite as they imagined.**More on WorldViews**The Islamic State\u000aand its war against historyThe misguided debate about the Islam of the Islamic\u000aState\u000a\u000a

VThe Islamic State militant thought to have been killed in a Friday morning\u000aairstrike in Libya was reportedly linked to several major terrorist attacks in\u000aTunisia last year.U.S. officials said Noureddine Chouchane, a Tunisian member\u000aof the extremist group, helped train militants who launched a deadly attack on\u000aa Tunis museum last year and another at a beach resort popular with Europeans.\u000aHe also helped facilitate the movement of Islamic State fighters from Tunisia\u000ato Libya, the officials said.The attack on the Bardo Museum in the Tunisian\u000acapital, Tunis, involved three gunmen dressed in police uniforms. They killed\u000a23 people, including 17 foreigners. Two months later, a lone gunmen smuggled a\u000aKalashnikov-type rifle under a beach umbrella and began shooting beach-goers\u000aat a resort in Sousse, on Tunisia\u2019s coast. That attack left 38 dead. The\u000aIslamic State claimed responsibility for both the Bardo and Sousse\u000arampages.Both attacks targeted Tunisia\u2019s tourism industry and managed to deal\u000aa sharp blow to the small country\u2019s economy.According to a Tunisian news site,\u000aChouchane was a kick boxer who lived in Italy for a time and later joined the\u000amilitant group Ansar al-Sharia. His family is from Sidi Bouzid, a city in\u000acentral Tunisia, according to the site. The Post could not independently\u000averify that information.The airstrike near Sabratha, in western Libya, Friday\u000amorning was conducted by U.S. F-15 strike fighters. It also supposedly\u000adestroyed an Islamic State training camp.\u201cDestruction of the camp and\u000aChouchane\u2019s removal will eliminate an experienced facilitator and is expected\u000ato have an immediate impact on ISIL\u2019s ability to facilitate its activities in\u000aLibya,\u201d Pentagon press secretary Peter Cook said in a statement, using an\u000aacronym for the Islamic State.Chouchane was one of five militants for whom\u000aTunisia had issued arrest warrants in the weeks after the Bardo attack. One of\u000athem, a Moroccan named Mohamed Ali Aroui, was arrested trying to flee into\u000aLibya. The other three, Adel Ghandri, Chemseddine Sendi and Maher Gadi, have\u000ayet to be found. It is unclear whether any of them were killed in the Sabratha\u000astrike._Missy Ryan contributed to this report._\u000a\u000a

VOne of the cornerstones of the Islamic State\u2019s arsenal is undoubtedly the\u000aimprovised explosive device, or IED. And as the group attempts to hold what\u000aterritory it has in Iraq and Syria, it has become a staple of the group\u2019s\u000adefensive and offensive capabilities.The modern IED came of age during the\u000aearly years of the last Iraq War, as bands of insurgents began attacking U.S.\u000avehicles and patrols with hidden bombs made of unexploded ordnance, industrial\u000asupplies and whatever else could be squeezed into a container and made to\u000aexplode. Countering the low-budget, highly lethal devices became a game of\u000achess for the United States and its allies fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u000aFor every American widget put into the field, the enemy would make a bomb\u000acapable of, at the least, undermining it. But with the United States long wars\u000aof occupation winding down, groups like the Islamic State\u2013who are now fighting\u000aopponents with little of the same capabilities the United States once brought\u000ato bear\u2013are producing the weapons on an almost industrial scale.[_ISIS attacks\u000aspike in Syria with help from Russian air cover, report says_]A report\u000apublished Thursday by the weapon research group, Conflict Armament Research,\u000aexamines a sampling of the Islamic State\u2019s IEDs gathered from the battlefields\u000aof Syria and Iraq. The group, over the course of almost two years, examined\u000amore than 700 IED components and traced them back to 51 countries and 20\u000acompanies spread from Turkey to the United States.While the report points out\u000athat all companies involved in the trade of the components did so legally, its\u000amost striking finding is how fast the items found their way into the hands of\u000athe Islamic State.\u201cThe appearance of these components in possession of Islamic\u000aState forces, as little as one month following their lawful supply to\u000acommercial entities in the region, speaks to a lack of monitoring by national\u000agovernments and companies alike,\u201d the report says. \u201cIt may also indicate a\u000alack of awareness surrounding the potential use of these civilian-market\u000acomponents by terrorist and insurgent forces.\u201dThe report only details\u000acommercially available items, not any of the military-type explosives that\u000amight be used in tandem with the devices. The report also does not go into\u000adetail about what the purpose of these IEDs might have been used for, i.e. to\u000adestroy vehicles, maim foot patrols, etc.[_The fight against the Islamic State\u000ajust entered a new phase \u2014 and it could grow soon_]Many of the items used to\u000abuild IEDs are commonly found in and around construction sites and mining\u000afacilities\u2013including detonation cord and chemical components. Yet their\u000aprevalence in seemingly benign settings hasn\u2019t made them any less problematic.\u000aThe report points to countries like Turkey and Iraq as those responsible for\u000afunneling the majority of the reports\u2019 recorded IED material.\u201cIslamic State\u000aacquisition networks draw most heavily on lawful commerce in the countries\u000athat border their territory,\u201d the report says.Additionally, and somewhat\u000aunsurprisingly, the Islamic State\u2019s preferred cell phone for remotely\u000atriggering some of their IEDs is the Nokia Model 105. According to the report,\u000aof the 10 phones documented, eight had been sent through a third party in the\u000aUAE while two were acquired in Iraqi Kurdistan. The Nokia 105 is an extremely\u000acommon phone throughout the Middle East.\u000a\u000a

VAbu Omar al-Shishani, a top Islamic State leader, was likely killed in a\u000aseries of coalition airstrikes near a strategic town in Syria last week,\u000aaccording to Pentagon officials.Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said in a\u000astatement that the U.S. military was still \u201cassessing the results\u201d of the\u000aoperation. The strikes were conducted by both manned and unmanned aircraft,\u000asaid one official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss operational\u000adetails.The official said 12 other Islamic State fighters were also killed in\u000athe strike, which hit near the town of Shadadi. No civilians were killed, the\u000aofficial added.Shishani\u2019s death, if confirmed, would represent a strike at the\u000aorganization\u2019s group of operational leaders. Shishani was a skilled tactician\u000awho helped Syrian rebels to victory in a number of key battles earlier in the\u000awar. He was also likely a key decision-maker for Islamic State combat\u000aoperations in the region. By contrast, the 2015 attack on Mohammed Emwazi, the\u000aISIS executioner known by many as \u201cJihadi John,\u201d eliminated a more symbolic\u000amember of the terrorist group. Shadadi has been the site of heavy fighting in\u000arecent weeks as the Syrian Democratic Forces and Kurdish YPG fighters have\u000afought to retake the town from Islamic State forces. Backed by U.S. airstrikes\u000aand advisers, the two groups managed to take the town \u2014 a key intersection for\u000aIslamic State forces moving into Iraq \u2014 relatively quickly.\u201cIt is unusual and\u000anoteworthy that [Shishani] \u2014 who was the ISIL equivalent of the secretary of\u000adefense \u2014 had traveled to the al-Shadadi area from Raqqa,\u201d the official\u000asaid.Shishani\u2019s presence near Shadadi \u201cwas likely to bolster the sagging\u000amorale of ISIL fighters there,\u201d the official said, using an acronym for the\u000aIslamic State.A Georgian by birth known also as \u201cOmar the Chechen\u201d and by his\u000abirth name of Tarkhan Tayumurazovich Batirashvili, Shishani fought in the\u000aGeorgian armed forces during the country\u2019s short war in 2008 against the\u000aRussians. After serving out his time in his home country\u2019s military, Shishani\u000ajoined a number of rebel brigades fighting in Syria following the start of the\u000acountry\u2019s civil war in 2011. Sometime in 2013, Shishani joined the Islamic\u000aState. In September 2014, Shishani was added to the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s\u000alist of specially designated global terrorists.\u201cBatirashvili is a battle-\u000atested leader with experience who had led ISIL fighters in numerous\u000aengagements in Iraq and Syria,\u201d Cook said in an emailed statement. \u201cHis\u000apotential removal from the battlefield would negatively impact ISIL\u2019s ability\u000ato recruit foreign fighters \u2014 especially those from Chechnya and the\u000a[Caucasus] regions \u2014 and degrade ISIL\u2019s ability to coordinate attacks and\u000adefense of its strongholds like Raqqah, Syria, and Mosul, Iraq.\u201d **Read\u000amore:**The current chaos in Syria may help the Islamic StateTurkey pledges to\u000asend ground forces to fight the Islamic State in SyriaIslamic State is no\u000alonger so formidable on the battlefield\u000a\u000a

VSulayman Dawud al-Bakkar, an Islamic State fighter apparently responsible for\u000amanufacturing chemical weapons, was transferred to Iraqi custody Thursday\u000aafter being held by U.S. forces for roughly a month. Al-Bakkar, also known as\u000aAbu Dawud, was captured in a U.S. special operations raid in February. The\u000araid was carried out by the Expeditionary Targeting Force \u2014 a unit that was\u000adeployed to Iraq in recent months with specific orders to capture and kill\u000ahigh-value Islamic State fighters throughout the region.It was unclear where\u000aAbu Dawud was held while in U.S. custody. U.S. officials have stressed that\u000atheir intent after capturing Islamic State fighters is to transfer them to\u000alocal authorities as quickly as possible.\u201cHis capture removed a key ISIL\u000aleader from the battlefield, and provided the coalition with important\u000ainformation about ISIL\u2019s chemical weapons capabilities. Dawud was transferred\u000aearlier today into the custody of the Government of Iraq,\u201d Pentagon spokesman\u000aPeter Cook said in an emailed statement, using an acronym for the Islamic\u000aState.According to Cook, intelligence gleaned from Dawud \u201cresulted in multiple\u000acoalition airstrikes that have disrupted and degraded ISIL\u2019s ability to\u000aproduce chemical weapons and will continue to inform our operations in the\u000afuture.\u201dWhile U.S. officials would not confirm the Islamic State has used\u000achemical weapons against its opponents, there are numerous instances where\u000alocal forces have reported coming under attack from chemical agents \u2014\u000aespecially in northern Iraq. According to a report in Reuters, Islamic State\u000aforces fired 107mm rockets loaded with a \u201cpoisonous substance\u201d at a town in\u000aIraqi Kurdistan earlier this week, wounding 40.Dawud is the second Islamic\u000aState fighter captured by U.S. forces. Last year, a U.S. raid in Syria\u000acaptured Umm Sayyaf, the wife of a high-level Islamic State commander. Sayyaf\u000ahas since been charged in a U.S. federal court.\u000a\u000a

VHUBBARD, Iowa \u2014 His voice quavering with emotion, Mike Valde told Sen. Ted\u000aCruz (R-Tex.) about his brother-in-law: He was a barber who couldn\u2019t afford\u000ahealth care until the Affordable Care Act, and after getting coverage he went\u000ato the doctor for the first time in years, and was diagnosed with multiple\u000atumors. He died soon after.\u201cMark never had health care until Obamacare,\u201d Valde\u000atold Cruz in a middle school cafeteria here. \u201cWhat are you going to replace it\u000awith?\u201dCruz has made repealing the Affordable Care Act one of the central\u000atenets of his presidential run. He tells voters that he plans to \u201crepeal every\u000aword of Obamacare,\u201d a line that typically gets big cheers. Valde heard those\u000acheers, and Cruz\u2019s opposition to the law, at an event earlier this year. He\u000awanted to ask Cruz about his stance but didn\u2019t. He says he was \u201ckicking\u000amyself\u201d because of it. So he decided to come to see Cruz again; this time to\u000aask the question.Cruz expressed his sorrow for Valde\u2019s loss.\u201cUnder Obamacare,\u000amillions of Americans have lost their jobs. Millions of Americans have lost\u000atheir doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket. That is happening all\u000aacross this country,\u201d he said, noting that President Obama said the average\u000afamily\u2019s health insurance premium would drop by $2,500.\u201cI\u2019ve joked, anyone\u000awhose premiums have dropped $2500 as President Obama promised should vote for\u000aHillary Clinton. I\u2019ll take everybody else,\u201d as some people chuckled. Valde\u000awasn\u2019t amused.\u201cMy question is, what are you going to replace it with?\u201d Valde\u000aasked.\u201cSir, I promise you, I will answer your question. I\u2019m laying out first\u000aof all the problems,\u201d Cruz said. He went on to say that the \u201cmost pragmatic,\u000athe most prudent\u201d thing to do is repeal the law and start over. When that is\u000adone, he said that competition in the marketplace should be expanded, people\u000ashould be able to buy health insurance across state lines and that everyone\u000awants people to have insurance coverage.\u201cYour father in law, he couldn\u2019t\u000aafford it,\u201d Cruz said.\u201cBrother-in-law,\u201d Valde responded.\u201cYour brother-in-law\u000acouldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d Cruz said.\u201cRight. But he could afford it, he finally got\u000ait under Obama,\u201d Valde told Cruz.Cruz repeated Valde\u2019s story, that by the time\u000aValde\u2019s brother-in-law went to a doctor, he was already dying.\u201cHe would have\u000agotten it earlier, if he could have afforded it earlier, but because of\u000agovernment regulations, he couldn\u2019t,\u201d Cruz said.Valde, a Democrat who said he\u000awill caucus for Hillary Clinton, said after the exchange that Cruz hadn\u2019t\u000aanswered his question.The answer, he said, was incomplete.\u201cI think he said\u000awhat he wanted, but pragmatically, I don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to get it\u000athrough Congress,\u201d he said.Valde said he knows there have been many problems\u000aimplementing the law, but he said it allowed his brother-in-law to finally\u000aafford health care.\u201cIt\u2019s a stump line, we\u2019re gonna repeal Obamacare, every\u000aword, and then you get the crowd response,\u201d he said. \u201cI want an America with\u000ahealth care.\u201d\u000a\u000a

VIn 2013, freshman Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said he had a plan to do something\u000athat seemed impossible. He could force President Obama to strip the funding\u000afrom the landmark health-care law that had come to bear his name \u2014 Obamacare \u2014\u000aby threatening to shut down the government.To some other conservatives, there\u000awas a problem with Cruz\u2019s plan.It still seemed impossible.To succeed, Cruz\u000aneeded a novel way to outmaneuver the Democrat-led Senate and then pressure\u000aObama to undercut his signature domestic policy achievement.But Cruz didn\u2019t\u000ahave one. Instead, his critics said, he offered only a fanciful theory that if\u000athe GOP flirted hard enough with a shutdown, Democratic lawmakers and the\u000aWhite House might lose heart and surrender.Grover Norquist, the influential\u000aanti-tax activist, likened Cruz\u2019s strategy to a plotline in the satirical\u000aanimated show \u201cSouth Park,\u201d in which a group of gnomes comes up with a\u000abrilliant plan to become rich.\u201cStep 1 is: Steal all the underwear in South\u000aPark. Step 2 is: _Mumumumbumbumbum_,\u201d Nor­quist said, making a nonsense sound.\u000a\u201cAnd Step 3 is: Make a million dollars. And this [plan] reminded me of that\u000aepisode.\u201dJosh Holmes, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u000a(R-Ky.), said it was \u201clike a toddler\u2019s version of legislating.\u201dCruz\u2019s gambit\u000adidn\u2019t work. Neither Senate Democrats nor Obama gave an inch on their\u000acherished law. Instead, the government shut down for 16 days, and Republicans\u000ain Congress were blamed for it \u2014 including by other Republicans, who said they\u000ahad distracted attention from the disastrous rollout of the HealthCare.gov\u000awebsite. ****Today, the drama that surrounded the shutdown \u2014 including Cruz\u2019s\u000a21-hour Senate speech, in which he read \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d to his daughters\u000avia the C-SPAN feed \u2014 is the defining moment of a Senate tenure that has\u000ahelped make Cruz the favorite Republican presidential candidate for many\u000aconservatives.To those supporters, the shutdown signaled the depth of Cruz\u2019s\u000acommitment to rein in government.But for many Republicans in Congress, this\u000awas the episode that soured them on Cruz. Many suspect that he always knew his\u000aplan would fail but went ahead with it anyway \u2014 expecting that he would\u000apersonally benefit from the exposure, even if his party lost a damaging\u000afight.\u201cHe knew that. He knew it. He knew it,\u201d former senator Tom Coburn\u000a(R-Okla.) said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about the shutdown. It wasn\u2019t about the Affordable\u000aCare Act. It was about launching Ted Cruz.\u201dOn the campaign trail this year,\u000anone of Cruz\u2019s fellow senators have endorsed him for president. And some GOP\u000arivals have used the shutdown to criticize him.Republican presidential\u000acandidate Marco Rubio, a senator from Florida who was a vocal supporter of\u000aCruz during the shutdown, now uses it to call Cruz ineffective: \u201cI\u2019m the only\u000aone running that\u2019s actually ever scored a victory against Obamacare,\u201d Rubio\u000asays. He is referring to a bill that undercut a government program to bail out\u000afailing insurers. Rubio didn\u2019t actually play a very substantial role in its\u000apassage. But it passed.Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a former presidential\u000acandidate and a longtime Cruz nemesis who is now backing former Florida\u000agovernor Jeb Bush, cites the shutdown saga as proof that Cruz is\u000ashameless.\u201cWhat he did was stood up for Ted and threw the Republican Party\u000aunder the bus,\u201d Graham has said. On the campaign trail, Cruz often talks about\u000aObamacare, telling audiences that he will \u201crepeal every word\u201d of the health-\u000acare law if he is elected president. But he refers to the 2013 battle\u000ainfrequently. And he rarely utters the word \u201cshutdown.\u201d ****Rick Tyler, a\u000aspokesman for Cruz\u2019s campaign, said the senator doesn\u2019t often say the word\u000abecause shutting down the government was never his goal.\u201cHe didn\u2019t pursue a\u000agovernment shutdown strategy. That\u2019s not even sane,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cThat would\u000abe a good thing to go out and campaign on? That wasn\u2019t what he did. He led the\u000afight to defund Obamacare.\u201dBut even in Cruz\u2019s telling of the story, his plan\u000ato defund Obamacare was based on a misreading of how other key players would\u000areact when he threatened a shutdown.He says he thought Obama and top Democrats\u000awould be cowed. He says he thought Senate Republican leaders would be willing\u000a\u2014 at least in public \u2014 to take the risk.In both cases, he was wrong.\u201cThe\u000areason it didn\u2019t work is because Ted Cruz was the only candidate, the only\u000asenator, who campaigned on defunding Obamacare and followed through on his\u000acampaign promise. Nobody else did,\u201d Tyler said, arguing that others said: \u201c\u000a\u2018Oh, we don\u2019t have the votes. We\u2019ll just give up.\u2019 That\u2019s not leadership;\u000athat\u2019s capitulation and appeasement and surrender.\u201d ****If there was a blunder\u000ain Cruz\u2019s plans, Tyler said, \u201cthe miscalculation was that when his colleagues\u000acampaigned on defeating Obamacare, he thought they meant it.\u201d ****The fullest\u000aexplanation of that time, written from Cruz\u2019s perspective, came in his 2015\u000abook, \u201cA Time for Truth.\u201d In it, Cruz begins the chapter about his own fight\u000awith a story from 160 years ago. Just before the Civil War, he writes, a\u000aWisconsin abolitionist was punished for breaking the law to help a former\u000aslave escape to Canada. But later, Cruz says, the man was pardoned and\u000avindicated.\u201cHe was an American hero,\u201d Cruz writes.In the next paragraph, Cruz\u000ajumps from slavery to Obamacare, and from that American hero to himself.\u201cIn\u000aWashington, pundits repeatedly intone that we had no plan, no strategy, and no\u000ahope of success,\u201d Cruz writes. \u201cI\u2019ve got many personal faults, but, as a\u000aformer Supreme Court litigator, failing to plan is not one of them.\u201dIt was not\u000aCruz\u2019s idea, originally.In 2013, conservative activists were looking for a new\u000atactic to defeat the health-care law, which had survived a Supreme Court\u000achallenge, before its first insurance exchanges opened Oct. 1. Republicans had\u000atried passing standalone bills to repeal it, but the Senate killed them. The\u000anew plan was to use a bill that the Senate was obligated to pass \u2014 a spending\u000abill to keep the government funded. They would pass a bill that paid for\u000aeverything, except Obamacare.\u201cIt was the last chance. It was the last gasp to\u000astop it,\u201d said Brent Bozell, chairman of the conservative group ForAmerica.\u000a\u201cDid I think it was going to work? We knew it was going to be tough. Anything\u000ais possible. But we knew it was going to be tough.\u201dCruz joined the \u201cdefund\u201d\u000aeffort early on and became its leading spokesman and an important legislative\u000aleader.\u201cThe president is never going to sign a bill that defunds Obamacare,\u201d\u000aCNN\u2019s Candy Crowley told him on Aug. 25, 2013, with a shutdown a little more\u000athan a month away.\u201cYou know, you may be convinced to that,\u201d Cruz\u000areplied.\u201cYou\u2019re not convinced to that?\u201d Crowley asked.\u201cI am not at all,\u201d Cruz\u000asaid.In theory, his plan worked like this:First, the House would pass a bill\u000ato defund the health-care law.Then came the Senate. Republicans had 46 seats\u000athere \u2014 not enough to pass a bill but enough to block one. So they\u2019d block a\u000avote on any Democratic version of the spending bill. In the meantime, Cruz\u000awould use lobbying and public pressure to swing wobbly Democrats over to his\u000aside.Eventually, Obamacare opponents would have the 60 Senate votes they\u000aneeded to pass Cruz\u2019s bill and send it to the president.At that point,\u000aaccording to Cruz\u2019s plan, Obama might start to respond as he did during the\u000adebt-ceiling showdown two years earlier. In those negotiations, the threat of\u000aa government default was so scary that the White House and legislative leaders\u000aagreed to a series of drastic cuts known as the sequester.Chip Roy, Cruz\u2019s\u000achief of staff at the time, described the debt talks as a \u201cmodel\u201d for Cruz\u2019s\u000astrategy.\u201cWe could get some pound of flesh out of the president and [then-\u000aSenate Majority Leader] Harry Reid,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThat was always the\u000aendgame.\u201dBut other Republicans believed that Cruz\u2019s plan was too farfetched to\u000awork.For one thing, Cruz would need to flip more than a dozen Democratic votes\u000ato get his idea passed by the Senate. And he\u2019d need seven more Democrats to\u000aoverride a presidential veto. If Cruz couldn\u2019t get them, ever, then Republican\u000aleaders were reluctant to gridlock the Senate and wait for the impossible to\u000ahappen.\u201cVirtually everybody understood the absurdity of the tactic,\u201d said\u000aHolmes, the former McConnell aide. \u201cLook, we all support the idea of defunding\u000aObamacare. But saying we were going to defund Obamacare\u201d with 46 votes \u201cin the\u000aSenate or shut the government down is absurd.\u201dBut in the summer and fall of\u000a2013, Cruz and conservative activist groups pressed on, pressuring other\u000aRepublicans to go along with the plan. They tended to reduce the complex\u000acalculations of the fight \u2014 60-vote thresholds, worries about presidential\u000avetoes \u2014 into a test of Republican fortitude.\u201cHow do we win the fight to\u000adefund Obamacare?\u201d Cruz shouted at a rally in Dallas in the summer of 2013,\u000apart of a 10-city tour. \u201cDon\u2019t blink.\u201dStep 1 worked, as Cruz wanted. The GOP-\u000aled House \u2014 pushed by conservatives who were coordinating with Cruz \u2014 passed a\u000abill to cut off the health-care law\u2019s money.Now it was time for the\u000aSenate.\u201cKind of like Evel Knievel crossing the Grand Canyon,\u201d said former\u000acongressman Steve Southerland II (R-Fla.), who voted for Cruz\u2019s plan in the\u000aHouse. That was a joke: Knievel, the 1970s motorcycle daredevil, always\u000aboasted that he could jump the Grand Canyon. But he never actually did.Indeed,\u000ahere is \u201cwhere the plan went awry,\u201d Cruz says in his book.\u201cWhat we did not\u000aanticipate was that .\u2009.\u2009. the GOP leadership team would decide to publicly,\u000adirectly and aggressively lead the fight against the House Republicans and in\u000afavor of Obamacare,\u201d he writes.Senate Republicans did not gridlock their\u000achamber, and several criticized Cruz for making them the villains.The\u000aDemocrats who ran the Senate were able to reject the House bill easily. Cruz\u000anever seems to have made a concerted effort to lobby red-state Senate\u000aDemocrats, whom he described as the last key element of his plan to win over\u000athe Senate.\u201cI don\u2019t ever remember hearing from Senator Cruz or his people,\u201d\u000asaid former senator Mark Pryor (Ark.), who was perhaps the Senate\u2019s most\u000avulnerable Democrat at the time. He would lose his reelection bid to a\u000aRepublican by 17 points. But he says he never felt pressure. \u201cThere was zero\u000atemptation for Democrats to shut down the government or defund Obamacare. No\u000aone on the Democratic side was interested in that at all.\u201dAs the days ticked\u000adown to the shutdown, Cruz was criticized even by House conservatives, who\u000athought he needed to do more to make his plan work. He gathered with top aides\u000ain a small office near the Capitol dome. He read to them from Psalm 40,\u000arecalled Roy, his former chief of staff.The reading is a plea for deliverance\u000afrom someone overcome by problems: \u201cFor troubles without number surround me.\u000aMy sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see.\u201dCruz then went to the Senate\u000afloor.\u201cI intend to speak in support of defunding Obamacare until I am no\u000alonger able to stand,\u201d he said.Cruz\u2019s speech was, at its heart, a meditation\u000aon impossibility. He cited cases in which things that seemed impossible \u2014 the\u000aContinental Army\u2019s fight against the British, the British fight against the\u000aNazis, the mountain climbed by the Little Engine That Could \u2014 were difficult\u000abut possible.His battle, Cruz said, was similar. \u201cI think I can. I think I\u000acan. No, you can\u2019t. No, you can\u2019t. We can\u2019t win,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop\u000aObamacare. It cannot be done. It is impossible.\u201dBut, it turned out, he\u000acouldn\u2019t.In his book, he blamed Obama\u2019s refusal to compromise on the\u000apresident\u2019s confidence in how the friendly media would tell the story.\u201cHe knew\u000ahis media lap dogs would report that it was Republicans who were refusing to\u000acompromise,\u201d Cruz wrote.Finally, on the 16th day of the shutdown, the Senate\u000aand the House voted to fund the health-care law, ending the standoff without\u000aany of the victories Cruz wanted. Cruz and his allies blamed Senate\u000aRepublicans, saying they had splintered without ever testing Obama\u2019s\u000aresolve.\u201cWith respect to Obama, it\u2019s the road not taken. We don\u2019t know. I\u000acan\u2019t accept the premise that we miscalculated on Obama in the slightest,\u201d Roy\u000asaid. \u201cThe Republican leadership literally cowered in the corner, afraid of\u000athe word \u2018shutdown.\u2019\u2009\u201d**** Today, the sting from the standoff lingers among\u000aCruz\u2019s congressional colleagues.\u201cHow can I say this nicely? He was still\u000acritical of those of us who pointed out the obvious shortcomings of his\u000atactic, and he called us capitulators,\u201d Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) said.\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s not real leadership. That\u2019s lemming leadership. It\u2019s lemming\u000aleadership, is what it is.\u201dEven so, while the shutdown earned Cruz enemies in\u000aWashington, his success thus far in the presidential race shows that it gave\u000ahim credibility with the conservative base. When he was campaigning in Des\u000aMoines in the closing days before his victory in the Iowa caucuses this month,\u000aone of the men who introduced him uttered the S-word that Cruz avoids.\u201cWhen\u000aTed Cruz shut down the government,\u201d said Michael Berry, a conservative talk-\u000aradio host and Cruz ally.The crowd roared.__\u000a\u000a

VMore than 11.3 million people have signed up for health coverage under the\u000aAffordable Care Act in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, according\u000ato data released Thursday that provides the first national snapshot of\u000aenrollment for 2016.The total includes 8.6 million people (76 percent) through\u000alast Saturday in the 38 states using the federal marketplace, HealthCare.gov,\u000aas well as 2.7 million people (24 percent) who enrolled in coverage as of Dec.\u000a26 in the 13 state insurance exchanges.Enrollment is well ahead of the figures\u000aannounced in late 2014, when more than 7.1 million people had signed up for\u000a2015 health plans \u2013 6.5 million via HealthCare.gov and 633,000 in the 14\u000astates that were then running their own marketplaces.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing\u000aunprecedented demand" for coverage, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia\u000aBurwell said in a statement, which noted that the consumers now seeking\u000acoverage "are increasingly young, engaged and shopping for the best\u000aplan."Nationwide, almost 4 million people under 35 signed up on the federal\u000aand state marketplaces through Dec. 26. Of those, nearly 3 million are ages\u000a18-34 \u2013 more than a quarter of all plan selections. HHS officials touted that\u000apercentage, although it is about the same as late December last year.The\u000aofficials said one enrollment trend involving young adults was particularly\u000aencouraging.\u201cOver 1 million new consumers under age 35 signed up for\u000aHealthCare.gov coverage,\u201d said Andy Slavitt, acting administrator for the\u000aCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. They represent 41 percent of all\u000anew consumers, he said, up from 38 percent at this time last year.Federal\u000aofficials also said the latest numbers show that consumers are actively\u000aengaged in choosing their coverage. Among the 8.2 million re-enrolled\u000acustomers nationwide, more than half came back, reviewed their information and\u000aactively selected a plan.And about 60 percent of people who actively re-\u000aenrolled through HealthCare.gov switched to a different plan, officials said.\u000aMany enrollees faced substantial premium increases if they stuck with their\u000aold plans and could save a substantial amount of money by switching, noted\u000aLarry Levitt, a senior vice president at Kaiser Family Foundation.Robert\u000aLaszewski, an insurance industry analyst and frequent critic of the law, has\u000awarned that enrollment is not strong enough to make the ACA politically and\u000afinancially sustainable.  \u000a\u201cWe always see these big enrollment numbers being announced by the\u000aadministration, only to see the block shrink dramatically by year-end,\u201d he\u000awrote in a blog post this week.Open enrollment continues through Jan. 31, and\u000athe sign-up totals could fluctuate as plan changes or cancellations occur,\u000asuch as those in response to life changes like a new job or marriage. The data\u000areleased Thursday only reflect plan selections and do not indicate how many\u000aconsumers have paid their premiums to put coverage in effect.Until now, the\u000aObama administration's ACA snapshots have looked at just HealthCare.gov. Data\u000areleased at the end of 2015 suggested enrollment was skewing slightly younger,\u000aand officials say that's likely a proxy for healthy people -- a trend that is\u000acrucial to the stability of the marketplaces.Enrollment is a key barometer of\u000athe 2010 law's success because insurance premiums in the federal exchange are\u000aup this year by 7.5 percent on average, nearly four times as much as a year\u000aago.Despite the latest numbers, the Obama administration has not adjusted its\u000amodest projection for how many more Americans will have coverage at the end of\u000athe year compared to the close of 2015 \u2013 acknowledgement that successful\u000aoutreach will be increasingly tough.The decline in the nation\u2019s uninsured rate\u000awas stagnant last year, according to a Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index\u000areleased Thursday. The survey showed that 11.9 percent of U.S. adults did not\u000ahave health insurance in the final quarter of 2015, the same as in the first\u000aquarter.\u201cThis validates concerns that similarly large reductions may not be\u000apossible in the future because the remaining uninsured are harder to reach or\u000aless inclined to become insured more generally,\u201d Gallup noted.**Read more:**2\u000amillion current ACA enrollees ignore advice to return to\u000aHealthCare.govCongress sends health-care law to Obama, setting up certain veto\u000a\u000a

VIn 2013, freshman Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas said he had a plan to do something\u000athat seemed impossible. He could force President Obama to strip the funding\u000afrom the landmark health-care law that had come to bear his name \u2014 Obamacare \u2014\u000aby threatening to shut down the government.To some other conservatives, there\u000awas a problem with Cruz\u2019s plan.It still seemed impossible.To succeed, Cruz\u000aneeded a novel way to outmaneuver the Democrat-led Senate and then pressure\u000aObama to undercut his signature domestic policy achievement.But Cruz didn\u2019t\u000ahave one. Instead, his critics said, he offered only a fanciful theory that if\u000athe GOP flirted hard enough with a shutdown, Democratic lawmakers and the\u000aWhite House might lose heart and surrender.Grover Norquist, the influential\u000aanti-tax activist, likened Cruz\u2019s strategy to a plotline in the satirical\u000aanimated show \u201cSouth Park,\u201d in which a group of gnomes comes up with a\u000abrilliant plan to become rich.\u201cStep 1 is: Steal all the underwear in South\u000aPark. Step 2 is: _Mumumumbumbumbum_,\u201d Nor­quist said, making a nonsense sound.\u000a\u201cAnd Step 3 is: Make a million dollars. And this [plan] reminded me of that\u000aepisode.\u201dJosh Holmes, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u000a(R-Ky.), said it was \u201clike a toddler\u2019s version of legislating.\u201dCruz\u2019s gambit\u000adidn\u2019t work. Neither Senate Democrats nor Obama gave an inch on their\u000acherished law. Instead, the government shut down for 16 days, and Republicans\u000ain Congress were blamed for it \u2014 including by other Republicans, who said they\u000ahad distracted attention from the disastrous rollout of the HealthCare.gov\u000awebsite. ****Today, the drama that surrounded the shutdown \u2014 including Cruz\u2019s\u000a21-hour Senate speech, in which he read \u201cGreen Eggs and Ham\u201d to his daughters\u000avia the C-SPAN feed \u2014 is the defining moment of a Senate tenure that has\u000ahelped make Cruz the favorite Republican presidential candidate for many\u000aconservatives.To those supporters, the shutdown signaled the depth of Cruz\u2019s\u000acommitment to rein in government.But for many Republicans in Congress, this\u000awas the episode that soured them on Cruz. Many suspect that he always knew his\u000aplan would fail but went ahead with it anyway \u2014 expecting that he would\u000apersonally benefit from the exposure, even if his party lost a damaging\u000afight.\u201cHe knew that. He knew it. He knew it,\u201d former senator Tom Coburn\u000a(R-Okla.) said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about the shutdown. It wasn\u2019t about the Affordable\u000aCare Act. It was about launching Ted Cruz.\u201dOn the campaign trail this year,\u000anone of Cruz\u2019s fellow senators have endorsed him for president. And some GOP\u000arivals have used the shutdown to criticize him.Republican presidential\u000acandidate Marco Rubio, a senator from Florida who was a vocal supporter of\u000aCruz during the shutdown, now uses it to call Cruz ineffective: \u201cI\u2019m the only\u000aone running that\u2019s actually ever scored a victory against Obamacare,\u201d Rubio\u000asays. He is referring to a bill that undercut a government program to bail out\u000afailing insurers. Rubio didn\u2019t actually play a very substantial role in its\u000apassage. But it passed.Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a former presidential\u000acandidate and a longtime Cruz nemesis who is now backing former Florida\u000agovernor Jeb Bush, cites the shutdown saga as proof that Cruz is\u000ashameless.\u201cWhat he did was stood up for Ted and threw the Republican Party\u000aunder the bus,\u201d Graham has said. On the campaign trail, Cruz often talks about\u000aObamacare, telling audiences that he will \u201crepeal every word\u201d of the health-\u000acare law if he is elected president. But he refers to the 2013 battle\u000ainfrequently. And he rarely utters the word \u201cshutdown.\u201d ****Rick Tyler, a\u000aspokesman for Cruz\u2019s campaign, said the senator doesn\u2019t often say the word\u000abecause shutting down the government was never his goal.\u201cHe didn\u2019t pursue a\u000agovernment shutdown strategy. That\u2019s not even sane,\u201d Tyler said. \u201cThat would\u000abe a good thing to go out and campaign on? That wasn\u2019t what he did. He led the\u000afight to defund Obamacare.\u201dBut even in Cruz\u2019s telling of the story, his plan\u000ato defund Obamacare was based on a misreading of how other key players would\u000areact when he threatened a shutdown.He says he thought Obama and top Democrats\u000awould be cowed. He says he thought Senate Republican leaders would be willing\u000a\u2014 at least in public \u2014 to take the risk.In both cases, he was wrong.\u201cThe\u000areason it didn\u2019t work is because Ted Cruz was the only candidate, the only\u000asenator, who campaigned on defunding Obamacare and followed through on his\u000acampaign promise. Nobody else did,\u201d Tyler said, arguing that others said: \u201c\u000a\u2018Oh, we don\u2019t have the votes. We\u2019ll just give up.\u2019 That\u2019s not leadership;\u000athat\u2019s capitulation and appeasement and surrender.\u201d ****If there was a blunder\u000ain Cruz\u2019s plans, Tyler said, \u201cthe miscalculation was that when his colleagues\u000acampaigned on defeating Obamacare, he thought they meant it.\u201d ****The fullest\u000aexplanation of that time, written from Cruz\u2019s perspective, came in his 2015\u000abook, \u201cA Time for Truth.\u201d In it, Cruz begins the chapter about his own fight\u000awith a story from 160 years ago. Just before the Civil War, he writes, a\u000aWisconsin abolitionist was punished for breaking the law to help a former\u000aslave escape to Canada. But later, Cruz says, the man was pardoned and\u000avindicated.\u201cHe was an American hero,\u201d Cruz writes.In the next paragraph, Cruz\u000ajumps from slavery to Obamacare, and from that American hero to himself.\u201cIn\u000aWashington, pundits repeatedly intone that we had no plan, no strategy, and no\u000ahope of success,\u201d Cruz writes. \u201cI\u2019ve got many personal faults, but, as a\u000aformer Supreme Court litigator, failing to plan is not one of them.\u201dIt was not\u000aCruz\u2019s idea, originally.In 2013, conservative activists were looking for a new\u000atactic to defeat the health-care law, which had survived a Supreme Court\u000achallenge, before its first insurance exchanges opened Oct. 1. Republicans had\u000atried passing standalone bills to repeal it, but the Senate killed them. The\u000anew plan was to use a bill that the Senate was obligated to pass \u2014 a spending\u000abill to keep the government funded. They would pass a bill that paid for\u000aeverything, except Obamacare.\u201cIt was the last chance. It was the last gasp to\u000astop it,\u201d said Brent Bozell, chairman of the conservative group ForAmerica.\u000a\u201cDid I think it was going to work? We knew it was going to be tough. Anything\u000ais possible. But we knew it was going to be tough.\u201dCruz joined the \u201cdefund\u201d\u000aeffort early on and became its leading spokesman and an important legislative\u000aleader.\u201cThe president is never going to sign a bill that defunds Obamacare,\u201d\u000aCNN\u2019s Candy Crowley told him on Aug. 25, 2013, with a shutdown a little more\u000athan a month away.\u201cYou know, you may be convinced to that,\u201d Cruz\u000areplied.\u201cYou\u2019re not convinced to that?\u201d Crowley asked.\u201cI am not at all,\u201d Cruz\u000asaid.In theory, his plan worked like this:First, the House would pass a bill\u000ato defund the health-care law.Then came the Senate. Republicans had 46 seats\u000athere \u2014 not enough to pass a bill but enough to block one. So they\u2019d block a\u000avote on any Democratic version of the spending bill. In the meantime, Cruz\u000awould use lobbying and public pressure to swing wobbly Democrats over to his\u000aside.Eventually, Obamacare opponents would have the 60 Senate votes they\u000aneeded to pass Cruz\u2019s bill and send it to the president.At that point,\u000aaccording to Cruz\u2019s plan, Obama might start to respond as he did during the\u000adebt-ceiling showdown two years earlier. In those negotiations, the threat of\u000aa government default was so scary that the White House and legislative leaders\u000aagreed to a series of drastic cuts known as the sequester.Chip Roy, Cruz\u2019s\u000achief of staff at the time, described the debt talks as a \u201cmodel\u201d for Cruz\u2019s\u000astrategy.\u201cWe could get some pound of flesh out of the president and [then-\u000aSenate Majority Leader] Harry Reid,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThat was always the\u000aendgame.\u201dBut other Republicans believed that Cruz\u2019s plan was too farfetched to\u000awork.For one thing, Cruz would need to flip more than a dozen Democratic votes\u000ato get his idea passed by the Senate. And he\u2019d need seven more Democrats to\u000aoverride a presidential veto. If Cruz couldn\u2019t get them, ever, then Republican\u000aleaders were reluctant to gridlock the Senate and wait for the impossible to\u000ahappen.\u201cVirtually everybody understood the absurdity of the tactic,\u201d said\u000aHolmes, the former McConnell aide. \u201cLook, we all support the idea of defunding\u000aObamacare. But saying we were going to defund Obamacare\u201d with 46 votes \u201cin the\u000aSenate or shut the government down is absurd.\u201dBut in the summer and fall of\u000a2013, Cruz and conservative activist groups pressed on, pressuring other\u000aRepublicans to go along with the plan. They tended to reduce the complex\u000acalculations of the fight \u2014 60-vote thresholds, worries about presidential\u000avetoes \u2014 into a test of Republican fortitude.\u201cHow do we win the fight to\u000adefund Obamacare?\u201d Cruz shouted at a rally in Dallas in the summer of 2013,\u000apart of a 10-city tour. \u201cDon\u2019t blink.\u201dStep 1 worked, as Cruz wanted. The GOP-\u000aled House \u2014 pushed by conservatives who were coordinating with Cruz \u2014 passed a\u000abill to cut off the health-care law\u2019s money.Now it was time for the\u000aSenate.\u201cKind of like Evel Knievel crossing the Grand Canyon,\u201d said former\u000acongressman Steve Southerland II (R-Fla.), who voted for Cruz\u2019s plan in the\u000aHouse. That was a joke: Knievel, the 1970s motorcycle daredevil, always\u000aboasted that he could jump the Grand Canyon. But he never actually did.Indeed,\u000ahere is \u201cwhere the plan went awry,\u201d Cruz says in his book.\u201cWhat we did not\u000aanticipate was that .\u2009.\u2009. the GOP leadership team would decide to publicly,\u000adirectly and aggressively lead the fight against the House Republicans and in\u000afavor of Obamacare,\u201d he writes.Senate Republicans did not gridlock their\u000achamber, and several criticized Cruz for making them the villains.The\u000aDemocrats who ran the Senate were able to reject the House bill easily. Cruz\u000anever seems to have made a concerted effort to lobby red-state Senate\u000aDemocrats, whom he described as the last key element of his plan to win over\u000athe Senate.\u201cI don\u2019t ever remember hearing from Senator Cruz or his people,\u201d\u000asaid former senator Mark Pryor (Ark.), who was perhaps the Senate\u2019s most\u000avulnerable Democrat at the time. He would lose his reelection bid to a\u000aRepublican by 17 points. But he says he never felt pressure. \u201cThere was zero\u000atemptation for Democrats to shut down the government or defund Obamacare. No\u000aone on the Democratic side was interested in that at all.\u201dAs the days ticked\u000adown to the shutdown, Cruz was criticized even by House conservatives, who\u000athought he needed to do more to make his plan work. He gathered with top aides\u000ain a small office near the Capitol dome. He read to them from Psalm 40,\u000arecalled Roy, his former chief of staff.The reading is a plea for deliverance\u000afrom someone overcome by problems: \u201cFor troubles without number surround me.\u000aMy sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see.\u201dCruz then went to the Senate\u000afloor.\u201cI intend to speak in support of defunding Obamacare until I am no\u000alonger able to stand,\u201d he said.Cruz\u2019s speech was, at its heart, a meditation\u000aon impossibility. He cited cases in which things that seemed impossible \u2014 the\u000aContinental Army\u2019s fight against the British, the British fight against the\u000aNazis, the mountain climbed by the Little Engine That Could \u2014 were difficult\u000abut possible.His battle, Cruz said, was similar. \u201cI think I can. I think I\u000acan. No, you can\u2019t. No, you can\u2019t. We can\u2019t win,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop\u000aObamacare. It cannot be done. It is impossible.\u201dBut, it turned out, he\u000acouldn\u2019t.In his book, he blamed Obama\u2019s refusal to compromise on the\u000apresident\u2019s confidence in how the friendly media would tell the story.\u201cHe knew\u000ahis media lap dogs would report that it was Republicans who were refusing to\u000acompromise,\u201d Cruz wrote.Finally, on the 16th day of the shutdown, the Senate\u000aand the House voted to fund the health-care law, ending the standoff without\u000aany of the victories Cruz wanted. Cruz and his allies blamed Senate\u000aRepublicans, saying they had splintered without ever testing Obama\u2019s\u000aresolve.\u201cWith respect to Obama, it\u2019s the road not taken. We don\u2019t know. I\u000acan\u2019t accept the premise that we miscalculated on Obama in the slightest,\u201d Roy\u000asaid. \u201cThe Republican leadership literally cowered in the corner, afraid of\u000athe word \u2018shutdown.\u2019\u2009\u201d**** Today, the sting from the standoff lingers among\u000aCruz\u2019s congressional colleagues.\u201cHow can I say this nicely? He was still\u000acritical of those of us who pointed out the obvious shortcomings of his\u000atactic, and he called us capitulators,\u201d Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) said.\u000a\u201cThat\u2019s not real leadership. That\u2019s lemming leadership. It\u2019s lemming\u000aleadership, is what it is.\u201dEven so, while the shutdown earned Cruz enemies in\u000aWashington, his success thus far in the presidential race shows that it gave\u000ahim credibility with the conservative base. When he was campaigning in Des\u000aMoines in the closing days before his victory in the Iowa caucuses this month,\u000aone of the men who introduced him uttered the S-word that Cruz avoids.\u201cWhen\u000aTed Cruz shut down the government,\u201d said Michael Berry, a conservative talk-\u000aradio host and Cruz ally.The crowd roared.__\u000a\u000a

VDuring the debate over President Obama's signature health-care law, opponents\u000awarned that the law would discourage large numbers of Americans from working,\u000aforce millions into part-time jobs and make it more difficult to find work.\u000aThree new studies released this week suggest that, so far, it hasn't\u000ahappened.The new analyses are still early, since a key requirement of the law\u000abegan to be phased in just last year, but they add to a growing body of\u000aevidence that, if the law has had any effect on the labor market, it's been a\u000asmall one.Critics had predicted that, under Obamacare, employers would shift\u000aworkers to part-time schedules to avoid a requirement that they provide\u000ainsurance to full-time employees. Critics also predicted people might opt to\u000awork less because they could obtain insurance through the marketplaces or\u000aexpanded Medicaid coverage.Last month, the Congressional Budget Office renewed\u000aits warning that Obamacare would discourage the equivalent of 2 million\u000aAmericans from working by 2025, since they can get health insurance without\u000arelying on an employer.While the new studies don\u2019t rule out a dim long-term\u000aforecast, they do offer reason for optimism. The predictions that the ACA\u000awould have broad economic consequences weren\u2019t borne out in researchers\u2019 data:\u000aPart-time jobs didn\u2019t significantly increase, and states that expanded\u000aMedicaid did not have significant shifts in employment patterns."There were a\u000alot of stories about employers, with anecdotes about employers shifting jobs\u000ato part-time," said Larry Levitt, an economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation\u000anot involved in the new research. "You can't deny those stories \u2014 they\u2019re\u000areal. They\u2019re just not generalizable. It\u2019s not what is mostly happening, based\u000aon this study and others."_[Read more: No, Obamacare isn\u2019t killing full-time\u000ajobs, new evidence shows]_That isn't to say that individual people and\u000aemployers haven't made changes because of the law. White Castle, a company\u000athat had warned it would reduce some employees' hours a few years ago, has\u000achanged its scheduling practices so more employees work fewer than 30 hours a\u000aweek, the threshold at which large companies don't have to provide health\u000acoverage. Vice President Jamie Richardson said the company had 1,400 employees\u000aworking 30 to 35 hours before the law and very few do today."In practice, if\u000ayou're part time, you're going to be scheduled to work less than 30 hours per\u000aweek," he said.At other firms, though, owners ultimately decided not to\u000arestrict hiring.In 2013, Jody Manor, who owns Bittersweet Catering, Cafe and\u000aBakery in Alexandria, Va., put his expansion plans on hold, fearing he would\u000ahave to pay for pricier comprehensive health coverage if he expanded his small\u000abusiness to more than 50 employees.Instead, Manor found out he could get a\u000abetter deal from the bakery\u2019s health insurer with a larger payroll. He opened\u000aa new cafe later that year, and employees\u2019 premiums declined by 3 percent, the\u000aonly decrease he can recall since Bittersweet opened in 1983.The results of\u000athe new research suggest that Manor\u2019s approach was the more common response to\u000anew health insurance requirements.One study, published Tuesday in the journal\u000aHealth Affairs, focuses on a widely criticized provision of the law that\u000arequires employers with at least 100 full-time workers to offer health\u000ainsurance as of the beginning of 2015. (This year, that requirement is being\u000aextended to firms with more than 50 employees.) Critics worried that the\u000aprovision would deter small businesses from expanding and would encourage them\u000ato cut their workers' hours. But this study is the latest in a series to\u000aconclude that Obamacare did not, in fact, widely result in more firms asking\u000aemployees to work part time.The authors examined Census data and found no\u000aincrease in the likelihood of working part time, except for a 0.18 percentage\u000apoint increase in the likelihood of working 25 to 29 hours per week between\u000a2013 and 2014 \u2014 a trend that the authors say predated the ACA."These results\u000aare surprising to me, given that there was a concern that employers would make\u000aadjustments in employee work hours," said Asako Moriya, a service economist\u000awith the governmental Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality who led the\u000awork.The study included another piece of evidence that appears to contradict\u000athe notion that the law would cause an increase in part-time work: The number\u000aof people working 25 to 29 hours a week in firms not subject to the mandate\u000aincreased between 2012 and 2015, while the number of people at firms subject\u000ato the mandate slightly decreased.Two groups of people were slightly more\u000alikely to work part time: workers with little education and older workers\u000abetween 60 and 64 years old. There was suggestive, but not conclusive,\u000aevidence that the shifts were voluntary and not caused by employers cutting\u000ahours.One reason that some workers might be voluntarily working fewer hours is\u000ato reduce their earnings in order to qualify for subsidized insurance from the\u000afederal government \u2014 either through the insurance marketplaces or through\u000aMedicaid.A second Health Affairs study and a working paper issued Monday by\u000athe National Bureau of Economic Research both** **examined whether employees\u000ahave chosen to work less in order to qualify for Medicaid, which became\u000aavailable to a larger group of people under health reform.The new research on\u000athe effects of the Medicaid expansion does not suggest that people are looking\u000ato limit their earnings. On the contrary, some might even be looking to work\u000amore."In general, there's been no evidence that the ACA has done anything\u000asignificant to employment," said Robert Kaestner, an economist at the\u000aUniversity of Illinois at Chicago and one of the authors of the working paper,\u000ausing the abbreviation for the Affordable Care Act. "We don't have to worry\u000atoo much."Previously, only people living in poverty were eligible for\u000aMedicaid, but the law expanded that group to people with incomes up to 138\u000apercent of the federal poverty level. The Supreme Court, though, decided that\u000athe federal government couldn't require states to expand Medicaid.That\u000adecision created an opportunity for researchers, such as Moriya \u2014 who is also\u000aone of the authors of the second article in Health Affairs \u2014 and Kaestner and\u000ahis colleagues at the University of Illinois.Following the decision, some\u000astates chose to expand Medicaid to a less impoverished group of people, while\u000aothers did not, allowing the researchers to compare the change over time in\u000athe numbers of people working and their schedules in these two groups of\u000astates.Obamacare's detractors had said that with access to Medicaid, some\u000apeople earning between the poverty level and 138 percent of that level would\u000aquit working. They might have been working in jobs that did not pay well but\u000aoffered health insurance sponsored by the employer. With insurance provided by\u000aUncle Sam, people in that category might have decided going to work wasn't\u000aworth it.At the same time, some people in that group who did not subscribe to\u000ainsurance through their employers might have turned down additional hours or\u000apromotions in order to keep their incomes below 138 percent of the poverty\u000alevel and maintain their newly acquired eligibility for Medicaid.Moriya's\u000agroup found that if some who gained Medicaid worked less as a result, their\u000anumbers were too small to measure reliably. Although they found that people\u000awere about 0.6 percentage points more likely to leave a job in the states that\u000aexpanded Medicaid than in the states that maintained the program as it was,\u000athe difference was slight enough that it could have been due to chance.In\u000afact, according to the calculations by Kaestner's group, the labor market\u000aactually looked a little bit stronger in the states that expanded\u000aMedicaid.That might be because some people whose incomes were below the\u000apoverty level before the expansion might have been working less to maintain\u000atheir eligibility, and took on a second job or additional hours when the limit\u000aon income in their state increased to 138 percent of the poverty level."People\u000acan work more and earn more," Kaestner said. "It frees people to actually be\u000aable to work without getting penalized."Moriya and her colleagues examined\u000aonly the number of people leaving a job or working fewer hours, not the number\u000ataking on a new job or working more. As a result, their analysis might not\u000ahave accounted for this positive aspect of the expansion, yielding more\u000apessimistic numbers.Yet neither group of researchers produced statistically\u000asignificant results, suggesting that any effect on the labor market was likely\u000avery small.There will be real economic effects of easier access to health\u000ainsurance \u2014 people who retire earlier or stay home to take care of a child\u000abecause they can get health insurance on their own. But as the data suggest,\u000athese changes are happening on the fringes.So far, trying to detect the effect\u000aof the ACA on the job market is like "finding a needle in a haystack," Levitt\u000asaid.**  \u000aMore from Wonkblog:**How Obamacare helped millennials chill outOne way\u000aObamacare's plan to cut drug costs for Medicare recipients falls shortMitt\u000aRomney takes credit for Obamacare, a law he vowed to repeal\u000a\u000a

VLast Updated Jan 15, 2016 1:54 AM EST**11:21 p.m.** After the last-minute\u000afireworks from Cruz and Rubio, the candidates are wrapping up with closing\u000astatements.**11:11 p.m.** Cruz went after Rubio for not supporting border\u000asecurity, prompting Rubio to accuse him of flip-flopping on issues ranging\u000afrom immigration to national security to the military budget."That is not\u000aconsistent conservatism," Rubio said. "That is political calculation."Cruz\u000aresponded, "I appreciate you dumping your oppo research folder on the\u000adebate...at least half of the things Marco said are flat-out false."**11:07\u000ap.m.** Asked about the Senate immigration bill he helped write allowing more\u000aimmigrants to come to the country legally when American workers need jobs,\u000aRubio pivoted to talking about the need to tighten security for all\u000aimmigrants."The issue is dramatically different than it was 24 months ago," he\u000asaid.**11:04 p.m.** Kasich was asked to weigh in on a new training program for\u000aChicago police. He talks about ways that Ohio is doing police retraining, but\u000aalso said one of the key issues is ""integration of community and police.""As\u000apresident of the United States, it's all about communication, folks. It's all\u000aabout getting people to listen to one another's problems," he said.**11:00\u000ap.m.** Would Trump put his assets into a blind trust if he's elected?"It's an\u000ainteresting question because I'm very proud of my company...but if I become\u000apresident I couldn't care less about my company," he said.He then gestured to\u000ahis children in the audience."Run the company kids, have a good time. I'm\u000agoing to do it for America," he said.**10:53 p.m.** Rubio hits back by arguing\u000athat Cruz can't eliminate the IRS as he is promising to do, because "someone\u000ahas to be there to collect your VAT tax." He also argues that companies will\u000apay employees less and charge companies more.**10:53 p.m.**Rubio said that\u000aunlike Cruz, he would not implement a value-added tax (VAT) because it\u000aobscures the true cost of government. Cruz responds that a business flat tax\u000ais not a value-added tax, and it also allows the U.S. to eliminate other taxes\u000asuch as the estate tax and payroll taxes.**10:47 p.m.** Asked about how to fix\u000aAmerica's roads and bridges without "breaking the bank," Christie argues for\u000areforming the tax code to bring the corporate tax rate down to 25 percent and\u000aallow for a one-time repatriation of overseas profits at just an 8.75 percent\u000arate.Carson argued for getting rid of regulations and implementing a flat\u000atax.**10:40 p.m.** In a rare moment, Cruz plays the conciliator and says both\u000aTrump and Bush are right on the issue.He pushes his tax plan, which he said\u000awould make every export tax free and every import would pay a business flat\u000atax.**10:38 p.m.** Bush looks for a few early-state votes by warning that\u000aChina would retaliate against tariffs -- possibly by blocking soybeans from\u000aIowa."We need someone with a steady hand as president of the United States,"\u000ahe said. Trump responds, "We don't need a weak person being president of the\u000aUnited States, because that what we'll get if we have Jeb."**10:36 p.m. **"You\u000ahave to be careful with tariffs," Rubio warns, saying they get passed onto the\u000abuyer. He said the best way to protect the U.S. from China is to grow the\u000aeconomy. Trump said that method will take too long.When the moderators ask\u000awhether Rubio is right about the tariff getting passed onto consumers, Trump\u000ainsisted "it will never happen" because China will let their currency\u000arise.**10:32 p.m.** Trump has a back and forth with Cavuto about whether he\u000awould impose a 45 percent tariff on Chinese goods, which he has suggested\u000abefore. "I'm saying absolutely, we don't have to continue to lose $505 billion\u000aas a trade deficit for the privilege of dealing with China. I'm a free trader.\u000aI believe it. But we have to be smart.""You're open to a tariff?" Cavuto\u000aasked."I'm totally open to a tariff if they don't treat us fairly," he\u000asaid.**10:25 p.m.** Other candidates are asked whether they would pause Muslim\u000aimmigration.Kasich: "I've been for pausing on admitting the Syrian\u000arefugees...I don't believe we have a good process on being able to vet them.\u000aBut you know we don't want to put everybody in the same category," he said. He\u000aalso talked about the need to build a coalition with Muslim\u000acountries.Christie: "I said right from the beginning we should take no Syrian\u000arefugees of any kind...after spending seven years as a former federal\u000aprosecutor, right after 9/11 dealing with this issue...you can't just ban all\u000aMuslims. You have to ban radical Muslim jihadists." He said the intelligence\u000acommunity needs more funding and tools and criticizes those who tried to\u000arestrict spying by the National Security Agency.Rubio: "If we do not know who\u000ayou are, and we do not know why you are coming...you are not getting into the\u000aUnited States of America."Cruz: "I understand why Donald made the comments he\u000adid and I understand why Americans are feeling scared and frustrated," he\u000asaid. He urged Congress to pass a bill stripping Americans of citizenship if\u000athey go to fight with ISIS, and also pass legislation stopping all refugees\u000afrom countries controlled by ISIS or al Qaeda.Carson: "Clearly what we need to\u000ado is get a group of experts together, including people from other\u000acountries...come up with some new guidelines for immigration and for visas for\u000apeople who are coming into this country."Bush: "What we need to do is destroy\u000aISIS." He said the U.S. will not ban Muslims from places like Indonesia. "You\u000adon't solve [the problem] by big talk about banning all Muslims."**10:23\u000ap.m.** Bush is asked about his comments calling Trump "unhinged" after making\u000athe proposal. Cavuto asked: Are the people who agree with Trump unhinged?"No,"\u000aBush said. "I can see why people are angry and scared...I totally get that.\u000aBut we are running for the presidency of the United States here. This is a\u000adifferent kind of job. You have to lead. You can't make rash\u000astatements."**10:21 p.m. **Bush asks Trump to reconsider."This policy is a\u000apolicy that makes it impossible to build the coalition that is necessary to\u000atake out ISIS," he said.**10:19: **Bartiromo notes that more than 10 million\u000apeople have discussed Trump's proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from the\u000aU.S. after the San Bernardino shootings. Was there anything he heard, she\u000awanted to know, that makes him want to rethink the position?"No," Trump\u000aresponds.**10:16 p.m.** South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham dropped out of the\u000aRepublican presidential race, but the candidates are still getting questions\u000aabout his proposals to fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria\u000a(ISIS) such as sending 20,000 troops to fight the group.Carson advocated for\u000alistening more to the generals and being more aggressive about bombing targets\u000alike oil tankers controlled by ISIS.On whether Syrian President Bashar Assad\u000amust go, Christie said, "You're not going to have peace in Syria with Assad in\u000acharge. You're simply not. So Sen. Graham is right about this."**10:08 p.m.\u000a**Though much of the focus on foreign policy has been about the threat from\u000aIran, Cavuto asked Kasich what he makes of recent events in Saudi Arabia.\u000aTensions between the U.S. Sunni ally and Iran are high after Saudi Arabia\u000aexecuted a prominent Shia cleric."My biggest problem with them is that they're\u000afunding radical clerics," Kasich said. "Whether I'm president or not we better\u000amake it clear to the Saudis that we're going to support you...but you've got\u000ato knock off the funding and teaching of radical clerics."**10:05 p.m.** A\u000atough moment for Cruz after he is asked what he means when he talks about "New\u000aYork values.""The values in New York City are socially liberal...focused\u000aaround money and the media," he said.Trump comes back at him by invoking the\u000a9/11 attacks. "When the world trade center came down I saw something that no\u000aplace on earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New\u000aYork," he said.**10:01 p.m.** Cruz argues that all candidates in a GOP primary\u000aare going to pledge to protect the Second Amendment, but voters are "savvier"\u000athan that."They recognize that people's actions don't always match their\u000awords. I've got a proven record fighting to protect the Second Amendment," he\u000asaid. "The other individuals on this stage wouldn't know where to be found in\u000athat fight."**9:59 p.m. **In a particularly impassioned moment, Christie\u000apromises the president Republicans will "kick your rear end of the White\u000aHouse" in fall.**9:55 p.m. **Rubio piles on as well."I am convinced that if\u000athis president could confiscate every gun in America, he would," Rubio said.He\u000aalso criticized Mr. Obama's recent executive actions to reduce gun violence,\u000asaying that criminals don't procure guns through methods that would subject\u000athem to a background check.Moderator Neil Cavuto presses Rubio about whether\u000athat's an extreme position, but Rubio doubles down and references Mr. Obama's\u000acomment about people clinging to guns and religion during the 2008\u000acampaign.**9:53 p.m.** Bush is asked about gun control in the context of the\u000aCharleston, South Carolina shooting earlier this year."The law itself requires\u000aa background check but they didn't fill their end of the bargain...we don't\u000aneed to add new rules, we need to make sure the FBI does their job," he\u000asaid.Trump also said he opposes any restrictions on guns, and echoed Bush in\u000aurging a focus on mental health.**9:46 p.m.** Carson gets the question about\u000awhether former President Bill Clinton's sexual history is fair game. The\u000aaudience seemed to think it was, with several yelling "yes." And it's been a\u000afrequent topic on the campaign trail, particularly from Trump."There's no\u000aquestion we should be able to look at any past president whether they're\u000amarried to someone who's running for president or not," he said, before\u000ashifting to a larger question about morality."Here's the real issue: Is this\u000aAmerica anymore? Do we still have standards? Do we still have values and\u000aprinciples?" he said.He said some people still recognize what is "right and\u000awrong" but that they should not let "secular progressives" drive that\u000aout.**9:40 p.m.** Rubio and Christie tussle over whether Christie's policies\u000aare liberal."We cannot afford to have a president of the United States who\u000asupports Common Core," he said, and also questioned Christie's record judicial\u000anominees and abortion access."Christie fires back at Rubio's points and also\u000amakes an oft-repeated argument that while senators talk, governors act."You're\u000aheld accountable for everything that you do," he said. "I like Marco too and\u000atwo years ago he called me a conservative reformer that new jersey needed.\u000aThat was before he was running against me. Now he's changed his tune. I'm\u000anever going to change my tune."**9:37 p.m. **Trump got a question about how he\u000awould unite the GOP after South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who delivered the\u000aofficial Republican response to President Obama's State of the Union address,\u000aurged members of her own party to resist the temptation to follow the "siren\u000acall of the angriest voices.""I will gladly accept the mantle of anger," Trump\u000asaid, because the people running the country are "incompetent."**9:31 p.m.**\u000aCruz finally gets the question about Trump's attacks on his citizenship, and\u000aaccuses Trump of attacking him because his poll numbers have risen in\u000aIowa."Back in september my friend Donald said he had had his lawyers look at\u000ait from every which way and there was nothing there, there was nothing to this\u000abirther issue..since September the Constitution hasn't changed. But the poll\u000anumbers have. And I recognize, I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his\u000apoll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law here are really\u000aquite clear here. Under longstanding U.S. law the child of a U.S. citizen born\u000aabroad is a natural born citizen," he said.Cruz went on to note that some of\u000athe more "extreme" birther theorists say that a natural born citizen must have\u000atwo parents born in the United States, which would also disqualify Trump from\u000athe presidency."I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you. You are\u000aan American as is everybody else on this stage and I would suggest we focus on\u000awho is best prepared to be commander in chief because that's the most\u000aimportant question facing the country," Cruz said.Trump once again told Cruz\u000ahe should seek a declaratory judgment that he is eligible to run, because if\u000aCruz was his vice presidential nominee -- or the nominee himself -- Democrats\u000awould challenge his citizenship.He also admitted he's raised the issue,\u000a"because now he's doing a little bit better.""I didn't care before," Trump\u000asaid. But now, "He's got probably a 4 or 5 percent chance."Cruz's response to\u000aTrump: "I'm happy to consider naming you as VP so if you happen to be right\u000ayou can get the top job at the end of the day.""I think I'll go back to\u000abuilding buildings," Trump responded.**9:22 p.m.** When about the New York\u000aTimes that he failed to disclose a low-interest loan from his wife's employer,\u000aGoldman Sachs, Cruz begins by railing about the what he viewed as a "hit\u000apiece." Then he talked about his struggle as the underdog in the 2012 Texas\u000aSenate campaign."Yes I made a paperwork error...but if that's the best hit the\u000aNew York Times has got they've better go back to the well," Cruz said.**9:20\u000ap.m.** In his first answer of the night, Trump warns that migrants could be\u000athe "great Trojan horse" of attacks on the U.S. and said he is skeptical there\u000aare few women coming to the U.S.**9:16 p.m. **Guantanamo Bay would definitely\u000aremain open under a President Rubio. He promised that any terror suspects\u000acaptured abroad would get a "one-way ticket" to the Cuban prison\u000afacility.**9:14 p.m.** As the debate turns to foreign policy, both Christie\u000aand Bush say the military has become weak under Mr. Obama and needs to be\u000astrengthened. Both also warn that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would\u000abe a disaster as president because she would continue the president's foreign\u000apolicies.Rubio also chimes in."Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being\u000acommander in chief of the United States. Someone who cannot handle\u000aintelligence information appropriately cannot be president of the United\u000aStates," he said, in a reference to Clinton's email use as secretary of\u000astate.**9:06 p.m.** ****The first question goes to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who is\u000aasked about President Obama's assessment of the economy in his State of the\u000aUnion address. Instead, he opted to first talk about the sailors who were\u000acaptured by Iran and then released earlier this week."In that State of the\u000aUnion President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been\u000acaptured by Iran. President Obama is preparing to send $100 billion or more to\u000athe Ayatollah Khomeini," Cruz said. "The next commander in chief is standing\u000aon this stage....no serviceman or servicewomen will be forced to be on their\u000aknees. **8:57 p.m.**: Just seven candidates are taking the stage for the sixth\u000aRepublican debate in North Charleston, South Carolina: businessman Donald\u000aTrump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, neurosurgeon Ben Carson,\u000aNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Ohio Gov.\u000aJohn Kasich. Fox Business Network, which is hosting the debate, raised the bar\u000afor entry in the main debate. Canddiates had to place among the top six\u000acandidates nationally in an average of the five most recent national polls\u000arecognized by Fox News, or in the top five in either Iowa or New Hampshire,\u000abased on recognized polls in those states.  Earlier in the evening, former\u000aHewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, former Pennsylvanian Sen. Rick Santorum and\u000aformer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee participated in the undercard debate. Sen.\u000aRand Paul, R-Kentucky, is boycotting the lower-tier debate after he was deemed\u000aineligible for the main stage. Fox Business rejected Paul's appeal Wednesday\u000ato participate in the first-tier debate. The debate is being moderated by Neil\u000aCavuto, a Fox Business Network anchor and managing editor of business news,\u000aand anchor Maria Bartiromo.\u000a\u000a

VPresident Obama is to unveil a series of executive actions meant to curb gun\u000aviolence, but before he even formally announces them, gun rights advocates are\u000adenouncing the move. The president is to publicly explain his moves today,\u000awhich target loopholes that allow weapons sales without background checks. In\u000athe next few years, the Supreme Court could see as many as four vacancies as\u000ajustices hit retirement age. That significant turnover could grant the winner\u000aof November's elections huge influence in determining the future composition\u000aof the nation's highest court.British authorities believe a man who appears in\u000athe latest ISIS propaganda video, threatening the U.K, is a Muslim convert\u000afrom London. Siddartha Dahr is well known to British law enforcement, but like\u000aother suspects, he appears to have waltzed into the so-called "Islamic State"\u000awith ease.Ethan Couch, the Texas teenager known for his controversial\u000a"affluenza" legal defense, will meet his high profile attorney in Mexico\u000atoday. The 18-year-old is being held at an immigration detention center. His\u000amother is soon to appear in a Los Angeles court, but her next stop could be\u000ajail. More than a third of working-age adults in the U.S. are either\u000aunemployed or aren't looking for a job, a big jump from a decade ago. We look\u000aat what's behind the increase in workplace dropouts, and some of the reasons\u000amay surprise you.Hundreds of thousands of Netflix viewers are demanding help\u000afor convicted killer Steven Avery. Fans of the documentary series "Making a\u000aMurderer" are signing petitions, claiming the legal system failed and put an\u000ainnocent man behind bars, twice. But does the show give the whole truth?**Man\u000astabs himself after standoff involving kids in Georgia****Uncontrolled\u000aacceleration in deadly Toyota crash?****3 NFL teams vying to move to L.A.\u000aarea****Utah judge retires after criticism in lesbian foster parent\u000acase****Bodies of migrants wash up on Turkish beach****Widow calls for Hebdo\u000asecurity probe year after attacks****Bus fire kills more than a dozen in\u000anorthern China****Trump maintains strong lead among GOP voters\u000anationwide****For Hillary Clinton, stakes "couldn't be higher" in Iowa****Ted\u000aCruz sides with law enforcement in Oregon standoff****Christie compares Obama\u000ato "petulant child" on guns****Why Main Street shouldn't sweat Wall Street's\u000awoes****What's Barnes &amp; Noble's next chapter?****10 retailers that offer\u000ayear-round free shipping ****Social media sites you'll see more of in\u000a2016****Second look at an old-school exercise technique****Amy (Duggar) King\u000aopens up on cousin Josh's scandal**\u000a\u000a

VFollowing the murder of 14 people in San Bernardino, California, by two\u000ashooters praised by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) as "supporters"\u000aof the terror group, President Obama is calling for a re-evaluation of the\u000anation's gun laws. "We know that the killers in San Bernardino used military-\u000astyle assault weapons -- weapons of war -- to kill as many people as they\u000acould," the president said in a video released Saturday. "It's another tragic\u000areminder that here in America it's way too easy for dangerous people to get\u000atheir hands on a gun.""Right now, people on the no-fly list can walk into a\u000astore and buy a gun. That is insane," the president said. "If you're too\u000adangerous to board a plane, you're too dangerous, by definition, to buy a\u000agun." He called on Congress to close the loophole, saying that while the\u000anation may not be able to prevent every tragedy, "at a bare minimum, we\u000ashouldn't be making it so easy for potential terrorists or criminals to get\u000atheir hands on a gun that they could use against Americans." The president\u000aalso edged closer to labeling the massacre a terrorist attack, just a day\u000aafter the FBI said it would investigate the mass shooting as an act of\u000aterrorism. "It is entirely possible that these two attackers were radicalized\u000ato commit this act of terror," Mr. Obama said. "And if so, it would underscore\u000aa threat we've been focused on for years -- the danger of people succumbing to\u000aviolent extremist ideologies."![Weapons confiscated from the attack in San\u000aBernardino, California, are shown in this San Bernardino County Sheriff\u000aDepartment handout photo from its Twitter account Dec. 3,\u000a2015.](http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/12/05/9ab2ea39-88e1-45bc-\u000a83de-8ff5941ad394/thumbnail/620x350/92f66918a010fbfcb31f7427c9fbf3dc/san-\u000abernardino-shooting-2015-12-04t044725z.jpg)\u000a\u000aView Gallery\u000a\u000aWeapons confiscated from the attack in San Bernardino, California, are shown\u000ain this San Bernardino County Sheriff Department handout photo from its\u000aTwitter account Dec. 3, 2015.\u000a\u000aReuters/San Bernardino County Sheriffs Department\u000a\u000aRepublicans, for their part, floated another possible solution to combat\u000aterror threats: strengthen the security of the U.S. visa waiver program. "We\u000ahave a major weakness in our visa-waiver program -- a glaring hole that we\u000ahave to close," Rep. Candice Miller, R-Michigan, said in a video released\u000aSaturday. The program allows foreign citizens of 38 partner countries --\u000aincluding Belgium, France and the United Kingdom -- to travel to the U.S.\u000awithout a visa. Each year, up to 20 million people enter the country in this\u000amanner. "The next terrorist to attack our country could be only one flight\u000aaway," the House Homeland Security Committee vice chair said. "And that's why\u000athe House is preparing to act on legislation to prevent our enemies from\u000aentering this country through our visa-waiver program." The bill, according to\u000aMiller, would "strengthen the security" of the program, allowing the\u000aDepartment of Homeland Security to suspend a country's participation in the\u000aprogram if it fails to share counterterrorism information with the U.S. Among\u000aother measures, the legislation would also revoke visa waivers for citizens\u000awho have traveled to Iraq and Syria in the last five years.The White House has\u000aalso proposed changes to the visa waiver program with similar restrictions.\u000a"The members of ISIS will use every means within their power to attack our\u000acountry," Miller said. "And that's why we have to use every mean within our\u000apower to defend it."\u000a\u000a

V**NEWTOWN, Conn.** \u005c-- Three years ago on Monday, a gunman opened fire in Sandy Hook Elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, killing 20 first graders and six adults.Marking the anniversary, Vice President Joe Biden tweeted: "Since that nightmare, an estimated 555 children have been killed by guns in America. It is shameful that Congress hasn't acted."Since that nightmare, an estimated 555 children have been killed by guns in America. It is shameful that Congress hasn't acted.As the nation debates gun laws and access to mental healthcare, Newtown parents remind us of the urgency.When the numbers became names, and the names became faces, suddenly, they were America's children.Twenty first graders gunned down in their classrooms, along with their teachers."It's always 12/14. It's always the last day that they went to school. And that's never gonna change," said Nicole Hockley, who lost her 6-year-old son Dylan.![](http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/01/30/4afc3d44-a645-11e2-a3f0-029118418759/thumbnail/220x140/84bfee65af71938f87b13f279bd00c7d/130130-Dylan_Hockley.jpg)\u000a\u000aA photograph of Dylan Hockley, one of the students who died in the Sandy Hook\u000aElementary School Shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.\u000a\u000aCBS News\u000a\u000aFor Nicole, something had to change."This is about not accepting this," Nicole\u000asaid. "We can't passively sit back and say, 'These shootings\u000ahappen.'"Together, with other Newtown parents, she helped found "Sandy Hook\u000aPromise" -- a group working to prevent gun violence."I can still hear him. I\u000acan still smell him, I can hear his little voice," said Mark Barden.Barden\u000alost his 6-year-old son, Daniel.![parents.jpg](http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/\u000ahub/i/r/2015/12/15/1dd13ae3-4a47-4af6-8fd6-0c889feb4210/thumbnail/620x350/188a\u000a75eaab7dd5f084cd8fd0f6e32b12/parents.jpg)\u000a\u000aView Gallery\u000a\u000aMark Barden and Nicole Hockley.\u000a\u000aCBS News\u000a\u000a"In almost every one of these mass shootings, there are signs and signals," he\u000asaid. "There are opportunities to intervene. To stop the continuum before it\u000aleads to tragedy."Together, they travel the country teaching others how to\u000arespond to those signs. They call it the "Say Something" campaign: If you see\u000asomeone at risk, say something. That training worked recently in Cincinnati\u000awhen a student reported someone plotting an\u000aattack.![](http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2012/12/17/2ac38019-c43a-\u000a11e2-a43e-02911869d855/thumbnail/220x140/0316f4212b01581da322d5b2f25bbab8/Dani\u000aelBarden_AP971707888426.jpg)\u000a\u000aDaniel Barden, 7, a victim in the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary\u000aSchool in Newtown, Conn., Dec. 14, 2012.\u000a\u000aRex Features via AP Images\u000a\u000a"The whole thing was stopped and diffused," said Barden."I burst into tears.\u000aTo actually know that we potentially saved lives -- that means something,"\u000asaid Nicole through tears.And so does sweeping gun legislation they helped\u000apass in Connecticut two years ago. It expands the ban on assault weapons, and\u000alimits the number of rounds per magazine.But the campaign has had it setbacks\u000a-- especially with the defeat of a bill two years ago that would have closed\u000aloopholes in background checks for gun buyers. And often, people will say, "If\u000ait didn't happen with Newtown, when will it happen?""It is happening," said\u000aBarden."Sandy Hook was the start. It was a catalyst for change," said Nicole.\u000a"It's too late for us. But there's a lot of positive change for this country\u000athat will come."Change that will keep a promise for the children of Sandy\u000aHook.\u000a\u000a

VLast Updated Dec 20, 2015 12:11 AM EST**10:50 p.m. **Excerpts from the closing\u000astatements:Sanders: "On our worst day I think we have a lot more to offer the\u000aAmerican people than the right wing extremists...I know something about\u000aeconomic anxiety and living in a family that does not have sufficient income\u000aand that is why I have pledged...to bring about a political revolution where\u000amillions of people begin to stand up and say 'enough is enough, this great\u000acountry and our government belong to all of us.'"O'Malley: "Tonight what you\u000alistened to was a healthy exchange of ideas...When you listened to the\u000aRepublicans debate the other night you heard a lot of anger and a lot of\u000afear...they can have their anger and they can have their fear but anger and\u000afear never built America."Clinton: "On January 20, 2017 the next president of\u000athe United States will walk into the White House. If, heaven forbid, that next\u000apresident is a Repbulican I think its pretty clear we know what will happen. A\u000alot of the rights that have been won over the years from women's rights to\u000avoter rights to gay rights to worker rights will be at risk...This is a\u000awatershed election. I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed\u000aPresident Obama in the White House and I will do all that I can in this\u000acampaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as\u000apresident."She closed by saying, "Thank you, good night, and may the Force be\u000awith you."**10:37 p.m. **O'Malley gets a question about whether his wife,\u000aKatie, would have to give up her work as a district judge if he were\u000aelected."That would be totally up to her. Katie has never been a person who\u000alet her husband's professional choices get in the way of her dreams," he said.\u000a"Katie O'Malley will do whatever Katie O'Malley wants to do regardless of\u000awhether her husband gets elected."**10:34 p.m. **A question for Clinton, who\u000aheld this role: Is it time to change the role of a president's spouse?" The\u000arole has been defined by each person who has held it and I am very grateful\u000afor all my predecessors and my successors because of them did what she could\u000ato support her husband and her country but also chose to work on issues that\u000awere of particular concern," Clinton said. "With respect to my own husband, I\u000aam probably still going to pick the flowers and the China for state dinners\u000aand stuff like that, but I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have\u000afor special missions, for advice, and in particular how we're going to get the\u000aeconomy working again for everybody."As Sanders is asked about his own wife,\u000ahe took a second to praise Clinton's tenure as first lady. She "redefined what\u000athat role could be."**10:28 p.m.** A follow up question goes to Clinton about\u000awhether she bears responsibility for the chaos in Libya after the 2011\u000amilitary intervention. She blamed the Arab Spring and ISIS propaganda for\u000adestabilizing the country."What we're seeing happening in Libya right now is\u000athat there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that\u000aexist between Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS...and to try to\u000acreate a national government," she said. "This is not easy work. We did a lot\u000ato help."Raddatz pressed her over whether mistakes were made, and Clinton\u000asaid, "There's always a retrospective to say what mistakes are made...we\u000aoffered a lot of help and it was difficult for the Libyans to accept\u000ahelp."**10:25 p.m.**"I agree, we need to reign in the overprescribing,"\u000aO'Malley said, but he also called for a $12 billion federal investment for\u000alocal partnerships and said there needs to be more intervention at\u000ahospitals.**10:22 p.m.** The debate shifts to heroin abuse, as Muir talks\u000aabout a poll that showed 48 percent in new Hampshire say they have known\u000asomeone who has abused heroin.Sanders said that part of the solution is\u000atelling doctors prescribing opiates and pharmaceutical companies to "get their\u000aact together" to help fix the problem. Plus, he said, addiction should be\u000atreated like a disease and not a criminal problem.Clinton says the federal\u000agovernment should offer $10 billion over 10 years to work with states to come\u000aup with a plan to fight the heroin epidemic."There are too many opioids being\u000aprescribed...that leads directly to heroin addiction," Clinton said.**10:19\u000ap.m. **Sanders focused his comments on reforming the criminal justice\u000asystem."We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice\u000asystem," he said, and called for an effort to end institutional racism."Police\u000aofficers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African\u000aAmericans," he said. He also said it is important to make police officers look\u000alike the communities they serve.**10:16 p.m.** The debate turns to race as\u000aClinton is asked how to bridge the divide between civilians and law\u000aenforcement."We need to get a bipartisan commitment to work together on this\u000aand we need to hear the voices of those men and women and boys and girls who\u000afeel like strangers in their own country and do whatever is necessary to not\u000aonly deal with the immediate problems within the criminal justice system, but\u000amore opportunities, more jobs, more education," Clinton said.O'Malley talked\u000aabout his experience as mayor of Baltimore -- increasing drug treatment, using\u000adata to protect the lives of young people and doing a better job of policing\u000athe police."We reported excessive force, discourtesy, lethal use of force," he\u000asaid. "As a nation, we have to embrace this moment and make our departments\u000amore open."**10:08 p.m. **O'Malley said what sets him apart is the experience\u000abalancing a budget every year when he was governor of Maryland.He has called\u000afor expanding Social Security and giving paid family leave. He also called for\u000ahigher taxes on top earners.One entitlement the U.S. cannot afford, he said,\u000ais "the entitlement that the super wealthy among us -- those earning more than\u000aa million dollars -- feel they are entitled to pay lower income tax rates and\u000aa far lower preferred tax rate when it comes to capital gains."**10:05 p.m.\u000a**Clinton reaffirms her pledge not to raise taxes on middle class families."I\u000adon't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise\u000amiddle class families' taxes...we've got to get back to where people can save\u000amoney again," she said.Sanders said Clinton is going against President\u000aRoosevelt on Social Security and President Johnson on Medicare -- as well as\u000aprogressive Democrats, who argue for small tax increases to pay for things\u000alike paid medical and family leave.**10:04 p.m. **The debate turns to taxes.\u000a"Now this is getting fun!" Sanders exclaims.**10:01 p.m.** As O'Malley talks\u000aabout his plan to give students access to a debt-free college education at any\u000ain-state university, he thanks Clinton for "borrowing" many of his ideas in\u000aher own plan.Clinton calls for debt-free public tuition and said the U.S.\u000ashould focus on poorer families, not eliminating tuition for everyone.**9:59\u000ap.m. **Sanders is talking about his education plan, which would put a\u000aspeculation tax on Wall Street to eliminate tuition at public colleges and\u000auniversities altogether."If we are going ot be competitive in the global\u000aeconomy we need the best educated workforce," he said, calling it "insane"\u000athat some people cannot afford to go to college.Read more about where the\u000acandidates stand on college affordability here.**9:53 p.m. **Asked about\u000arising premiums for health insurance, Clinton said, "I would certainly build\u000aon the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the\u000aglitches."She said she has proposed a $4,000 tax credit to help people who\u000ahave very large out of pocket costs and wants Medicare to be able to negotiate\u000afor lower drug prices. Additionally, Clinton said, the health care exchanges\u000aneed to be "properly regulated so we are not being gamed."**9:48\u000ap.m.**O'Malley argues that he has a better plan than both of his rivals,\u000asaying, "We're not going to fix what ails our economy...by either trying to\u000areplace American capitalism with socialism...nor will we fix it by submitting\u000ato Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.""I had the backbone to take on Wall\u000aStreet in the ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has," he said, and\u000arecalled what he termed "shameful" comments Clinton made in the last debate\u000alinking Wall Street, campaign finance and the terrorist attacks on\u000a9/11."Clinton fired back, saying O'Malley had "no problem" going to Wall\u000aStreet bankers to raise money when he was the head of the Democratic\u000aGovernor's Association.**9:44 p.m. **Sanders gets the same question -- and the\u000aanswer is no."Hillary and I have a difference. CEOs of large multinationals,\u000athey like Hillary, they aren't going to like me. And Wall Street, they're\u000agoing to like me even less.**9:42 p.m.**"Should corporate America love Hillary\u000aClinton?" Muir asks. "Everyone should!" Clinton responds.She went on to talk\u000aabout leveling the playing field but also describing herself as someone\u000ainterested in creating jobs."If people who are in the private sector know what\u000aI stand for...and they want to be part of once again building our economy so\u000ait works for everybody, more power to them."**9:40 p.m. **Candidates are\u000aoutlining the broad strokes of their economic policies as the debate shifts to\u000athe economy, taxes and healthcare.**9:26 p.m.** Clinton and Sanders continued\u000ato spar over whether the U.S. should focus on removing Assad and destroying\u000aISIS at the same time. The former secretary of state argued that the fighters\u000aon the ground who oppose Assad need to know there is a diplomatic channel in\u000aplace to change the leadership. Sanders stuck to his position."Yes, of course,\u000aAssad is a terrible dictator. But I think we have got to get our foreign\u000apolicies and our priorities right. It is not Assad who is attacking the United\u000aStates. It is ISIS," he said. The major priority, he affirmed, "should be the\u000adestruction of ISIS."O'Malley argued that the U.S. should not be determining\u000awhich dictators around the world must stay and go."We have a role to play in\u000athis world but it is not the role of traveling the world to look for new\u000amonsters to destroy," he said.**9:22 p.m.** Sanders calls for focusing on\u000adestroying ISIS in Syria first, and removing Syrian dictator Bashar Assad\u000asecond, repeating a frequent argument against regime change.In response.\u000aClinton hits Sanders over voting in favor of the U.S.-led campaign of\u000aairstrikes that helped depose former Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.If the\u000aU.S. had not done that, Clinton said, "you would be looking at Syria.**9:21\u000ap.m.** Clinton dismisses a question on whether she would be willing to shoot\u000adown a Russian plane in a no-fly zone over Syria."It wouldn't come to that,"\u000ashe said, arguing that the U.S. would be able to work with Russia on the no-\u000afly zone.**9:18 p.m.** Clinton says a question about whether she is willing to\u000arisk having to send more and more forces into the Middle East to defeat ISIS\u000ais a "false choice." She listed a number of things she said the U.S. must do\u000ain combination to defeat the group: Lead an air coalition, build back up the\u000aIraqi Army, talk to sheiks in the Anbar province, get the Turks to pay more\u000aattention to ISIS than the Kurds and build a coalition of Muslim nations on\u000athe ground.**9:13 p.m.** Raddatz pushes Sanders over how he will convince\u000aMuslim nations to put troops on the ground to fight ISIS, since he does not\u000awant U.S. combat troops in the region."My plan is to make it work, to tell\u000aSaudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they...are going to have\u000ato go to war against ISIS. To tell Qatar that instead of spending $200 billion\u000aon the World Cup, maybe instead they should pay attention to ISIS which is at\u000ahis doorstep," he said.**9:08 p.m.** The moderators point out that the\u000agovernor of the state hosting the debate, New Hampshire's Maggie Hassan, has\u000acalled for a halt in accepting refugees from Syria.I don't think a halt is\u000anecessary," Clinton said, calling for "increased vetting and screening.""The\u000aprocess should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS," she\u000asaid.O'Malley said there are far greater vulnerabilities than those posed by\u000arefugees, and that the U.S. should take in more than the 65,000 refugees he\u000ahas called for if necessary.**9:05 p.m.** Fielding a question about whether\u000athe government should force tech companies to give them a back door into\u000aencrypted communications, Clinton calls for a "Manhattan-like project" to\u000afigure out a way to bring the government and tech community together to find\u000amiddle ground.She said she would "not want to go to that point" of forcing\u000atech companies to preserve a back door for government, which they argue would\u000aalso make their products vulnerable to hackers. "I would hope that given the\u000aextraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs\u000aand questions...that there could be a Manhattan-like project...they've got to\u000abe partners," she added.O'Malley also weighed in: "I believe we should never\u000agive up our privacy," he said. He then talked about the importance of\u000apreserving the freedom of religion.**9:02 p.m.** As the conversation turns to\u000aTrump, Sanders has a message for his supporters:"What I say to those people\u000awho go to Donald Trump's rallies: He thinks a lot minimum wage in America is a\u000agood idea...I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this\u000acountry," he said.**9:00 p.m. **"He is becoming ISIS' best recruiter," Clinton\u000asays of Republican candidate Donald Trump, talking about his rhetoric on\u000aMuslims and call to ban them from coming to the U.S.**8:59 p.m. **Sanders grew\u000apassionate when talking about his history with gun control in a state like\u000aVermont."Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the\u000agun people," he told O'Malley.Clinton also said, "I applaud his record in\u000aMaryland, I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine."Read more about where the\u000a2016 candidates stand on gun control here.**8:53 p.m. **Sanders argued, "I'm\u000anot going to say that everybody is in agreement...but there is a broad\u000aagreement on sensible gun safety regulations." He cited expanding background\u000achecks and banning assault weapons as a place where there is broad agreement,\u000aand said he would push for those regulations even though he comes from a state\u000awith virtually no gun control.Meanwhile, O'Malley went after Clinton and\u000aSanders for a "flip-flopping culture of Washington" on gun control."Let's calm\u000adown a little Martin," Sanders said. "Let's tell the truth here Martin,"\u000aClinton chimed in.**8:51 p.m. **Clinton is asked about an ABC News poll that\u000ashows Americans believe arming more people, not stricter gun laws, is the best\u000adefense. "Guns in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans\u000asafer...arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response\u000ato terrorism. I think what is is creating much deeper, closer relations and\u000ayes coalitions within our own country. The first line of defense against\u000aradicalization is in the Muslim-American community, people who we should be\u000awelcoming and working with," she said. **8:45 p.m. **The moderators ask\u000aClinton how confident the American people should be that there aren't people\u000alike the ones who committed the San Bernardino shooting who have been\u000aradicalized under the radar of authorities. She pivots to her strategy to\u000adefeat ISIS. At the end of hear answer, Clinton called for better sharing of\u000aintelligence and information, and said the government must work with Muslim\u000aAmerican communities. "They will be our early warning signal...that's why we\u000aneed to work with them and not demonize them like the Republicans have been\u000adoing," Clinton said. O'Malley jumps in and says the problem in the fight\u000aagainst ISIS is a "lack of battle tempo." **8:40 p.m. **Sanders gets the first\u000aquestion over the voter data breaches, and says again that his staffer "did\u000athe wrong thing" and calling for an independent investigation of breaches of\u000avoter data. He is still critical of the Democratic National Committee (DNC)\u000afor shutting off his access to his data, calling it a "real problem." Asked by\u000athe moderators, Sanders apologized to both Clinton and his supporters. Clinton\u000aresponded, "I very much appreciate that comment," but added, "I don't think\u000athe American people are all that interested in this." **8:38 p.m. **Excerpts\u000afrom the opening statements: Clinton: "The American president has to both keep\u000aour families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not\u000ajust those at the top. That's the job. I have a strategy to combat and defeat\u000aISIS without getting us involved in another ground war and I have a plan to\u000araise in comes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at\u000anight....we have a distinct difference between those of us up on stage and our\u000aRepublican counterparts." O'Malley: "I visited with a number of our neighbors\u000ain northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday. And as I looked out there at the\u000aeyes of our neighbors, I looked into the eyes of veterans, I looked into the\u000aeyes of boy scouts...what our nation needs right now is to realize that while\u000awe face a terror danger we also face another sort of political danger and that\u000ais the danger that democracies are susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders\u000atry to turn us against each other." Sanders: "I am running for president of\u000athe United States because it is too late for establishment politics and\u000aestablishment economics. I'm running for president because our economy is\u000arigged, because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and\u000aalmost all of the new wealth and income being created is going to the top 1\u000apercent...I'm going to create an economy that works for working families, not\u000ajust billionaires. I'm running for president because we have a campaign\u000afinance system that is corrupt...I'm running because we need to address the\u000aplanetary crisis of climate change...I want a new foreign policy, one that\u000atakes on ISIS, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved\u000ain perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works\u000aaround a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim\u000atroops on the ground." **7:50 p.m.**Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,\u000aVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley are\u000apreparing to take the stage for the last debate of 2015, hosted by ABC News.\u000aThe network is also partnering with the New Hampshire Union Leader, one of the\u000astate's largest and most influential papers. It will be the first and only\u000aDemocratic debate held in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New\u000aHampshire during the 2016 campaign season. The moderators are ABC's "World\u000aNews Tonight" anchor David Muir, chief global affairs correspondent Martha\u000aRaddatz, and WMUR-TV anchor Josh McElveen will moderate the debate. ABC News\u000ahas said questions will focus on national security issues and foreign policy,\u000afollowing the deadly terror attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. The\u000aDemocratic race was interrupted just a day before the debate by a data breach\u000acontroversy in which a Sanders staffer accessing confidential Clinton voter\u000adata. The breach pitted the Sanders team against the Democratic National\u000aCommittee, with the Clinton campaign adding that it was an "egregious"\u000atransgression and "may have been a violation of the law." "This was not an\u000ainadvertent glimpse into our data," Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said\u000aFriday on a conference call with reporters. "It was not, as the Sanders\u000acampaign has described it, a mistake." The DNC granted access to the voter\u000adatabase back t0 the Sanders campaign early Saturday morning, restoring\u000ainformation that could prove crucial to the team in the weeks leading up to\u000athe first nominating contests in Iowa.\u000a\u000a

VThe path to good green intentions is strewn with obstacles that could waylay a\u000a$100 billion plan to help poorer countries fight climate change. These range\u000afrom the adequacy of the fund's size to its secrecy-minded operations. And\u000ait's all part of a worldwide effort mandated by the Paris climate deal, whose\u000aoverall cost could reach $16.5 trillion.Part of the climate accord struck over\u000athe weekend in Paris, the Green Climate Fund will subsidize the developing\u000anations in adopting such steps as carbon-free power generation and protections\u000aagainst global warming-linked catastrophes like hurricanes and rising\u000aseas.Climate cleanup work is an expensive proposition. The total tab, focused\u000aon developed economies curbing their voluminous carbon emissions, is around\u000a$16.5 trillion, the International Energy Agency estimates. A switch from\u000afossil fuels would entail a massive reordering of global energy production and\u000adelivery, moving toward renewable sources and greater energy efficiency, the\u000aagency said.Low-lying nations such as Zimbabwe and Madagascar are most at risk\u000afrom major storms and escalating oceans. But according to the Notre Dame\u000aGlobal Adaptation Index, they have the least financial ability to stave off\u000aenvironmental havoc. In fact, their carbon emissions are -- relative to major\u000aindustrial powers like the U.S. and China -- minuscule, so they haven't\u000acontributed much to the problem.In a statement issued two weeks ago, Héla\u000aCheikhrouhou, the fund's executive director, said the $100 billion kitty was\u000adedicated to supporting the climate conference's "objective on climate change\u000ato keep temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius." He noted that its board\u000aalready had approved a $168 million outlay for eight projects, including\u000asafeguarding Amazon River wetlands in South America and building hurricane\u000ashelters in Bangladesh. The fund did not respond to a request for comment\u000aabout criticisms. Potential problems include: **Insufficient money.** A study\u000aby the London School of Economics concluded that the fund's intended size of\u000a$100 billion per year was far too small to get the job done. The LSE report\u000arecommended at least $400 billion, and found that a sum up to $2 trillion was\u000amore likely to be effective. Even scraping together the $100 billion might be\u000atough. The Green Climate Fund has so far received pledges of around $10\u000abillion, but actually has just $1 billion of that in hand, says Climate\u000aCentral, an environmental study group.President Barack Obama has said the\u000aUnited States would chip in $3 billion, but the GOP-run Congress intends to\u000ascuttle that. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), a member of the Senate Environment\u000aand Public Works Committee, said: "Congress has never authorized funding the\u000aGreen Climate Fund, and we cannot support providing taxpayer dollars to the\u000afund."Meanwhile, potential aid recipients are disconcerted that the reference\u000ain the Paris climate pact was only in the document's preamble, thus not giving\u000ait adequate legal force to ensure it is enshrined in international\u000apolicy.**Waste. **Among Republican lawmakers,there's a strong suspicion that\u000athe fund's money will end up frittered away or in the bank accounts of corrupt\u000aofficials.Lending credence to the waste fears was the Bangladesh government's\u000a$3.1 million project to build "climate-resilient housing" along the nation's\u000acoast after a cyclone battered it. The watchdog agency Transparency\u000aInternational Bangladesh discovered that the homes had no walls. Why? The\u000agovernment wanted to stretch its budget and build more houses. Channeling\u000aGreen Climate Fund largesse to boondoggles like Bangladesh's risks more of the\u000asame.**Secrecy.** The fund has drawn criticism for operating behind closed\u000adoors. Green groups were furious to learn last summer that Deutsche Bank was\u000aone of the financial institutions the fund tapped to distribute the money. It\u000aturns out the German bank is a big investor in the coal industry. (The bank\u000aissued a statement saying that it fully supports the objective of a "low-\u000aemission economy.")To be sure, in the wake of the Paris conclave, there is a\u000alot of momentum behind the Green Climate Fund and international commitments to\u000ahold down greenhouse gas emissions. So some of the good intentions may end up\u000aactually coming to pass. Obama is hedging his bets on corralling the money\u000aneeded for the Green Climate Fund by enlisting private financial sources.\u000aMicrosoft billionaire Bill Gates recently declared he would invest $2 billion\u000ain technology to combat climate change. Gates wrote on his blog: "Given the\u000ascale of the challenge, we need to be exploring many different paths."\u000a\u000a

VThousands gathered in San Bernardino at a candlelight prayer vigil to honor\u000athe 14 men and women killed in the shooting at the Inland Regional Center.\u000aFamily and friends honored their loved ones by offering a glimpse into who\u000athey were and how they lived their lives. As investigators sort through\u000aevidence picked up at the San Bernardino shooting suspects' Redlands home,\u000afamily members say they're in disbelief. Suspected gunman Syed Rizwan Farook's\u000asister Saira and her husband Farhan Kahn say they share the heartache felt by\u000atheir community and their country.Negotiators from around the world are now in\u000athe middle of two weeks of talks in Paris, trying to reach an agreement to\u000alimit global warming. President Obama spoke to "CBS This Morning" co-host\u000aNorah O'Donnell at the White House about his effort to fight climate change\u000aand his hopes of leaving behind a legacy on the issue.As the air war against\u000aISIS expands and the group finds itself under increasing pressure on the\u000aground, a senior White House official says its adherents are turning more and\u000amore to a desperate tactic that takes advantage of America's desire to kill\u000aterrorists without causing civilian casualties. With shooting incidents\u000abecoming more and more frequent, pressure is mounting on lawmakers to take\u000aaction. We look at five ideas that Democrats and Republicans have offered up\u000ato try and address the problem, and how far some of those ideas have gone in\u000aterms of becoming the law of the land.Renewed fear of terrorism around the\u000aworld is raising pressure on technology companies to join government law\u000aenforcement agencies in fighting back. But there are some very real concerns\u000athat consumer privacy could suffer as a result. Businesses are set to receive\u000abillions of dollars in tax breaks under the bipartisan spending bill moving\u000aits way through Congress. Is that good public policy aimed at making U.S.\u000acompanies more competitive, or unnecessary corporate welfare compounding the\u000anational debt?**Maryland police officer shot in face, suspect at\u000alarge****Video shows fatal S.F. police shooting of suspect****Cop describes\u000aSan Bernardino shooting as "unspeakable"****Deadly firebomb attack on Cairo\u000anightclub****FIFA execs among those indicted by U.S.****Rare in U.S., female\u000asuicide bombers nothing new abroad****S.C. lawmaker sends Confederate flag\u000aChristmas card****GOP rolls out bill to tighten visa waiver program****Putin\u000alevels accusation at U.S. over Syria policy****5 affordable, gas-sipping used\u000aluxury cars****To cut or not to cut: Which road with OPEC take?****Rare\u000arainbow-colored bird spotted in unlikely place****New Facebook feature could\u000alet you share live video****How to explain mass shootings to\u000akids****Staggering toll from tainted food worldwide****Rock star Scott Weiland\u000afound dead on tour bus**\u000a\u000a

V**BRUSSELS** \u005c-- One of the most renowned Belgian beer brewers said Friday it is a victim of climate change because increasingly high temperatures have shortened the brewing season by about a month compared with the 1950s.The Cantillon gueuze brewery needs to cool its hot brew in open tanks so that the natural yeasts in the air can help produce the sour beer that has developed a niche following throughout the world. However, with temperatures staying as high as 15 C (59 F) at night during the past days, Cantillon has stopped brewing since it doesn't want to use artificial refrigeration."It is totally abnormal. We have those night temperatures in the summer and with such a temperature it is totally impossible to brew," Cantillon brewer Jean Van Roy said.Scientists say the global average temperature has risen by about 0.8 degrees C since the industrial revolution. The issue will be discussed at a major U.N. climate conference in Paris that opens Nov. 30.In the Cantillon brewery in the center of Brussels, the unusually warm weather means the copper vessels that should be steaming with golden brew are empty."The goal was to brew yesterday, so if we did it (the vessel) would be totally full," he said. "But as you can see: totally empty," Van Roy said.Cantillon is renowned for its traditional methods and refuses to use artificial refrigeration, which some other brewers have switched to. It makes Van Roy's brewing season totally dependent on the seasonal temperatures.In his grandfather's days, the season would run from mid-October to early May. "We are beginning right now, mainly in November, to end in the end of March or early April," Van Roy said."We are losing more than one month and if it continues we will lose maybe two months and that is certainly do to the global warming," he said.Even Brazilians are hunkering for a dip in temperatures. "I am hoping that we get cold, so that they can start the production very soon," said Brazilian visitor Francisco Romanini.The Belgian brewer's claims come after U.S. government scientists said that 14 extreme weather events in 2014 were made worse by climate change caused by pollution.Extreme heat events were one focus of the U.S. government's report on the impact of climate change around the world. The study found that in 2014, extreme heat waves, like one that gripped South Korea, were made worse by human-caused climate change which includes things such as car emissions, burning coal and methane gas.\u000a\u000a

VNegotiators from around the world are now in the middle of two weeks of talks\u000ain Paris, trying to reach an agreement to limit global warming.Last month,\u000aPresident Obama pledged a $3 billion U.S. contribution to an international\u000afund for developing countries - such as India -- to cope with the effects of\u000aclimate change.He spoke to "CBS This Morning" co-host Norah O'Donnell about\u000ahis effort to take historic action."Keep in mind, these are pledges over a\u000anumber of years. And this is in our interest. Let's take a country like India\u000athat's got over a billion people. If they are to develop, using let's say,\u000acoal as their main way of generating electricity, with a billion people...\u000ayou're looking at an amount of carbon that would mean South Florida's gone,\u000abecause the ocean's would have risen too high," Mr. Obama said. "You can't\u000abuild a border wall when it comes to carbon emissions or global temperatures\u000aor the oceans. We've got to make sure that people have incentives to work with\u000aus."The president has pushed the issue of climate change more aggressively as\u000ahe nears his last days in office. But he is receiving backlash from opponents\u000afor suggesting that climate change, not terrorism, is the world's greatest\u000athreat. "No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than\u000aclimate change," the president said in his State of Union address. GOP\u000acandidate Donald Trump called the president's remarks, "one of the dumbest\u000astatements I've ever heard in politics.""What I mean by that is that-- we're\u000agoing to get ISIL. They will be defeated. There will be ongoing efforts to\u000adisrupt the world order from terrorists, from rogue states... and we have to\u000abe vigilant in going after them," the president clarified. "But if you start\u000aseeing the oceans rise by five, six, seven feet, if you see major shifts in\u000aweather patterns so that what have been previously bread baskets to the world\u000asuddenly can no longer grow food, then you're seeing the kind of crisis that\u000awe can't deal with through the deployment of the Marines. We can't deal with\u000ait through pouring money at it."The president also responded to Trump's\u000acriticism of his climate change remarks. "Mr. Trump should run back a tape or\u000aquote on some of the stuff he's said -- 99.5 percent of scientists in the\u000aworld say this is a really urgent problem," Mr. Obama said. "Political parties\u000aaround the world. The only people who are still disputing it are either some\u000aRepublicans in Congress or folks on the campaign trail."Despite the backlash\u000afrom opponents, the president expressed hopes that he would be able to leave\u000abehind a legacy with his climate change priorities, especially thinking about\u000ahis family's future. "I don't think any president ends the presidency saying,\u000a'I got everything done.' You're always a little dissatisfied," Mr. Obama said.\u000a"But Malia is 17. Sasha's 14... and I do picture that if I'm lucky and I have\u000aenough years left that 20 years from now... I've got some grandkids, I want to\u000abe able to take my little grandson or granddaughter on a walk to the park and\u000aknow that the planet's in pretty good shape. And I want to feel like I\u000acontributed to that."_Watch President Obama's full interview on climate\u000achange_\u000a\u000a

VLast Updated Dec 12, 2015 5:25 PM EST**LE BOURGET, France --** With the tap of\u000aa gavel and thunderous applause, 195 nations and the European Union adopted a\u000anew climate change plan, one with the ambitious goals of slowing global\u000awarming by reducing greenhouse gases and aiding poor countries adjusting to\u000athe negative impact.As president of the Conference of Parties to the U.N.\u000aFramework Convention on Climate Change, or COP21, French Foreign Minister\u000aLaurent Fabius presented delegates with the final text, and a few hours later\u000athe "Paris Agreement" was approved by consensus of all the countries involved.\u000aThe product: an agreement on a plan to slow global warming.The adoption of the\u000aplan to slow global warming was announced Saturday. The takeaway was a shift\u000afrom dependence on fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy, with the hope of\u000aaverting dangerous climate effects."Nobody will get 100 percent of what they\u000awant," Fabius said. "What I hope is that everyone remembers the message of the\u000afirst day, when 150 heads of state and government came from all around the\u000aworld to say, 'The world needs a success.'"There was little doubt that high-\u000alevel arm-twisting made the deal happen, most notably a Thursday call by\u000aPresident Obama to China's President Xi Jinping, which followed earlier calls\u000ato Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Dilma\u000aRousseff.Janos Pasztor, the U.N. assistant secretary-general on climate\u000achange, told CBS News that the message of the plan is to "send a strong signal\u000ato the markets, the private sector that this is the direction we are going, to\u000aa low-carbon, low-emissions world, so investing in new technology is the way\u000ato go.""What it means is, for example," Pasztor said, "is get your act\u000atogether, oil and gas industry, and develop these carbon capture storage\u000asystems.""What we want is zero emissions at some point in the future; from a\u000aclimate point of view, it is perfectly OK to continue oil and gas for some\u000atime to come," Pasztor said.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that 186\u000acountries, representing close to 100 percent of global carbon emissions, had\u000asubmitted their national climate plans, called the Intended Nationally\u000aDetermined Contributions (INDCs)."This is quite encouraging," he said, adding\u000athat municipal and business leaders as well as civil society organizations\u000awere also at the conference to play a role.An agreement would be judged,\u000adelegates and U.N. officials say, on its ability to send a message to the\u000amarkets if investors shift from fossil fuels and put it into low or zero-\u000acarbon energy sources."I have absolute confidence in the ability of capital to\u000amove where the signal of the marketplace says 'go' after Paris," U.S.\u000aSecretary of State John Kerry said to the "Earth to Paris" summit earlier in\u000athe week.Not everyone is thrilled with the final compromise result; during the\u000anegotiations some scientists said that the final agreement is too weak and\u000athat sections that were deleted in the intense, often politically motivated\u000anegotiations, leading to an agreement that will not avert the dangerous\u000awarming of the world. Others believed it will restrict the U.S. and other\u000adeveloped countries too much.Crafting the mechanism to submit the reports on\u000areducing carbon emissions proved to be difficult. India wanted a voluntary\u000ameasure. Locking horns with the U.S. and European Union countries, the China\u000adelegation wanted "differentiation," what its deputy chief, Liu Zhenmin, said\u000ameant that rich countries, which does not include China or India, would make\u000adeeper emissions cuts and pay more into the fund.But in the end, delegates and\u000acivil society groups were visibly pleased that the summit ended in the\u000aapproval of an agreement."The agreement requires the world to wean itself off\u000aof fossil fuels by the middle of the century," said Alden Meyer, the director\u000aof strategy and policy of the Union of Concerned Scientists. "We have to get\u000ato net zero of greenhouse gases by 2060 or so. That can be through a\u000acombination of reducing emissions and increasing uptake of carbon dioxide by\u000aforests and agriculture by natural syncs. There is no way to meet this goal\u000awithout phasing out fossil fuels over that time.""We would have liked to see a\u000arequirement that all countries revise the level of ambition in their proposed\u000apost-2020 commitments based on the science by the end of the decade," Meyer\u000asaid.Included in the deal is a temperature goal to keep warming to a limit,\u000abut that, along with who would pay for damages brought on by global warming\u000aand what countries would contribute to fundraising to be raised annually, were\u000athe contentious issues, resulting in the negotiations dragging into an extra\u000aday.The final agreement reads, "the Parties to the Paris Agreement shall set a\u000anew collective quantified goal from a floor of USD 100 billion per year,\u000ataking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries."After a\u000abriefing by Fabius on Thursday evening, Ségolène Royal, the French minister of\u000aEcology, Sustainable Development and Energy, met with reporters and told CBS\u000aNews, "The financial sector should bear the responsibility of gathering the\u000anecessary funds, help countries transition to a low-carbon economy."The plan\u000arequires countries to keeping the rise in the global average temperature "well\u000abelow" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and "endeavor to limit" them\u000aeven more, to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the year 2100, compared with pre-\u000aindustrial levels.Emma Ruby-Sachs, acting executive director of Avaaz, a\u000aglobal civil action group concerned with the climate, said: "This deal will\u000arepresent a turning point in history, paving the way for the shift to 100\u000apercent clean energy that the world wants and the planet needs. By marching in\u000athe streets, calling leaders and signing petitions, people everywhere created\u000athis moment, and now people everywhere will deliver on it to secure the future\u000aof humanity.""It will be a big step forward for all of humanity," Fabius said\u000aFriday."The agreement is a mechanism for how countries will behave - the new\u000arules of the game," Pasztor told CBS News. "Whatever they commit to is not\u000alegally binding but they have to report ... it is not name and shame, it is\u000aname and encourage."Ban, reacting to the final agreement, said, "Nature is\u000asending urgent signals. The solutions to climate change are on the table. They\u000aare ours for the taking."\u000a\u000a

V******HOUSTON --**An Iraqi refugee arrested on terror charges is innocent, his wife insisted in an interview with CBS affiliate KHOU.Federal prosecutors accuse Omar Al Hardan of providing support to the terror group ISIS. He appeared in a federal courtroom in Houston Friday morning.Another Iraqi immigrant who authorities say Al Hardan communicated with on social media, Aws Al-Jayab, was arrested Thursday in Sacramento. Court papers say Al-Jayab traveled to Syria in 2013, "took up arms with terrorist organizations and concealed that conduct from immigration authorities" when he returned to the U.S. the following year.Al Hardan and his wife, Haenne Al Kokiss, live in a small Southwest Houston apartment with their 10-month-old son and his parents."I'm so bad. I'm sick. I can't sleep, I can't eat because my husband is in jail," 18-year-old Al Kokiss told KHOU. "I need my husband here with me. I can't."She was adamant that her husband, who works as a limousine driver, has no ties to terrorism. "He loves America. I love America too. He was so happy because he came to America," Al Kokiss said. "He loves America too much. I love American too much."Al Kokiss said the FBI seized their computers and phones Thursday when they arrested her 24-year-old husband. She doesn't believe they will find any evidence.Al Hardan's brother, who had a falling out with him six months ago, said he was shocked to learn about the arrest."My family, everyone in my family doesn't like ISIS. I don't like ISIS. Why? Big problem ISIS," said Saeed Al Hardan.The entire family came to the United States as Iraqi refugees. Federal investigators say Al Hardan was radicalized after he arrived in 2009.\u000a\u000a

VTwo Iraqi refugees are due in court to face federal charges of supporting\u000aterrorism. One of the men was arrested in Sacramento and the other in Houston.\u000aInvestigators say one suspect fought in Syria's civil war before returning to\u000athe U.S., and the arrests are stoking the debate over refugees in America.West\u000aVirginia is suing pharmacies and drug distributors accused of making millions\u000apushing narcotics to anyone who wants them. No state has had more trouble with\u000aprescription pain pills, and no town more trouble than Kermit. CBS News\u000ainvestigates the small town's big drug problem.New dietary guidelines from the\u000aUSDA and Department of Health and Human Services are supposed to tell you what\u000ayou should and shouldn't eat to stay healthy, but they're already being\u000ahammered by critics who say the new recommendations will only confuse people\u000afurther. North Korea grabbed the world's attention this week by claiming a\u000asuccessfully hydrogen bomb test. The U.S. is "highly skeptical" it was an\u000aactual thermonuclear device, but experts say it could still represent a leap\u000aforward for the North's nuclear program -- and it demands a carefully\u000acalibrated response.She's a familiar face to North Koreans; the veteran news\u000aanchor who re-appeared this week, decked out in a pink, traditional Korean\u000agown, to announce the North's claim of a hydrogen bomb test. But who is the\u000awoman known in the Hermit Kingdom as "the people's broadcaster?" A deepening\u000amystery in Hong Kong sounds like the plot of a thriller, but it's all too\u000areal. Five people have vanished since October -- all of them connected to a\u000apublishing company that specializes in books critical of communist China's\u000aleadership. **Rare dime sells for a staggering amount****Man ambushes, tries\u000ato "execute" Philadelphia cop****Dummy Hellfire missile mistakenly shipped to\u000aCuba****High alert as S. Korea resumes cross-border anti-Kim\u000abroadcasts****"Dying in slow motion": Videos show desperation of starving\u000aSyria town****Kerry says Iran could be days away from nuke deal\u000acompliance****How well do you know Chris Christie?

VTwo refugees from Iraq with alleged ties to the Islamic State of Iraq and\u000aSyria (ISIS) are due in court Friday to face federal charges of supporting\u000aterrorism.According to an affidavit, both men are accused of lying to cover up\u000atheir efforts to support terrorism. The arrests are now renewing a debate over\u000abringing refugees from Syria and other countries to the U.S., reports CBS News\u000acorrespondent Jeff Pegues. Court documents allege that Omar Faraj Saeed Al\u000aHardan and Aws Mohammed Younis Al-Jayab - both Palestinian-born Iraqi refugees\u000a-- were intent on fighting alongside terrorist organizations in Syria.Al\u000aHardan had been in the U.S. since around November of 2009, while Al-Jayab\u000aarrived in October of 2012. According to court documents, 23-year-old Al-Jayab\u000aused social media to communicate with people inside Syria in 2012, expressing\u000aa desire to return to Syria to "work."He was also allegedly communicating with\u000a24-year-old Al Hardan, who prosecutors say is associated with members and\u000asympathizers of ISIS.While living in Arizona and Wisconsin, Al-Jayab spent\u000atime at a gun range, pleaded for travel funds and asked online friends for\u000aguidance on how to reach Syria, according to court documents. By March of\u000a2013, Al-Jayab had a strategy, saying "I am coming to Syria... I have planned\u000aa route and everything," then in April saying, "I am eager to see blood."\u000aAfter receiving a $4,500 insurance settlement in November of 2013, Al-Jayab\u000aflew from Chicago to Turkey and then made his way to Aleppo, Syria. But he was\u000awise to American surveillance tactics, telling one associate online, "the\u000agovernment is alert for everything... my trip constitutes a charge." He\u000areturned to the U.S. in January of 2014. Investigators say Al-Jayab lied in\u000acustoms forms and multiple interviews months later, telling immigration\u000aofficials he went to Turkey to visit his grandmother. The charges provided\u000apolitical blow back aimed at the White House. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a\u000astatement: "This is precisely why I called for a halt to refugees entering the\u000aU.S. from countries substantially controlled by terrorists." The U.S. attorney\u000ain California's eastern district said there's no indication Al-Jayab "planned\u000aany acts of terrorism" in the United States.\u000a\u000a

VThree months after coming to America, the Obaidat family is still settling\u000ainto their new life in a modest one-bedroom apartment on Chicago's North Side:\u000a"When I drop the kids at school, people are very welcoming, the school is\u000aexcellent," said Asma Obaidat, through a translator, adding how she didn't\u000aexpect Chicago residents would be so "warm."Muhammad and Asma Obaidat and\u000atheir two children, 9-year-old Redaj and 6-year-old Akram, fled violence in\u000aDamascus after the Syrian war broke out four-and-a-half-years ago. They waited\u000afor two years in Jordan for permission to enter the U.S."Nobody wants to\u000aabandon their country," said Muhammad Obaidat. "But the situation is difficult\u000a-- very difficult."The plight of refugee families like the Obaidats may be\u000aeven more difficult in the wake of the Paris terror attacks, for which the\u000aIslamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) took credit. While only one of the\u000aeight attackers is said by authorities to have come from Syria, more than a\u000adozen U.S. governors have expressed opposition to taking in Syrian refugees,\u000abased on the fear that terrorists could infiltrate those groups.Refugee\u000aadvocates dispute states' power to ban refugees from specific countries,\u000aciting the Refugee Act of 1980."Refugees are just like you and me," said\u000aSuzanne Akhras, a Syrian-American community advocate in Chicago. She runs a\u000asmall nonprofit, Syrian Community Network, that raises money for necessities\u000alike food and clothing, and visits refugee families."A refugee is someone who\u000ahas lost everything who needs to rebuild their life who needs to find shelter\u000afor their family," said Akhras.Speaking at the G-20 Summit in Turkey on\u000aMonday, President Obama affirmed that the U.S. will continue to take more\u000aSyrian refugees, using "rigorous security checks."America's annual quota for\u000arefugee resettlement is 70,000 and it's expected to rise, in part because of\u000athe war in Syria, to 75,000 next year. The refugee crisis has reached a\u000acritical point, spilling into Europe and beyond, and advocates are pushing the\u000aU.S. to accept more refugees. America has taken in 2,070 refugees from Syria\u000aacross 180 towns and cities since the conflict began in 2011. Of those,\u000aroughly 1,300 were resettled in the past 12 months.Despite concerns from some\u000aU.S. politicians, the Obaidats and hundreds of their fellow Syrians are\u000anonetheless here, trying to create a community that will help them cope with\u000athe challenge of being strangers in a new land.The resettlement process\u000aoverseas can take as long as 18-24 months from the time a UNHCR referral is\u000areceived to the time a refugee arrives in America to be resettled.Upon\u000aarrival, the Department of State's Reception and Placement Program provides\u000afunding to resettlement agencies to support refugees during their first 30-90\u000adays in the United States. The current Reception and Placement per capita\u000agrant is $2,025, intended to partially cover initial case management costs and\u000asupport to refugees. Of that sum, each refugees receives about $1,000 for\u000anecessities such as rent, clothing and food."It's very difficult to think\u000aabout our homeland ... but at the same time, at the end of every week here,\u000awhen the children are no longer at school, we can get together with our\u000afriends who are other refugees, and go to the lake for a picnic," said\u000aMuhammad, glancing at his wife. "We enjoy that."The children attend regular\u000aschool in English and are picking up the language slightly faster than their\u000aparents.![screen-shot-2015-10-15-at-1-22-30-pm.png](http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic\u000a.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/15/5f114fc3-7532-4eab-8d0f-\u000aa7ac00decaf4/thumbnail/270x150/6b99a98f140a68c8cd2990ca2f64ba35/screen-\u000ashot-2015-10-15-at-1-22-30-pm.png)\u000a\u000aRedaj and Akram say their favorite food is hamburgers.\u000a\u000aInes Novacic / CBS News\u000a\u000a"God-willing, in 10 years we will have learned the language, and our situation\u000awill be better than this," Asma said."And we hope our health gets better,"\u000asaid Muhammad, who was diagnosed with cancer just before the war broke out in\u000aSyria. He was unable to get regular treatment and a part of his left hand was\u000aamputated. He's currently receiving treatment through a Medicaid program,\u000asince refugees are eligible for the same public assistance programs as U.S.\u000acitizens and other legal residents. Refugees are also placed on a pathway to\u000aU.S. citizenship.They receive additional support from private groups like the\u000aSyrian Community Network:![screen-shot-2015-10-15-at-1-24-19-pm.png](http://cb\u000asnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/15/c103aac9-12a2-4e00-8c16-f052a855303c/\u000athumbnail/270x150/a626e221175ad08412c14adfb37acdab/screen-\u000ashot-2015-10-15-at-1-24-19-pm.png)\u000a\u000aAkhras pays a weekly visit to the Obaidat family.\u000a\u000aInes Novacic / CBS News\u000a\u000a"We should try to read about the history of what's going on [in Syria], and\u000ahave a bigger perspective and not just see Syria through the lens of ISIS, but\u000asee Syria as a humanitarian crisis," said Akhras."We set up in early 2015,\u000aafter we heard [the U.S.] would be receiving more refugees from Syria," she\u000aadded. "We thought Chicago would be a hub, especially because of the\u000aestablished Syrian-American community here."![screen-shot-2015-10-15-at-1-23-3\u000a8-pm.png](http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/15/9c4490da-\u000aaefd-4644-8558-ce412913029e/thumbnail/270x150/7c89e979969d3190ac8884a09b80aa6e\u000a/screen-shot-2015-10-15-at-1-23-38-pm.png)\u000a\u000aThe Obaidat family attend English classes at Refugee One in Chicago's\u000aNorthside neighborhood.\u000a\u000aInes Novacic / CBS News\u000a\u000aAkhras came to America as an immigrant from Syria when she was 10 years old.\u000aHer husband is the advocacy director at the Syrian American Medical Society\u000a(SAMS), where she previously worked before setting up her own organization\u000athat caters specifically to refugees. "I understand the challenges that they\u000ahave, I remember that sense of loss as a child - when you don't know what\u000abaseball is, what kickball is," said Akhras. "This is a quiet neighborhood,\u000atheir school is nearby, there are many shops nearby that sell Arabic food and\u000aArabic groceries. "It's a comfort to them, when they have to do their daily\u000aerrands, to know that people can speak their language."Akhras and her small\u000ateam of seven volunteers visit refugees in their homes at least once a week,\u000aand offer advice and guidance on things like job applications and children's\u000aschooling. In Chicago, most of the refugees are initially processed through a\u000alocal resettlement agency called Refugee One.![screen-shot-2015-10-15-at-1-26-\u000a49-pm.png](http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/10/15/645d16d3-757c-\u000a419c-8814-c257195f6c13/thumbnail/270x150/a98f4b01000b2489e596c6ce1b81886a\u000a/screen-shot-2015-10-15-at-1-26-49-pm.png)\u000a\u000aMuhammad and Asma Obaidat say that people in Chicago have been very welcoming.\u000a\u000aInes Novacic / CBS News\u000a\u000a"When refugees are processed in different overseas countries and ready to\u000atravel, we receive notification," Melineh Kano, executive director of Refugee\u000aOne, who came to America in 1984 as a refugee from Armenia, told CBS News.\u000a"We're at the airport to welcome them, and we usually have homes set up for\u000athem ... and from the following day basically services will begin for\u000athem."These services include financial support - stipends for food and\u000anecessities such as clothing, as well as job training and English language\u000alessons. Some refugees are also eligible for Refugee Cash and/or Medical\u000aAssistance administered through the Office of Refugee Resettlement at the\u000aDepartment of Health and Human Services, which carry a maximum benefit of\u000aeight months after arrival in the U.S.According to the State Department, early\u000aeconomic self-sufficiency is a cornerstone of the refugee admissions program,\u000aand many refugee families have at least one income earner within a few months\u000aof their arrival in the United States. There is, however, no comprehensive\u000adata about how many refugees are employed and how long it took them to find\u000aemployment. Muhammad Obaidat, still struggling with his health, hasn't found\u000awork yet, but insists he isn't in search of a free ride."I want people to know\u000awhen a Syrian comes to America they're not trying to be a burden on anyone.\u000aWhen a Syrian comes to America, of course they're not going to sit high above\u000aother people. He's going to work, he's going to contribute to the country," he\u000asaid.His wife plans to start looking for work soon.On a recent Wednesday\u000aafternoon, after their English language lesson at Refugee One, the Obaidats\u000awere paid a home visit by Akhras:"We are very lucky to be able to do this,"\u000asaid Akhras, as Asma served the Arabic coffee she had just made - as is custom\u000a- on a tray with a single glass of water among the white coffee cups. The\u000achildren played on a smartphone and flicked through cartoons on an old T.V.\u000aset. "Yes, there's hardships because [they] have to learn new language and a\u000anew culture - but that is our job now," said Akhras. "We can bridge those gaps\u000aand make sure their resettlement goes smoother.""Why wouldn't we want people\u000alike that, who are willing to roll up their sleeves, and get to work to start\u000aover."The death toll from Syria's war is estimated to be more than 250,000\u000apeople. Four million Syrians are refugees, and another 7 million are displaced\u000awithin their own country due to violence. The U.S. has so far provided more\u000athan $4 billion in humanitarian aid.\u000a\u000a

V******WASHINGTON --** The U.S. military has launched a newly aggressive campaign of cyberattacks against militants with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, targeting the group's abilities to use social media and the Internet to recruit fighters and inspire followers, U.S. officials told The Associated Press.The surge of computer-based military operations by U.S. Cyber Command began shortly after Defense Secretary Ash Carter prodded commanders at Fort Meade, Maryland, last month to ramp up the fight against ISIS on the cyber front.U.S. officials confirmed that operations launched out of Fort Meade have focused on disrupting the group's online activities. The officials said the effort is getting underway as operators try a range of attacks to see what works and what doesn't. They declined to discuss details, other than to say that the attacks include efforts to prevent the group from distributing propaganda, videos, or other types of recruiting and messaging on social media sites such as Twitter, and across the Internet in general.Other attacks could include attempts to stop insurgents from conducting financial or logistical transactions online.Several U.S. officials spoke about the cyber campaign on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. Much of the effort is classified.Carter mentioned the operations briefly Thursday, telling a House Appropriations subcommittee only that Cyber Command is beginning to conduct operations against ISIS. He declined to say more in a public setting.The more aggressive attacks come after months of pressure from Carter, who has been frustrated with the belief that the Pentagon - and particularly Cyber Command - was losing the war in the cyber domain.Late last year Carter met with commanders, telling them they had 30 days to bring him options for how the military could use its cyberwarfare capabilities against the group's deadly insurgency across Iraq and Syria, and spreading to Libya and Afghanistan. Officials said he told commanders that beefing up cyberwarfare against ISIS was a test for them, and that they should have both the capability and the will to wage the online war.But the military cyber fight is limited by concerns within the intelligence agencies that blocking the group's Internet access could hurt intelligence gathering.Officials said Carter told commanders that he wanted creative options that would allow the U.S. to impact ISIS without diminishing the indications or warnings intelligence officers can glean about what the group is doing.On Jan. 27, Carter and Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, went to Fort Meade for an update.Officials familiar with Carter's meetings said the secretary was frustrated that as Cyber Command has grown and developed over the past several years, it was still focused on the cyberthreats from nations, such as Iran, Russia and China, rather than building a force to block the communications and propaganda campaigns of Internet-savvy insurgents."He was right to say they could be more forward leaning about what they could possibly do against ISIS," said James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "You could disrupt their support networks, their business networks, their propaganda and recruitment networks."However, Lewis added, the U.S. needs to be careful about disrupting the Internet to insure that attacks don't also affect civilian networks or systems needed for critical infrastructure and other public necessities.U.S. officials have long been stymied by militants' ability to use the Internet as a vehicle for inspiring so-called lone wolf attackers in Western nations, radicalized after reading propaganda easily available online."Why should they be able to communicate? Why should they be using the Internet?" Carter said during testimony before the defense appropriations subcommittee. "The Internet shouldn't be used for that purpose."He added that the U.S. can conduct cyber operations under the legal authorities associated with the ongoing war against ISIS.The U.S. has also struggled to defeat high-tech encryption techniques used by ISIS and other groups to communicate. Experts have been working to find ways to defeat those programs.Cyber Command is relatively new. Created in 2009, it did not begin operating until October 2010.Early on, its key focus was on defending military networks, which are probed and attacked millions of times a day. But defense leaders also argued at length over the emerging issues surrounding cyberwarfare and how it should be incorporated.The Pentagon is building 133 cyber teams by 2018, including 27 that are designed for combat and will work with regional commands to support warfighting operations. There will be 68 teams assigned to defend Defense Department networks and systems, 13 that would respond to major cyberattacks against the U.S., and 25 support teams.\u000a\u000a

V******HILLAH, Iraq** \u005c- A suicide bomber rammed his explosives-laden fuel truck into a security checkpoint south of Baghdad on Sunday, killing at least 47 people and wounding dozens, officials said.The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing in an online statement circulated by supporters.It was the third massive bombing in and around Baghdad in a little over a week, and appeared to be part of a campaign by ISIS to stage attacks deep behind front lines in order to wreak havoc and force the government to overextend its forces.Crowds gathered at the scene, picking through rubble and twisted car parts in search of survivors. Smoke rose from smoldering cars that had been lined up at the main checkpoint at the northern entrance to the city of Hillah, located about 60 miles south of Baghdad."The blast has completely destroyed the checkpoint and its buildings," Falah al-Khafaji, a senior security official in Hillah, said as he stood at the edge of the blast site. "More than 100 cars have been damaged."ISIS has carried out scores of suicide bombings against security forces and the country's Shiite majority. Hillah is in the country's mainly Shiite south, far from the front lines of the war against ISIS.Among the dead were 39 civilians, while the rest were members of the security forces. The attacker struck shortly after noon when the checkpoint was crowded with dozens of cars, a police officer said. He added that up to 65 other people were wounded.A medical official confirmed the causality figures. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release information.Iraq has seen a spike in violence in the past month, with suicide attacks claimed by ISIS killing more than 170 people. The attacks follow a string of advances by Iraqi forces backed by U.S.-led airstrikes, including in the western city of Ramadi, which was declared fully "liberated" by Iraqi and U.S.-led coalition officials last month.Such attacks "force the government and the militias to look back and reallocate resources and reassess," said Bill Roggio, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, referring to the mainly Shiite militias fighting alongside government forces.IS still controls large swaths of Iraq and neighboring Syria and has declared an Islamic "caliphate" on the territory it holds. The extremist group controls Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, as well as the city of Fallujah, 40 miles west of Baghdad.At least 670 Iraqis were killed last month due to ongoing violence, of whom about two-thirds were civilians, according to U.N. figures.\u000a\u000a

V******BEIRUT --** A U.S. and Russian-brokered cease-fire brought relative calm to parts of Syria for the first time in years on Saturday despite numerous cease-fire breaches, but the war against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, continued as the extremists launched a surprise attack on a northern border town.ISIS, which is not a party to the cease-fire, launched several attacks after the truce went into effect, including a brazen offensive on the northern town of Tal Abyad on the border with Turkey and at least one suicide bombing in central Syria.The cease-fire went into effect across Syria at midnight, marking the most ambitious international attempt yet to reduce violence in the devastating conflict, which has killed more than 250,000 people, wounded a million and created Europe's worst refugee crisis since World War II.In addition to ISIS, the truce also excludes al Qaeda's branch in Syria, known as al Nusra, which is also considered a terrorist organization by the United Nations.CBS News correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports that in the capital of Damascus overnight and again Saturday morning sporadic sounds of fighting could be heard from the suburbs, which are controlled by opposition fighters. The army would argue that those fighters are with al Nusra and therefore fair game under the terms of the agreement.![Fighters from the Democratic Forces of Syria inspect weapons and ammunition that, according to them, belonged to Islamic State of Iraq and Syria fighters in al-Shadadi, Syria, Feb. 26, 2016.](http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/02/27/9b21bcfa-4b51-4efc-9abf-4c55bf09d2a1/thumbnail/620x350/39006cd88278824ad96ec474319cdeb6/isis-syria-2016-02-26t215054z.jpg)\u000a\u000aFighters from the Democratic Forces of Syria inspect weapons and ammunition\u000athat, according to them, belonged to Islamic State of Iraq and Syria fighters\u000ain al-Shadadi, Syria, Feb. 26, 2016.\u000a\u000aReuters/Rodi Said\u000a\u000aSyria's state-run news agency said armed groups fired several shells on\u000aresidential areas in the capital in the first breach of a cease-fire at midday\u000aSaturday. SANA says the shells were fired by "terrorist groups" entrenched in\u000aJobar and Douma, two opposition-held Damascus suburbs.Rebel groups said they\u000ahave registered numerous violations by government forces across the country\u000athat could threaten the agreement.Lt. Col. Fares al-Bayoush, commander of the\u000a1,300-strong Fursan al-Haq Brigade, a U.S.-backed rebel faction, told The\u000aAssociated Press that his group and others affiliated with the mainstream Free\u000aSyrian Army are so far abiding by the truce."If they continue with these\u000aviolations we will be forced to retaliate accordingly," he said by phone from\u000asouthern Turkey. He added, however, that the cease-fire has sharply reduced\u000agovernment attacks across northern Syria, where his group is based.A top\u000amilitary official in Moscow said Russia has grounded its warplanes in Syria to\u000ahelp secure the cease-fire.Lt.-Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, of the General Staff, said\u000athat while Russia will continue air strikes against ISIS and al Nusra, Moscow\u000ais keeping its aircraft on the ground for now "to avoid any possible\u000amistakes."Rudskoi said that 17 opposition units have contacted the Russian\u000amilitary to adhere to the truce.He said the Russian military had established\u000ahotlines to exchange information with the U.S. military in order to help\u000amonitor the cease-fire and quickly respond to any conflict situations.The U.S.\u000ahas provided the Russian Defense Ministry with similar maps and its own list\u000aof opposition units, which have agreed to respect the cease-fire.Rudskoi said\u000athat according to the U.S.-Russian agreements, a rebel unit that accidentally\u000acomes under attack should contact Russian or U.S. representatives, who would\u000aquickly resolve the matter.A coordination center at the Hemeimeem air base in\u000aSyria's coastal province of Latakia, where Russian warplanes are based, has 61\u000aofficers who negotiate with groups willing to join the cease-fire and\u000acoordinate the deliveries of humanitarian aid.According to Syrian state media,\u000aISIS launched two suicide attacks near the central town of Salamiyeh, one on\u000aan army checkpoint that killed two and wounded four. The second car bomb was\u000adestroyed by Syrian troops before reaching a military post, state TV said.The\u000aISIS-affiliated Aamaq news agency said ISIS claimed responsibility for the\u000ablasts in the area, where most residents belong to the Ismaili branch of\u000aShiite Islam. The Sunni extremist group views Shiites as heretics.In the\u000anorthern province of Raqqa, ISIS fighters attacked the border town of Tal\u000aAbyad and the nearby village of Suluk, which were captured months ago by\u000aKurdish fighters, according to a Syrian rebel official.Talal Sillo, a\u000aspokesman for the predominantly Kurdish Syria Democratic Forces, said the\u000afighting began after midnight Friday and was still ongoing. Tal Abyad has been\u000aheld by Kurdish fighters since July.Sillo and the main Kurdish militia in\u000aSyria, the YPG, said some of the ISIS fighters came from Turkey. The YPG\u000astatement said its fighters had killed the attackers after hours of\u000afighting.The Aamaq news agency reported that ISIS fighters launched a\u000a"surprise attack" on several areas in northern Raqqa province, where Tal Abyad\u000ais located. But the report did not provide further details.The Observatory\u000asaid intense fighting is ongoing near the northern town of Khanaser between\u000apro-government forces and ISIS. Battles have continued for five days in the\u000astrategic area near the highway that links Aleppo with central and western\u000aSyria.State TV said Syrian warplanes attacked oil tanker trucks belonging to\u000aISIS in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour.The Syrian government and 97\u000arebel and militant groups said they will abide by the cease-fire.In southern\u000aSyria, the situation was "calm" Saturday, according to opposition activist\u000aAhmad al-Masalmeh, who is based in the southern city of Daraa. Calm also\u000aprevailed in large parts of the central province of Homs, according to\u000aMohammed al-Sibai, who is based in the province."The situation yesterday was\u000avery bad and fighting was intense," al-Masalmeh said. "Then it was like a\u000afootball match. People were excited and once the referee blew his whistle all\u000athe noise stopped."\u000a\u000a

VLast Updated Mar 9, 2016 11:01 AM ESTU.S. commandos have captured a chemical\u000aweapons expert for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), CBS News\u000anational security correspondent David Martin reports.The capture has led to at\u000aleast one strike in Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, which was designed to\u000adestroy a building where mustard gas munitions were believed to be\u000amanufactured. There are 12 reported instances of ISIS using mustard gas on the\u000abattlefield.It's the first known major success of Washington's more aggressive\u000apolicy of pursuing the jihadis on the ground.The Obama administration launched\u000athe new strategy in December, deploying a commando force to Iraq that it said\u000awould be dedicated to capturing and killing ISIS leaders in clandestine\u000aoperations, as well as generating intelligence leading to more raids.U.S.\u000aofficials said last week that the expeditionary team had captured an ISIS\u000aleader but had refused to identify him, saying only that he had been held for\u000atwo or three weeks and was being questioned.The two Iraqi officials identified\u000athe man to The Associated Press as Sleiman Daoud al-Afari, who worked for\u000aSaddam Hussein's now-dissolved Military Industrialization Authority where he\u000aspecialized in chemical and biological weapons. They said al-Afari, who is\u000aabout 50 years old, heads ISIS' recently established branch for the research\u000aand development of chemical weapons.He was captured in a raid near the\u000anorthern Iraqi town of Tal Afar, the officials said. They would not give\u000afurther details.The officials, who both have first-hand knowledge of the\u000aindividual and of the ISIS chemical program, spoke to the AP on condition of\u000aanonymity as they are not authorized to brief the media.The U.S.-led coalition\u000abegan targeting ISIS' chemical weapons infrastructure with airstrikes and\u000aspecial operations raids over the past two months, the Iraqi intelligence\u000aofficials and a Western security official in Baghdad told the AP.Airstrikes\u000aare targeting laboratories and equipment, and further special forces raids\u000atargeting chemical weapons experts are planned, the intelligence officials\u000asaid. They and the Western official spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity\u000abecause they were not authorized to brief the press.ISIS has been making a\u000adetermined effort to develop chemical weapons, Iraqi and American officials\u000ahave said. It is believed to have set up a special unit for chemical weapons\u000aresearch, made up of Iraqi scientists from the Saddam-era weapons program as\u000awell as foreign experts. Iraqi officials expressed particular worry over the\u000aeffort because ISIS gained so much room to operate and hide chemical\u000alaboratories after overrunning around a third of the country in the summer of\u000a2014, joined with territory they controlled in neighboring Syria.Still, its\u000aprogress has been limited. It is believed to have created limited amounts of\u000amustard gas. Tests confirmed mustard gas was used in a town in Syria when ISIS\u000awas launching attacks there in August 2015. Other unverified reports in both\u000aIraq and Syria accuse ISIS of using chemical agents on the battlefield.But so\u000afar, experts say, the extremist group appears incapable of launching a large-\u000ascale chemical weapons attack, which requires not only expertise, but also the\u000aproper equipment, materials and a supply-chain to produce enough of the\u000achemical agent to pose a significant threat."More than a symbolic attack seems\u000ato me to be beyond the grasp of ISIS," said Dan Kaszeta, a former U.S. Army\u000achemical officer and Department of Homeland Security expert who is now a\u000aprivate consultant. "Furthermore, the chemicals we are talking about are\u000aprincipally chlorine and sulfur mustard, both of which are actually quite poor\u000aweapons by modern standards."The United States has been leading a coalition\u000awaging airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria for more than a year. The\u000acampaign has been key to backing Iraqi and Kurdish forces that have slowly\u000aretaken significant parts of the territory the militants had seized.But after\u000acoming under pressure at home for greater action against the militants, the\u000aObama administration moved to the tactic of stepped up commando operations on\u000athe ground.Last year, U.S. special forces killed a key ISIS leader and\u000acaptured his wife in a raid in Syria, but the new force in Iraq was intended\u000aas a more dedicated deployment. American officials have been deeply secretive\u000aabout the operation. Its size is unknown, though it may be fewer than 100\u000atroops."This is a no-kidding force that will be doing important things," was\u000aabout all Defense Secretary Ash Carter would say about the force in testimony\u000ato the Senate Armed Services Committee in December.\u000a\u000a

V**BAGHDAD --** The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) has launched two chemical attacks near the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, killing a 3-year-old girl, wounding some 600 people and causing hundreds more to flee, Iraqi officials said Saturday."What the Daesh terrorist gangs did in the city of Taza will not go unpunished," Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said, using an alternative name for ISIS during a meeting with village elders in the small town of Taza on Saturday. "The perpetrators will pay dearly."![fatima.jpg](http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/2016/03/12/c6acd53c-078c-4fcc-99a7-5e1795665bfd/274a65f1cafc22898f7136b1bd8ae53d/fatima.jpg)\u000a\u000aThis undated family picture shows Fatma Samir, 3, who was killed in a chemical\u000aattack in Taza, 10 miles south of Kirkuk, northern Iraq.\u000a\u000aFatma Samir Family Photo via AP\u000a\u000aSecurity and hospital officials say the latest attack took place early\u000aSaturday in Taza, which was also struck by a barrage of rockets carrying\u000achemicals three days earlier.Sameer Wais, whose daughter Fatima was killed in\u000athe attack, is a member of a Shiite militia fighting ISIS in Kirkuk province.\u000aHe said he was on duty at the frontline when the attack occurred early in the\u000amorning, quickly ran home and said he could still smell the chemicals in the\u000arocket."We took her to the clinic and they said that she needed to go to a\u000ahospital in Kirkuk. And that's what we did, we brought her here to the\u000ahospital in Kirkuk," he said.Wais said his daughter appeared to be doing\u000abetter the next day so they took her home. "But by midnight she started to get\u000aworse. Her face puffed up and her eyes bulged. Then she turned black and\u000apieces of her skin started to come off," he said.By the next morning, Fatima\u000ahad died, Wais said.The hundreds of wounded are suffering from infected burns,\u000asuffocation and dehydration, said Helmi Hamdi, a nurse at the Taza hospital.\u000aHe said eight people were transferred to Baghdad for treatment."There is fear\u000aand panic among the women and children," said Adel Hussein, a local official\u000ain Taza. "They're calling for the central government to save them." Hussein\u000asaid a German and an American forensics team arrived in the area to test for\u000athe presence of chemical agents.U.S. and Iraqi officials said U.S. special\u000aforces captured the head of the ISIS unit trying to develop chemical weapons\u000ain a raid last month in northern Iraq.CBS News national security correspondent\u000aDavid Martin reported Delta Force commandos captured the Iraqi who had once\u000aworked for the regime of Saddam Hussein. After interrogating him, U.S.\u000aintelligence was able to identify a building in Mosul where mustard agent was\u000amanufactured and loaded into artillery shells.Video released by the British\u000aDefense Ministry shows a building described as an ISIS weapons factory being\u000adestroyed by an airstrike last weekend.By the Pentagon's count, ISIS has\u000amounted a dozen chemical weapons attacks in Iraq and Syria, a fact confirmed\u000aby CIA Director John Brennan in a "60 Minutes" interview."We have a number of\u000ainstances where ISIL has used chemical munitions on the battlefield," Brennan\u000asaid.CBS' Scott Pelley asked Brennan if ISIS has access to chemical artillery\u000ashells."There are reports that ISIS has access to chemical precursors and\u000amunitions that they can use," Brennan said.The day before the strike on the\u000achemical weapons building, U.S. aircraft targeted a top ISIS commander, known\u000aby the alias Omar the Chechen, who the Pentagon considered to be the\u000aequivalent of the group's Secretary of Defense.U.S. intelligence was trying to\u000aconfirm if he was in fact killed. The U.S.-led coalition said the chemicals\u000aISIS has so far used include chlorine and a low-grade sulfur mustard which is\u000anot very potent. "It's a legitimate threat. It's not a high threat. We're not,\u000afrankly, losing too much sleep over it," U.S. Army Col. Steve Warren told\u000areporters Friday.Experts also say the extremist group appears incapable of\u000alaunching a large-scale chemical weapons' attack, which requires not only\u000aexpertise, but also the proper equipment, materials and a supply-chain to\u000aproduce enough of the chemical agent to pose a significant threat.The\u000acoalition began targeting ISIS' chemical weapons infrastructure with\u000aairstrikes and special operations raids two months ago, Iraqi intelligence\u000aofficials and a Western security official in Baghdad told the AP.Airstrikes\u000aare targeting laboratories and equipment, and further special forces raids\u000atargeting chemical weapons experts are planned, the officials said. They spoke\u000aon condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief\u000areporters.The extremist group is believed to have set up a special unit for\u000achemical weapons research made up of Iraqi scientists who worked on weapons\u000aprograms under Saddam Hussein as well as foreign experts.The group is believed\u000ato have created limited amounts of mustard gas. Tests confirmed mustard gas\u000awas used in a town in Syria when ISIS was launching attacks there in August\u000a2015. There have been other unverified reports of ISIS using chemical agents\u000aon battlefields in Syria and Iraq.Separately, attacks across Baghdad Saturday\u000akilled 13 and wounded 27. The attacks were mostly carried out with homemade\u000abombs placed along roads in the capital's southern and eastern neighborhoods.\u000aThere were no immediate claims of responsibility, but ISIS often claims\u000aresponsibility for bomb attacks in the Iraq capital targeting civilians.As the\u000agroup has endured territorial losses in Iraq -- most recently the city of\u000aRamadi which was declared "fully liberated" by Iraqi and U.S. officials last\u000amonth -- they have stepped up insurgent style attacks in Baghdad and other\u000aareas far from the front lines.Hamish De Bretton Gordon, a former British army\u000aofficer and chemical weapons expert, says the use of chemical weapons by ISIS\u000aalso appears to be linked to losses on the battlefield."As they get more and\u000amore pushed, we're seeing them use it more and more often," he said. "They are\u000atrying to prevent defeat."The mustard agent that ISIS is using is not very\u000atoxic, Gordon says, but "it has a huge physiological impact that far outweighs\u000aits physical impacts."Fatima's father Wais said he was planning to return to\u000athe frontline with ISIS as soon as possible. "Now I will fight Daesh more than\u000abefore, for Fatima."\u000a\u000a

VThe Obama administration has extended the deadline to sign up for health\u000ainsurance under the Affordable Care Act by two days because of a extremely\u000ahigh demand, according to a statement on HealthCare.gov."Because of the\u000aunprecedented demand and volume of consumers contacting our call center or\u000avisiting HealthCare.gov, we are extending the deadline to sign-up for January\u000a1 coverage until 11:59pm PST December 17," Kevin Counihan, CEO of the Health\u000aInsurance Marketplaces, said in an emailed statement.The final days heading\u000ainto the December 15 deadline were the busiest the site had ever seen, with\u000ahundreds of thousands of people electing plans, officials said. This clogged\u000athe federal government's exchange, forcing another million people to leave\u000atheir contact information in order to hold their place in line.The\u000aadministration said the two extra days will give these users -- as well as\u000aanyone else still looking to sign up for health insurance \u005c-- the chance to do\u000aso before the deadline. (People can continue to sign up after Thursday, but\u000athat's the last chance to get coverage that goes into effect January 1.)"Our\u000agoal is to provide access to affordable coverage, and the additional 48 hours\u000awill give consumers an opportunity to come back and complete their enrollment\u000afor January 1 coverage," Counihan said.Those who have left their contact\u000ainformation on the website or call center will receive an email notification\u000aor call when they are able to finish enrolling.Thursday is also the deadline\u000ato make any changes to existing coverage that will take effect January 1.\u000aCurrent customers will be automatically renewed the first of the year if they\u000adon't make any changes.The final deadline for new enrollments and plan\u000aswitches is January 31, 2016. After that, new sign-ups and changes are only\u000aallowed under special circumstances. People who remain uninsured after January\u000a31 are subject to a penalty.\u000a\u000a

VAnother year, another effort to repeal Obamacare. House Republicans are\u000astarting off 2016 with a renewed legislative push to roll back the president's\u000alandmark health care legislation, with proposals to defund Planned Parenthood\u000atacked onto the bill."As Congress returns next week, in one of our first acts\u000aof the new year, the House will vote on a bill that would eliminate key parts\u000aof Obamacare and stop taxpayer funding for abortion providers such as Planned\u000aParenthood," Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Missouri, said in a video released\u000aSaturday. "If this bill becomes law, patients will be able to choose a health\u000ainsurance plan that works for them -- without Washington getting in the\u000away."The Missouri Republican, who sits on the House Budget Committee, points\u000ato rising health insurance costs as a reason to target the individual mandate\u000aof the Affordable Care Act (ACA).Obamacare "forces people to buy insurance\u000athat's much more expensive than what they need," Hartzler said. "And when you\u000aforce millions of people to buy expensive and unaffordable insurance, it's not\u000athat surprising to see premiums going up. Deductibles are going up too -- all\u000awhile people's choices are disappearing."Hartzler promised that the bill,\u000awhich would eliminate the individual mandate as well as the employer mandate\u000ato offer insurance, would be sent directly to the president's desk via the\u000areconciliation process, avoiding the chance of congressional Democrats\u000afilibustering the legislation. The bill also takes aim at federal funding for\u000aPlanned Parenthood -- a fight Republicans have renewed with vigor since last\u000asummer, when an anti-abortion group released undercover videos of Planned\u000aParenthood employees discussing controversial procedures like fetal tissue\u000atransfers. According to Hartzler, the legislation places a "moratorium on\u000ataxpayer funding to abortion providers" for one year and uses some of that\u000amoney to fund other community health centers."We have taken many votes to\u000apreserve health care choices and protect precious tax dollars in the House,"\u000ashe said. "If the president didn't hear the people's voices earlier,\u000ahopefully, he will through this bill." The Senate passed similar legislation\u000alast month, narrowly voting through a bill crafted under the budget\u000areconciliation process that repeals major parts of the ACA. The Missouri\u000arepresentative also added a message for the people of her state, extending her\u000athoughts and prayers to those affected by severe weather events over the last\u000aweek. "Missouri is experiencing extensive flooding as are other states.\u000aFamilies across the South are picking up the pieces of their lives after being\u000adevastated by tornadoes. Ice and snow have caused power outages in multiple\u000astates. It wasn't the holiday week we were expecting, but there is help,"\u000aHartzler said. "If you are affected, I urge you to reach out to your U.S.\u000arepresentative's office, state and local authorities, or the federal and state\u000aemergency management agencies for resources to deal with the aftermath. While\u000athe assistance can't undo the damage, it can help get you on a path to\u000arecovery so 2016 can be a new year with new hope."\u000a\u000a

V**WASHINGTON, D.C. **\u005c-- The third year of open enrollment for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act began this week. Premiums are up and some people have decided they are not so affordable.Lisa Patton turns 26 years old this month. That means, she will lose coverage under her parents health insurance. But she doesn't want to pay up to $250 a month for a plan under Obamacare."Being a graduate student and living in D.C., and kind of barely making ends meet now, it's just hard to factor in the cost of an extra bill," she said.![en1102goldmanobamacare2.jpg](http://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/11/03/c7893f42-202d-4a8d-baf2-66c87f7512e1/thumbnail/620x350/611bda4b6731fb95b733a0d1fa29155d/en1102goldmanobamacare2.jpg)\u000a\u000aLisa Patton, 25.\u000a\u000aCBS News\u000a\u000aThere are 10.5 million uninsured Americans eligible for coverage under the\u000aAffordable Care Act, but the Obama administration expects only a quarter will\u000asign up this year, even though those who don't could pay a higher penalty in\u000atheir taxes.When it's pointed out that she will face a $700 penalty if she\u000adoesn't sign up, Patton responded: "I actually didn't know the penalty was\u000athat high."Premiums have also increased. The cost of a mid-level plan is up an\u000aaverage of 7.5 percent. It's due in part because a number of companies have\u000aleft the marketplace and fewer insurers means less competition."I've had\u000aObamacare insurance now for two years and it did go up the second year," said\u000aDawn Erin an actress and singer living in Texas.Erin said Obamacare made her\u000aHepatitis C medication affordable."Total cost of that medication was\u000aapproximately $70,000. And my co-pay was 5 bucks," she said.![en1102goldmanoba\u000amacare3.jpg](http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2015/11/03/440184d4-368f-4\u000a2d7-8f01-5803c4040ec4/thumbnail/620x350/617164d2f4c74721333700e4aa1d419b/en110\u000a2goldmanobamacare3.jpg)\u000a\u000aDawn Erin.\u000a\u000aCBS News\u000a\u000aAs for Patton, the healthy millennial is inclined to take her chances without\u000ainsurance."I will probably look at enrolling after I graduate," she said.And\u000ashe will deal with the penalty then."Kind of a hard situation to be in right\u000anow," she said.Officials acknowledge that most people will need to shop around\u000aand pick new plans to avoid price hikes. The Obama administration expects 10\u000amillion people will be enrolled in insurance exchanges by the end of 2016, but\u000athat's way down from the original estimates of 21 million.\u000a\u000a

VLast Updated Feb 6, 2016 10:48 PM EST**10:47 p.m. **Excerpts from the\u000acandidates' closing statements:**Kasich**: "I've done now over 100 town hall\u000ameetings and I've loved every second of it...you've changed me, because I've\u000alistened to your stories and I've had your hugs and I've seen your tears and\u000aI've seen you walk away and say I now have hope."**Christie**: "I've spent the\u000alast 13 years of my life focused on one thing: Serving the people who have\u000agiven me the opportunity to serve them. Not about politics, not about\u000apartisanship, but about putting the people of my state and our country\u000afirst...New Hampshire I've spent 70 days with you. You've gotten to know my\u000aheart."**Bush**: "I want to celebrate the birthday of a great president.\u000aRonald Reagan would have been 105 today. President Reagan believed in the\u000afuture of our country, believed in its future...we need someone who has a\u000aproven record to take our case to the American people because our message is\u000aby far the best one."**Carson**: "For many months the political class,\u000apundits, the media, have tried ot ignore or bury me, they say that politics is\u000atoo complex, and too sleazy, you can't survive. Well guess what? I'm still\u000ahere and I'm not going anyplace either and I believe there is still a place in\u000aour country for faith, integrity and common sense."**Rubio**: "This week I had\u000athe great pleasure of having my kids join me on the campaign trail. I haven't\u000aseen them in a while...it once again reminded me of what's at stake here in\u000aNew Hampshire in less than 72 hours. We are literally deciding what kind of\u000acountry we will be like when they are my age...we will grow the conservative\u000amovement, we will defeat Hillary Clinton, and we will leave our children what\u000aour parents left us."**Cruz**: "I campaigned in the state of Iowa four square\u000aagainst the ethanol mandate, something everyone said was political suicide. My\u000atwo leading competitors both attacked me for it. The governor of the state\u000asaid vote for anyone but Cruz and lobbyists spent millions of dollars in\u000aattack ads, but I stood and said we should have no mandates, a level playing\u000afield, and the people of Iowa put country and our children above the cronyism\u000aand corporate welfare."**Trump**: "That's because he got Ben Carson's votes by\u000athe way, but we won't say anything. Our country that we love so much doesn't\u000awin anymore, we don't win with the military, we don't win on the border, you\u000alook at New Hampshire with the tremendous problem we have with heroin...we\u000adon't win with healthcare, we don't win with trade, you look at what other\u000acountries are doing to us, China, everyone, they are killing us on trade. If I\u000aam elected president we will win and we will win and we will win."**10:32\u000ap.m.** Here's what the candidates had to say when asked who would win the\u000aSuper Bowl on Sunday:**10:26 p.m. **Rubio fields a question about how he will\u000adefend his positions opposing same-sex marriage and abortion even though he\u000awill be charged with intolerance. He said he respects people who disagree with\u000ahim on marriage, but that he believes it should be between a man and a\u000awoman.He criticizes the media for not asking Democrats why they support\u000aabortion rights in the debates."They are extremists on abortion and I can't\u000await to expose them in a general election," he said.Later, in response to a\u000aquestion about Bush's campaign suggesting he is too pro-life to be elected,\u000aRubio said, "I would rather lose an election than be wrong on the issue of\u000alife."**10:25 p.m.** The candidates are asked about their policies toward\u000apaying ransoms for Americans held hostage abroad. The moderators note that the\u000afamily of James Foley, an American journalist who was beheaded by ISIS, is\u000afrom New Hampshire."I recognize it's an agonizing experience," Cruz said, "But\u000aat the same time, putting in place legal regimes that encourage the payment of\u000aransom ahs the effect of putting a bounty on other Americans. There is a\u000areason it has been longstanding policy that we don't negotiate with\u000aterrorists, we don't pay ransoms." He slammed President Obama for the deal to\u000aswap Taliban prisoners for Army Sgt. Bowe Berghdal.Trump agreed. "You cannot\u000anegotiate this way with terrorists. If you do, you are going to have many more\u000aJames Foleys," he said.**10:22 p.m.** The conversation turns to ways to reform\u000aveterans' healthcare."I totally agree that we need to give veterans more\u000achoices. A veterans card to be able to go to a private provider will enhance\u000athe quality of care," Bush said. He also called for career civil service\u000areform so more people could be fired for poor performance.Kasich said, "When a\u000aveteran comes home, they should get healthcare anywhere they want to go." He\u000aalso stresses an increased focus on getting veterans college educations and\u000ajobs.**10:13 p.m.** Rubio and Bush both say that women should be required to\u000aregister for Selective Service now that combat roles will be opened to all\u000awomen. Both used the opportunity to call for strengthening the U.S.\u000amilitary.**10:12 p.m.** Raddatz recalls Christie's decision to quarantine a\u000anurse who had displayed symptoms of Ebola. Would he do that again to stop the\u000aZika virus from spreading?"You bet I would," he said.Carson, asked whether he\u000awould quarantine, said it's not a simple issue."Do we quarantine people? If we\u000ahave evidence they are infected and if we have evidence that infection can\u000aspread by something they are doing, yes," he said. But he would not "willy-\u000anilly" quarantine people who were returning from Brazil, where the virus has\u000aspread the fastest.**10:08 p.m.** Would Rubio visit a mosque as president, as\u000aPresident Obama did this week and former President George W. Bush did?"I\u000awould," Rubio said. But he also criticized President Obama for perpetuating a\u000a"fiction" that there is discrimination against Muslims.**10:07 p.m. **Kasich\u000ajumps in to say that Ohio was able to bring community and police together to\u000a"have a win-win.""We love the police but we've got to be responsive the\u000acommunities," he said.**10:06 p.m. **Trump is asked how he would bridge the\u000adivide between police and communities, and he doubles down on his previous\u000astatements about police.****"The police are absolutely mistreated and\u000amisunderstood," he said. "The police in this country have done an unbelievable\u000ajob of keeping law and order and they're afraid for their jobs, they're\u000aafraid."He added, "minorities all over the country, they respect the police of\u000athis country" and said they deserve more respect.**9:57 p.m.** Both Rubio and\u000aCarson attack Clinton over her role in the 2012 attacks on the U.S. diplomatic\u000afacility in Benghazi.Carson on how he would run against Clinton: "I would\u000asimply make it a referendum on honesty and integrity versus deceit."**9:55\u000ap.m.** Trump talks about what will happen if he runs against former Secretary\u000aof State Hillary Clinton."We will win it by a lot and we will win it handily,"\u000ahe said.**9:50 p.m.** WMUR's McElveen asks Cruz about anger from law\u000aenforcement that he missed a hearing in Washington about the heroin\u000aepidemic."What can you say to law enforcement right now to convince them that\u000ayou understand the severity of this problem?" he said."This is a problem that\u000afor me I understand firsthand," Cruz said. "My older sister Miriam, who is my\u000ahalf sister, struggled her whole life with drug and alcohol addiction." He\u000atold a story about her life, which eventually resulted in her death from a\u000apresumed overdose."This is an absolute epidemic. We need leadership to solve\u000ait. Solving it has to happen at the state and local levels," Cruz said. He\u000aalso said it was important to close the southern border to ensure no more\u000adrugs come across.**9:42 p.m.** Trump is asked to respond to people who are\u000aconcerned he might make deals and betray conservative principles in the\u000aprocess."A good dealmaker will make great deals but will do it the way our\u000afounders thought it should be done. People get together, they make deals," he\u000asaid. "With Congress, you have to get everyone in the room and you have to get\u000athem to agree, and you have to get them to agree to what you want...you can't\u000ago to Hawaii and play golf for three weeks."Among his tactics for working with\u000aCongress: "Grab 'em, hug 'em, kiss 'em and get the deal done."**9:38 p.m.\u000a**Asked whether waterboarding qualifies as torture, Cruz said, "It is enhanced\u000ainterrogation, it is vigorous interrogation, but it does not meet the\u000ageneralized definition of torture.""I would not bring it back in any sort of\u000awidespread use," Cruz said. He said that he joined with Sen. John McCain,\u000aR-Arizona, in offering a bill to stop line officers from using the\u000atechnique.He said that if it was necessary to "prevent a city from facing an\u000aimminent terrorist attack," he would use whatever enhanced interrogation\u000amethods he could."Bush said he would not call on Congress to change the laws\u000abanning the use of waterboarding.Rubio said that fighting terrorism is not\u000alike law enforcement where evidence must be collected in a legal way, but\u000areiterated his stance not to tell the enemy what tactics the U.S. will\u000ause.**9:36 p.m.** Carson calls for a "proactive" plan to deal with ISIS in\u000aLibya. He says the U.S. should consult with its military experts to develop\u000athat actual plan."I would support the possibility of renewed airstrikes if in\u000aconjunction with our joint chiefs and our military people, they felt that was\u000aan appropriate military strategy," he said when asked whether he would support\u000arenewed airstrikes. "None of us up here is a military expert. We sometimes act\u000alike we are, but we're not."**9:34 p.m. **Bush said he would support new\u000aairstrikes in Libya to defeat the outgrowth of ISIS there."This is the lesson\u000alearned from history: if you bomb something and don't do anything as it\u000arelated to the aftermath...you get an unstable government.""Dealing with the\u000acaliphate is important because it has now spawned," Bush said. He predicted\u000athe United States would "play a significant role" in destroying ISIS\u000athere.**9:32 p.m.** It's Trump's turn to provide specifics about defeating\u000aISIS. He said the U.S. must be trying harder to "knock the hell out of the\u000aoil" and take the oil ISIS holds and not worry about environmental impacts,\u000aand to also cut off ISIS financing."Nobody knows banking better than I do," he\u000asaid.Asked what to do about the cities that ISIS controls, Trump said ISIS\u000awill be weakened when their wealth disappears.**9:29 p.m.** Rubio is similarly\u000aasked to elaborate on his proposal to use "overwhelming U.S. force" to defeat\u000aISIS. He talked about building a ground force of Sunnis backed by a U.S.-led\u000acoalition that also includes Jordanians and Egyptians, but also called for\u000astrikes against the group in every part of the world where they have\u000aaffiliates.Raddatz noted that Rubio has called ISIS the most dangerous terror\u000agroup in the world -- more dangerous than al Qaeda, which the U.S. committed a\u000ahuge ground force to defeat. Why not send in a large U.S. ground force\u000anow?"They currently occupty Sunni cities and villages. Sunni cities and\u000avillages can only truly be liberated by Sunnis themselves," Rubio said. "Kurds\u000acannot and do not want to liberate and hold Sunni cities and towns."**9:26\u000ap.m. **Cruz further discusses his proposal to "carpet-bomb" the Islamic State\u000aof Iraq and Syria (ISIS), saying it would be "not indiscriminate," but rather\u000atargeted at oil tankers, oil facilities, command and control locations and\u000ainfrastructure. He also said the rules of engagement should be loosened.**9:23\u000ap.m.** Bush has a pithy line when asked about the statistic that 68 percent of\u000aAmericans favor tax increases on people making more than a million."I'd like\u000ato see more millionaires," Bush said. "This notion that somehow we're\u000aundertaxed as a nation is just foolhardly."**9:19 p.m. **Christie defends\u000ahimself against attacks on New Jersey's economic record as compared to\u000aKasich's record in Ohio."He deserves credit for his record on jobs, he's doing\u000aa very good job in Ohio." But, Christie also said there were 10,000 fewer\u000aemployees than when he took office. "John has a bigger government now and more\u000aemployees than he had when he walked in the door," he said.Kasich said Ohio's\u000agovernment has grown with the rate of inflation and that there are the lowest\u000anumber of state employees in 30 years.**9:15 p.m. **Some definitions of\u000aconservatism from the candidates:Kasich: "In America, conservatism should mean\u000athat nto only some rise with conservative principles, but that everybody has\u000athe ability to rise...so they can live their God-given purpose."Trump: "I view\u000aconservatism as a derivative of the word conserve. We want to conserve our\u000amoney. We want to conserve our wealth...we want to conserve our country, we\u000awant to save our country."Rubio: "It's about three things. the first is\u000aconservatism is about limited government, especially at the federal\u000alevel...it's about free enterprise, which is an economic model that allows\u000aeverybody to rise without pulling anybody down...and it's about a strong\u000anational defense."**9:06 p.m**A new debate question from WMUR political\u000adirector Josh McElveen asks about the use of eminent domain in New Hampshire\u000afor the Northern Pass project."Eminent domain is an absolute necessity for a\u000acountry, for our country," he said, arguing there would be no roads,\u000ahospitals, schools or bridges without it. "The Keystone pipeline without\u000aeminent domain, it wouldn't go 10 feet," he added.When eminent domain is used\u000aon somebody's property that person gets a fortune. They get at least fair\u000amarket value and if they're smart they'll get at least two or three times the\u000avalue of their property."Bush accuses Trump of using eminent domain to take\u000aover the property of a woman in Atlantic City."I didn't take the property,"\u000aTrump said. "The woman ultimately didn't want to do that.""To turn this into a\u000alimousine parking lot for his casinos is not a public use," Bush said.As Trump\u000amocks Bush for "trying to be a tough guy," Bush responds, "How tough is it to\u000atake away property from an elderly woman."The crowd boos Trump for telling\u000aBush, "quiet," and Trump says it's all of Bush's donors and special interests\u000ain the audience."The reason they're not loving me is I don't want their\u000amoney," he said.**8:58 p.m. **Trump is pressed over specific details of what\u000ahe would do about health care as moderator Mary Katharine Ham noted he has\u000asaid "everybody's got to be covered" and also "the government's got to pay for\u000ait." "We are going to repeal Obamacare, we are going to replace Obamacare with\u000asomething so much better and there are so many examples of it," Trump said. He\u000aargued the insurance companies are "getting rich" and he's going to end that\u000aby taking out the "artificial lines" between insurance companies to encourage\u000afree enterprise."There will be a certain number of people that will be on the\u000astreet dying and as a Republican I don't want that to happen," he added.When\u000aCruz is asked what he would say to people who gained coverage under Obamacare\u000aand are worried about losing it, he warned about "socialized\u000amedicine.""Socialized medicine is a disaster. It does not work. If you look at\u000athe countries that have imposed socialized medicine...what inevitably happens\u000ais rationing...the elderly are told 'we're going to ration a hip replacement,\u000awe're going to ration a knee replacement, we're going to ration end-of-life\u000acare,'" he said. "Socialized medicine whether proposed by a Democrat or\u000aproposed by a Republican would hurt the people of this country," he\u000asaid.**8:53 p.m. **Once again, Rubio is asked about his support for the 2013\u000acomprehensive Senate legislation that would have provided a pathway to\u000acitizenship for those in the country illegally. "Did you fight for the\u000alegislation at the time or did you run from it?" Muir asked."Here's the bottom\u000aline," Rubio said. "We cannot get that legislation passed." He argued the\u000aAmerican people have no trust that the federal government will enforce the\u000alaws. He, too, promised to enforce the law first as president and said then he\u000awould see what the American people support.Christie jumped in to point out\u000athat Rubio had skirted the issue."The question was did he fight for his\u000alegislation. It's abundantly clear that he didn't," Christie said. He touted\u000ahis own record of fighting with teacher's unions and the legislature in New\u000aJersey.**8:50 p.m. **Kasich is asked how he defends his stance that the U.S.\u000acannot possibly deport all people in the country illegally, given that the\u000aleading Republicans are promising to deport all 11-million plus."I cannot even\u000abegin to imagine" taking parents out of their house if they had not committed\u000aa crime and leaving their children behind, Kasich said.Cruz is asked to give\u000aspecifics on how he would deport so many people, and he launches into his plan\u000ato secure the border -- and says, looking at Trump, that he has "someone in\u000amind" to build the wall on the border.He said an employment verification\u000asystem and biometric tracking for visas, as well as ending "sanctuary cities"\u000aand welfare benefits for those in the U.S. illegally, will end the presence of\u000athose in the U.S. illegally."What you do is you enforce the law," he said,\u000awhen pressed about the point Kasich made about not breaking up families.**8:48\u000ap.m. **Another North Korea question: Bush is asked what he would do about an\u000aAmerican college student who was recently detained there."It's interesting\u000ahtat htat happened literally days when this hostage release took place in\u000aIran, a day or two days afterwards," he said. "I think it's when we send a\u000asignall of weakness when we're negotiating to release people who committed\u000acrimes in our country for people who didn't commit crimes in Iran.""The next\u000apresident of the United States is going to have to get back in the game where\u000athe United States' word matters," he added.Christie echoed that idea."You\u000anever pay ransom to the criminals, ever," he said. He added the U.S. must\u000a"engage in a much different way with these folks. They do not understand\u000aanything but toughness and strength."**8:44 p.m.** Trump jumps in to say he\u000adisagrees with Rubio's assessment that Mr. Obama knows what he's doing. He\u000adoesn't know, Trump says, and the country is "going to hell" as a result.On\u000athe North Korea question, he says he would get on the phone with China and\u000ademand they take the lead on dealing with their neighbor.**8:40 p.m.**Cruz is\u000aasked how, as president, he would respond to news that broke just minutes\u000abefore the debate began: North Korea test-launched an intercontinental\u000aballistic missile."The fact that we're seeing the launch and we're seeing the\u000alaunch from a nuclear North Korea is a result of the failures of the first\u000aClinton administration" for relaxing sanctions against the country, Cruz said.\u000a"What we are seeing with North Korea is foreshadowing of where we should be\u000awith Iran.'"One of the first things we should do is expand our missile defense\u000acapacity" by putting receptors in South Korea, he added. He said there is a\u000agreat risk that North Korea would put a nuclear weapon on a satellite and\u000alaunch an electro-magnetic pulse over the U.S.Raddatz follows up by asking\u000awhether Cruz would have ordered the U.S. military to preemptively strike the\u000amissile on the launch pad. "At this point I'm not going to speculate on that\u000awithout the intelligence briefing that any commander-in-chief would have," he\u000asaid.Kasich, fielding the same question, said the U.S. should intercept both\u000aNorth Korea's ships and their aircraft. He added that he would have signaled\u000ato the Japanese that they would have had U.S. support if they took\u000aaction.**8:36 p.m.** Bush gets a crack at the preparedness question and ticks\u000aoff his numerous endorsements and experience running the state of Florida,\u000aincluding through several hurricanes."Marco Rubio is a gifted, gifted\u000apolitician and he may have the skills to be a president of the United States\u000abut we've tried it the old way, with Barack Obama and soaring eloquence," he\u000asaid.**8:33 p.m. **As Rubio and Christie scuffle over who is better prepared\u000ato be president, Rubio repeatedly tries to shift the conversation back to\u000aPresident Obama to argue that Mr. Obama is trying to make the U.S. more like\u000athe rest of the world.****"There it is, everybody. He memorized a 25-second\u000aspeech," Christie said. "He gets very unruly when he gets off his talking\u000apoints."**8:30 p.m. **Rubio gets a chance to defend his accomplishments in the\u000aSenate after former Sen. Rick Santorum, who endorsed him earlier this week,\u000ahad a hard time listing his accomplishments.Rubio ticked off a few items,\u000aincluding protecting the people of Florida from eminent domain abuse to\u000areforming the Veterans Administration.But he also suggested his Senate record\u000ashouldn't matter."If the presidency becomes about electing the people who are\u000ain Congress or the Senate the longest, we should all rally around Joe Biden,"\u000ahe said.Christie jumped in and said that Rubio does not have the experience\u000amaking decisions for which he will be held accountable, and said that\u000aregarding one of the accomplishments he listed -- a bill dealing with\u000aHezbollah -- Rubio was not even present to vote on it."That's not leadership,\u000athat's truancy," he said.**8:26 p.m. **Carson is asked to respond to the dust-\u000aup during the Iowa caucus in which his campaign circulated a news story that\u000asaid Carson was taking a break from the campaign.**"**I'm not going to use\u000athis opportunity to savage the reputation of Sen. Cruz," Carson said. "I will\u000asay I'm very disappointed members of his team thought so little of me that\u000athey thought that after having hundreds if not thousands of volunteers and\u000acollege students who sacrificed their time and were dedicated to the cause,\u000aone even died, to think that I would just walk away 10 minutes before the\u000acaucus and say 'forget about you guys.' I mean who would do something like\u000athat?""To assume that someone would, what does that tell you?" he added. "It\u000agives you a very good example of certain types of Washington ethics.\u000aWashington ethics says if it's legal you do what you need to do in order to\u000awin. My ethics are you do what's right.""Ben, I'm sorry," Cruz said, before\u000adefending what had happened - that his team was just spreading a CNN story\u000athat turned out to be accurate. He reiterated that his team should have\u000aclarified Carson was not dropping out.**8:23 p.m.**Trump is asked about Cruz's\u000acomments that he doesn't have the temperament to be commander-in-chief and\u000amight use a nuclear weapon against Denmark."I actually think I have the best\u000atemperament," Trump said. "I built a massive corporation, I employ thousands\u000aof thousands of people, I've gotten along for people with years and years."On\u000astage, Cruz backs away from the attack slightly when asked about those\u000acomments."I am convinced every individual standing on this stage would make a\u000amuch better commander-in-chief than Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton or Bernie\u000aSanders," he said.Pressed whether he stands by those words, Cruz responded\u000athat's an assessment for the voters to make.Trump jumped in and pointed out\u000athat Cruz didn't answer the question."We're going to win with Trump. People\u000aback down with Trump," he said.******7:45 p.m. **Republicans are about to take\u000athe stage in Manchester, New Hampshire for the final Republican debate before\u000athe state's first-in-the-nation primary.Those qualifying for the main stage\u000ainclude businessman Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco\u000aRubio, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New\u000aJersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.This is the only\u000aRepublican debate to take place between the Iowa caucuses and the New\u000aHampshire primary. Cruz won the Iowa Republican caucuses, followed by Donald\u000aTrump, and then Marco Rubio. Trump and Rubio were separated by a single\u000apercentage point in the race.Going into the Granite State primary, Donald\u000aTrump holds a double-digit lead in most polls, with Rubio in second. Several\u000acandidates on the debate stage, including the three former and current state\u000agovernors, have invested a large amount of time and campaign resources on the\u000aNew Hampshire primary contest.This debate, hosted by ABC News and the\u000aIndependent Journal Review, is the first to exclude an undercard debate stage\u000afor Republicans.Despite attempts by Carly Fiorina to be included on the debate\u000astage, ABC News declined. She is the only remaining Republican who has ever\u000abeen included on the main debate stage in a primary debate who is being\u000aexcluded.Banking on other media exposure ahead of New Hampshire's primary on\u000aTuesday, Fiorina's campaign is set to air an ad in the state during CBS' Super\u000aBowl broadcast on Sunday. The ad buy, according to the campaign was a six-\u000afigure sum.Candidates qualified for the debate stage if they met one of three\u000arequirements: finishing in the top three by popular vote in the Iowa caucuses,\u000aplacing in the top six in an average of New Hampshire polls recognized by ABC\u000aNews, or polling in the top six in an average of national GOP polls deemed\u000avalid by the network.ABC News anchor David Muir and ABC News chief global\u000aaffairs correspondent Martha Raddatz will moderate the debate. Additional\u000aquestions will be posed by WMUR political director Josh McElveen and\u000aconservative blogger Mary Katharine Ham.\u000a\u000a

VLast Updated Feb 6, 2016 10:48 PM EST**10:47 p.m. **Excerpts from the\u000acandidates' closing statements:**Kasich**: "I've done now over 100 town hall\u000ameetings and I've loved every second of it...you've changed me, because I've\u000alistened to your stories and I've had your hugs and I've seen your tears and\u000aI've seen you walk away and say I now have hope."**Christie**: "I've spent the\u000alast 13 years of my life focused on one thing: Serving the people who have\u000agiven me the opportunity to serve them. Not about politics, not about\u000apartisanship, but about putting the people of my state and our country\u000afirst...New Hampshire I've spent 70 days with you. You've gotten to know my\u000aheart."**Bush**: "I want to celebrate the birthday of a great president.\u000aRonald Reagan would have been 105 today. President Reagan believed in the\u000afuture of our country, believed in its future...we need someone who has a\u000aproven record to take our case to the American people because our message is\u000aby far the best one."**Carson**: "For many months the political class,\u000apundits, the media, have tried ot ignore or bury me, they say that politics is\u000atoo complex, and too sleazy, you can't survive. Well guess what? I'm still\u000ahere and I'm not going anyplace either and I believe there is still a place in\u000aour country for faith, integrity and common sense."**Rubio**: "This week I had\u000athe great pleasure of having my kids join me on the campaign trail. I haven't\u000aseen them in a while...it once again reminded me of what's at stake here in\u000aNew Hampshire in less than 72 hours. We are literally deciding what kind of\u000acountry we will be like when they are my age...we will grow the conservative\u000amovement, we will defeat Hillary Clinton, and we will leave our children what\u000aour parents left us."**Cruz**: "I campaigned in the state of Iowa four square\u000aagainst the ethanol mandate, something everyone said was political suicide. My\u000atwo leading competitors both attacked me for it. The governor of the state\u000asaid vote for anyone but Cruz and lobbyists spent millions of dollars in\u000aattack ads, but I stood and said we should have no mandates, a level playing\u000afield, and the people of Iowa put country and our children above the cronyism\u000aand corporate welfare."**Trump**: "That's because he got Ben Carson's votes by\u000athe way, but we won't say anything. Our country that we love so much doesn't\u000awin anymore, we don't win with the military, we don't win on the border, you\u000alook at New Hampshire with the tremendous problem we have with heroin...we\u000adon't win with healthcare, we don't win with trade, you look at what other\u000acountries are doing to us, China, everyone, they are killing us on trade. If I\u000aam elected president we will win and we will win and we will win."**10:32\u000ap.m.** Here's what the candidates had to say when asked who would win the\u000aSuper Bowl on Sunday:**10:26 p.m. **Rubio fields a question about how he will\u000adefend his positions opposing same-sex marriage and abortion even though he\u000awill be charged with intolerance. He said he respects people who disagree with\u000ahim on marriage, but that he believes it should be between a man and a\u000awoman.He criticizes the media for not asking Democrats why they support\u000aabortion rights in the debates."They are extremists on abortion and I can't\u000await to expose them in a general election," he said.Later, in response to a\u000aquestion about Bush's campaign suggesting he is too pro-life to be elected,\u000aRubio said, "I would rather lose an election than be wrong on the issue of\u000alife."**10:25 p.m.** The candidates are asked about their policies toward\u000apaying ransoms for Americans held hostage abroad. The moderators note that the\u000afamily of James Foley, an American journalist who was beheaded by ISIS, is\u000afrom New Hampshire."I recognize it's an agonizing experience," Cruz said, "But\u000aat the same time, putting in place legal regimes that encourage the payment of\u000aransom ahs the effect of putting a bounty on other Americans. There is a\u000areason it has been longstanding policy that we don't negotiate with\u000aterrorists, we don't pay ransoms." He slammed President Obama for the deal to\u000aswap Taliban prisoners for Army Sgt. Bowe Berghdal.Trump agreed. "You cannot\u000anegotiate this way with terrorists. If you do, you are going to have many more\u000aJames Foleys," he said.**10:22 p.m.** The conversation turns to ways to reform\u000aveterans' healthcare."I totally agree that we need to give veterans more\u000achoices. A veterans card to be able to go to a private provider will enhance\u000athe quality of care," Bush said. He also called for career civil service\u000areform so more people could be fired for poor performance.Kasich said, "When a\u000aveteran comes home, they should get healthcare anywhere they want to go." He\u000aalso stresses an increased focus on getting veterans college educations and\u000ajobs.**10:13 p.m.** Rubio and Bush both say that women should be required to\u000aregister for Selective Service now that combat roles will be opened to all\u000awomen. Both used the opportunity to call for strengthening the U.S.\u000amilitary.**10:12 p.m.** Raddatz recalls Christie's decision to quarantine a\u000anurse who had displayed symptoms of Ebola. Would he do that again to stop the\u000aZika virus from spreading?"You bet I would," he said.Carson, asked whether he\u000awould quarantine, said it's not a simple issue."Do we quarantine people? If we\u000ahave evidence they are infected and if we have evidence that infection can\u000aspread by something they are doing, yes," he said. But he would not "willy-\u000anilly" quarantine people who were returning from Brazil, where the virus has\u000aspread the fastest.**10:08 p.m.** Would Rubio visit a mosque as president, as\u000aPresident Obama did this week and former President George W. Bush did?"I\u000awould," Rubio said. But he also criticized President Obama for perpetuating a\u000a"fiction" that there is discrimination against Muslims.**10:07 p.m. **Kasich\u000ajumps in to say that Ohio was able to bring community and police together to\u000a"have a win-win.""We love the police but we've got to be responsive the\u000acommunities," he said.**10:06 p.m. **Trump is asked how he would bridge the\u000adivide between police and communities, and he doubles down on his previous\u000astatements about police.****"The police are absolutely mistreated and\u000amisunderstood," he said. "The police in this country have done an unbelievable\u000ajob of keeping law and order and they're afraid for their jobs, they're\u000aafraid."He added, "minorities all over the country, they respect the police of\u000athis country" and said they deserve more respect.**9:57 p.m.** Both Rubio and\u000aCarson attack Clinton over her role in the 2012 attacks on the U.S. diplomatic\u000afacility in Benghazi.Carson on how he would run against Clinton: "I would\u000asimply make it a referendum on honesty and integrity versus deceit."**9:55\u000ap.m.** Trump talks about what will happen if he runs against former Secretary\u000aof State Hillary Clinton."We will win it by a lot and we will win it handily,"\u000ahe said.**9:50 p.m.** WMUR's McElveen asks Cruz about anger from law\u000aenforcement that he missed a hearing in Washington about the heroin\u000aepidemic."What can you say to law enforcement right now to convince them that\u000ayou understand the severity of this problem?" he said."This is a problem that\u000afor me I understand firsthand," Cruz said. "My older sister Miriam, who is my\u000ahalf sister, struggled her whole life with drug and alcohol addiction." He\u000atold a story about her life, which eventually resulted in her death from a\u000apresumed overdose."This is an absolute epidemic. We need leadership to solve\u000ait. Solving it has to happen at the state and local levels," Cruz said. He\u000aalso said it was important to close the southern border to ensure no more\u000adrugs come across.**9:42 p.m.** Trump is asked to respond to people who are\u000aconcerned he might make deals and betray conservative principles in the\u000aprocess."A good dealmaker will make great deals but will do it the way our\u000afounders thought it should be done. People get together, they make deals," he\u000asaid. "With Congress, you have to get everyone in the room and you have to get\u000athem to agree, and you have to get them to agree to what you want...you can't\u000ago to Hawaii and play golf for three weeks."Among his tactics for working with\u000aCongress: "Grab 'em, hug 'em, kiss 'em and get the deal done."**9:38 p.m.\u000a**Asked whether waterboarding qualifies as torture, Cruz said, "It is enhanced\u000ainterrogation, it is vigorous interrogation, but it does not meet the\u000ageneralized definition of torture.""I would not bring it back in any sort of\u000awidespread use," Cruz said. He said that he joined with Sen. John McCain,\u000aR-Arizona, in offering a bill to stop line officers from using the\u000atechnique.He said that if it was necessary to "prevent a city from facing an\u000aimminent terrorist attack," he would use whatever enhanced interrogation\u000amethods he could."Bush said he would not call on Congress to change the laws\u000abanning the use of waterboarding.Rubio said that fighting terrorism is not\u000alike law enforcement where evidence must be collected in a legal way, but\u000areiterated his stance not to tell the enemy what tactics the U.S. will\u000ause.**9:36 p.m.** Carson calls for a "proactive" plan to deal with ISIS in\u000aLibya. He says the U.S. should consult with its military experts to develop\u000athat actual plan."I would support the possibility of renewed airstrikes if in\u000aconjunction with our joint chiefs and our military people, they felt that was\u000aan appropriate military strategy," he said when asked whether he would support\u000arenewed airstrikes. "None of us up here is a military expert. We sometimes act\u000alike we are, but we're not."**9:34 p.m. **Bush said he would support new\u000aairstrikes in Libya to defeat the outgrowth of ISIS there."This is the lesson\u000alearned from history: if you bomb something and don't do anything as it\u000arelated to the aftermath...you get an unstable government.""Dealing with the\u000acaliphate is important because it has now spawned," Bush said. He predicted\u000athe United States would "play a significant role" in destroying ISIS\u000athere.**9:32 p.m.** It's Trump's turn to provide specifics about defeating\u000aISIS. He said the U.S. must be trying harder to "knock the hell out of the\u000aoil" and take the oil ISIS holds and not worry about environmental impacts,\u000aand to also cut off ISIS financing."Nobody knows banking better than I do," he\u000asaid.Asked what to do about the cities that ISIS controls, Trump said ISIS\u000awill be weakened when their wealth disappears.**9:29 p.m.** Rubio is similarly\u000aasked to elaborate on his proposal to use "overwhelming U.S. force" to defeat\u000aISIS. He talked about building a ground force of Sunnis backed by a U.S.-led\u000acoalition that also includes Jordanians and Egyptians, but also called for\u000astrikes against the group in every part of the world where they have\u000aaffiliates.Raddatz noted that Rubio has called ISIS the most dangerous terror\u000agroup in the world -- more dangerous than al Qaeda, which the U.S. committed a\u000ahuge ground force to defeat. Why not send in a large U.S. ground force\u000anow?"They currently occupty Sunni cities and villages. Sunni cities and\u000avillages can only truly be liberated by Sunnis themselves," Rubio said. "Kurds\u000acannot and do not want to liberate and hold Sunni cities and towns."**9:26\u000ap.m. **Cruz further discusses his proposal to "carpet-bomb" the Islamic State\u000aof Iraq and Syria (ISIS), saying it would be "not indiscriminate," but rather\u000atargeted at oil tankers, oil facilities, command and control locations and\u000ainfrastructure. He also said the rules of engagement should be loosened.**9:23\u000ap.m.** Bush has a pithy line when asked about the statistic that 68 percent of\u000aAmericans favor tax increases on people making more than a million."I'd like\u000ato see more millionaires," Bush said. "This notion that somehow we're\u000aundertaxed as a nation is just foolhardly."**9:19 p.m. **Christie defends\u000ahimself against attacks on New Jersey's economic record as compared to\u000aKasich's record in Ohio."He deserves credit for his record on jobs, he's doing\u000aa very good job in Ohio." But, Christie also said there were 10,000 fewer\u000aemployees than when he took office. "John has a bigger government now and more\u000aemployees than he had when he walked in the door," he said.Kasich said Ohio's\u000agovernment has grown with the rate of inflation and that there are the lowest\u000anumber of state employees in 30 years.**9:15 p.m. **Some definitions of\u000aconservatism from the candidates:Kasich: "In America, conservatism should mean\u000athat nto only some rise with conservative principles, but that everybody has\u000athe ability to rise...so they can live their God-given purpose."Trump: "I view\u000aconservatism as a derivative of the word conserve. We want to conserve our\u000amoney. We want to conserve our wealth...we want to conserve our country, we\u000awant to save our country."Rubio: "It's about three things. the first is\u000aconservatism is about limited government, especially at the federal\u000alevel...it's about free enterprise, which is an economic model that allows\u000aeverybody to rise without pulling anybody down...and it's about a strong\u000anational defense."**9:06 p.m**A new debate question from WMUR political\u000adirector Josh McElveen asks about the use of eminent domain in New Hampshire\u000afor the Northern Pass project."Eminent domain is an absolute necessity for a\u000acountry, for our country," he said, arguing there would be no roads,\u000ahospitals, schools or bridges without it. "The Keystone pipeline without\u000aeminent domain, it wouldn't go 10 feet," he added.When eminent domain is used\u000aon somebody's property that person gets a fortune. They get at least fair\u000amarket value and if they're smart they'll get at least two or three times the\u000avalue of their property."Bush accuses Trump of using eminent domain to take\u000aover the property of a woman in Atlantic City."I didn't take the property,"\u000aTrump said. "The woman ultimately didn't want to do that.""To turn this into a\u000alimousine parking lot for his casinos is not a public use," Bush said.As Trump\u000amocks Bush for "trying to be a tough guy," Bush responds, "How tough is it to\u000atake away property from an elderly woman."The crowd boos Trump for telling\u000aBush, "quiet," and Trump says it's all of Bush's donors and special interests\u000ain the audience."The reason they're not loving me is I don't want their\u000amoney," he said.**8:58 p.m. **Trump is pressed over specific details of what\u000ahe would do about health care as moderator Mary Katharine Ham noted he has\u000asaid "everybody's got to be covered" and also "the government's got to pay for\u000ait." "We are going to repeal Obamacare, we are going to replace Obamacare with\u000asomething so much better and there are so many examples of it," Trump said. He\u000aargued the insurance companies are "getting rich" and he's going to end that\u000aby taking out the "artificial lines" between insurance companies to encourage\u000afree enterprise."There will be a certain number of people that will be on the\u000astreet dying and as a Republican I don't want that to happen," he added.When\u000aCruz is asked what he would say to people who gained coverage under Obamacare\u000aand are worried about losing it, he warned about "socialized\u000amedicine.""Socialized medicine is a disaster. It does not work. If you look at\u000athe countries that have imposed socialized medicine...what inevitably happens\u000ais rationing...the elderly are told 'we're going to ration a hip replacement,\u000awe're going to ration a knee replacement, we're going to ration end-of-life\u000acare,'" he said. "Socialized medicine whether proposed by a Democrat or\u000aproposed by a Republican would hurt the people of this country," he\u000asaid.**8:53 p.m. **Once again, Rubio is asked about his support for the 2013\u000acomprehensive Senate legislation that would have provided a pathway to\u000acitizenship for those in the country illegally. "Did you fight for the\u000alegislation at the time or did you run from it?" Muir asked."Here's the bottom\u000aline," Rubio said. "We cannot get that legislation passed." He argued the\u000aAmerican people have no trust that the federal government will enforce the\u000alaws. He, too, promised to enforce the law first as president and said then he\u000awould see what the American people support.Christie jumped in to point out\u000athat Rubio had skirted the issue."The question was did he fight for his\u000alegislation. It's abundantly clear that he didn't," Christie said. He touted\u000ahis own record of fighting with teacher's unions and the legislature in New\u000aJersey.**8:50 p.m. **Kasich is asked how he defends his stance that the U.S.\u000acannot possibly deport all people in the country illegally, given that the\u000aleading Republicans are promising to deport all 11-million plus."I cannot even\u000abegin to imagine" taking parents out of their house if they had not committed\u000aa crime and leaving their children behind, Kasich said.Cruz is asked to give\u000aspecifics on how he would deport so many people, and he launches into his plan\u000ato secure the border -- and says, looking at Trump, that he has "someone in\u000amind" to build the wall on the border.He said an employment verification\u000asystem and biometric tracking for visas, as well as ending "sanctuary cities"\u000aand welfare benefits for those in the U.S. illegally, will end the presence of\u000athose in the U.S. illegally."What you do is you enforce the law," he said,\u000awhen pressed about the point Kasich made about not breaking up families.**8:48\u000ap.m. **Another North Korea question: Bush is asked what he would do about an\u000aAmerican college student who was recently detained there."It's interesting\u000ahtat htat happened literally days when this hostage release took place in\u000aIran, a day or two days afterwards," he said. "I think it's when we send a\u000asignall of weakness when we're negotiating to release people who committed\u000acrimes in our country for people who didn't commit crimes in Iran.""The next\u000apresident of the United States is going to have to get back in the game where\u000athe United States' word matters," he added.Christie echoed that idea."You\u000anever pay ransom to the criminals, ever," he said. He added the U.S. must\u000a"engage in a much different way with these folks. They do not understand\u000aanything but toughness and strength."**8:44 p.m.** Trump jumps in to say he\u000adisagrees with Rubio's assessment that Mr. Obama knows what he's doing. He\u000adoesn't know, Trump says, and the country is "going to hell" as a result.On\u000athe North Korea question, he says he would get on the phone with China and\u000ademand they take the lead on dealing with their neighbor.**8:40 p.m.**Cruz is\u000aasked how, as president, he would respond to news that broke just minutes\u000abefore the debate began: North Korea test-launched an intercontinental\u000aballistic missile."The fact that we're seeing the launch and we're seeing the\u000alaunch from a nuclear North Korea is a result of the failures of the first\u000aClinton administration" for relaxing sanctions against the country, Cruz said.\u000a"What we are seeing with North Korea is foreshadowing of where we should be\u000awith Iran.'"One of the first things we should do is expand our missile defense\u000acapacity" by putting receptors in South Korea, he added. He said there is a\u000agreat risk that North Korea would put a nuclear weapon on a satellite and\u000alaunch an electro-magnetic pulse over the U.S.Raddatz follows up by asking\u000awhether Cruz would have ordered the U.S. military to preemptively strike the\u000amissile on the launch pad. "At this point I'm not going to speculate on that\u000awithout the intelligence briefing that any commander-in-chief would have," he\u000asaid.Kasich, fielding the same question, said the U.S. should intercept both\u000aNorth Korea's ships and their aircraft. He added that he would have signaled\u000ato the Japanese that they would have had U.S. support if they took\u000aaction.**8:36 p.m.** Bush gets a crack at the preparedness question and ticks\u000aoff his numerous endorsements and experience running the state of Florida,\u000aincluding through several hurricanes."Marco Rubio is a gifted, gifted\u000apolitician and he may have the skills to be a president of the United States\u000abut we've tried it the old way, with Barack Obama and soaring eloquence," he\u000asaid.**8:33 p.m. **As Rubio and Christie scuffle over who is better prepared\u000ato be president, Rubio repeatedly tries to shift the conversation back to\u000aPresident Obama to argue that Mr. Obama is trying to make the U.S. more like\u000athe rest of the world.****"There it is, everybody. He memorized a 25-second\u000aspeech," Christie said. "He gets very unruly when he gets off his talking\u000apoints."**8:30 p.m. **Rubio gets a chance to defend his accomplishments in the\u000aSenate after former Sen. Rick Santorum, who endorsed him earlier this week,\u000ahad a hard time listing his accomplishments.Rubio ticked off a few items,\u000aincluding protecting the people of Florida from eminent domain abuse to\u000areforming the Veterans Administration.But he also suggested his Senate record\u000ashouldn't matter."If the presidency becomes about electing the people who are\u000ain Congress or the Senate the longest, we should all rally around Joe Biden,"\u000ahe said.Christie jumped in and said that Rubio does not have the experience\u000amaking decisions for which he will be held accountable, and said that\u000aregarding one of the accomplishments he listed -- a bill dealing with\u000aHezbollah -- Rubio was not even present to vote on it."That's not leadership,\u000athat's truancy," he said.**8:26 p.m. **Carson is asked to respond to the dust-\u000aup during the Iowa caucus in which his campaign circulated a news story that\u000asaid Carson was taking a break from the campaign.**"**I'm not going to use\u000athis opportunity to savage the reputation of Sen. Cruz," Carson said. "I will\u000asay I'm very disappointed members of his team thought so little of me that\u000athey thought that after having hundreds if not thousands of volunteers and\u000acollege students who sacrificed their time and were dedicated to the cause,\u000aone even died, to think that I would just walk away 10 minutes before the\u000acaucus and say 'forget about you guys.' I mean who would do something like\u000athat?""To assume that someone would, what does that tell you?" he added. "It\u000agives you a very good example of certain types of Washington ethics.\u000aWashington ethics says if it's legal you do what you need to do in order to\u000awin. My ethics are you do what's right.""Ben, I'm sorry," Cruz said, before\u000adefending what had happened - that his team was just spreading a CNN story\u000athat turned out to be accurate. He reiterated that his team should have\u000aclarified Carson was not dropping out.**8:23 p.m.**Trump is asked about Cruz's\u000acomments that he doesn't have the temperament to be commander-in-chief and\u000amight use a nuclear weapon against Denmark."I actually think I have the best\u000atemperament," Trump said. "I built a massive corporation, I employ thousands\u000aof thousands of people, I've gotten along for people with years and years."On\u000astage, Cruz backs away from the attack slightly when asked about those\u000acomments."I am convinced every individual standing on this stage would make a\u000amuch better commander-in-chief than Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton or Bernie\u000aSanders," he said.Pressed whether he stands by those words, Cruz responded\u000athat's an assessment for the voters to make.Trump jumped in and pointed out\u000athat Cruz didn't answer the question."We're going to win with Trump. People\u000aback down with Trump," he said.******7:45 p.m. **Republicans are about to take\u000athe stage in Manchester, New Hampshire for the final Republican debate before\u000athe state's first-in-the-nation primary.Those qualifying for the main stage\u000ainclude businessman Donald Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco\u000aRubio, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New\u000aJersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.This is the only\u000aRepublican debate to take place between the Iowa caucuses and the New\u000aHampshire primary. Cruz won the Iowa Republican caucuses, followed by Donald\u000aTrump, and then Marco Rubio. Trump and Rubio were separated by a single\u000apercentage point in the race.Going into the Granite State primary, Donald\u000aTrump holds a double-digit lead in most polls, with Rubio in second. Several\u000acandidates on the debate stage, including the three former and current state\u000agovernors, have invested a large amount of time and campaign resources on the\u000aNew Hampshire primary contest.This debate, hosted by ABC News and the\u000aIndependent Journal Review, is the first to exclude an undercard debate stage\u000afor Republicans.Despite attempts by Carly Fiorina to be included on the debate\u000astage, ABC News declined. She is the only remaining Republican who has ever\u000abeen included on the main debate stage in a primary debate who is being\u000aexcluded.Banking on other media exposure ahead of New Hampshire's primary on\u000aTuesday, Fiorina's campaign is set to air an ad in the state during CBS' Super\u000aBowl broadcast on Sunday. The ad buy, according to the campaign was a six-\u000afigure sum.Candidates qualified for the debate stage if they met one of three\u000arequirements: finishing in the top three by popular vote in the Iowa caucuses,\u000aplacing in the top six in an average of New Hampshire polls recognized by ABC\u000aNews, or polling in the top six in an average of national GOP polls deemed\u000avalid by the network.ABC News anchor David Muir and ABC News chief global\u000aaffairs correspondent Martha Raddatz will moderate the debate. Additional\u000aquestions will be posed by WMUR political director Josh McElveen and\u000aconservative blogger Mary Katharine Ham.\u000a\u000a

VWelcome to Trail Guide, your host through the wilds of the 2016 presidential\u000acampaign. It's Sunday, Jan. 10, and here's what we're talking about:I've seen\u000athings and I've watched things.  \u000aRead moreHillary Clinton's new television ad does not mention any of her\u000achallengers for the Democratic presidential nomination. Instead, the focus of\u000athe 30-second spot, titled "Incredible," is on Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and\u000aother Republican presidential hopefuls. From GOP calls to repeal the\u000aAffordable Care Act to defunding Planned Parenthood, the ad touts Clinton as\u000athe best candidate to take on Republicans. Despite Clinton's strong lead\u000anationally for the Democratic presidential nomination, she does trail Vermont\u000aSen. Bernie Sanders in the early nominating state of New Hampshire. In recent\u000aweeks, she has hammered Sanders on gun-control, but on the campaign trail her\u000afocus has mostly centered on Republicans.  The three candidates for the\u000aDemocratic presidential nomination don't disagree on much - except, perhaps,\u000aon gun control.Hillary Clinton, the front runner, has sought to showcase a\u000aclear difference with Bernie Sanders, her chief rival in the party\u2019s 2016\u000aprimary. In debates and at town hall-style events, the former secretary of\u000aState has assailed the senator from Vermont for his vote in favor of a 2005\u000alaw giving gun manufacturers and dealers immunity from product liability\u000alawsuits. It\u2019s a proposal that then-Sen. Clinton did not support.\u201cI think he\u000ahas been consistently confusing to say that he would vote to repeal this\u000aabsolute immunity from any kind of responsibility or liability,\u201d she said\u000aSunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201dThe Dec. 2 massacre in San Bernardino and\u000aother recent mass shootings have brought gun violence back into the public\u000aspotlight, and renewed the debate over whether federal gun laws should be\u000astrengthened.In a tearful speech at the White House last week, President Obama\u000aannounced an executive action that calls for law enforcement officials to\u000aessentially warn private gun sellers that they may be vulnerable to\u000aprosecution if they don\u2019t conduct background checks on gun buyers.National\u000apolls have repeatedly shown that Americans support background checks on gun\u000asales to help weed out felons and the mentally ill.Sanders has said his vote\u000aon the 2005 measure was \u201ccomplicated\u201d and has said he\u2019s open to revisiting the\u000aissue.\u201cIf you have a small gun shop owner in northern Vermont who sells a gun\u000alegally to somebody and then, you know, something happens to that guy, he goes\u000anuts or something, and he kills somebody, should the gun shop owner be held\u000aliable? I think not,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201dBut if a manufacturer is\u000asending guns \u201cinto an area and really knows that those guns are not being used\u000aor bought by the people in that area \u2026 should we hold that manufacturer\u000aliable? Absolutely,\u201d he added. On Sunday, seeking to bolster her standing\u000aamong gun-control supporters, Clinton announced the endorsement of former Rep.\u000aGabby Giffords of Arizona. Giffords was injured in a 2011 shooting outside a\u000aTucson grocery store and ever since the incident she has been a staunch\u000aadvocate of stricter gun-control reforms. "Most of the people running for\u000apresident talk a lot about how tough they are," Giffords wrote in her\u000aendorsement of Clinton. "But most of them have shown they aren\u2019t tough enough\u000ato stand up to the gun lobbyists."  \u000a_**UPDATE: 4:05 p.m. **This post was updated with information about Gabby\u000aGiffords' endorsement of Clinton. _The 2016 presidential contest kicks off on\u000aFeb.1 with Iowa caucuses and polls seem to be released almost daily in the\u000arace for the White House.On Sunday, a new NBC News/Marist poll was released of\u000aIowa and New Hampshire voters. Here are some highlights from the polls.\u000a**Republican side - Iowa: **Ted Cruz - **28%**Donald Trump - **24%**Marco\u000aRubio - **13%**The Iowa poll of likely Republican caucus-goers has a margin of\u000aerror of plus or minus 4.6 percentage points. **Democratic side - New\u000aHampshire: **Bernie Sanders - **50%**Hillary Clinton - **46%**The New\u000aHampshire poll of likely Democratic primary voters has a margin of error of\u000aplus or minus 4.8 percentage points.  \u000aRead more Donald Trump is trailing in Iowa with about three weeks until GOP\u000acaucus-goers cast the first ballots of 2016, but should he falter in the state\u000athe billionaire businessman has no plans to exit the race for the Republican\u000apresidential nomination. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz recently surpassed Trump in\u000aseveral Hawkeye State polls after making significant inroads with evangelical\u000avoters \u2013 a large and influential voting bloc in the state\u2019s GOP caucuses. When\u000aasked Sunday if he would quit the race should he lose on Feb. 1 in Iowa, Trump\u000awas direct. \u201cI'm not leaving. No, I'm not leaving," Trump said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet\u000athe Press.\u201d "...There's no maybes. I'm not leaving.\u201d  \u000aIn an interview that touched on President Obama's recent actions on\u000aenforcement of gun laws, and North Korea's unconfirmed claim to have tested a\u000ahydrogen bomb, Trump again questioned if Cruz is eligible to become president\u000abecause he was born in CanadaThe Constitution requires presidents to be\u000a\u201cnatural-born citizens.\u201d Cruz and most legal scholars argue that he is not\u000adisqualified for the presidency because his mother was an American citizen,\u000aand children of U.S. citizens born abroad are automatically granted\u000acitizenship. Trump didn't back down, however. \u201cFrom Ted's standpoint and from\u000athe party's standpoint, he has to solve this problem," Trump said. "Because\u000athe Democrats will sue him if he's the nominee."Appearing on CNN, Cruz argued\u000athat Trump is only pushing the issue because Trump is in danger of losing.\u000a\u201cThree weeks ago, almost every Republican candidate was attacking Donald\u000aTrump," he said. "Today, almost every Republican candidate is attacking me.\u000aAnd that kind of suggests maybe something has changed in the race." They can\u000asay whatever they want. More power to them. I think it's a deadend, blind\u000aalley for them, but let them go.  Donald Trump launched his TV advertising\u000ajust after New Year's with his familiar swagger: He was so far ahead in the\u000apolls that it might be a waste, he said, but he felt guilty for not spending\u000ahis money.The reality was more sobering.After six months of branding opponents\u000aand critics as losers, Trump faces the threat of becoming one himself in Iowa,\u000athe first state to hold a Republican presidential nominating contest. The ads\u000aare a crucial part of Trump's strategy to keep Ted Cruz from beating him in\u000athe Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1.Cruz's appeals to evangelicals, tea party\u000afollowers and other conservatives have made the Texas senator the current\u000afavorite in Iowa, though the New York billionaire remains a solid front-runner\u000ain the rest of the country.Cruz's surge in Iowa is jeopardizing Trump's quest\u000ato "run the table" by winning every GOP primary and caucus nationwide.Read\u000amore\u000a\u000a

VThanks for reading Essential Politics!Welcome to our archived feed. You can\u000afind the latest news over here. Meantime, follow us on Twitter for more, or\u000asubscribe to our free daily newsletter.  \u000aGov. Jerry Brown delivered his 13th State of the State address Thursday\u000amorning. Our politics team will continue to offer full coverage and analysis\u000aof the speech, an annual address delivered from the Assembly chamber at the\u000astate Capitol. You can also keep up to date via our Twitter feed, and get a\u000adaily dose of politics and government news from our Essential Politics\u000anewsletter.You can find the latest news from Sacramento and across the Golden\u000aState over here. Read moreState lawmakers faced one of the final major hurdles\u000ain clearing legislation before an end-of-month deadline.The powerful\u000aAppropriations committees met Thursday to determine the fate of dozens of\u000abills, most of them carryover proposals from last year that must pass their\u000ahouses of origin by Jan. 31. Several high-profile bills cleared committee,\u000aincluding an Assembly bill to allow ballot selfies on social media, another\u000athat would regulate the fantasy sports industry, and one that would grant\u000afamilies on welfare assistance a monthly voucher to buy diapers. The Assembly\u000aAppropriations committee also signed off on a bill that would allow medical\u000amarijuana dispensaries to make their sales tax payments in cash.The Senate\u000aAppropriations Committee sent on a measure on charter bus safety that came in\u000aresponse to the deadly Northern California bus crash that claimed the lives of\u000aseveral Los Angeles-area students, but shelved a bill that would have closed a\u000aloophole in Proposition 13 that allows some commercial properties to escape\u000areassessment if they are sold to more than one person.The focus moves now to\u000athe Senate and Assembly floors, which must pass these bills by next week to\u000akeep them alive and move them through to the next house._Times staff writer\u000aPatrick McGreevy contributed to this report._Yes, you read the headline\u000acorrectly.It's not often that the mayor of Fresno gets a chance to speak from\u000athe lectern inside the White House briefing room, let alone a Republican mayor\u000aoften talked about back home as a contender for statewide office in 2018.But\u000asuch was the case Thursday, when Mayor Ashley Swearengin praised the Obama\u000aadministration's help for communities like hers. It was Swearengin who\u000awelcomed the president on the tarmac for his Central Valley visit in\u000a2014.Swearengin's comments came in response to a question from my colleague,\u000aMichael Memoli. And while she suggested policy trumped politics, it might not\u000ahurt a GOP candidate in California to get some attention for\u000abipartisanship.Needless to say, the Obama team quickly tweeted out the\u000avideo.Lt. Gov Gavin Newsom on Thursday endorsed longtime friend and San\u000aFrancisco political ally Atty. Gen. Kamala Harris for the U.S. Senate.Newsom\u000asaid he knew Harris long before both became major Democratic political players\u000ain San Francisco -- he as mayor and Harris as district attorney."If you can\u000asurvive San Francisco politics, Washington, D.C., is a cakewalk," Newsom told\u000aa crowd of Harris supporters at her Sacramento campaign office.  \u000aNewsom, who is preparing for a 2018 bid for California governor, described\u000aHarris as an ethical and pragmatic leader, and one who cares about\u000aCalifornians.Harris was first elected attorney general in 2010, and was\u000areelected in 2014.She told supporters that, if sent to Washington, she would\u000amake education among her top priorities. She touted her efforts to combat\u000atruancy and reduce the number of high school dropouts, and also outlined her\u000aefforts to win a $20-billion settlement from the nation's top banks in the\u000awake of the foreclosure crisis.The attorney general also criticized Washington\u000apoliticians who conflate immigration policy with criminal justice\u000apolicy.Harris said the overwhelming majority of immigrants who come to the\u000aUnited States without proper documents are decent, hardworking people. "An\u000aundocumented immigrant is not a criminal," Harris said.  \u000aShe acknowledged that there are exceptions, alluding to the case of five-time\u000adeportee Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, who shot and killed 32-year-old Kate\u000aSteinle in San Francisco. If those individuals are found guilty, they should\u000abe "locked up as long as we can."Harris is the current front-runner in the\u000arace to succeed retiring Barbara Boxer in the U.S. Senate. Her biggest rival\u000ais fellow Democrat Rep. Loretta Sanchez of Orange.Miss the speech? Want to\u000aknow where Gov. Jerry Brown went off-script and what was notably absent from\u000ahis remarks? Fear not, you can read the full text of the State of the State,\u000awith helpful annotations from our Sacramento politics team, here. Read\u000amoreGov. Jerry Brown dusted off his rarely used campaign email account to send\u000asupporters a copy of his State of the State address not long after delivering\u000athe speech. The email had the subject line "California: The Great Exception"\u000aand included a prominent link to a video promoting the Sacramento-San Joaquin\u000aDelta tunnels project, which would replumb the state's water hub."One of the\u000akey points is the need for a reliable system for moving water in California,"\u000areads the email's introduction, before directing viewers to a "cool video" on\u000athe plan. The twin tunnels \u2014 a legacy project for the governor \u2014 were notably\u000anot mentioned in his address.  \u000aSpecial interest groups will have to disclose many more details of how they\u000aare spending money to influence California officials under new rules approved\u000aThursday by the state\u2019s ethics panel.Currently, corporations, labor unions and\u000aother groups must report the money they pay directly to lobbyists, along with\u000athe identity of the advocate.But the rest of the cash they spend on\u000aconsultants, television and radio campaigns, public affairs and mail is\u000areported as a lump sum in a category called "other payments to influence,"\u000awithout any explanation.\u201cThe amount of money that is being spent in the dark\u000ais extremely compelling,\u201d said state Fair Political Practices Commission\u000amember Eric Casher.The panel on Thursday voted to require, starting in July,\u000athat lobbying firms report details of any payment to influence of $2,500 per\u000acalendar quarter, including money spent on mailers, TV ads and polls.\u201cIn order\u000ato make sure people are playing by the rules, we need this type of\u000ainformation,\u201d said Jodi Remke, chairwoman of the panel. \u201cIt puts a light on\u000awhat is going on.\u201dThe newly disclosed information will include the name and\u000abusiness address of the payee, the amount paid and the primary purpose of the\u000apayment. Purposes will be disclosed by codes broadly designating activities\u000athat include:--Payments for public affairs, which includes coalition building,\u000agrass-roots campaigns,, news releases, media campaigns, literature and\u000amailings.--Polling and public opinion research:--Lobbying events, including\u000arallies or hearings to influence legislative or administrative action.--\u000aAdvertising spending, including billboards, print, radio, television, text,\u000aemail and other electronic communication.--Money paid to lobbyists and\u000aconsultants for researching, analyzing or drafting legislation, and\u000arecommending strategy on pending bills and administrative proposals.Remke said\u000athe new rules may reveal which former legislators are working behind the\u000ascenes to help clients without registering as lobbyists because they don\u2019t\u000ameet thresholds for payments received to directly communicate with elected\u000aofficials.Remke made reference, without using names, to former state Sen.\u000aMichael Rubio (D-Bakersfield) and former state Assemblyman Henry Perea\u000a(D-Fresno), who resigned from the Legislature to go to work in the government\u000aaffairs offices of Chevron and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers\u000aof America, respectively. \u201cI think we are going to get [disclosure of] the\u000apeople like the former members who leave the Legislature early, join Chevron,\u000ajoin the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers, but call themselves\u000agovernment relations advocates,\u201d Remke said. \u201cBut we know what they are doing.\u000aThey are exposing their clients to the [legislative] members and doing other\u000athings short of direct communication.\u201d"Water goes to the heart of what\u000aCalifornia is and what it has been over centuries," Gov. Jerry Brown said\u000aduring his State of the State speech. "Pitting fish against farmer misses the\u000apoint and grossly distorts reality."  \u000aGov. Jerry Brown began his State of the State address with an off-script joke\u000aabout his long run as California's governor."Three more years to go. That is,\u000aunless I take my surplus campaign funds and put a ballot initiative on the\u000aNovember ballot to allow fourth-term governors to seek a final fifth term,"\u000aBrown said.  \u000aIn a short speech with a long view of California, Gov. Jerry Brown used his\u000aState of the State address to challenge lawmakers to better balance the\u000acyclical nature of success and setback that has dominated state government for\u000athe better part of two decades."The challenge is to solve today's problems\u000awithout making those of tomorrow even worse," the governor said in his annual\u000aspeech delivered from the Assembly chamber.Read moreHere at the state Capitol\u000awe often think we have more control over things than we actually do. But the\u000atruth is that global events, markets and policies set the pace and shape the\u000aworld we live in.Take a look back at Gov. Jerry Brown's life in politics.\u000a\u000a

VContinuous television coverage of violent mass shootings is pulling at hearts,\u000abut not changing minds.In June, nine people killed at Emanuel African\u000aMethodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C. In October, nine dead and nine\u000ainjured in a shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon. This week,14\u000apeople shot to death and 21 injured at a holiday party in San Bernardino.Every\u000atragedy is accompanied by hours of graphic video images of the wounded and\u000agrieving survivors. The law enforcement news conferences have become a\u000afamiliar and dispiriting tableau.Has the proliferation of incidents and the\u000arelentless televised coverage had any affect on public opinion?Analysts say\u000athe parade of violence has only served to harden feelings on both sides in the\u000abattle over the gun control issue. Gun control advocates say the shootings\u000aunderline the need to get guns off the streets; gun rights advocates say they\u000ashow the need for Americans to be armed to protect themselves."It certainly\u000ariles people up," said John Donohue, a law professor at Stanford Law School.\u000a"The question is, does it push views in either direction, or does it entrench\u000apeople more in their current views?"Public opinion polls have reflected the\u000adeep divide on the gun control issue. Following the Umpqua shooting, a Gallup\u000apoll showed that 55% felt that laws covering the sale of firearms should be\u000amore strict, while 11% thought they should be less strict and 33% believed\u000athey should be kept as they are. In contrast, shortly after the Columbine High\u000aSchool massacre in Colorado in 1999, 66% were in favor of stricter laws."The\u000acall for tougher gun control is actually short-lived," James Alan Fox, Lipman\u000aprofessor of criminology, law and public policy at Northeastern University.\u000a"You can see on Gallup polls asking [about] tougher gun control that it spikes\u000aafter certain cases, but it goes back down. And there are some people think we\u000ahave the right gun laws, but we just need to enforce them."Franklin E.\u000aZimring, a law professor at UC Berkeley, noted that mass shootings haven't\u000achanged the intensity of support versus opposition at the national level in a\u000away that translates into legislation. President Obama has called for tighter\u000agun control measures, but Congress remains deeply divided over the issue."The\u000areason that gun control laws do or don't pass is not so much the number of\u000apeople for or against it, but how deeply they feel," Zimring said. "And for\u000apro-gun, anti-more-control folks, it's much more important to them \u2014 they care\u000amore deeply about their cause \u2014 than the average citizen."In an earlier era of\u000atelevision, the constant barrage of news footage from the Vietnam War helped\u000aturn public opinion against U.S. military involvement. But the division over\u000agun laws is so intense that any television commentators looking to make the\u000aissue a crusade do so at their own risk.On Friday morning, up to 100\u000ajournalists began rummaging around the house formerly occupied by the married\u000acouple who carried out a mass shooting on Wednesday in San Bernardino.And as\u000athat bizarre scene was playing out live on TV, critics \u2014 on Twitter and\u000aelsewhere \u2014 let out a collective yowl.On Friday morning, up to 100 journalists\u000abegan rummaging around the house formerly occupied by the married couple who\u000acarried out a mass shooting on Wednesday in San Bernardino.And as that bizarre\u000ascene was playing out live on TV, critics \u2014 on Twitter and elsewhere \u2014 let out\u000aa collective yowl.When British journalist Piers Morgan had a nightly CNN\u000aprogram, he called for an assault weapons ban after the 2012 slaughter of 20\u000aelementary school children in Newtown, Conn. He covered the story for seven\u000aconsecutive nights, often stiff-arming the gun control opponents who appeared\u000aas guests. It prompted a petition to the White House with 80,000 signatures\u000agathered by pro-gun activists that called for Morgan's deportation."If the\u000akillings of elementary schoolchildren at Newtown did not galvanize the public\u000aaround the issue, it's not quite clear what it's going to take," said Andrew\u000aHeyward, former president of CBS News and currently a research affiliate for\u000athe Laboratory for Social Machines at MIT. "Even if the issue takes great\u000aprominence, which I think it will, there are diametrically different points of\u000aview on how to deal with gun violence, including arming citizens so they can\u000ashoot the shooters before cops get there."A fragmented media environment makes\u000ait less likely for any single individual media outlet or commentator to\u000ainfluence the debate on gun control measures. "No one owns the airwaves like\u000aWalter Cronkite did when he spoke to 30 million people," said Joe Peyronnin, a\u000aHofstra University journalism professor who worked with the legendary anchor\u000aat CBS. "There is no single voice that can stand up and make a call to action\u000aas a journalist. There is a lot of division around this and it's not an issue\u000aof government distrust."Donna Dees Thomases, a former television publicity\u000aexecutive and longtime gun control activist, said the reflex of TV news is to\u000apresent the causes of gun violence as a polarizing issue that requires\u000adiscussion rather than a problem that needs resolution."I think by always\u000aframing it as a debate might be good for ratings or make you feel like you're\u000adoing fair and balanced coverage," she said. "But I don't think it's creating\u000aa public service. This is a story that needs to be told constantly, over and\u000aover again, without a mass shooting and having a bogus debate."The New York\u000aDaily News took such an approach with its blaring front page last week that\u000acalled out political leaders \u2014 all of them Republican \u2014 for offering prayers\u000afor the San Bernardino victims but no call for action on gun control. "God\u000aIsn't Fixing This" read the headline that became a talking point throughout\u000acable news coverage of the massacre's aftermath.Daily News editor-in-chief Jim\u000aRich did not see his tabloid's front page as advocacy."When one side of an\u000aissue is so consistently lacking or predictable or in many cases duplicitous,\u000ait's difficult to adhere to a traditional line in the sand as far as what's\u000abeing objective and what's being subjective," he said. "Right now we're\u000acalling it exactly the way it is." The New York Times may have taken its cue\u000afrom the Daily News on Saturday with a call for stricter gun laws in its first\u000afront-page editorial since 1920.Heyward believes any shift in opinion will\u000aprobably be driven by social media platforms rather than traditional TV news.\u000aCoverage of San Bernardino turned to the terrorist links of the husband-and-\u000awife shooting team Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik by Friday afternoon,\u000aas viewers were transfixed by a media tour of their apartment."As TV networks\u000amove on to the next story, which will they inevitably do, it will be\u000ainteresting to see if social media interest in guns moves up," Heyward said.\u000a"That would be a better measure."**MORE ON SAN BERNARDINO SHOOTING****San\u000aBernardino residents are weary and on edge after a traumatic week****Islamic\u000aState calls San Bernardino shooters 'supporters' as terrorism probe\u000acontinues****Tashfeen Malik: A onetime 'modern girl' who managed to avoid\u000adetection before mass shooting**\u000a\u000a

He was remarkably nonchalant when I picked him up.\u000a\u201cIt was just a Level One,\u201d he said, brushing off my concerns. \u201cEverything's\u000afine now.\u201dIt wasn't, in fact; the horror was still unfolding and would come\u000aeven closer to home that afternoon, when law enforcement found a veritable\u000aarsenal in the assailants' Redlands townhouse. But I recognized my son's need\u000ato normalize what had happened.I listened attentively as he explained the\u000adifference in lockdown levels: A Level One is when an active shooter is in the\u000atown or city; a Level Two is when the shooter is in the neighborhood; and a\u000aLevel Three is when the shooter is actually on campus.During a Level One, my\u000ason explained, teachers lock their classroom doors and lower the blinds. Some\u000acontinue with the day's lesson plans. Others choose to take the more extreme\u000ameasures required during a Level Two or Three. They turn off the lights and\u000ainstruct the kids to turn off their cellphones. They ask everyone to gather\u000asilently in the corner of the room farthest from the door and windows.Once\u000athey're given the all-clear signal, teachers may take additional time away\u000afrom instruction to discuss what just happened, knowing that it's hard for\u000akids to snap right back to Latin or biology when they've just been\u000acontemplating a shooter on the loose.I may be 33 years my son's senior, but in\u000amany ways he's more worldly. When I was in high school in the San Fernando\u000aValley in the 1980s, the terms \u201cactive shooter,\u201d \u201clockdown\u201d and \u201cshelter in\u000aplace\u201d weren't buzzwords. \u201cActive shooter\u201d entered the lexicon not long after\u000athe Columbine massacre in 1999. \u201cLockdown\u201d has been around longer, but until\u000arecently was most commonly used in prisons.It now appears, as some had\u000apredicted from the start, that the husband and wife who carried out the brutal\u000amassacre in San Bernardino were motivated at least in part by Islamic\u000aextremism. According to the FBI, Tashfeen Malik \u2014 who, with her husband, Syed\u000aRizwan Farook, killed 14 people and injured...It now appears, as some had\u000apredicted from the start, that the husband and wife who carried out the brutal\u000amassacre in San Bernardino were motivated at least in part by Islamic\u000aextremism. According to the FBI, Tashfeen Malik \u2014 who, with her husband, Syed\u000aRizwan Farook, killed 14 people and injured...In the wake of the Sandy Hook\u000aattack, the Department of Education released guidelines for school emergency\u000aplans. Specific requirements vary by state. California's Education Code\u000adoesn't mandate \u201cactive shooter\u201d exercises but does expect school districts to\u000adevelop comprehensive safety procedures for each campus. Some schools around\u000athe country, eager to stay ahead of the curve, have taken it upon themselves\u000ato stage simulations complete with uniformed officers, fake blood and student\u000aactors. Sometimes schools announce drills in advance; sometimes not. The goal\u000ais to minimize the \u201cfreeze\u201d response, which can prove fatal. Instead,\u000aparticipants learn to \u201cRun, Hide, Fight.\u201dI get it: Preparedness is key. But\u000athere are possible downsides to these morbid war games. For starters, we don't\u000aknow how kids may respond to them in the long term. (There's little research\u000aon the subject.) And they scare the hell out of the community. An \u201cactive\u000ashooter\u201d drill at an Irvine elementary school in August was realistic enough\u000athat surprised neighbors called the police. Responding officers were unaware\u000aof the drill.Our schools are confronting the new normal through preparations\u000athat would once have seemed ridiculous. At my daughter's elementary school,\u000athe Parent Teacher Assn. voted to buy portable toilets and privacy curtains\u000afor kids to use during lockdowns. It was a prudent decision. After the\u000aschool's last lockdown, my daughter told me that a fellow second-grader had to\u000apee in a trash can, shielded by a flip chart the teacher set up to provide\u000aprivacy.Somehow, we've gotten to the point in California where, like\u000aearthquakes, school shootings are an acknowledged part of our kids' lives.Each\u000aOctober, the state goes all out publicizing the Great California ShakeOut. The\u000achirpy online \u201cShakeOut Shop\u201d offers T-shirts, coffee mugs and buttons\u000areminding Californians to \u201cDrop, Cover and Hold On\u201d in the event of an\u000aearthquake. Can a similarly upbeat \u201cBullet-Wise\u201d preparedness day be far\u000abehind?Teaching kids to \u201cRun, Hide, Fight\u201d reinforces the nihilistic view that\u000amass shootings are inevitable, diverting energy from the struggle to stop\u000athem. Instead of crafting catchy phrases to help kids stay safe in the event\u000aof an atrocity, we should work toward stronger gun ownership background checks\u000aand assault-weapon restrictions. We need more than preparedness; we need\u000aprevention._Lisa Lewis is a writer based in Redlands.

VPresident Obama addressed the nation from the Oval Office on Sunday night\u000ahoping to reassure anxious Americans that his administration has a strategy to\u000adefeat Islamic State overseas, and to protect Americans from the threat of\u000ahomegrown terrorism.But the 13-minute speech underscored the magnitude of the\u000achallenge and the dearth of options for the White House.Obama revealed no new\u000aideas or plans for dismantling Islamic State, and he again ruled out sending a\u000alarge force of U.S. ground troops to fight in the Middle East.President Obama\u000aspeaks from the Oval Office on Sunday. (Address begins at about\u000a28:50.)President Obama speaks from the Oval Office on Sunday. (Address begins\u000aat about 28:50.)The strategy he did present \u2014 more drone strikes, more special\u000aforces, more FBI investigations \u2014 pointed to a long-term struggle rather than\u000aa decisive victory any time soon.Standing before the oaken Resolute desk, the\u000aultimate bully pulpit, Obama insisted that the U.S.-led military coalition is\u000amaking progress at whittling away the vast territory Islamic State controls in\u000aIraq and Syria, and at choking off the group's illicit revenue sources.But he\u000aalso acknowledged the group had dramatically expanded its reach in recent\u000aweeks by sponsoring or inspiring attacks around the globe, including killing\u000a130 people in Paris, downing a Russian plane over Egypt, shooting up a hotel\u000ain Mali, and using suicide bombs in Lebanon, Libya and Yemen.Obama paid\u000aspecial tribute to the 14 people killed in San Bernardino on Wednesday, noting\u000athat the two killers were lured \u201cdown the dark path of radicalization.\u201d\u201cThis\u000awas an act of terrorism designed to kill innocent people,\u201d he said.He argued\u000athat Islamic State is like no terrorist group in the past. It has drawn about\u000a30,000 foreign fighters, uses encrypted apps and software to avoid detection,\u000aand uses social media and the Internet to exhort followers to launch attacks\u000ain their home countries.He described the group as \u201cthugs and killers, part of\u000aa cult of death.\u201d He urged Muslims \u201cto decisively and unequivocally reject the\u000ahateful ideology.\u201dBut he didn't assign new resources to address that\u000achallenge. He instead offered a defense of his current strategy, suggested\u000amodest adjustments to existing programs and called on Congress to pass laws it\u000ais unlikely to approve.Obama said, for example, that he's ordered the State\u000aDepartment and Homeland Security to review the K-1 visa program, known as the\u000afiance visa, that allowed Pakistani-born Tashfeen Malik \u2014 one of the two\u000ashooters in San Bernardino \u2014 to enter the country in 2014.He repeated his\u000acalls for new gun-control laws since, he said, history has shown that law\u000aenforcement \u201ccannot identify every would-be shooter.\u201d But he has urged\u000aCongress to pass stiffer gun laws to no avail after every mass killing.He also\u000aurged Congress to draft a new authorization for the use of military force\u000aspecifically targeting Islamic State. The Pentagon told Congress as recently\u000aas Wednesday that it doesn't need new authorization to go after the\u000agroup.Obama also said he would urge tech companies to cooperate more with law\u000aenforcement to \u201cmake it harder for terrorists to use technology to escape from\u000ajustice.\u201d Silicon Valley has largely resisted efforts to give the government\u000abackdoor access to encryption.He argued that the success of U.S. efforts to\u000adetect or disrupt complicated plots since Sept. 11, 2001, has given rise to\u000athe current crop of \u201cless complicated acts of violence,\u201d like the attack in\u000aSan Bernardino.\u201cThe terrorist threat has evolved into a new phase,\u201d Obama\u000asaid. White House aides say that the FBI has arrested so many people \u2014 at\u000aleast 56 this year \u2014 that the group's followers have grown more secretive and\u000athus more dangerous.Obama insisted he is using \u201cevery aspect of American\u000apower\u201d to battle and ultimately eliminate the group.\u201cThe threat from terrorism\u000ais real, but we will overcome it. We will destroy ISIL and any other\u000aorganization that tries to harm us,\u201d he said, using an acronym for Islamic\u000aState.He added a swipe at his critics: \u201cOur success won't depend on tough\u000atalk, or abandoning our values, or giving in to fear.\u201dEarlier Sunday, Donald\u000aTrump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, reiterated\u000ahis call to profile American Muslims.\u201cI want real vigilance,\u201d he said on CBS'\u000a\u201cFace the Nation,\u201d \u201cwhether it's mosques or whatever it has to be.\u201dOther\u000aRepublicans said the president missed an important opportunity to clearly\u000adefine the threat and retool his strategy.\u201cWe are not winning the war against\u000aISIL, and the threat of terrorism against our homeland is real and growing,\u201d\u000aSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said in\u000aa statement. \u201cAs the president said, America should never give in to fear. But\u000aneither should we fear to acknowledge the nature and severity of the threats\u000awe face and do everything within our power to confront them.\u201dObama hasn't\u000alacked for opportunities recently to try to convince Americans that he has a\u000astrategy for beating Islamic State.Since the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris, the\u000apresident has spoken with reporters no fewer than 30 times, including at four\u000anews conferences where counter-terrorism was a dominant theme.The president's\u000adecision to speak Sunday night was an acknowledgment that his message was not\u000agetting through. He last addressed the nation from the Oval Office five years\u000aago, when he announced his plan to withdraw all U.S. combat troops from\u000aIraq.In the view of his aides, Obama's message on terrorism has been drowned\u000aout by the heated rhetoric of Republicans vying to replace him next year, and\u000aby the president's own insistence on pressing ahead with other priorities,\u000aincluding global warming and the so-called pivot to Asia.The calculus changed\u000aafter the San Bernardino attack, the deadliest terrorist incident on U.S. soil\u000asince Sept. 11, 2001.The president decided late Friday to deliver a major\u000aaddress to \u201cprovide the American people with a clear sense of how we need to\u000adeal with this threat as a country,\u201d a senior administration official said\u000aSunday.**Follow @mikememoli for more White House coverage.****Times staff\u000awriters Lisa Mascaro and W.J.

VThe money spent by megacities to adapt to climate change appears to be linked\u000amore to protecting valuable capital and less to protecting vulnerable people,\u000anew research suggests.That trend means cities in developing nations may be\u000apoorly equipped to protect residents against future health, environmental and\u000aeconomic effects of living on a warming planet, according to a study published\u000aMonday in the journal Nature Climate Change.\u201cCurrent adaptation activities are\u000ainsufficient in major population centers in developing and emerging\u000aeconomies,\u201d the study authors wrote.Humans have been increasingly moving into\u000acities \u2014 half the world\u2019s population now lives in them. Although cities are\u000agreat for concentrating people and resources, they\u2019re also vulnerable to\u000arising sea levels, extreme weather events and other changes associated with\u000aclimate change. The complex array of effects also includes rising demand for\u000aenergy and a growing scarcity of water.To exacerbate matters, experts say\u000athese effects will be disproportionately visited upon people whose lives are\u000amost unstable.\u201cCities in developing countries are thought to be even more\u000avulnerable to climate change owing to widespread poverty, lack of\u000ainfrastructure, unplanned informal settlements and a lack of spending on\u000aadaptation,\u201d wrote the study authors, a University of College London-led team\u000aof British researchers.Scientists who flew an airplane equipped with sensors\u000athrough the plume of natural gas leaking into the Porter Ranch area have found\u000athat at its peak, the nearly four-month leak released roughly 100,000 tons of\u000amethane \u2014 effectively doubling the methane emissions rate of the entire Los\u000aAngeles...Scientists who flew an airplane equipped with sensors through the\u000aplume of natural gas leaking into the Porter Ranch area have found that at its\u000apeak, the nearly four-month leak released roughly 100,000 tons of methane \u2014\u000aeffectively doubling the methane emissions rate of the entire Los Angeles...To\u000atry to get a handle on what that urban response to climate change looks like,\u000athe team focused on 10 of the world\u2019s megacities \u2014 those with populations\u000aexceeding 3 million, or with a gross domestic product (GDP) that puts it in\u000athe top 25 of cities \u2014 and analyzed how much money they spent on measures to\u000aadapt to climate change effects.The diverse metropolitan roster, picked on the\u000abasis of  size, location and developmental status, included: London, Paris,\u000aNew York, Mexico City, Beijing, Sao Paulo in Brazil, Mumbai in India, Jakarta\u000ain Indonesia, Lagos in Nigeria and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia.\u201cIt is important to\u000astudy a range of cities in different regions of the world, with different\u000aclimates and at different states of socioeconomic development,\u201d the study\u000aauthors explained. \u201cAlthough, in economic terms, disaster losses from weather,\u000aclimate and geophysical events are greater in developed countries, fatalities\u000aand economic losses as a proportion of GDP are higher in developing\u000acountries.\u201dThe numbers showed a high contrast between cities in more\u000aeconomically advanced countries and those in developing nations. New York\u000aspent $2.26 billion (0.22% of its city GDP), while Addis Ababa spent  $21\u000amillion (0.14% of its city GDP).In fact, essentially all the wealthy cities\u000aspent about 0.22% of their city GDP on measures responding to climate change,\u000awhile the developing cities mostly spent around 0.16%. (The exception was\u000aBeijing, which spent 0.33% of its city GDP, or $1.19 billion).Sliced another\u000away, Paris spent the most per person ($553.76), while Addis Ababa spent the\u000aleast ($6.56), followed closely by Lagos ($7.69).\u201cThe evidence seems to\u000asuggest that current adaptation responses may be largely influenced by market-\u000abased responses to protecting physical capital, rather than at-risk\u000apopulations,\u201d the study authors concluded. The findings highlight a need to\u000ashift the focus to protecting the people who will bear the brunt of climate\u000achange\u2019s effects, they wrote.**Follow @aminawrite on Twitter for more science\u000anews and "like" Los Angeles Times Science &amp; Health on Facebook.**\u000a\u000a

VAt the 88th Academy Awards, "Spotlight," the film about the Boston Globe's\u000ainvestigation into priest abuse, won for best picture. Leonardo DiCaprio,\u000aheavily favored to win for lead actor, was not disappointed in his fifth\u000achance to take home an Oscar for acting. His director, Alejandro G. Iñárritu,\u000ahad just gotten his second directing win in a row for "The Revenant." The film\u000acame into the night with the most nominations at 12 and won three.Overall,\u000a"Mad Max: Fury Road" has the most bragging rights, with six statuettes from 10\u000anods in total.The major upset of the evening was Sylvester Stallone's loss to\u000aMark Rylance of "Bridge of Spies" for supporting actor.  \u000aHost Chris Rock kicked off the 2016 Oscars with a highly anticipated monologue\u000aamid the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, taking multiple jabs at Hollywood's\u000aculture.  \u000aCheck out the intimate moments on the 2016 Academy Awards red carpet. When\u000acomedian Chris Rock took to the Dolby Theatre stage to start the Oscars\u000atelecast Sunday night, the track \u201cFight the Power\u201d by rap group Public Enemy\u000aplayed in the background. That same song, used by Spike Lee to cap his seminal\u000afilm \u201cDo the Right Thing,\u201d also played at the end of the show as the credits\u000arolled. Both instances were a reminder, comedic or otherwise, to keep pushing\u000afor greater diversity prompted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and\u000aSciences' mostly white list of nominees for a second year in a row. And\u000afighting the power is what the #OscarsSoWhite movement plans to continue\u000adoing.Here are the ways some proponents of increased diversity believe the\u000aconversation can continue now that awards season is over.**April Reign,\u000acreator of #OscarsSoWhite:**  \u000a\u201cI would encourage everybody to be more mindful of the movies on which they\u000aspend their hard earned money. If the cast does not look like them, does not\u000arepresent their stories, perhaps choose not to see their films and instead\u000aseek out stories that tell the diversity and the beauty and nuance of all\u000apeople.\u201d**Gil Robertson, president of the African American Film Critics\u000aAssn.:**  \u000a\u201cI want to see the putting together of a multicultural group of journalists to\u000acontinue this conversation. It's important that we do that because the way the\u000aconversation has been had traditionally is in black and white terms. I think\u000ait is important that we encourage our Hispanic and Asian and other brothers\u000aand sisters to also be vocal, and to give them room to be vocal. We need to\u000awork collaboratively to see results.\u201d**  \u000a**Read moreGirl Scouts, giggles and little gold men set the tone in the wings of the Dolby Theatre stage at the Oscars, where presenters and performers settled their nerves and celebrated their victories.Read moreComedian Chris Rock came out swinging, at least in regard to his music choices. Rock's walk-on song was Public Enemy's "Fight the Power," a song tied to Spike Lee's 1989 film "Do the Right Thing." Many looked to Rock to address the lack of diversity in Hollywood and at the Oscars, and he did so before even saying a word, choosing a song that still feels revolutionary. Read moreDuring a comedy bit on the 88th Academy Awards Sunday night, Chris Rock said he trekked to a Compton movie theater to interview black moviegoers about largely white Oscar contenders.The resulting segment got big laughs as Rock asked cinema fans if they had seen, or even heard of, movies like "The Big Short," "Brooklyn" and "Bridge of Spies."But there was one problem with the routine \u2014 that theater isn't in Compton. Rock's video, filmed about a week before the ceremony, actually took place in front of the Rave Cinema 15 (formerly Magic Johnson Theatres) at Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. In fact, as the Los Angeles Times has reported, Compton doesn't even have a movie theater within its city limits, and it hasn't in decades.Read moreNo real surprise here, the most popular Instagram videos to be created on Oscars night include a celebrity puppy, Cate Blanchett and her diamonds, Reese Witherspoon doing shots, and Diddy instructing his followers on how to keep their "glows." Let's shine together. View the rest of the videos here.Read moreDespite an Academy Awards ceremony focused on addressing issues of diversity in Hollywood, Asian Americans expressed outrage on social media after two jokes that poked at stereotypes. The comments, one by host Chris Rock during a skit and another by comedic actor Sacha Baron Cohen under his Ali G persona, were particularly notable due to the controversy surrounding the #OscarsSoWhite theme.Rock's skit drew the most ire. In a rehearsed bit involving the tabulation of Academy Awards votes, he introduced the would-be PriceWaterhouseCoopers representatives overseeing the count. \u201cThey sent us their most dedicated, accurate and hard-working representatives," he said. "Please welcome Ming Zhu, Bao Ling and David Moskowitz."Three kids of Asian descent, dressed in suits and carrying briefcases, walked toward center stage. Following a muted response from the crowd, Rock added: "If anybody\u2019s upset about that joke, just tweet about it on your phone that was also made by these kids." And react they did, many wondering how the gag made it out of the writers room.Read morePatricia Clarkson, sitting on a couch bleary-eyed at the late hour, seemed amused by the gaggle of tall, pretty girls. Less concerned was "Love" star Gillian Jacobs, who was hanging out with "Game of Thrones" star Emilia Clarke.Jacobs was more interested in getting some beignets. While waiting for her ride, she grabbed a bag of the Bouchon donuts \u2014 guests were given to-go packets upon exiting \u2014 and tossed a few in her mouth. And that's how you end an award season right.Read the full Vanity Fair party recap here. As established over the last few months of #OscarsSoWhite coverage and controversy, Hollywood diversity is an issue that inspires much passion within the entertainment industry and beyond.But matters of diversity aren\u2019t a trending topic, they\u2019re a conversation that\u2019s been going on for decades. Even in Hollywood. Even at the Oscars.At the 49th Academy Awards held in 1977, 39 years ago, Richard Pryor (after a seven-minute interpretive song-and-dance number by Ann-Margret) opened the Oscars with a searing monologue that lampooned the lack of African American representation at the awards while a primarily white audience nervously tittered.In 1988, 11 years after Pryor\u2019s monologue, the academy invited Eddie Murphy, one of the biggest box-office stars of the decade, to award the ceremony\u2019s crown jewel, best picture. But before Murphy got down to business, he went off book and told the story of how he originally wanted to turn down the offer from the academy.Watch both speeches here. Read moreFor as much was written speculating about what this year\u2019s Chris Rock-hosted Oscars might look like, it\u2019s doubtful many prognosticators predicted an appearance of Black History Month\u2019s sworn enemy Stacey Dash.Dash, best known for her work in 1995\u2019s \u201cClueless,\u201d now spends her days as a cultural contributor for Fox News, where she was suspended in December 2015 for using profanity in reference to President Obama while on the air. More recently, Dash stoked the flames of controversy with statements in response to the #OscarsSoWhite controversy that suggested that BET and Black History Month should be done away with in the interest of equality.So when Dash took the stage at Sunday\u2019s Oscars, under the guise of \u201cdirector of minority outreach,\u201d the joke didn\u2019t just flail, it sank like a stone.Read moreI mean, it's my eighth time losing. I didn't think I'd lose this time. I mean, that's the best performance I've ever seen in my life. That's like an Oscar moment of all time. I guess I'm just the perennial loser. I mean, it's like everybody is talking about it. That and Stallone. It's really weird.  \u000aOne of the most urgent questions going into Sunday's Academy Awards ceremony\u000awas just how host Chris Rock would handle the gig, and particularly how he\u000awould address the ongoing #OscarsSoWhite controversy. Critics generally\u000apraised Rock for addressing the issue so directly, even if not all the jokes\u000aworked. Here's a look at reactions:Writing for The Times, television critic\u000aMary McNamara argued that although Rock didn't land every joke, he encouraged\u000aa bit of reflection on what is typically a night for the film industry to pat\u000aitself on the back. "For all its flaws, Rock's Oscars had some of the most\u000apowerful moments seen in the telecast's history. His decision to honestly\u000aanswer the question 'Is Hollywood racist?' was brave and effective," she said.\u000a"If Hollywood believes, as it should, that film is a medium of truth-telling\u000aand a catalyst for change, then moments of self-examination should occur at\u000aleast as often as those of celebration."New York Times TV critic James\u000aPoniewozik noted that having Rock, who was hired before the diversity flap\u000abegan, emcee the ceremony "was a lucky pairing of host and subject." His\u000aperformance was "evenhanded without being wishy-washy" and represented "an\u000aexample of something the industry is still trying to learn: that you can\u000aachieve both inclusion and entertainment by giving the right person just the\u000aright opportunity."That being said: What was with the bizarre appearance by\u000aStacey Dash?Read moreAnticipation of Chris Rock's no-holds-barred commentary\u000aat the 88th Academy Awards ceremony did not boost to the overnight ratings for\u000aSunday's telecast on ABCBased on Nielsen\u2019s overnight data from 56 large U.S.\u000aTV markets, the telecast averaged a 23.4 rating and a 36% share of the homes\u000ausing television from 8:30 p.m. to 11:51 p.m. EST, when the last commercial\u000abreak aired.That's down 6% when compared with the 24.9 rating from the\u000aovernight data for 2015.Read moreIt was a year of two films. Until it\u000awasn't.It was the year "Spotlight," the third film on everyone's list of top-\u000athree finishers, came from behind and walked off with the best picture\u000atrophy.So what did \u201cSpotlight\u201d have that \u201cThe Big Short\u201d did not? Three\u000athings:It not only provided work for a lot of actors, it featured an actor\u000a(Tom McCarthy) who also co-wrote and directed. As \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d proved\u000ayears ago, actors, a big chunk of academy members, like to see actors\u000abranching out.Read moreFor all its flaws, Rock's Oscars had some of the most\u000apowerful moments seen in the telecast's history.The 2016 Oscars telecast was a\u000ahot mess, but it certainly wasn't boring.An event most often criticized for\u000abeing self-indulgent and self-congratulatory \u2014 so over-long, repetitive and\u000apredictable that the host is all but required to joke about its absurdity \u2014\u000athis year's Academy Awards was a strange compilation of atonal moments in\u000awhich the audience was kept perpetually off balance. Host Chris Rock called\u000aHollywood out on its racism and then sent his daughters out to sell Girl Scout\u000acookies. The mood whipsawed from the shocking to the familiar and back again,\u000aoften in the space of a few moments.Read moreThey parted ways on that sinking\u000aship back in 1997, but lately Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have been\u000aback together in an awards season that's gone on and on. After both actors won\u000aGolden Globes in January and British Academy Film Awards in mid-February (his\u000aas lead actor in "The Revenant," hers as supporting actress in "Steve Jobs"),\u000amany fans were hoping for the ultimate "Titanic" recoupling at the Oscars.\u000aWinslet, however, lost the Oscar to Alicia Vikander ("The Danish Girl"). But\u000awhen DiCaprio won his Oscar, he found Winslet backstage. They embraced. They\u000akissed. And for one brief moment it was as if Jack and Rose had never drifted\u000aapart. The 88th Academy Awards at the Dolby Theatre wasn\u2019t without a plethora\u000aof standout accessories and sartorial details worth a second look, including\u000athe red silk flower of Oscar winner Jared Leto\u2019s festive Gucci ensemble and\u000athe feathers of Oscar winner Cate Blanchett\u2019s Armani Privé seafoam green gown.\u000aAnd how could we forget Academy Award winner Whoopi Goldberg\u2019s bold jewelry?\u000aHere\u2019s a look at what style accessories, details and accompanying fashion\u000aselections stood out on the red carpet.Read moreBringing an end to an\u000aunpredictable and tumultuous Oscar race, the newsroom drama \u201cSpotlight\u201d took\u000ahome the top prize for best picture at the 88th Academy Awards, emerging\u000avictorious in what had widely been seen as a three-way race with the brutal\u000afrontier epic \u201cThe Revenant\u201d and the financial crisis dramedy \u201cThe Big\u000aShort.\u201dLeonardo DiCaprio won his first Academy Award \u2014 after four previous\u000aacting nominations \u2014 for his starring role as a man who survives a vicious\u000agrizzly bear attack in \u201cThe Revenant.\u201d Brie Larson earned the lead actress\u000aprize for her performance as a mother who has spent much of her life in\u000acaptivity in the drama \u201cRoom.\u201dThe evening marked the climax of one of the most\u000acontroversial Oscar seasons in Hollywood history, as a bitter debate over the\u000alack of any acting nominees of color for the second year in a row roiled the\u000aAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.Unlike in many previous years, no\u000asingle film dominated the night, as academy voters spread their love around to\u000aa wide range of contenders.  \u000aRead moreThe art of the quick change is a Hollywood staple. And many of the\u000aOscars ceremony audience members showcased entirely new looks at the Vanity\u000aFair Oscar party. Mindy Kaling traded in her long, blue train for a Salvador\u000aPerez original.Kerry Washington switched from a custom Atelier Versace gown to\u000aa backless number.And Sofia Vergara wore Marchesa to the ceremony but traded\u000athat in for something white for the night.\u000a\u000a

VThe Zika virus sweeping across South America may be only one of several long-\u000adormant infections that will resurface in coming years because of climate\u000achange and deforestation, says a Johns Hopkins University neurologist now\u000aleading research efforts in Colombia, one of the countries hardest hit by the\u000adisease.According to Dr. Carlos Pardo Villamizar, warmer climates may have\u000atriggered the emergence and subsequent spread of the Zika virus by making more\u000aof the world habitable for the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, its main carrier.\u000aHigher temperatures and dryness have been linked to the spread of another\u000amosquito-borne illness, dengue, and deforestation is thought to be a cause of\u000athe most recent Ebola outbreak in Africa.**See the most-read stories this hour\u000a&gt;&gt;**The neurologist suspects that Zika, which so far has struck 42,000\u000aColombians, may also have caused other complications, including a 50% increase\u000ain Guillain-Barre, a nervous system disorder causing partial paralysis. There\u000ahave been no reported cases in Colombia of newborns with microcephaly, or\u000aabnormally small heads, as seen in Brazil. But Colombia's more than 6,600\u000aZika-infected pregnant women are being monitored.**The Zika epidemic \u2013 why\u000anow?**Although Zika was discovered in the 1940s, it remained dormant for many\u000adecades, reappearing in Micronesia about 10 years ago. Since then it has\u000aslowly spread to other areas of the world. But no one paid any attention to it\u000auntil now because there was no epidemiological problem, no great outbreak of\u000athe virus. "Why now?" is a matter of ecology and environment.Zika is a virus\u000atransmitted primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, a\u000aspecies that also spreads dengue and yellow fever. Declaring a threat of\u000a\u201calarming proportions,\u201d the head of the World Health Organization warned Jan.\u000a28 that the Zika virus is \u201cspreading explosively\u201d across...Zika is a virus\u000atransmitted primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito, a\u000aspecies that also spreads dengue and yellow fever. Declaring a threat of\u000a\u201calarming proportions,\u201d the head of the World Health Organization warned Jan.\u000a28 that the Zika virus is \u201cspreading explosively\u201d across...**Is it inevitable\u000athat Zika will come to the U.S.?**The magnitude of the problem we are seeing\u000ain South America will not be seen in the United States because the mosquito\u000acannot live in the majority of the U.S. Parts of the South could be\u000avulnerable, but the ecology of most of the U.S. is not conducive to the\u000apresence of the _Aedes aegypti_ mosquito, which is the main vector, or\u000acarrier, of Zika.**What makes the disease so threatening?**The mother\u2019s\u000aexposure to the virus in the early stages of pregnancy could lead to\u000amicrocephaly in a small subset of patients. But the fetus is potentially\u000avulnerable to neurological complications at any stage of pregnancy. It\u2019s very\u000apossible that viral infections in later stages of pregnancy could lead to\u000afuture developmental disorders for the child in the future, such as epilepsy\u000aand learning and language disabilities. The spectrum of neurological problems\u000athat could emerge is quite wide.**What makes the Zika virus so potentially\u000aharmful to newborns?**In a subset of victims, Zika triggers a change in their\u000aimmune systems. It seems to produce a kind of cross-attack against the nervous\u000asystem. We suspect the virus may have the direct capability to attack the\u000abrain and spinal cord. Scientists in the 1950s experimenting with animals were\u000aable to demonstrate that Zika targeted neurons, the cellular elements of the\u000abrain and spinal cord.**You say that Zika\u2019s apparent role in promoting\u000aGuillain-Barre disease is as worrisome, if not more so, than microcephaly.\u000aWhy?**I have just come from seeing a Guillain-Barre patient here in Cali and\u000ait is horrible to see how they are left weak and incapacitated. It can be\u000adevastating for them and for caregivers. It is a temporary condition in most\u000acases, but it is very aggressive and some will be incapacitated for the rest\u000aof their lives. Patients can be left with a lot of consequences, such as\u000aatrophy of muscles and a deficit in sensations.You talk to neurologists in\u000aaffected areas who before may have seen three or four cases a year who now are\u000aseeing 10 or 15 per month. That\u2019s the magnitude of the problem. In Brazil the\u000aincrease in Guillain-Barre cases since the Zika outbreak is even more striking\u000a.Sixteen-year-old Angie Paola Castro gave birth last month to an apparently\u000ahealthy boy. It has been a month of both celebration and anguish: In her\u000aeighth month of pregnancy, Castro contracted the Zika virus, which researchers\u000asay may trigger serious neurological problems in the womb.Hundreds...Sixteen-\u000ayear-old Angie Paola Castro gave birth last month to an apparently healthy\u000aboy. It has been a month of both celebration and anguish: In her eighth month\u000aof pregnancy, Castro contracted the Zika virus, which researchers say may\u000atrigger serious neurological problems in the womb.Hundreds...**What makes you\u000athink climate change is behind the spread of Zika?**We know that dengue\u000afollows a pattern of climate change and that dengue and Zika have a common\u000avector or carrier, the _Aedes_ mosquito. It\u2019s well known in South America that\u000awhen you have El Niño climate conditions of dryness and heat, dengue cases\u000aincrease. And where there is dengue, you have the possibility of Zika.**What\u000atreatment is there for Zika, and is there hope for a vaccine?**There is no\u000atreatment and a vaccine will take years and years to develop. You need to\u000afirst find a vaccine, then test it for safety and efficacy. How much money and\u000ahow many years have we spent looking for vaccines for malaria and dengue? So\u000ait is very challenging. A better approach in the near term is to control the\u000aspread of the mosquito.**You can easily imagine a doomsday scenario for\u000aZika.**We are still learning about the disease, but there are biological\u000afeatures which make it different from dengue and chikungunya. There is\u000aevidence that Zika is present in the urine, saliva and semen. That means the\u000avirus has the potential to attack different cell populations and organs,\u000awhereas dengue affects mainly the blood. That means Zika has a potential to\u000acause more complications from the disease and for it to spread.**Looking\u000aahead, what encourages you?**In January we established a task force of\u000aresearchers from Johns Hopkins and Columbia University medical schools and the\u000aNational Institutes of Health with our Colombian colleagues at six different\u000auniversity hospitals here. Many fields of expertise are represented, such as\u000aneurology, virology and maternal-fetal medicine. Collaboration is the only way\u000ato learn about this disease, not just to diagnose the neurological problems\u000abut the factors behind this emerging disease, in order to design treatment and\u000aways of managing patients.But we need support. We have been knocking at the\u000adoor for federal grants but nothing has come through. I\u2019m here thanks only to\u000aphilanthropy from a family foundation called the Bart McLean Fund for\u000aNeuroimmunology Research, which has been supporting Johns Hopkins for 10\u000ayears. I asked them if I could divert some of their support to Colombia and\u000athe family quickly agreed._Kraul is a special correspondent.__For more news on\u000aglobal sustainability, go to our Global Development Watch page: latimes.com\u000a/global-development_\u000a\u000a

VThe Supreme Court dealt a surprising setback to President Obama on Tuesday by\u000aputting his climate change policy on hold while a coalition of coal producers\u000aand Republican-led states challenges its legality.The justices, by a 5-4 vote,\u000aissued an unusual emergency order that blocks the Environmental Protection\u000aAgency from moving forward with its effort to reduce carbon pollution from\u000apower plants by 32% by 2030.The order said the EPA's \u201ccarbon pollution\u000aemission guidelines\u201d for power plants are \u201cstayed pending\u201d a decision from the\u000aU.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which will hear\u000athe case this summer.It is rare for the high court to intervene in a case\u000apending in the lower courts. The brief order suggests that most of the\u000ajustices have doubts about the legality of the EPA's policy.The order could\u000aalso be a sign that conservative justices are increasingly skeptical of\u000aObama\u2019s use of executive authority. In a separate case this term, the high\u000acourt will decide whether Obama went too far in issuing an executive action to\u000adefer deportation of more than 4 million immigrants here illegally.Chief\u000aJustice John G. Roberts Jr.  and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy,\u000aClarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined in support of the order.The\u000afour liberal justices dissented: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia\u000aSotomayor and Elena Kagan.A former Justice Department attorney who has worked\u000aon environmental litigation called the order significant.It is \u201cextraordinary\u000aand fairly surprising,\u201d Washington lawyer James Rubin said. \u201cThe court\u000aessentially reviewed the merits before the D.C. Circuit even had a chance to\u000arule on them, something the court has not done before in the context of a\u000arule-making challenge. It\u2019s a significant blow to the EPA and the\u000aadministration\u2019s climate change plan.\u201d**See more of our top stories on\u000aFacebook &gt;&gt;**The EPA regulations, known as the Clean Power Plan, would\u000aset state-by-state targets for reducing greenhouse gases from power plants.\u000aThe rules would force many states to shut down older coal-fired plants and\u000aproduce more electricity using natural gas or solar and wind power.Lawyers for\u000aWest Virginia, Texas and 24 other states sued, contending the EPA does not\u000ahave the authority under the Clean Air Act to launch a broad attack on\u000agreenhouse gases.They filed an emergency appeal at the end of January asking\u000afor the high court to put the EPA plan on hold while their lawsuit\u000aproceeds.The challengers reminded the justices that they ruled last year in a\u000aseparate case that the EPA had failed to weigh the $9-billion cost before\u000arequiring power plants to eliminate mercury emissions. But because the high\u000acourt had allowed the rules to take effect while the legal challenge went\u000aforward, by the time the industry won, it was too late because the power\u000aplants had complied. Their message was that the high court this time needed to\u000aintervene early.The appeals court said it would hear arguments in June for the\u000aclimate case and would probably rule in the fall, during Obama's last months\u000ain the White House.\u201cMake no mistake: This is a great victory for West\u000aVirginia,\u201d said the state\u2019s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey. \u201cWe are\u000athrilled that the Supreme Court realized the rule\u2019s immediate impact and froze\u000aits implementation, protecting workers and saving countless dollars as our\u000afight against its legality continues.\u201d West Virginia and Texas led the\u000acoalition of states challenging the EPA regulations.The National Rural\u000aElectric Cooperative Assn., one of several groups that joined the challenge,\u000aapplauded the court\u2019s move.\u201cCharging ahead with implementation of the Clean\u000aPower Plan would have caused immediate and irreparable harm to America\u2019s\u000aelectric co-ops,\u201d said Jeffrey Connor, the group\u2019s interim chief executive.The\u000apresident's lawyers had urged the justices to turn down the emergency request,\u000acalling it \u201cextraordinary and unprecedented.\u201d Meanwhile, 18 mostly Democratic-\u000aled states, including California and Illinois, filed a brief supporting the\u000aadministration.In a statement Tuesday, the White House said it disagreed with\u000athe court\u2019s decision.\u201cWe remain confident that we will prevail on the merits,\u201d\u000athe statement said. \u201cEven while the litigation proceeds, EPA has indicated it\u000awill work with states that choose to continue plan development and will\u000aprepare the tools those states will need.\u201dThe Environmental Defense Fund\u000aexpressed disappointment in the court order.\u201cToday\u2019s court decision is\u000aunfortunate, but it does not reflect a decision on the merits,\u201d said Vickie\u000aPatton, its general counsel. She said she was confident the courts would\u000aultimately uphold the EPA plan.**Twitter: @DavidGSavage****ALSO****Islamic\u000aState will continue to target the U.S., top intelligence officials say****FBI\u000acan't figure out how to unlock encrypted phone in San Bernardino\u000ainvestigation****Why one consumer advocate blames a mysterious ship for\u000ahelping keep California gas prices high**\u000a\u000a

VAt the 88th Academy Awards, "Spotlight," the film about the Boston Globe's\u000ainvestigation into priest abuse, won for best picture. Leonardo DiCaprio,\u000aheavily favored to win for lead actor, was not disappointed in his fifth\u000achance to take home an Oscar for acting. His director, Alejandro G. Iñárritu,\u000ahad just gotten his second directing win in a row for "The Revenant." The film\u000acame into the night with the most nominations at 12 and won three.Overall,\u000a"Mad Max: Fury Road" has the most bragging rights, with six statuettes from 10\u000anods in total.The major upset of the evening was Sylvester Stallone's loss to\u000aMark Rylance of "Bridge of Spies" for supporting actor.  \u000aHost Chris Rock kicked off the 2016 Oscars with a highly anticipated monologue\u000aamid the #OscarsSoWhite controversy, taking multiple jabs at Hollywood's\u000aculture.  \u000aCheck out the intimate moments on the 2016 Academy Awards red carpet. When\u000acomedian Chris Rock took to the Dolby Theatre stage to start the Oscars\u000atelecast Sunday night, the track \u201cFight the Power\u201d by rap group Public Enemy\u000aplayed in the background. That same song, used by Spike Lee to cap his seminal\u000afilm \u201cDo the Right Thing,\u201d also played at the end of the show as the credits\u000arolled. Both instances were a reminder, comedic or otherwise, to keep pushing\u000afor greater diversity prompted by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and\u000aSciences' mostly white list of nominees for a second year in a row. And\u000afighting the power is what the #OscarsSoWhite movement plans to continue\u000adoing.Here are the ways some proponents of increased diversity believe the\u000aconversation can continue now that awards season is over.**April Reign,\u000acreator of #OscarsSoWhite:**  \u000a\u201cI would encourage everybody to be more mindful of the movies on which they\u000aspend their hard earned money. If the cast does not look like them, does not\u000arepresent their stories, perhaps choose not to see their films and instead\u000aseek out stories that tell the diversity and the beauty and nuance of all\u000apeople.\u201d**Gil Robertson, president of the African American Film Critics\u000aAssn.:**  \u000a\u201cI want to see the putting together of a multicultural group of journalists to\u000acontinue this conversation. It's important that we do that because the way the\u000aconversation has been had traditionally is in black and white terms. I think\u000ait is important that we encourage our Hispanic and Asian and other brothers\u000aand sisters to also be vocal, and to give them room to be vocal. We need to\u000awork collaboratively to see results.\u201d**  \u000a**Read moreGirl Scouts, giggles and little gold men set the tone in the wings of the Dolby Theatre stage at the Oscars, where presenters and performers settled their nerves and celebrated their victories.Read moreComedian Chris Rock came out swinging, at least in regard to his music choices. Rock's walk-on song was Public Enemy's "Fight the Power," a song tied to Spike Lee's 1989 film "Do the Right Thing." Many looked to Rock to address the lack of diversity in Hollywood and at the Oscars, and he did so before even saying a word, choosing a song that still feels revolutionary. Read moreDuring a comedy bit on the 88th Academy Awards Sunday night, Chris Rock said he trekked to a Compton movie theater to interview black moviegoers about largely white Oscar contenders.The resulting segment got big laughs as Rock asked cinema fans if they had seen, or even heard of, movies like "The Big Short," "Brooklyn" and "Bridge of Spies."But there was one problem with the routine \u2014 that theater isn't in Compton. Rock's video, filmed about a week before the ceremony, actually took place in front of the Rave Cinema 15 (formerly Magic Johnson Theatres) at Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. In fact, as the Los Angeles Times has reported, Compton doesn't even have a movie theater within its city limits, and it hasn't in decades.Read moreNo real surprise here, the most popular Instagram videos to be created on Oscars night include a celebrity puppy, Cate Blanchett and her diamonds, Reese Witherspoon doing shots, and Diddy instructing his followers on how to keep their "glows." Let's shine together. View the rest of the videos here.Read moreDespite an Academy Awards ceremony focused on addressing issues of diversity in Hollywood, Asian Americans expressed outrage on social media after two jokes that poked at stereotypes. The comments, one by host Chris Rock during a skit and another by comedic actor Sacha Baron Cohen under his Ali G persona, were particularly notable due to the controversy surrounding the #OscarsSoWhite theme.Rock's skit drew the most ire. In a rehearsed bit involving the tabulation of Academy Awards votes, he introduced the would-be PriceWaterhouseCoopers representatives overseeing the count. \u201cThey sent us their most dedicated, accurate and hard-working representatives," he said. "Please welcome Ming Zhu, Bao Ling and David Moskowitz."Three kids of Asian descent, dressed in suits and carrying briefcases, walked toward center stage. Following a muted response from the crowd, Rock added: "If anybody\u2019s upset about that joke, just tweet about it on your phone that was also made by these kids." And react they did, many wondering how the gag made it out of the writers room.Read morePatricia Clarkson, sitting on a couch bleary-eyed at the late hour, seemed amused by the gaggle of tall, pretty girls. Less concerned was "Love" star Gillian Jacobs, who was hanging out with "Game of Thrones" star Emilia Clarke.Jacobs was more interested in getting some beignets. While waiting for her ride, she grabbed a bag of the Bouchon donuts \u2014 guests were given to-go packets upon exiting \u2014 and tossed a few in her mouth. And that's how you end an award season right.Read the full Vanity Fair party recap here. As established over the last few months of #OscarsSoWhite coverage and controversy, Hollywood diversity is an issue that inspires much passion within the entertainment industry and beyond.But matters of diversity aren\u2019t a trending topic, they\u2019re a conversation that\u2019s been going on for decades. Even in Hollywood. Even at the Oscars.At the 49th Academy Awards held in 1977, 39 years ago, Richard Pryor (after a seven-minute interpretive song-and-dance number by Ann-Margret) opened the Oscars with a searing monologue that lampooned the lack of African American representation at the awards while a primarily white audience nervously tittered.In 1988, 11 years after Pryor\u2019s monologue, the academy invited Eddie Murphy, one of the biggest box-office stars of the decade, to award the ceremony\u2019s crown jewel, best picture. But before Murphy got down to business, he went off book and told the story of how he originally wanted to turn down the offer from the academy.Watch both speeches here. Read moreFor as much was written speculating about what this year\u2019s Chris Rock-hosted Oscars might look like, it\u2019s doubtful many prognosticators predicted an appearance of Black History Month\u2019s sworn enemy Stacey Dash.Dash, best known for her work in 1995\u2019s \u201cClueless,\u201d now spends her days as a cultural contributor for Fox News, where she was suspended in December 2015 for using profanity in reference to President Obama while on the air. More recently, Dash stoked the flames of controversy with statements in response to the #OscarsSoWhite controversy that suggested that BET and Black History Month should be done away with in the interest of equality.So when Dash took the stage at Sunday\u2019s Oscars, under the guise of \u201cdirector of minority outreach,\u201d the joke didn\u2019t just flail, it sank like a stone.Read moreI mean, it's my eighth time losing. I didn't think I'd lose this time. I mean, that's the best performance I've ever seen in my life. That's like an Oscar moment of all time. I guess I'm just the perennial loser. I mean, it's like everybody is talking about it. That and Stallone. It's really weird.  \u000aOne of the most urgent questions going into Sunday's Academy Awards ceremony\u000awas just how host Chris Rock would handle the gig, and particularly how he\u000awould address the ongoing #OscarsSoWhite controversy. Critics generally\u000apraised Rock for addressing the issue so directly, even if not all the jokes\u000aworked. Here's a look at reactions:Writing for The Times, television critic\u000aMary McNamara argued that although Rock didn't land every joke, he encouraged\u000aa bit of reflection on what is typically a night for the film industry to pat\u000aitself on the back. "For all its flaws, Rock's Oscars had some of the most\u000apowerful moments seen in the telecast's history. His decision to honestly\u000aanswer the question 'Is Hollywood racist?' was brave and effective," she said.\u000a"If Hollywood believes, as it should, that film is a medium of truth-telling\u000aand a catalyst for change, then moments of self-examination should occur at\u000aleast as often as those of celebration."New York Times TV critic James\u000aPoniewozik noted that having Rock, who was hired before the diversity flap\u000abegan, emcee the ceremony "was a lucky pairing of host and subject." His\u000aperformance was "evenhanded without being wishy-washy" and represented "an\u000aexample of something the industry is still trying to learn: that you can\u000aachieve both inclusion and entertainment by giving the right person just the\u000aright opportunity."That being said: What was with the bizarre appearance by\u000aStacey Dash?Read moreAnticipation of Chris Rock's no-holds-barred commentary\u000aat the 88th Academy Awards ceremony did not boost to the overnight ratings for\u000aSunday's telecast on ABCBased on Nielsen\u2019s overnight data from 56 large U.S.\u000aTV markets, the telecast averaged a 23.4 rating and a 36% share of the homes\u000ausing television from 8:30 p.m. to 11:51 p.m. EST, when the last commercial\u000abreak aired.That's down 6% when compared with the 24.9 rating from the\u000aovernight data for 2015.Read moreIt was a year of two films. Until it\u000awasn't.It was the year "Spotlight," the third film on everyone's list of top-\u000athree finishers, came from behind and walked off with the best picture\u000atrophy.So what did \u201cSpotlight\u201d have that \u201cThe Big Short\u201d did not? Three\u000athings:It not only provided work for a lot of actors, it featured an actor\u000a(Tom McCarthy) who also co-wrote and directed. As \u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d proved\u000ayears ago, actors, a big chunk of academy members, like to see actors\u000abranching out.Read moreFor all its flaws, Rock's Oscars had some of the most\u000apowerful moments seen in the telecast's history.The 2016 Oscars telecast was a\u000ahot mess, but it certainly wasn't boring.An event most often criticized for\u000abeing self-indulgent and self-congratulatory \u2014 so over-long, repetitive and\u000apredictable that the host is all but required to joke about its absurdity \u2014\u000athis year's Academy Awards was a strange compilation of atonal moments in\u000awhich the audience was kept perpetually off balance. Host Chris Rock called\u000aHollywood out on its racism and then sent his daughters out to sell Girl Scout\u000acookies. The mood whipsawed from the shocking to the familiar and back again,\u000aoften in the space of a few moments.Read moreThey parted ways on that sinking\u000aship back in 1997, but lately Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have been\u000aback together in an awards season that's gone on and on. After both actors won\u000aGolden Globes in January and British Academy Film Awards in mid-February (his\u000aas lead actor in "The Revenant," hers as supporting actress in "Steve Jobs"),\u000amany fans were hoping for the ultimate "Titanic" recoupling at the Oscars.\u000aWinslet, however, lost the Oscar to Alicia Vikander ("The Danish Girl"). But\u000awhen DiCaprio won his Oscar, he found Winslet backstage. They embraced. They\u000akissed. And for one brief moment it was as if Jack and Rose had never drifted\u000aapart. The 88th Academy Awards at the Dolby Theatre wasn\u2019t without a plethora\u000aof standout accessories and sartorial details worth a second look, including\u000athe red silk flower of Oscar winner Jared Leto\u2019s festive Gucci ensemble and\u000athe feathers of Oscar winner Cate Blanchett\u2019s Armani Privé seafoam green gown.\u000aAnd how could we forget Academy Award winner Whoopi Goldberg\u2019s bold jewelry?\u000aHere\u2019s a look at what style accessories, details and accompanying fashion\u000aselections stood out on the red carpet.Read moreBringing an end to an\u000aunpredictable and tumultuous Oscar race, the newsroom drama \u201cSpotlight\u201d took\u000ahome the top prize for best picture at the 88th Academy Awards, emerging\u000avictorious in what had widely been seen as a three-way race with the brutal\u000afrontier epic \u201cThe Revenant\u201d and the financial crisis dramedy \u201cThe Big\u000aShort.\u201dLeonardo DiCaprio won his first Academy Award \u2014 after four previous\u000aacting nominations \u2014 for his starring role as a man who survives a vicious\u000agrizzly bear attack in \u201cThe Revenant.\u201d Brie Larson earned the lead actress\u000aprize for her performance as a mother who has spent much of her life in\u000acaptivity in the drama \u201cRoom.\u201dThe evening marked the climax of one of the most\u000acontroversial Oscar seasons in Hollywood history, as a bitter debate over the\u000alack of any acting nominees of color for the second year in a row roiled the\u000aAcademy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.Unlike in many previous years, no\u000asingle film dominated the night, as academy voters spread their love around to\u000aa wide range of contenders.  \u000aRead moreThe art of the quick change is a Hollywood staple. And many of the\u000aOscars ceremony audience members showcased entirely new looks at the Vanity\u000aFair Oscar party. Mindy Kaling traded in her long, blue train for a Salvador\u000aPerez original.Kerry Washington switched from a custom Atelier Versace gown to\u000aa backless number.And Sofia Vergara wore Marchesa to the ceremony but traded\u000athat in for something white for the night.\u000a\u000a

VWael Alagha was curling up for the night on the cold ground outside a freeway\u000arest stop. He had a black ski jacket and blanket to shield him from the\u000anight\u2019s cold, but still shivered slightly.Around him, dozens of people sat\u000aaround fires that filled the air with acrid smoke. In tents nearby, charities\u000ahanded out tomato sandwiches and bottles of water. Young men crowded around\u000apicnic tables to charge their phones, intermittently shouting over access to\u000athe outlets.For weeks, thousands of migrants, many from Syria and Iraq, have\u000abeen stranded on this tense border between Greece and Macedonia. Fleeing war,\u000aor poverty, or grim prospects at home, they have been trying to get north,\u000athrough the Balkans and on to Germany or Sweden \u2014 but a closed border has left\u000athem sleeping here in the open.In January, Austria announced strict limits on\u000athe number of asylum claims it would accept, spurring a series of border\u000aclosures in the Balkan countries north of Greece. Since then, Macedonia has\u000abeen allowing only limited numbers through, and pressure has been\u000amounting.**NEWSLETTER: Get the day's top headlines from Times Editor Davan\u000aMaharaj &gt;&gt;**Syrian migrant Wael Alagha on the edge of the refugee camp\u000awhere he has found himself stranded in Idomeni, Greece.Syrian migrant Wael\u000aAlagha on the edge of the refugee camp where he has found himself stranded in\u000aIdomeni, Greece.On Monday, Macedonian police fired tear gas and stun grenades\u000ato subdue migrants who stormed the border and tried to tear down the barbed-\u000awire fence. Greece's migration minister has warned that 70,000 migrants could\u000aend up \u201ctrapped\u201d in Greece.The flow of refugees heading this way is increasing\u000aby several hundred a day, and United Nations officials said Tuesday there are\u000anow an estimated 8,500 migrants waiting for passage in this quiet rural\u000acommunity.Alagha, 21, left his hometown in Syria in early February and was\u000ahoping to make it to the German town of Marl, where his fiancee has been for\u000athree months. The two haven\u2019t seen each other since November.The gray rubber\u000adinghy that carries Huda Malak, pregnant with her first child, sags to sea\u000alevel as it approaches Lesbos. The overloaded raft has been taking on water\u000asince it launched from a crag off the Turkish shore, about six miles away.The\u000a18 Syrians on board desperately try to bail water...The gray rubber dinghy\u000athat carries Huda Malak, pregnant with her first child, sags to sea level as\u000ait approaches Lesbos. The overloaded raft has been taking on water since it\u000alaunched from a crag off the Turkish shore, about six miles away.The 18\u000aSyrians on board desperately try to bail water...Instead, he is stuck at a\u000acamp for migrants and refugees here in Idomeni, a small farming village that\u000ais the settlement closest to the border.Idomeni was a name unknown even to\u000amany Greeks until it became in recent months a focal point of Europe\u2019s\u000amigration crisis. The town sits along a path that begins in Turkey, where\u000amigrants go by sea to one of Greece\u2019s islands, then by bus to Athens and north\u000atoward Macedonia.The camp is a cluster of tents set amid farm fields.\u000aOccupants sprawl out on bunk beds in the tents or pick up food and bottled\u000awater at booths. In one corner, there are tables with paper and crayons for\u000achildren to draw. The drawings, hung on a wall, show houses and smiling\u000afamilies.Alagha sat on a wooden bench with several other young Syrian men,\u000afighting off boredom and the stress of not knowing how long they will be in\u000alimbo. \u201cMaybe later today, maybe tomorrow,\u201d Alagha said of moving on. \u201cI just\u000awant to go. There\u2019s nothing to do in Syria. There\u2019s nothing to do here.\u201dThe\u000ayoung men ask every uniformed aid worker or volunteer who passes, \u201cDo you know\u000awhen they will open the border?\u201d The answer is always no.In late January, a\u000astrike by Greek ferries meant that arrivals from Turkey couldn\u2019t get from the\u000aislands to the mainland, and that slowed the flow north. But ferry traffic\u000aresumed after that and the camp has been filling fast. Bus after bus pulls in,\u000aand passengers disembark lugging backpacks and suitcases. Alagha was fleeing\u000ahis hometown of Aleppo, which has been split in two by Syria\u2019s civil war, one\u000aside controlled by the government, the other by a mishmash of rebel\u000amilitias.Over the past few years Alagha heard screeching bombs and rockets\u000awhenever he tried to sleep or study. His patience ran out a few weeks ago when\u000aa close friend was shot in the leg by a sniper.\u201cI realized then that I could\u000adie at any time,\u201d he said.**Join the conversation on Facebook &gt;&gt;**He\u000apaid a smuggler 1,200 euros (a little more than $1,300) to take him from\u000aAleppo into Turkey. The smugglers, he said, abandoned him and the other\u000arefugees he was traveling with on a mountain near the Turkish border. He had\u000ato walk for an hour dodging border guards, then crawl through a hole in a\u000abarbed-wire border fence.Alagha\u2019s plan is to join his fiancee in Germany,\u000awhere he says first he will learn the language, then look for a school where\u000ahe can work toward a degree in medicine. But with the border shut, those plans\u000awere on hold.Alagha paced in the afternoon sun, looking for something to pass\u000athe time. He watched German language instruction videos on YouTube (the camp\u000ahas free wi-fi) but said he misses movies \u2014 simple, romantic ones are his\u000afavorite. \u201cI like romance and want to live a simple life,\u201d he said.Alagha said\u000ahe is sure that he and his fiancee will be reunited in the end. But for the\u000amoment, all he could do was wait.\u201cIt\u2019s like the governments are trying to make\u000athe situation so bad that we all give up and go home,\u201d he said. But he was\u000adetermined to keep moving._Borowiec is a special correspondent. Special\u000acorrespondent Maria Petrakis in Athens and the Associated Press contributed to\u000athis report._**ALSO****Italian Senate passes bill recognizing same-sex unions,\u000abut strips adoption rights from measure****Refugees buying one-way tickets\u000ahome after finding Germany intolerable****There was no Trump on the ballot,\u000abut Irish voters still made their anger clear**\u000a\u000a

VThe United States will donate more than $925 million in aid for Syrian\u000arefugees, "the most complex humanitarian emergency of our time," Secretary of\u000aState John F. Kerry said Thursday.Speaking at a donors conference in London\u000athat gathered representatives of about 70 countries to confront the crisis,\u000aKerry noted after nearly five years of fighting that has killed more than\u000a200,000 people and displaced millions, "the situation on the ground is\u000aactually worse, not better."The conference was overshadowed by the apparent\u000abreakdown in peace talks in Geneva, where delegations from the Syrian\u000agovernment and some opposition groups had gathered under United Nations\u000aauspices. The talks ended almost before they began.**Join the conversation on\u000aFacebook &gt;&gt;**Staffan de Mistura, the U.N. envoy, portrayed the halt as\u000atemporary and said he hoped the negotiators would meet again on Feb. 25. But\u000aneither side seemed very amenable.Kerry said the new U.S. aid includes more\u000athan $600 million in food, shelter, water, medical care and similar relief for\u000arefugees from the war, and an additional $325 million in development\u000aassistance, directed primarily at youths in refugee camps in Jordan and\u000aLebanon.Syrian peace talks that opened less than a week ago after months of\u000adiplomatic maneuvering seemed on the verge of collapse Wednesday, as the chief\u000aUnited Nations mediator declared a \u201cpause\u201d and each side blamed the other for\u000athe setback.The U.N. envoy, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters in a\u000asurprise...Syrian peace talks that opened less than a week ago after months of\u000adiplomatic maneuvering seemed on the verge of collapse Wednesday, as the chief\u000aUnited Nations mediator declared a \u201cpause\u201d and each side blamed the other for\u000athe setback.The U.N. envoy, Staffan de Mistura, told reporters in a\u000asurprise...The United States is already the largest donor of humanitarian aid\u000ato victims of the Syrian conflict, providing about $4.5 billion in food,\u000awater, medical care and other assistance since the civil war began in\u000a2011.Kerry urged the international community to increase aid overall by 30%,\u000acalling on at least 10 countries who have never donated before to pledge\u000anow.By the day's end, British Prime Minister David Cameron said $6 billion had\u000abeen pledged for 2016.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry speaks to donors at\u000athe Syria Conference in London on Thursday.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry\u000aspeaks to donors at the Syria Conference in London on Thursday.Kerry\u000aacknowledged that providing aid for refuges was only a stop-gap measure and\u000athat ending the conflict had to be the world's priority.He said he had engaged\u000ain a "robust" conversation with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, a day\u000aafter the State Department condemned Russian airstrikes near the Syrian city\u000aof Aleppo that killed civilians and interrupted routes used to deliver\u000ahumanitarian aid. In a statement, Kerry called on Syrian President Bashar\u000aAssad and his supporters, which include Russia, "to halt their bombardment of\u000aopposition-held areas, especially in Aleppo, and to lift their besiegement of\u000acivilians."**For more news about global affairs, follow\u000a@TracyKWilkinson****See the most-read stories this hour\u000a&gt;&gt;****ALSO****The media war at Syria peace talks****Mob attack on\u000aTanzanian woman renews concerns about racism in India****Pentagon seeks to\u000aboost defense in Europe to counter Russia**\u000a\u000a

VIn the small town of Newtok, Alaska, a Yupik village of about 350 people,\u000achildren once played on endless fields of frozen permafrost. Now, they splash\u000ain salt water pools and teeter on boardwalks as the permafrost below thaws and\u000athe Ninglick River chips away at the community. Soon even the boards will be\u000aswallowed by the rising tides.In 2017, it is projected that the highest point\u000ain Newtok \u2014 the school building \u2014 will be underwater. For these Alaskans,\u000aclimate change is not just a global temperature trend; it is happening under\u000atheir feet. Shoreline erosion is forcing residents to abandon their community\u000aas rising water inundates the lives they once lived. Twenty years ago, the\u000asigns were already in place and Newtok made the difficult decision to\u000arelocate. Since then, it has been slowly rebuilding its school, homes, and\u000alives inland to escape the ever-encroaching waters.Newtok residents will be\u000aamong our country's first climate refugees \u2014 but not our last.In the decades\u000ato come, thousands more from along America's most fragile shorelines will\u000aembark on a great migration inland as their homes disappear beneath the\u000awater's surface. Over the last 10 years, the Isle de Jean Charles community in\u000aLouisiana has lost two-thirds of its residents to dislocation. In the\u000aChesapeake Bay, Tangier Island's shoreline recedes by about 14 feet a year. On\u000aWashington's Olympic Peninsula, the Quinault Indian Nation relies on a 2,000\u000a-foot-long sea wall for protection until it can complete its move uphill.For\u000athem and the residents of dozens of other American towns and ultimately\u000acities, the question is no longer what will be lost to climate change, but\u000awhat will be saved.Over the last seven years, President Obama has built a\u000alegacy of action on climate change. He negotiated a bilateral agreement with\u000aChina to reduce greenhouse emissions, lowered tariffs on clean technologies to\u000aencourage their spread, and set new rules to cut carbon at home with the Clean\u000aPower Plan. With the climate change agreement in Paris successfully negotiated\u000ain December, he is set to use his final year in office to continue his\u000acommitment to reduce America's greenhouse gas emissions, to try to \u201caccelerate\u000athe transition away from old, dirtier energy sources,\u201d as he said in his State\u000aof the Union speech.Before most Americans were even aware of global warming,\u000aExxon was investing in high-quality research on the subject. According to\u000areports in the Los Angeles Times and elsewhere, the oil company's scientists\u000aconcluded in the 1970s, '80s and '90s that climate change was real, would\u000atransform the...Before most Americans were even aware of global warming, Exxon\u000awas investing in high-quality research on the subject. According to reports in\u000athe Los Angeles Times and elsewhere, the oil company's scientists concluded in\u000athe 1970s, '80s and '90s that climate change was real, would transform\u000athe...While it is essential to mitigate the sources of carbon in the United\u000aStates, it will not help citizens on the front lines of climate change right\u000anow. In order to alleviate the most extreme consequences of a shifting\u000aclimate, the president must give equal attention to helping communities adapt\u000ato a rapidly changing homeland.As they stand today, federal programs for\u000adisaster assistance are limited and mostly unavailable to towns that require\u000aclimate-induced relocation. Relief programs focus on sudden natural disasters\u000alike Hurricane Sandy, and on rebuilding in place, not on financially\u000asupporting the relocation of towns facing gradual inundation.Because of this,\u000acoastal communities across the country must rely on ad hoc federal and state\u000agrants, and attempt to rebuild and relocate in bits and pieces, in the hope\u000athat the work will be done before an emergency evacuation is needed.Some steps\u000ahave been taken to provide support adaptation specific support, but they fall\u000ashort of any real impact. In September 2015 during the first presidential\u000avisit to the Arctic, Obama pledged $2 million to help with voluntary climate-\u000ainduced relocation efforts in Alaska. This covers less than 2% of the cost to\u000arelocate one town, estimated at $100 to $200 million.In Alaska alone, climate\u000achange flooding and shoreline erosion already affects more than 180 villages,\u000a31 of which are in \u201cimminent\u201d danger of becoming uninhabitable.To truly make a\u000alasting climate change legacy, Obama must take seriously the issue of climate\u000arelocation. This means creating a legal and financial structure that can\u000aadequately respond to communities in need.The first step is simple: Convene\u000alocal, state, and federal stakeholders to draft a framework for relocating all\u000aclimate refugees within the United States. The difficulty will be in the\u000adetails, especially determining the source of the financial resources that\u000awill be required. The debate over who will fund relocation and which agencies\u000awill lend technical assistance will be intense. But those negotiations must\u000abegin in order to protect the lives of our most vulnerable citizens.In\u000aSeptember during his visit to Alaska, Obama told the country, \u201cClimate change\u000ais no longer some far-off problem. It is happening here. It is happening now.\u201d\u000aHe must recognize American climate refugees today and use his last year in\u000aoffice to inaugurate the process of saving them from America's eroding\u000aedges._Victoria Herrmann is director of the Arctic Institute. In 2016 she is\u000atraveling across America for a National Geographic funded book on climate\u000achange stories, America's Eroding Edges._**Follow the Opinion section on\u000aTwitter ****@latimesopinion**** and ****Facebook**\u000a\u000a

VThe image of a dead Syrian toddler washed up on a beach last year stirred\u000aworldwide outrage over a growing refugee crisis.Rob Lawrie decided to do\u000asomething about it. The British former soldier closed down his cleaning\u000abusiness, bought a van and started delivering tents, clothing and food across\u000athe English Channel to the Jungle, a refugee shantytown of more than 4,000\u000apeople near the French port city of Calais.He now says his compassion got the\u000abetter of him.In a case that has elicited broad public support for Lawrie, he\u000awas set to go on trial Thursday in France on suspicion of trying to smuggle a\u000a4-year-old girl out of the Jungle and into England."I'm not a smuggler," he\u000atold Le Monde newspaper in December. "No money changed hands. It wasn't even a\u000apremeditated act. I did it on a sudden feeling."His French lawyer, Lucile\u000aAbassade, said Lawrie intends to plead guilty to the charge \u2014 aiding illegal\u000aimmigration \u2014 but argue that breaking the law was a humanitarian act. He faces\u000aup to five years in prison and a $41,300 fine if convicted by the court in the\u000acoastal town of Boulogne-sur-Mer.Lawrie's version of events goes like this:\u000aAfter he started volunteering in the shantytown, the girl, a refugee from\u000aAfghanistan named Bahar Ahmadi, began following him everywhere. Everybody\u000acalled her by her nickname, Bru. Her father, Reza Ahmadi, whose wife had been\u000akilled back home, begged him many times to take her to Leeds in the north of\u000aEngland, where several cousins had settled legally. Lawrie refused.But one\u000anight last October, he cracked in a "moment of madness," 49-year-old Lawrie\u000atold journalists.He was preparing to leave France when British border police\u000afound two migrants from Eritrea in the back of his van.Lawrie insisted that\u000athe men had stowed away without his knowledge. When French police handcuffed\u000ahim, he told them they had missed Bru, who was apparently in a storage\u000acompartment.Lawrie was not charged in relation to the Eritreans, only the\u000agirl."I just couldn't leave her to spend one more night in that horrendous\u000aplace," Lawrie told a British newspaper. "And when you have seen what I have\u000aseen all rational thought goes out of your head."He elaborated in an interview\u000awith Al Jazeera: "We cannot help everyone, but everyone can help someone and\u000ashe had become my someone. I just did it because I could no longer see her\u000alive in this squalid environment."She's a special little girl and in all the\u000amonths that I spent with her, I never saw her without a smile," he\u000aadded.Lawrie, who served for seven years as a physical training instructor\u000awith the Royal Corps of Transport, also said that he regretted his actions.\u000aAfter his arrest, his second marriage broke up, and his wife took their two\u000achildren, he said.His lawyer said he plans to argue that to have ignored the\u000aappeal by the girl's father would have flouted a French law requiring people\u000ato give assistance to someone in danger.In a show of support for Lawrie, about\u000a53,000 people signed a petition asking British authorities to help spare him\u000afrom jail."Rob shouldn't be treated as a criminal, but as an ordinary man ...\u000atrying to do the right thing in extraordinary circumstances," wrote the\u000apetition organizer, Jim Innes.A French petition on www.change.org has nearly\u000a120,000 signatures, and backers are being encouraged to demonstrate their\u000asupport outside the courtroom.Refugees and migrants who gather on France's\u000anorthwestern coast in hopes of making it across the channel to Britain have\u000abeen a source of tension between the two countries for at least 15 years.The\u000ashanty dwellers near Calais are part of the recent crisis in which hundreds of\u000athousands of people have arrived across Europe after being displaced from\u000aSyria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Eritrea and elsewhere.Though they could claim\u000aasylum in France, many prefer to take their chances with smugglers or stowaway\u000aon lorries and vehicles to make the crossing to Britain.Over the years, as the\u000aauthorities on each side of the channel have tightened checks and controls,\u000athe crossing attempts have become increasingly desperate and occasionally\u000afatal. Last summer thousands of migrants stormed the entrance to the Channel\u000aTunnel and clashed with police trying to contain them.The Calais port is now\u000aheavily guarded by police and protected by high fences topped with razor wire\u000aand closed-circuit television cameras.Each month an average of 3,600 people\u000aare caught trying to cross illegally, and last year at least 12 people died\u000aduring such attempts. Nobody knows how many refugees make it._Willsher is a\u000aspecial correspondent. Special correspondent Christina Boyle in London\u000acontributed to this report._**ALSO****Did Iran 'toy' with the\u000aU.S.?****California winner will have to share $1.5-billion Powerball\u000ajackpot****Another rare, venomous sea serpent washes ashore in Southern\u000aCalifornia**\u000a\u000a

VIt was one of the defining images of 2015: small boats crowded with migrants\u000amaking a perilous bid to reach Europe.More than 1 million people arrived by\u000asea during the year, according to estimates by the United Nations refugee\u000aagency, one of the biggest migration waves to hit the continent since the end\u000aof World War II.At least 3,770 died or went missing in the attempt, the\u000aInternational Organization for Migration said Thursday. But as the year drew\u000ato a close, the boats were still coming with nothing to suggest that the flood\u000awould be stanched anytime soon.The crisis has exposed deep rifts among the\u000aEuropean Union's 28 members, which have struggled to respond amid acrimonious\u000abickering and finger-pointing. Many have set up temporary border controls,\u000athreatening one of the bloc's cherished achievements: the free movement of\u000acitizens across most of its internal borders.Here is a look at what is driving\u000athe crisis and what the new year may hold for Europe's migrants.**What lies\u000abehind the rise ****in the numbers?**The surge was driven by Syrians, many of\u000awhom have lost hope that the war that has torn apart their country will be\u000abrought to an end. They make up nearly half of the migrants who arrived in\u000aEurope in 2015, according to the latest estimates.In nearby countries, to\u000awhich more than 4 million refugees from Syria have fled, conditions are\u000aincreasingly desperate. Few refugees are allowed to work legally in Lebanon,\u000aJordan and Turkey, and humanitarian agencies say their appeals for more aid\u000aare not being met.Other long-standing conflicts have also contributed to the\u000achaotic influx in Europe, with Afghanistan accounting for about 21% of\u000aarrivals and Iraq 7%.**Join the conversation on Facebook &gt;&gt;**Around the\u000aworld, nearly 60 million people have been forced to flee their homes because\u000aof war, conflict and persecution, the highest number ever recorded, according\u000ato the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.**Where are the\u000amigrants going?**The overwhelming majority of those trying to reach Europe \u2014\u000amore than 844,000, the U.N. says \u2014 cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to nearby\u000aGreek islands. But most don't stay, preferring to move on to wealthier\u000adestinations to the north.Germany has received nearly 1.1 million asylum\u000aseekers \u2014 more than any other EU nation. They include large numbers of\u000aEuropeans arriving overland from the Balkans.Hundreds of thousands of refugees\u000ahave poured into Europe in a desperate migration that has strained the\u000acontinent's ability to cope.Hundreds of thousands of refugees have poured into\u000aEurope in a desperate migration that has strained the continent's ability to\u000acope.Some poorer European nations have accused Germany of fueling the crisis\u000awith its open-door policy and have tried to curb the influx by dispatching\u000atroops to their borders and throwing up miles of fences. As the migrants keep\u000acoming, even Germany and other wealthier countries, such as Sweden, have\u000aintroduced border checks to regulate the entry of asylum seekers.Although such\u000acontrols are allowed in an emergency under European rules, they have been\u000afiercely criticized by EU officials and human rights groups, which have called\u000aon the bloc to uphold its values of compassion and meet international\u000aobligations to provide sanctuary to those fleeing war and persecution.However,\u000amany people in Eastern and Central Europe agree with Hungarian Prime Minister\u000aViktor Orban that most of the migrants are seeking better economic\u000aopportunities rather than fleeing war, and believe that they, as Muslims, will\u000aundermine Europe's Christian identity. Fear and hostility toward the migrants\u000ahave spread since the discovery that at least two of the Islamic State gunmen\u000awho killed 130 people in Paris on Nov. 13 posed as refugees to travel from\u000aSyria to Europe.Virginie Guiraudon, an immigration expert at the Center for\u000aEuropean Studies at Paris' Sciences Po university, said the crisis revealed a\u000afundamental misunderstanding by major EU powers about the bloc's newest\u000amembers.**NEWSLETTER: Get the day's top headlines from Times Editor Davan\u000aMaharaj &gt;&gt;**"They thought that these countries would remain tame and\u000acontrollable and would just be happy that they were allowed in," she said.\u000a"This ignores the fact that these countries also have domestic opinions, also\u000ahave domestic party politics and their own agenda."**What is Europe doing to\u000aresolve the crisis?**In an attempt to ease the burden on frontline states such\u000aas Greece and Italy, Germany tried to persuade all EU members to accept a\u000ashare of refugees. Those efforts largely failed. Just over 200 people have\u000abeen relocated so far.The focus has now shifted to finding ways to discourage\u000athe migrants from embarking on the dangerous journey to Europe \u2014 and to ensure\u000athat those who reach Europe are systematically registered and vetted. Tens of\u000athousands of migrants fleeing war and poverty are trying to reach safety in\u000aEurope. This summer's unprecedented exodus from Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea\u000aand other nations in turmoil has inundated southern Europe and exhausted the\u000agenerosity of countries suffering their own economic woes.EU leaders promised\u000ain November to give Turkey more than $3.2 billion in return for help stemming\u000athe flow. But at their last summit of the year in December, the leaders failed\u000ato take action on another proposal, by the bloc's executive arm, to set up a\u000anew border and coast guard service to bolster security at entry points.The\u000aplan has revived fears among some members, including Poland, about a loss of\u000asovereignty to EU bureaucrats in Brussels. Still, members agreed to "rapidly\u000aexamine" the proposals with the goal of reaching an agreement by mid-2016.**Is\u000apeace possible in Syria?**The crisis in Europe has renewed interest in finding\u000aa diplomatic solution to the war that has killed more than 200,000 people in\u000aSyria, caused vast destruction and left much of the country in the hands of\u000ahard-core Islamist militants.Russia's air campaign on behalf of President\u000aBashar Assad's government hasn't helped matters, in the view of the U.S.,\u000awhich heads a coalition that has been carrying out airstrikes against Islamic\u000aState in Syria and neighboring Iraq. One of Syria's top rebel leaders, Zahran\u000aAlloush, was killed in a Dec. 25 strike for which Assad's government claimed\u000aresponsibility, but for which insurgents blamed Russia.The U.S. has its\u000aconcerns about Alloush's Islam Army, which is part of a rebel alliance with\u000alinks to Al Qaeda. But State Department spokesman Mark Toner said he had been\u000aparticipating in the talks to bring about a cease-fire and a meaningful\u000apolitical dialogue in Syria."It doesn't send the most constructive message to\u000acarry out a strike like that," Toner told reporters in Washington.U.N.\u000amediator Staffan de Mistura plans to convene representatives of the Syrian\u000agovernment and opposition groups for another round of talks in Geneva on Jan.\u000a25.But the negotiators face enormous questions: How to decide the fate of\u000aAssad? What armed groups should be represented at the talks? And how to\u000apersuade the numerous countries that have been drawn into the war, including\u000aarchrivals Iran and Saudi Arabia, to cooperate?The answers will probably prove\u000ano less elusive in 2016 than in 2015._Twitter: @alexzavis_**ALSO****German\u000arepublication of Hitler's 'Mein Kampf' causes furor****Photographer's journal:\u000aA look at the migrant crisis in Lesbos, Greece****More than 1 million migrants\u000acrossed into Europe in 2015, migration organization says**\u000a\u000a

VThe Islamic State group has launched two chemical attacks near the northern\u000aIraqi city of Kirkuk, killing a 3-year-old girl, injuring some 600 people and\u000acausing hundreds more to flee, Iraqi officials said Saturday.Security and\u000ahospital officials say the latest attack took place early Saturday in the\u000asmall town of Taza, which was also struck by a barrage of rockets carrying\u000achemicals three days earlier.\u201cThere is fear and panic among the women and\u000achildren,\u201d said Adel Hussein, a local official in Taza. \u201cThey're calling for\u000athe central government to save them.\u201d Hussein said a German and an American\u000aforensics team arrived in the area to test for the presence of chemical\u000aagents.The wounded are suffering from infected burns, suffocation and\u000adehydration, said Helmi Hamdi, a nurse at the Taza hospital. He said eight\u000apeople were transferred to Baghdad for treatment.U.S. and Iraqi officials said\u000aU.S. special forces captured the head of the ISIS unit trying to develop\u000achemical weapons in a raid last month in northern Iraq.The U.S.-led coalition\u000asaid the chemicals ISIS has so far used include chlorine and a low-grade\u000asulfur mustard which is not very potent. \u201cIt's a legitimate threat. It's not a\u000ahigh threat. We're not, frankly, losing too much sleep over it,\u201d U.S. Army\u000aCol. Steve Warren told reporters Friday.When Salahuddin Barakat founded the\u000aIslam Academy in 2013, he located it on the edge of Rosengard, a predominantly\u000aMuslim neighborhood that has been a flashpoint in Sweden's sharpening debate\u000aover immigration.It wasn't his first choice, he said, "but people in central\u000aMalmo said we don't want...When Salahuddin Barakat founded the Islam Academy\u000ain 2013, he located it on the edge of Rosengard, a predominantly Muslim\u000aneighborhood that has been a flashpoint in Sweden's sharpening debate over\u000aimmigration.It wasn't his first choice, he said, "but people in central Malmo\u000asaid we don't want...The coalition began targeting ISIS' chemical weapons\u000ainfrastructure with airstrikes and special operations raids two months ago,\u000aIraqi intelligence officials and a Western security official in Baghdad told\u000athe AP.Airstrikes are targeting laboratories and equipment, and further\u000aspecial forces raids targeting chemical weapons experts are planned, the\u000aofficials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not\u000aauthorized to brief reporters.The extremist group is believed to have set up a\u000aspecial unit for chemical weapons research made up of Iraqi scientists who\u000aworked on weapons programs under Saddam Hussein as well as foreign experts.The\u000agroup is believed to have created limited amounts of mustard gas. Tests\u000aconfirmed mustard gas was used in a town in Syria when IS was launching\u000aattacks there in August 2015. There have been other unverified reports of IS\u000ausing chemical agents on battlefields in Syria and Iraq.**ALSO****Trump has a\u000ahistory of endorsing violence against protesters****Honest Co. faces big\u000aquestions after lawsuits, exposé****Suspect in Midwest slayings who could have\u000abeen deported had run-ins with law in L.A.**\u000a\u000a

VWhite House officials met with representatives from the tech, advertising and\u000aentertainment industries Wednesday to discuss how to combat activities of\u000aterrorist groups online.Representatives from at least 49 companies \u2014 including\u000aMicrosoft, Facebook, Apple, Google, Mediacom and Edelman \u2014 were invited to\u000ameet with officials from the Justice Department, the United Nations, the\u000aBritish Embassy and the Department of Homeland Security.The meeting was called\u000athe Madison Valleywood Project, in reference to the participation of\u000aindustries on Madison Avenue, in Silicon Valley and Hollywood, according to\u000adocuments from the meeting reviewed by The Times.**See more of our top stories\u000aon Facebook &gt;&gt;**The agenda included talks by the assistant attorney\u000ageneral for national security, John P. Carlin, and a panel discussion about\u000athe militant group Islamic State's media strategy and ways to \u201cscale counter-\u000anarratives and optimistic messaging.\u201dThe agenda also detailed activities such\u000aas \u201cStoryboarding the Opportunity,\u201d in which teams of eight people of\u000ainterdisciplinary skills determined where their companies could have the\u000agreatest effect. They then prepared their ideas for a presentation. In \u201cHuddle\u000ato Roadmap Next 100 Days,\u201d teams came up with a plan for things they could do\u000afor the next 100 days.The meeting comes at a time when the technology\u000aindustry's cooperation with the government is under heavy scrutiny. Apple in\u000aparticular is facing increasing pressure from the FBI to provide assistance in\u000ahacking an iPhone that belonged to San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook.\u000aApple has steadfastly refused to cooperate, citing customer privacy\u000aconcerns.Setting up a pitched battle between Silicon Valley and the counter-\u000aterrorism community, Apple's chief executive said Wednesday that his company\u000awould fight a court order demanding the tech giant's help in the San\u000aBernardino attack investigation, turning what had been a philosophical dispute\u000ainto...Setting up a pitched battle between Silicon Valley and the counter-\u000aterrorism community, Apple's chief executive said Wednesday that his company\u000awould fight a court order demanding the tech giant's help in the San\u000aBernardino attack investigation, turning what had been a philosophical dispute\u000ainto...Marc Raimondi, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, said the goal\u000ais to take \u201cevery action possible to confront and interdict terrorist\u000aactivities wherever they may occur, including in cyberspace.\u201d\u201cWe are using\u000athis engagement and others to enlist the help of industry leaders and experts\u000ain our effort to ensure we bring the most innovative private and public sector\u000athinking to all aspects of combating terrorism,\u201d the DOJ official\u000asaid.Meanwhile, Atty. Gen. Loretta Lynch told a House Appropriations\u000asubcommittee Wednesday that companies must comply with court orders to search\u000adevices.Without mentioning Apple, Lynch repeated the government's position\u000athat companies should take extra steps to help law enforcement execute\u000awarrants. \u201cIf the government needs the assistance of third parties to ensure\u000athat the search is actually conducted, judges all over the country and on the\u000aSupreme Court have said that those parties must assist if it is reasonably\u000awithin their power to do so," she said."And that is what we have been asking,\u000aand we owe it to the victims and to the public whose safety we must protect to\u000aensure that we have done everything under the law to fully investigate\u000aterrorist attacks on American soil.\u201d**Twitter: @traceylien****ALSO****How the\u000aiPhone's security measures work****Chinese tech execs side with Apple -- or\u000amaybe just against the FBI****Apple's Tim Cook disappointed with Justice\u000aDepartment's handling of San Bernardino case**\u000a\u000a

VTwo U.S. F-15 fighter jets carried out an airstrike in northwestern Libya\u000aearly Friday that destroyed what the Pentagon described as a Islamic State\u000atraining camp for several dozen foreign fighters and a senior terrorist\u000aoperative, U.S. officials said.\u201cWe obliterated the camp,\u201d said a U.S. official\u000awho discussed the raid on condition of anonymity. \u201cWe're still assessing the\u000acasualties at this point, but we hit what we were aiming at.\u201d\u201cWe feel\u000aconfident that this was a successful strike,\u201d Peter Cook, the Pentagon\u000aspokesman, told reporters. \u201cThese particular fighters posed a threat to\u000ainterests in the region, to Libya, and to the United States overall.\u201dThe\u000apredawn attack, launched from Lakenheath Air Base in Britain, comes after\u000aweeks of mounting pressure on the White House to attack Islamic State's\u000agrowing footprint in oil-rich Libya, the only country other than Syria and\u000aIraq where it controls territory.National security experts warn that an\u000aIslamic State sanctuary in Libya could give the Sunni extremist group another\u000alaunching pad for terrorist assaults in Europe and North Africa.U.S. drones\u000aand spy satellites had spent weeks focusing on the walled compound outside the\u000acoastal town of Sabratha, about 50 miles west of Tripoli, another official\u000asaid. The aerial images, coupled with other intelligence, heightened U.S.\u000aconcern that the militants were preparing to launch a cross-border attack.A\u000aphoto released by the Sabratha Municipal Council shows the site where U.S.\u000awarplanes struck what the Pentagon said was an Islamic State training camp in\u000athe town in northwest Libya.A photo released by the Sabratha Municipal Council\u000ashows the site where U.S. warplanes struck what the Pentagon said was an\u000aIslamic State training camp in the town in northwest Libya.The Sabratha\u000aMunicipal Council, the local government, said on its website that at least 41\u000apeople were killed in the bombing, many apparently as they slept. The compound\u000awas rented by non-Libyans, including Tunisians, and machine guns and rocket-\u000apropelled grenade launchers were found in the rubble, the website said.The\u000aPentagon said the attack specifically targeted Noureddine Chouchane, a veteran\u000aIslamic State operative who allegedly played a key role in terrorist attacks\u000alast year in neighboring Tunisia. The first, in March, killed 23 people at the\u000aNational Bardo Museum in Tunis, and another in June killed 38 at a seaside\u000aresort in Sousse.As Islamic State forces lose ground in Iraq and Syria,\u000afighters loyal to the group have seized territory in oil-rich Libya, levying\u000ataxes at gunpoint and creating sanctuaries to launch possible attacks in North\u000aAfrica and Europe, U.S. officials say.The Pentagon has sent special operations\u000ateams...As Islamic State forces lose ground in Iraq and Syria, fighters loyal\u000ato the group have seized territory in oil-rich Libya, levying taxes at\u000agunpoint and creating sanctuaries to launch possible attacks in North Africa\u000aand Europe, U.S. officials say.The Pentagon has sent special operations\u000ateams...Chouchane, who is from Tunisia, was also responsible for moving\u000aforeign fighters from Tunisia into Libya, according to the Pentagon.The only\u000aprevious U.S. airstrike in Libya against Islamic State was in November, when\u000aF-15 fighter jets killed a commander known as Abu Nabil. Officials said he was\u000aresponsible for the video last year that showed militants beheading 21\u000aEgyptian workers, all Coptic Christians, along the Mediterranean coast of\u000aLibya.Islamic State has found fertile ground in Libya, which has had no\u000afunctioning central government since the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\u000abombing campaign helped a popular uprising oust Moammar Kadafi in 2011.\u000aCompeting factions have fought a low-level civil war since 2014.Islamic State\u000ahas taken advantage of the power vacuum, attacking oil fields and\u000ainstallations, hobbling a major source of income. A U.S. intelligence estimate\u000athis month concluded that group has about 5,000 fighters in Libya, double the\u000aofficial estimate last fall.The U.S. military, along with British, French and\u000aItalian special forces, has been monitoring Islamic State movements in several\u000aLibyan cities, including the militants' stronghold of Sirte.The White House\u000ahas resisted calls from some aides and Congress members to escalate the U.S.\u000amilitary role to counter the potential threat, although Friday's attack\u000asuggested at least a modest shift in that policy.\u201cI think this is the\u000abeginning of what will be a broader pattern of operations in the country in\u000awhich the U.S. will strike, while being extremely careful about targeting,\u201d\u000aAnthony Cordesman, a defense expert at the Center for Strategic and\u000aInternational Studies, a nonpartisan Washington think tank, said Friday.At a\u000anews conference Monday after a summit with Southeast Asian leaders, President\u000aObama appeared to suggest U.S. raids in Libya are likely to increase.\u201cWith\u000arespect to Libya, I have been clear from the outset that we will go after ISIS\u000awherever it appears, the same way that we went after Al Qaeda wherever they\u000aappeared,\u201d Obama said, using another name for Islamic State.\u201cWe will continue\u000ato take actions where we've got a clear operation and a clear target in mind,\u201d\u000ahe said. \u201cAs we see opportunities to prevent ISIS from digging in, in Libya,\u000awe take them.\u201d**ALSO****Latinos seek answers from Sanders and Clinton in Las\u000aVegas****Manny Pacquiao posts Bible verse that states gay people should be\u000akilled****Change in bullet train construction plans will delay rail line's\u000aarrival in Southern California**\u000a\u000a

VAn Islamic State cyber team has threatened two Silicon Valley tech titans,\u000aposting a 25-minute video online that shows bullet holes over the faces of\u000aTwitter's Jack Dorsey and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg.Both companies recently\u000astepped up efforts to block postings and accounts that promote violence and\u000aIslamic State propaganda after White House officials complained that social\u000amedia companies weren't doing enough to smother extremist recruiting\u000aonline.The potential peril for two social media pioneers is the latest\u000aworrying intersection of extremist ideology and the fast-evolving digital\u000atechnology and online global presence that Twitter and Facebook\u000arepresent.Islamic State displays \u201cunprecedented online proficiency,\u201d James R.\u000aClapper, the director of national intelligence, warned the House Intelligence\u000aCommittee on Thursday at a hearing devoted to national security\u000athreats.President Obama met with his national security team at the State\u000aDepartment on Thursday to focus on the broader threat from Islamic State.\u000aLater, he told reporters that the diplomatic push for a cease-fire in Syria's\u000acivil war won't hamper U.S. airstrikes against the group's leaders and\u000aassets.\u201cWe can hit them anywhere, any time,\u201d Obama said. The U.S. is \u201ctaking\u000athem out, day in and day out, one after another after another.\u201dThough the\u000avideo probably does not signify an ongoing plot, it could prompt an Islamic\u000aState supporter to target employees of the social media giants, according to\u000aRick \u201cOzzie\u201d Nelson, a former U.S. counter-terrorism official now at the\u000anonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\u201cI\u000athink it does increase the risk to the employees of those companies,\u000aparticularly from a homegrown extremist,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThat's what concerns\u000ame the most.\u201dIn addition to organizing or sponsoring deadly terrorist attacks\u000ain Europe, Canada, the Middle East and North Africa, Islamic State and its\u000aaffiliates have used social media to recruit followers and encourage \u201clone\u000awolf\u201d attacks on the United States and its allies.The married couple who shot\u000aand killed 14 people in San Bernardino on Dec. 2 pledged allegiance to the\u000aIslamic State leader that morning on Facebook, for example. But they had no\u000aknown contact with the group.In May, however, Islamic State claimed direct\u000aresponsibility for the attempted attack on a prophet Muhammad cartoon contest\u000ain Garland, Texas. Both gunmen were shot dead.Last fall, FBI bulletins warned\u000athat Islamic State was promoting attacks against law enforcement personnel,\u000amembers of the news media and the U.S. military.It urged service members to\u000a\u201creview their online social media presence for any information that might\u000aattract the attention of violent extremists,\u201d including home addresses.The\u000alatest video, purportedly created by pro-Islamic State hackers calling\u000athemselves \u201cSons of the Caliphate Army,\u201d was shared on the messaging app\u000aTelegram and was first reported by the online media company Vocativ.\u201cIf you\u000aclose one account we will take 10 in return and soon your names will be erased\u000aafter we delete you sites, Allah willing, and will know that we say is true,\u201d\u000areads English-language text in the video.Twitter announced on Feb. 5 that it\u000ahad suspended more than 125,000 accounts since mid-2015 for \u201cthreatening or\u000apromoting terrorist acts,\u201d mostly related to Islamic State.It's not clear how\u000aeffective that effort has been. Islamic State supporters have been known to\u000aquickly replace deleted accounts with new Twitter handles.Twitter declined to\u000acomment Thursday, pointing to the Feb. 5 statement that begins, \u201cWe condemn\u000athe use of Twitter to promote terrorism.\u201dFacebook, which also declined to\u000acomment Thursday, has taken an aggressive approach to identifying and blocking\u000acontent and users who promote terrorist groups or sympathize with Islamic\u000aState.Speaking Monday at a telecommunications conference in Barcelona, Spain,\u000aZuckerberg said his company was working with governments to prevent terrorist\u000aattacks. \u201cWe feel a pretty strong responsibility to help make sure that\u000asociety is safe,\u201d he said.Apple also has assisted the government in scores of\u000aterrorism investigations. But it is fighting a federal magistrate's order to\u000awrite software so the FBI can access a locked iPhone used by one of the San\u000aBernardino killers.Doing so, Apple argued in a motion filed Thursday, would\u000acreate \u201ca backdoor to defeat the encryption on the iPhone, making its users'\u000amost confidential and personal information vulnerable to hackers, identity\u000athieves, foreign agents, and unwarranted government surveillance.\u201dThe Obama\u000aadministration has launched a concerted campaign to press social media\u000acompanies to take bolder steps to prevent extremists from using the Internet\u000ato recruit fighters, inspire attacks and publish threats to U.S.\u000aofficials.Senior White House officials met with tech executives in San Jose on\u000aJan. 8 to seek their help in thwarting terrorist attacks and preventing online\u000arecruitment.Secretary of State John F. Kerry met with Hollywood studio\u000aexecutives this month to discuss ways filmmakers could counter Islamic State's\u000aonline recruitment and exhortations to violence.On Wednesday, representatives\u000afrom Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr, Microsoft and\u000aother companies attended a three-hour meeting at the Justice Department.The\u000asession was billed as the \u201cMadison Valleywood Project\u201d because it brought\u000atogether Madison Avenue advertising firms, Silicon Valley tech companies and\u000aHollywood film and television studios.One panel examined Islamic State's media\u000astrategy from a marketing perspective and discussed how to counter the\u000aextremist message, according to one attendee who spoke on condition he not be\u000aidentified.Federal agencies have struggled to prevent recruitment over social\u000amedia, John P. Carlin, assistant attorney general for national security, told\u000athe group, attendees said.The director of the National Counterterrorism\u000aCenter, Nick Rasmussen, said some social media platforms had taken aggressive\u000asteps to take down accounts used by terrorist groups.Megan Smith, national\u000achief technology officer; Jen Easterly, senior director for counter-terrorism\u000aat the White House; and George Selim, head of community outreach for the\u000aDepartment of Homeland Security, also attended.The Obama administration \u201cis\u000acommitted to taking every action possible to confront and interdict terrorist\u000aactivities wherever they may occur, including in cyberspace,\u201d Justice\u000aDepartment spokesman Marc Raimondi said in a\u000astatement._brian.bennett@latimes.com__Times staff writers Christi Parsons in\u000aWashington and Paresh Dave in Los Angeles contributed to this report._\u000a\u000a

VThe conventional wisdom holds that Donald Trump is playing into the hands of\u000aISIS. His call for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the\u000aUnited States\u201d \u2014 a temporary measure, he says, \u201cuntil we can figure out what\u000athe hell is going on\u201d \u2014 has served only to divide America, offend and inflame\u000aMuslims worldwide, and quite possibly drive deeper into alienation the small\u000aminority of disaffected Muslims who are teetering on radicalism\u2019s edge.If we\u000aaccept the logically straightforward premise that Trump\u2019s pronouncements\u000aconstitute a form of help to ISIS, an ironic and disquieting corollary\u000afollows. ISIS has every reason to return the favor and they are exceedingly\u000awell-situated to do so. Indeed, the terror organization is in a position to\u000ahelp Trump further raise his profile, disseminate his message and even pave\u000athe way for him to gain the Republican nomination and possibly the White\u000aHouse.Donald Trump is a puzzle to political analysts. He's commonly described\u000aas a creature of the far right, given his ultra-hard-line stances on Mexican\u000aand Muslim immigration. But polls commonly show that his strongest base of\u000asupport is among moderate-to-liberal Republicans. Conservative\u000apundits,...Donald Trump is a puzzle to political analysts. He's commonly\u000adescribed as a creature of the far right, given his ultra-hard-line stances on\u000aMexican and Muslim immigration. But polls commonly show that his strongest\u000abase of support is among moderate-to-liberal Republicans. Conservative\u000apundits,...Let us presume that ISIS, however twisted its ideology, has at\u000aleast a rudimentary understanding of American politics. It wouldn\u2019t take much\u000amore than watching CNN for the terror organization\u2019s leadership to gain a\u000arough grasp of our political dynamic. What would leap off of the TV screen is\u000athat in the aftermath of the attack in San Bernardino, and following Trump\u2019s\u000arelease of his proposal to ban the entry of Muslims, the tycoon's support has\u000asurged. He has double the standing of his nearest rival in national polls and\u000ais gaining momentum. Perhaps even more significantly, they would see\u000atelevision screens showing mass rallies of wildly enthusiastic Americans\u000acheering Trump as he calls to exclude Muslims from American life. Such images\u000aare every bit as valuable to ISIS as images of American soldiers abusing\u000aprisoners at Abu Ghraib.Looking at the American political scene, ISIS would\u000anot need a David Axelrod or a Karl Rove in its ranks to understand that well-\u000atimed terror attacks in the U.S. could spur a dynamic already in motion and\u000athat San Bernardino has accelerated. Although we do not really know how ISIS\u000acalculates the time and locations of its operations, history can be a guide.\u000aAt least some Islamist terrorist attacks appear to have been launched with the\u000agoal of influencing the outcome of elections in democratic societies.The most\u000aprominent instance is the March 11, 2004 attack on the Madrid transit system\u000athree days before the Spanish national elections. Prior to the attack, the\u000agovernment of Prime Minister José María Aznar, which had aligned Spain with\u000athe United States in prosecuting the war in Iraq, was leading in the polls by\u000a5%. The Al Qaeda terror operation succeeded in killing 181 people and maiming\u000a1,800 more, had a demonstrable effect on public opinion. The Socialist Party,\u000aled by José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, who had pledged to end Spain\u2019s\u000aparticipation in the war, ended up winning the election by 5%. It would not be\u000adifficult for the leadership of ISIS, looking at this Al Qaeda success, to\u000ahave concluded that the terror attacks succeeded in swinging the electorate by\u000aa whopping 10 percentage points.Could ISIS attempt to replicate such an\u000ainfluence operation in the United States? There is a high probability that the\u000aresources for carrying out such a strategy are already in place. The FBI says\u000ait has active investigations of ISIS supporters in every state, with some 900\u000aopen cases. And, of course, as alarming as those numbers are, they include\u000aonly the suspects of whom the U.S. intelligence community is aware. As is made\u000aplain by the husband-wife team that conducted the San Bernardino massacre,\u000ahomegrown jihadist cells can acquire lethal weapons and operate in the United\u000aStates completely beneath the radar screen. The FBI and the rest of the\u000aintelligence community do not know what they do not know.Looking at the United\u000aStates in the aftermath of San Bernardino, ISIS might well conclude than\u000aanother such operation \u2014 or several \u2014 in the period immediately before the\u000aIowa caucuses, would fuel enthusiasm for their candidate of choice. If Trump\u000adoes succeed in securing the Republican nomination, they might also conclude\u000athat attacks during the general election season would severely undercut\u000aHillary Clinton. After all, she is inextricably tied to an administration that\u000a\u2014 at that juncture \u2014 would have spectacularly failed to keep the country\u000asecure.One can think of many reasons why such a scenario might not come to\u000apass, not least of which are the now redoubled efforts of the FBI to keep the\u000acountry safe. But as ISIS looks at the disarray in American politics, and if\u000ait has the resources in place, it would have every reason to settle on a\u000astrategy that aims at advancing Trump\u2019s prospects on the American political\u000astage. Even if they fail at the difficult-to-accomplish goal of making Donald\u000aJ. Trump the 45th president of the United States, they would have succeeded\u000ahandsomely in helping him spread his vile and venomous anti-Muslim propaganda.\u000aWin or lose, his candidacy is for them a bonanza._Gabriel Schoenfeld, a senior\u000afellow at the Hudson Institute, was a senior advisor to the Mitt Romney\u000acampaign in 2011 and 2012._**Follow the Opinion section on Twitter\u000a****@latimesopinion**** and ****Facebook**\u000a\u000a

VConservative attacks on the Affordable Care Act long ago took on the qualities\u000aof reflexive, empty rhetoric, of the "say it enough and people will believe\u000ait" variety.As it happens, a couple of statistical releases from the U.S.\u000agovernment give the lie to the most persistent attacks. More on those in a\u000amoment.During their debate Thursday night, the Republican presidential\u000aaspirants took their obligatory shots at Obamacare. Ted Cruz tipped his hat to\u000athe "the single moms who are working two and three jobs, 28, 29 hours a week\u000abecause their hours have been forcibly reduced because of Obamacare," which he\u000acalled "the biggest job-killer in America." He promised to "repeal every\u000aword," a pledge echoed by Marco Rubio.Earlier in the day, Donald Trump\u000areleased his own healthcare plan, taking a swipe at "the incredible economic\u000aburden" of the Affordable Care Act. His proposal turned out to be largely a\u000arehash of Republican shibboleths such as allowing the sale of policies across\u000astate lines, elimination of the individual mandate, and expansion of health\u000asavings accounts, the tax benefits of which flow disproportionately to the\u000arich. Nothing in it supports his promise to protect people with preexisting\u000aconditions; on its face, it would leave them in the lurch.  Now for what the\u000aAffordable Care Act actually has achieved.Every organization examining the\u000auninsured rate has found the same trend: The rate has come down since the\u000aimplementation of the Affordable Care Act.Every organization examining the\u000auninsured rate has found the same trend: The rate has come down since the\u000aimplementation of the Affordable Care Act.As the Department of Health and\u000aHuman Services reported Thursday, "20 million uninsured adults have gained\u000ahealth insurance because of the Affordable Care Act as of early 2016." The\u000afigure includes 17.7 million who gained coverage via the insurance exchanges\u000aor Medicaid, and 2.3 million young adults age 19 to 25 who were able to remain\u000aon a parent's plan up to age 26.The overall uninsured rate has been cut by\u000anearly half, from 20.3% in 2012 to 11.5% now. The trend includes every ethnic\u000agroup and both genders; for whites and non-Hispanic blacks, the reduction in\u000athe uninsured rate exceeds 50%, and for Hispanics the rate has come down from\u000a41.8% to 30.5%.What about the employment effect cited by Cruz? It's not\u000avisible in the real numbers. Since the Affordable Care Act was signed on March\u000a23, 2010, full-time employment growth has been strong and the number of people\u000aemployed part-time for economic reasons has consistently fallen.  Since 2010,\u000athe U.S. has experienced an almost unbroken string of months with job\u000agrowth.Since 2010, the U.S. has experienced an almost unbroken string of\u000amonths with job growth.The number of workers taking part-time jobs for\u000a"economic reasons" -- that is, because they sought full-time work but couldn't\u000afind it, has fallen steadly since the implementation of the Affordable Care\u000aAct. The number of workers taking part-time jobs for "economic reasons" --\u000athat is, because they sought full-time work but couldn't find it, has fallen\u000asteadly since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, total\u000aemployment has consistently risen. In February, the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u000areported Friday, the economy added 242,000 jobs. "Premiums have stayed steady\u000aand the total program cost is under budget," blogger Kevin Drum observed. "If\u000athis is a disaster, we could use a few more disasters like it.

VThe one common element in assertions that thousands of Americans are "gaming"\u000aObamacare by not signing up for health insurance until they get sick, thereby\u000asticking beleaguered insurance companies with a big bill, is that none of\u000athese assertions come attached to any hard numbers.Late last year, the\u000aDepartment of Health and Human Services invited insurers to produce the\u000anumbers, if they had them. It did so by proposing to tighten up on the so-\u000acalled special enrollment periods, or SEPs, that allowed individuals to enroll\u000ain health plans outside the once-a-year open-enrollment window, and asking\u000ainsurers to submit comments and data on the proposal. Most big insurers\u000asubmitted comments, as did AHIP, the health insurance industry's trade group.\u000aNone that I reviewed offered any empirical data -- just blanket assertions\u000athat people are gaming the system.This has become an article of faith and a\u000acore complaint among insurers. The indispensable Charles Gaba of\u000aACASignups.net posted a good update on the controversy on Tuesday. My\u000askeptical take on the complaints appeared in December. Since then, nothing has\u000aemerged to give substance to the insurers' complaints. "We haven't seen any\u000acomments laying out systematic abuse," said Laurel Lucia, healthcare program\u000amanager at UC Berkeley's Center for Labor Research and Education.With the\u000atraditional attack points on the Affordable Care Act having faded away--most\u000aenrollees were already insured (wrong), millions of people lost their coverage\u000aand couldn't replace it (wrong), etc.--Obamacare's critics have been looking\u000afor new ones.An up-and-coming star of this firmament...With the traditional\u000aattack points on the Affordable Care Act having faded away--most enrollees\u000awere already insured (wrong), millions of people lost their coverage and\u000acouldn't replace it (wrong), etc.--Obamacare's critics have been looking for\u000anew ones.An up-and-coming star of this firmament...Instead, she argues in a\u000arecent article on the blog Health Affairs, the evidence points in the opposite\u000adirection -- that the majority of individuals eligible for SEPs _aren't_\u000ataking advantage of them. Many of them are relatively young and healthy, so\u000athe result is that a disproportionate number of SEP enrollees are sicker than\u000athe general population. That's exactly the trend that insurers should want to\u000aavoid. The indications are that the insurers are wrongly treating SEPs as\u000atheir enemy, when they should be trying to make them work better.  Indeed,\u000asome of the comments filed with HHS about SEPs seemed to be flagrant\u000aexaggerations of the problem. Aetna, for example, argued that slack\u000aenforcement of SEPs "poses significant threats [sic] to the viability of the\u000arisk pool." The company counted "40+ SEPs for on-exchange coverage," which\u000a"leave individuals with little incentive to enroll in coverage during open\u000aenrollment, since they can wait until they are sick ... and drop coverage\u000aimmediately after receiving services." Is this plausible? To begin with, it's\u000ahard to see how Aetna came up with more than 40 SEPs, unless it's slicing them\u000avery thin. Aetna didn't list them, and my generous examination of those listed\u000aby the government, treating every minor variation as a separate SEP, still\u000acame up in the mid-20s. (Is "gain or become a dependent due to to a child\u000asupport or other court order" one SEP? Two? Four?)The truth is that the SEPs\u000afall into a handful of well-understood categories. These include "life events"\u000asuch as getting married or divorced; becoming or gaining a dependent via\u000abirth, adoption or placement in foster care; or losing a job and the coverage\u000athat came with it. The qualifying events unique to the Affordable Care Act or\u000aother government assistance programs include becoming a U.S. citizen, moving\u000ato a new state or sometimes within a state, or experiencing a change of income\u000athat makes one newly eligible or ineligible for government subsidies. The\u000agovernment also allows special enrollments if a conventional enrollment was\u000ascrewed up through no fault of the enrollee. Some of these categories are\u000aexpansive, but not all of them are entirely under the consumer's control, and\u000afor Aetna to argue that they cover so many people that it leaves "little\u000aincentive to enroll in coverage during open enrollment" is simply\u000apreposterous.Aetna must think the entire country consists of people plotting\u000ahow to get a quickie marriage or divorce or have a baby just in case they get\u000asick. The vast majority of SEPs cover a relatively trivial number of cases,\u000aunless you think there are hordes of people applying to become members of a\u000aNative American tribe after they get sick.The insurers typically assert that\u000aan inordinately high percentage of new customers are coming in through special\u000aenrollment periods -- as many as 20%, by some reckonings -- and that those\u000acustomers are unusually heavy users of medical services, especially in the\u000afirst months after enrollment. That indicates "'buying to use' behavior," the\u000agiant insurer Anthem said in its statement to HHS. Nothing new to see here,\u000afolks: Churn has long been a feature of the individual health insurance\u000amarket, despite insurers' claims that it's a post-Obamacare phenomenon.Nothing\u000anew to see here, folks: Churn has long been a feature of the individual health\u000ainsurance market, despite insurers' claims that it's a post-Obamacare\u000aphenomenon.But that's far from clear, Lucia said. She noted that the\u000aindividual insurance market always has been subject to short enrollments and\u000aheavy "churn"; a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2014 found that of\u000apeople covered by individual policies in January 2010, only 62% still had that\u000acoverage by July and fewer than half were still on it after two years. The\u000areason is that many people used it just as a bridge to employer-sponsored\u000ainsurance or a government program such as Medicare. That's still the case.As\u000afor the mob undeservedly exploiting SEPs, there's extensive evidence that the\u000aopposite is true. A study by the Urban Institute last year estimated that as\u000amany as 85% of people who were eligible to use SEPs to obtain insurance or\u000afill coverage gaps failed to do so. Similarly, a study published last year by\u000athe University of Minnesota found a similar failure of outreach: "A large\u000anumber of people are potentially eligible for special enrollment periods, and\u000athe majority of them are uninsured."Those researchers, like Lucia and HHS\u000aofficials, have found that millions of SEP-eligible consumers remain unaware\u000aof their eligibility despite efforts by government agencies to find and\u000aeducate them.That leaves only the most motivated consumers to take advantage\u000aof SEPs -- those with medical needs. That doesn't mean they're deliberately\u000agaming the system, only that they're inclined to investigate their options.\u000aIronically, tightening up the SEPs by shortening the windows of eligibility or\u000arequiring more documentation from those experiencing life events is likely to\u000aexacerbate the prevalence of sicker consumers in the SEP group. Forcing\u000ayounger or healthy consumers to jump through more hoops before gaining\u000acoverage will prompt them to give up earlier than sicker patients. The answer,\u000aLucia said, is to make special enrollment more accessible to eligible people,\u000anot to find ways to turn them away. In California, for example, she proposed\u000athat the state insurance exchange, Covered California, coordinate with the\u000astate Employment Development Department "to connect individuals receiving\u000aunemployment insurance with health insurance." The Department of Motor\u000aVehicles could notify Covered California when people change their\u000aaddresses.What may be most important is to treat assertions of widespread\u000agaming with a jaundiced eye. Insurance companies like nothing better than to\u000asimplify their business by eliminating uncertainties, including special\u000aenrollments. The fact that they all claim to see gaming happening, but can't\u000aor won't cite statistics or produce documents to prove it, should make\u000aeveryone suspicious -- of them.**Keep up to date with Michael Hiltzik.

V Since presidential candidate Hillary Clinton quietly updated the healthcare\u000apolicy page on her campaign website over the last few days, most commentators\u000ahave focused on the especially notable paragraphs stating that she will\u000a"continue to support a 'public option' \u2014 and work to build on the Affordable\u000aCare Act to make it possible." The policy page includes several other elements\u000aaimed at improving the Affordable Care Act, including broadening the\u000aaccessibility of heath coverage to otherwise excluded populations and reducing\u000aits cost. More on those in a moment.Clinton's support of the public option has\u000adrawn the most attention because it revives a provision of healthcare reform\u000athat was dropped from the ACA during the drafting and debate era of 2009-2010\u000a\u2014 to the disadvantage of the package as a whole, in the view of many\u000areformers.It's also Clinton's strongest counterpunch to the single-payer plan\u000aproposed by her Democratic opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an\u000aexcessively expensive program that would start reform from square one and\u000aeliminate many of the cost controls written into the ACA. Along with her other\u000aproposals, it's a reproach to Republican presidential candidates whose only\u000aidea is to scrap Obamacare in its entirety, without seriously contemplating\u000ahow to cover Americans in its stead. However you feel about Obamacare, the\u000adifference in their approaches is unmistakable.As Charles Gaba notes, Clinton\u000aisn't kidding when she says she supported the public option in the past \u2014 the\u000aevidence can be found among those accursed emails of hers, which document her\u000aefforts to keep the provision in the bill. (She was acting as an outsider, as\u000ashe had left the Senate to become secretary of State in January 2009.) The\u000apublic option, it will be remembered, was a way to provide competition to the\u000acommercial insurance industry via a government-run alternative, perhaps using\u000aMedicaid-level reimbursement rates for doctors and hospitals. The idea was\u000adropped under pressure from the insurance industry and replaced with a hybrid\u000asystem of nonprofit co-ops, which haven't worked very well. Otto von\u000aBismarck's famous definition of politics as "the art of the possible" gives us\u000aa good assessment of the single-payer health proposal unveiled by Democratic\u000apresidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Sunday: impossible.  That's not to\u000asay that the "Medicare for All" plan offered by Sen....Otto von Bismarck's\u000afamous definition of politics as "the art of the possible" gives us a good\u000aassessment of the single-payer health proposal unveiled by Democratic\u000apresidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Sunday: impossible.  That's not to\u000asay that the "Medicare for All" plan offered by Sen....Clinton's idea is to\u000aestablish the public option beginning at the state level using existing\u000aprovisions of the ACA \u2014 to "work with interested governors, using current\u000aflexibility under the Affordable Care Act, to empower states to establish a\u000apublic option choice."She's referring implicitly to the ACA's section 1332\u000a"innovation waivers." As Andrew Sprung of xpostfactoid observes, these aim to\u000aencourage states to develop alternative mechanisms for health coverage, as\u000along as they hew to Obamacare's coverage and affordability standards. The\u000abeauty of the proposal, Sprung notes, is that it doesn't require additional\u000alegislation."It would, however, need funding," Sprung notes. That's where\u000acooperation between governors and a President Clinton might come in.  And\u000athat's where the waiver might come in. If the state could find other means of\u000asavings, those measures might be integrated in a waiver proposal with a public\u000aoption. In time, state-level public options could be brought upstream to the\u000afederal level and \u2014 _presto! \u2014_ you've re-created the original ACA public\u000aoption.Clinton's other proposals reflect a determination to fix the known\u000ashortcomings of the Affordable Care Act without eroding its consumer\u000aprotections. She would address the sticker shock of deductibles and co-pays of\u000alow-premium individual health plans by providing a tax credit of up to $5,000\u000aper family to cover those out-of-pocket expenses.Clinton also would increase\u000atax subsidies for families by lowering the maximum percentage of income that\u000amakes families eligible for premium subsidies to 8.5%, from the current 9.5%.\u000aAnd she would eliminate the "family glitch," a notorious flaw in the ACA that\u000amakes whole families ineligible for premium subsidies if even one member of\u000athe family is eligible for employer-paid insurance, even if the workplace plan\u000ais too expensive to cover them all.Another proposal is to make Medicaid\u000aexpansion an offer that the last 16 holdout states _\u2014_ all under the control\u000aof anti-Obamacare Republican governors or legislators _\u2014_ can't refuse.\u000aClinton's idea is for the federal government to provide 100% of the\u000aexpansion's cost for the first three years of implementation. Under current\u000alaw, the government pays 100% for three years ending this year, after which\u000aits share declines toward 90% by 2020 and stays there for good.Her hope is\u000athat the prospect of more free money will goad these states to climb down from\u000atheir ideological resistance, even if the prospect of providing decent health\u000acoverage to hundreds of thousands of their lowest-income residents hasn't done\u000athe trick. Finally, Clinton is proposing to extend access to Obamacare\u000aexchange plans to all families, including those of undocumented immigrants.\u000aTheir exclusion from the right to purchase health plans on ACA exchanges\u000aserves no purpose except a punitive one, but those most severely punished are\u000achildren. **Keep up to date with Michael Hiltzik.

VThe notion that mobs of Americans are actively plotting to cheat the\u000aAffordable Care Act by waiting until they get sick and then finding an excuse\u000ato sign up for health insurance is cherished by two groups: anti-Obamacare\u000aconservatives and insurance companies.As we've pointed out in the past,\u000aneither group has actually come up with data to substantiate their claim that\u000athis produces huge losses in the individual exchange market. But there plainly\u000aare good reasons to close any loopholes. The Department of Health and Human\u000aServices on Wednesday announced that it would be tightening the verification\u000arules for customers signing up for insurance during special enrollment\u000aperiods. This is the time frame outside the annual three-month open enrollment\u000aperiod, when anyone can enroll in an individual health plan.Special enrollment\u000ais reserved mostly for those with a major life change warranting a change in\u000ainsurance or new enrollment. Under the new federal rules, anyone claiming\u000aeligibility under four major special categories will have to submit\u000adocumentation. These categories are the loss of coverage, typically through a\u000ajob loss; a permanent move, usually to a new state; birth, adoption or\u000afinancial responsibility for a child; and marriage. The government says these\u000aaccounted for three-fourths of all special enrollments on the federal exchange\u000awebsite in the last half of 2015.Covered California, the state's ACA exchange,\u000ais also taking steps. Following a presentation on the potential cost of\u000aineligible enrollees taking advantage of special enrollment periods, the\u000aexchange is moving toward requiring verification of eligibility for some\u000acategories starting in June. Covered California's board will vote on the\u000amatter in April, but they'll be responding to a report by their actuary that\u000asome health plans in the state are so concerned about the higher costs of\u000acovering special period enrollees that they might seek additional premium\u000aincreases of 2% to 5% for next year "if we do nothing," says the exchange's\u000aexecutive director, Peter V. Lee.With the traditional attack points on the\u000aAffordable Care Act having faded away--most enrollees were already insured\u000a(wrong), millions of people lost their coverage and couldn't replace it\u000a(wrong), etc.--Obamacare's critics have been looking for new ones.An up-and-\u000acoming star of this firmament...With the traditional attack points on the\u000aAffordable Care Act having faded away--most enrollees were already insured\u000a(wrong), millions of people lost their coverage and couldn't replace it\u000a(wrong), etc.--Obamacare's critics have been looking for new ones.An up-and-\u000acoming star of this firmament...The one common element in assertions that\u000athousands of Americans are "gaming" Obamacare by not signing up for health\u000ainsurance until they get sick, thereby sticking beleaguered insurance\u000acompanies with a big bill, is that none of these assertions come attached to\u000aany hard numbers.Late last year,...The one common element in assertions that\u000athousands of Americans are "gaming" Obamacare by not signing up for health\u000ainsurance until they get sick, thereby sticking beleaguered insurance\u000acompanies with a big bill, is that none of these assertions come attached to\u000aany hard numbers.Late last year,..."We're very mindful of the impact of a\u000apremium increase of 2% to 5%," Lee says. That wouldn't be enough to provoke\u000athe dreaded insurance "death spiral" in which higher premiums drive off\u000ahealthier customers, leaving progressively sicker populations to dominate the\u000arisk pool and sending premiums even higher, but it would certainly burden\u000aenrollees who don't receive premium subsidies and thus might be inclined to\u000adrop their coverage.It's unlikely that ineligible enrollees alone are the\u000acause of reported losses by ACA insurers. UnitedHealth Group, which has\u000aemerged as the emblematic big insurer unhappy with the ACA market, has said\u000athat it lost $475 million in that market last year and has already reserved\u000a$245 million against losses this year. Losses on that scale would require\u000amassive gaming by thousands of customers; the root cause of the problems seen\u000aby United may be that, inexperienced in the individual market, the firm\u000aunderpriced its health plans to attract customers and suffered buyer's remorse\u000awhen the customers turned out to be sicker than it expected.The question isn't\u000awhether there's _any_ gaming going on; in any market as large as the ACA's,\u000awith as many facets, there are surely some people who face the desperation of\u000abig medical bills, have figured out how to take advantage and found the\u000aopportunity to do so.Whether there are so many "gamers" that Obamacare itself\u000ais threatened, or so many loopholes that it makes no sense for a rational\u000aperson to sign up for insurance during annual open enrollment periods, as\u000aAetna asserted in a recent government filing, is doubtful. Among other\u000afactors, most people would prefer to have insurance than go without -- that's\u000awhy there was public pressure on Congress and the White House to reform the\u000ahealth insurance market in the first place.Some complaints from insurers are\u000aconsistent with the expected profile of special enrollees. For several\u000areasons, they tend to be sicker or have higher health needs than the general\u000apublic. An uninsured individual who falls ill is more likely to be on the\u000alookout for the opportunity to enroll, but that's not the same as deliberately\u000awaiting. Also, newborn babies, who probably account for a sizable plurality of\u000aspecial enrollment cases, are "much more expensive than other children" and\u000aremain so for their first year. But how much more expensive should the special\u000aenrollment pool be, compared to the overall exchange population? Among\u000aCalifornia's four largest exchange insurers, one found no difference in the\u000acost of the two pools. The other three, however, cited differentials ranging\u000afrom 15% to 50%, all of which seemed higher than expected.Another point of\u000aconcern was that insurers told the Covered California staff that demanding\u000aproof of special enrollment eligibility from applicants in the off-exchange\u000amarket -- these are higher-income customers ineligible for premium subsidies\u000a-- made 15% to 35% of them "disappear," a possible indication that at least\u000asome weren't really eligible. (Asking people to jump through hoops typically\u000adrives even some eligible applicants away, especially those who may be healthy\u000aand not desperate for coverage.) Off-exchange members account for about a\u000athird of the more than 1.8 million enrollees in the California individual\u000amarket.Some health plans documented "hundreds of cases" in which off-exchange\u000aapplicants denied coverage because they couldn't produce proof simply\u000areapplied via California and signed up without documentation, Covered\u000aCalifornia says. Even in the face of these vague indications of gaming,\u000aCovered California actually is stepping up its outreach to potential special\u000aenrollees, rolling out radio and digital ad campaigns to make sure that those\u000awho are eligible know it.  It probably makes sense for the federal and state\u000aexchanges to require documentation of the most common life events, where the\u000averifications are easiest to provide. "We want to maximize enrollment of\u000apeople who are eligible," Lee says, "but also as a matter of program integrity\u000amake sure that people who aren't eligible don't get in."Tightening the special\u000aenrollment rules also could be effective at encouraging people to comply with\u000athe individual mandate during open enrollment. Under Obamacare, people who\u000alack coverage are subject to a monthly tax penalty. For the current year, the\u000apenalty is 2.5% of income, or $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, to a\u000amaximum of $2,085. That's a pittance compared to the cost of obtaining\u000atreatment without insurance for a serious disease. Knowing that the loopholes\u000afor special enrollment have been sewn shut could make people think more\u000aseriously about the cost of bad health."The penalty pales in significance,"\u000aLee says, "compared to getting a diagnosis of uterine cancer in June and\u000agetting stuck with a $100,000 bill."**Keep up to date with Michael Hiltzik.\u000aFollow @hiltzikm on Twitter, see our Facebook page, or email\u000amichael.hiltzik@latimes.com.**\u000a\u000a

VU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination,\u000ahas revealed on the campaign trail that his family no longer is covered by\u000ahealth insurance. Naturally, he blames the Affordable Care Act: "I\u2019ll tell\u000ayou, you know who one of those millions of Americans is who\u2019s lost their\u000ahealthcare because of Obamacare? That would be me," he told an audience in\u000aManchester, N.H., according to Politico. "I don\u2019t have healthcare right\u000anow."If you pay attention, however, you'll discover that Cruz\u2019s quandary is\u000aentirely his own fault. His, and his Republican colleagues in the Senate.\u000a_[UPDATE: It turns out that Cruz actually is insured and always was, as his\u000acampaign disclosed late Friday. This makes his remark about his losing his\u000acoverage because of the Affordable Care Act look even more like pure political\u000aspin. Read on, and see more below.]_Essentially, Cruz\u2019s coverage lapsed\u000abecause his 2015 carrier, BlueCross BlueShield of Texas, ended its individual\u000aPPO plans for 2016, including the family plan that covered the Cruz family.\u000aThe carrier decided to move entirely to HMO plans for the individual market.\u000aAnd Cruz didn\u2019t manage to sign up for a new 2016 plan by Dec. 31. That\u000ahappened even though the insurer announced its decision to close PPO plans way\u000aback on July 23. Five months is normally enough for an educated adult to\u000aarrange health insurance. Cruz still has until Jan. 31 to sign up for coverage\u000abeginning March 1, and he said he\u2019d be doing that. "We\u2019re in the process of\u000afinding another policy," he said. "I hope by the end of the month we\u2019ll have a\u000apolicy for our family."In other words, Cruz\u2019s problem has nothing to do with\u000aObamacare and everything to do with his own sloth \u2014 unless the explanation is\u000amore sinister, as insurance expert Richard Mayhew of balloon-juice.com\u000aspeculates: "The Cruz family is currently uninsured to guarantee their father\u000aa cheap laugh line." In the latest attempt by congressional Republicans to\u000amake theatrical hay out of the Affordable Care Act without actually trying to\u000amake it any better, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) tried to make a\u000apublic spectacle out of his own experience signing up for a health plan.Things\u000adidn't turn...In the latest attempt by congressional Republicans to make\u000atheatrical hay out of the Affordable Care Act without actually trying to make\u000ait any better, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) tried to make a public\u000aspectacle out of his own experience signing up for a health plan.Things didn't\u000aturn...It is widely held that the dopiest anti-Obamacare lawsuit is King vs.\u000aBurwell, a conservative contrivance that tortures four words in the Affordable\u000aCare Act to assert that consumer healthcare subsidies in three dozen states\u000ashould be invalidated.But the Supreme Court has taken up King for a\u000aruling,...It is widely held that the dopiest anti-Obamacare lawsuit is King\u000avs. Burwell, a conservative contrivance that tortures four words in the\u000aAffordable Care Act to assert that consumer healthcare subsidies in three\u000adozen states should be invalidated.But the Supreme Court has taken up King for\u000aa ruling,...What\u2019s more certain is that Cruz\u2019s characterization of his issue\u000ais layered with dishonesty. He claims that the new plans he has examined carry\u000apremium increases of 50% \u2014 "That\u2019s happening all over the country," he said.\u000a"That\u2019s happening in New Hampshire."Well, no. Cruz wasn\u2019t especially\u000aforthcoming with details about his old plan or the new ones he\u2019s examining,\u000abut average rate increases in the individual market in Texas aren\u2019t anywhere\u000anear 50%. No single carrier is getting a rate increase that high; the largest\u000ais 34%, for a very tiny carrier. At some companies, including BlueCross\u000aBlueShield, some rates actually decreased. In New Hampshire, the biggest plans\u000ahad increases in the single digits. At Anthem, the largest individual insurer,\u000asome rates decreased.It\u2019s proper to examine why Cruz is looking for insurance\u000aon the individual exchange in the first place. Until last year, the Cruz\u000afamily got its coverage from his wife\u2019s employer, Goldman Sachs. But after she\u000atook an unpaid leave of absence from her job to help him run for president,\u000athey had to find coverage from his employer \u2014 the federal government.\u000aNormally, Cruz would be eligible for the standard government health insurance\u000aplan enjoyed by all government employees. But thanks to a deliberate monkey\u000awrench forged by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) during the drafting of the\u000aAffordable Care Act, members of Congress and their staffs are required to get\u000atheir insurance through the exchanges \u2014 a biting-your-nose-off-to-spite-your-\u000aface stunt that increased the complexity of health coverage for them all,\u000asince the ACA wasn't designed to substitute for employer insurance.Cruz is\u000astill eligible for the government\u2019s employer subsidy of up to 75% of his\u000ahealth insurance premium. He has said he wouldn\u2019t accept the employer share,\u000awhich makes his complaint about his cost of insurance just a teeny bit more\u000adishonest because he\u2019s the one driving up his own premium.Cruz\u2019s lament is\u000asadly typical of congressional critics of Obamacare, including former Speaker\u000aJohn Boehner, who made the claim in 2013 that his insurance rates had "spiked"\u000abecause of Obamacare. It was just as bogus as Cruz\u2019s complaint, as we\u000ademonstrated here. Former Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) claimed in 2014 that\u000aObamacare had cost him his cancer doctor. Typically, his office refused to\u000aprovide any details, including why the 65-year-old Coburn was using an ACA\u000aplan instead of Medicare. That\u2019s the state of Obamacare criticism on the GOP\u000aside of the aisle. They insist they want to "repeal and replace" Obamacare.\u000aBecause they can\u2019t offer any legitimate reasons to do so, they\u2019re stuck with\u000amaking them up._[More on the Cruz campaign's backtracking: A campaign\u000aspokesman told the Wall Street Journal that the Cruz family had been\u000aautomatically enrolled by BlueCross BlueShield in one of its HMOs, or health\u000amaintenance organizations, as of Jan. 1, when their former PPO plan expired.\u000aThe insurance carrier did this for all 2015 PPO enrollees who took no action\u000abefore Dec. 31. Cruz presumably should have known this, if he was paying\u000aattention, as the insurance carrier informed all affected customers of the\u000achange.__[The campaign says Cruz has now arranged to switch to a PPO plan\u000aoffered in Texas by Humana, effective March 1.]_**Keep up to date with Michael\u000aHiltzik.

V  President Obama doubled down on his push for gun control Thursday at a\u000atelevised town hall meeting in which he said that sales of guns have soared\u000aunder his presidency because gun rights groups have convinced people \u201cthat\u000asomebody is going to come get your guns.""Part of the reason is that the NRA\u000ahas convinced many of its members that somebody is going to come get your\u000aguns," Obama said after admitting that his presidency had been good for gun\u000amanufacturers.The town hall came just two days after Obama announced executive\u000aactions designed, among other goals, to broaden the scope of gun sales subject\u000ato background checks.Obama said that he has never owned a gun but would\u000aoccasionally shoot one at Camp David for skeet shootings.He also said he would\u000a\u201cbe happy\u201d to meet with the National Rifle Association -- which has vocally\u000aopposed to the president\u2019s gun control proposals -- and that he had invited\u000athem to the White House multiple times. Obama criticized the NRA\u2019s decision\u000anot to attend the event, and took aim at their fiery language in response to\u000ahis actions."If you listen to the rhetoric, it is so over the top, and so\u000aoverheated," Obama said.At the town hall, which was hosted and televised by\u000aCNN, Obama took questions from Taya Kyle, whose late husband Chris Kyle was\u000adepicted in the film "American Sniper." Kyle told Obama that gun ownership was\u000aat an all-time high while murder rates are at an historic low, and defended\u000aher right to own a gun.\u201cI want the hope -- and the hope that I have the right\u000ato protect myself; that I don't end up to be one of these families; that I\u000ahave the freedom to carry whatever weapon I feel I need,\u201d Kyle said.\u201cThere is\u000aa way for us to set up a system where you (as) a gun owner ... can have a\u000afirearm to protect yourself but where it is much harder for somebody to fill\u000aup a car with guns and sell them to 13-year-old kids on the streets,\u201d Obama\u000areplied.Obama also took questions from Cleo Pendleton, whose daughter was shot\u000aand killed near Obama's Chicago home, and from Sheriff Paul Babeu, an Arizona\u000alawman and congressional candidate who has accused Obama of unconstitutional\u000apower grabs on guns.He also took questions from controversial Chicago Catholic\u000apriest Rev. Michael Pfleger.\u201cThe reality is that I don't understand why we\u000acan't title guns just like cars,\u201d Pfleger said. \u201cIf I have a car and I give it\u000ato you, Mr. President, and I don't transfer a title, and you're in an\u000aaccident, it's on me.\u201d\u201cIssues like licensing, registration, that's an area\u000awhere there's just not enough national consensus at this stage to even\u000aconsider it. And part of it is, is people's concern that that becomes a\u000aprelude to taking people's guns away,\u201d Obama replied.Also in the audience was\u000aformer Rep. Gabby Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly. Kelly and Giffords\u000abecame prominent gun control advocates after Giffords was shot in 2011.Obama\u000ahas come under heavy fire from Republicans and Second Amendment advocates for\u000ahis actions, which they say infringe on Americans\u2019 right to bear arms.The NRA\u000afired back at Obama while the town hall was still going on. NRA Director Chris\u000aCox told Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly: \u201cThis is an attempt to distract the American\u000apeople away from his failed policies.\u201d\u201cThe NRA does more to teach safe and\u000aresponsible gun ownership than this president ever has or ever will,\u201d Cox\u000asaid.The president also published an opinion piece in Thursday's New York\u000aTimes in which he pledged not to support any candidate who is opposed to gun\u000acontrol.\u201cI will not campaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in\u000amy own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform,\u201d Obama said, a\u000amove that could make Democratic candidates in Republican states feel unable to\u000arequest the political support of the two-term president.White House spokesman\u000aJosh Earnest said before the event that Obama hoped the forum will spur a\u000a"serious conversation" about the Second Amendment as well as the\u000aadministration's new push to tighten gun control rules._The Associated Press\u000acontributed to this report.___\u000a\u000a

V  Fresh off a series of weekend victories in state caucuses, Bernie Sanders\u000aturned up the heat on Hillary Clinton at Sunday\u2019s debate in Flint, Mich.,\u000asharply challenging her economic credentials and suggesting her gun control\u000astand would ban guns in America. But the Democratic front-runner fought back,\u000ablasting him for voting against the auto bailout, dismissing him as a \u201cone-\u000aissue candidate\u201d and hitting him once again for his stance on guns.  The\u000aVermont senator reached back to the 1990s as he went after Clinton\u2019s support\u000afor \u201cdisastrous trade agreements\u201d like NAFTA. His rhetoric was notably more\u000apointed and, reflecting the tension in the race, Sanders even cut her off at\u000atimes as she tried to speak over him. \u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m talking,\u201d Sanders\u000asnapped, during one feisty exchange on the economy. But Clinton pushed back,\u000aand defended the country\u2019s economic progress during her husband\u2019s\u000aadministration. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to argue about the \u201890s, let\u2019s try to get the\u000afacts straight,\u201d she said, touting the jobs and income growth that came with\u000athe era. Sanders also tried to cast Clinton as soft on climate change, while\u000adeclaring he unequivocally does not support fracking. Clinton maintained she\u000ahas the \u201cmost comprehensive plan to combat climate change.\u201d The clashes came\u000aafter Sanders won the Maine Democratic caucuses, adding to wins the night\u000abefore in Nebraska and Kansas \u2014 by far the most successful two days of his\u000acampaign.But Sanders remains significantly behind in the race for delegates,\u000awith Clinton having won more \u2013 and more valuable \u2013 state contests, as well as\u000aenjoying the overwhelming support of so-called \u201csuperdelegates.\u201d Sanders is\u000alooking for a game-changer as the race heads next to states like Michigan this\u000acoming Tuesday, and Ohio and Florida the week after that.Sanders cited his\u000amost recent wins at the end of Sunday\u2019s debate, in arguing he would be the\u000abetter candidate to go up against Republican front-runner Donald Trump.He\u000abegan to joke he\u2019d give his \u201cright arm\u201d to run against the billionaire\u000abusinessman and then cited polls saying, \u201cSanders versus Trump does a lot\u000abetter than Clinton versus Trump.\u201dBut while Sanders said he\u2019s \u201cexciting\u201d\u000aworking-class and young voters, Clinton pointed to the raw numbers.\u201cThere\u2019s\u000aonly one candidate [in either primary campaign] who has more votes than\u000a[Trump], and that\u2019s me,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI will look forward to engaging\u000ahim.\u201dWith the CNN-hosted debate held in Michigan, the state\u2019s economic and\u000acrime problems were front and center.On gun control, the two candidates\u000asparred sharply, with Clinton using the Sandy Hook massacre to make a point\u000aabout holding gun makers responsible for crimes \u2013 and Sanders arguing that\u000aposition would effectively mean an America without guns.The dispute started\u000awhen Sanders defended his past support for a bill to help protect gun\u000amanufacturers and sellers from lawsuits. He said if gun sellers and makers are\u000aheld liable in many of these cases, \u201cWhat you\u2019re really talking about is\u000aending gun manufacturing in America.\u201dClinton countered that no other industry\u000ain America has \u201cabsolute immunity,\u201d and invoked the Sandy Hook mass\u000ashooting.The Democratic rivals were most heated when talking about their\u000arespective records on the economy. Sanders went after Clinton over what he\u000acalled \u201cdisastrous trade agreements\u201d like NAFTA.She countered by pointing out\u000ahe opposed the auto industry bailout. He tried to describe it as the Wall\u000aStreet bailout, and got a little feisty when she started to speak over\u000ahim.\u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m talking,\u201d he said. \u201cYour story is for voting for every\u000adisastrous trade agreement.\u201dClinton then called him a \u201cone-issue candidate.\u201d\u000aAnd on the auto bailout, she said, \u201cIf everybody had voted the way he did, I\u000abelieve the auto industry would have collapsed, taking 4 million jobs with\u000ait.\u201d\u201cMy one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class. That\u2019s my\u000aone issue,\u201d Sanders said.Meanwhile, at the top of the debate, Clinton and\u000aSanders momentarily set aside their differences, to lament the plight of the\u000apeople in the host city of Flint, and call for the governor\u2019s resignation over\u000athe toxic water crisis.Sanders said there\u2019s \u201cblame to go around\u201d but\u000aRepublican Gov. Rick Snyder should resign.Clinton echoed the remarks, saying,\u000a\u201cAmen to that.\u201d\u201cThe governor should resign or be recalled,\u201d she said, while\u000aalso calling on the federal and state governments to send more money to the\u000acity.The city\u2019s water crisis started when the city switched to the Flint River\u000ain 2014 while under a state-appointed emergency manager. While the state has\u000ataken much of the blame, officials with the city and federal government \u2013 as\u000awell as the state \u2013 have also resigned.Clinton faced Sanders on the debate\u000astage as she fights to shake her lone primary rival, who keeps notching just\u000aenough primary and caucus wins to keep his campaign alive, and a threat to her\u000abid.  Sanders rode to victory in Maine in part on a huge turnout \u2014 Sanders\u000abeat Clinton by a ratio of nearly 2-to-1. The turnout was so big Sunday that\u000asome voters had to wait in line for more than four hours in Portland.The\u000avictory gives Sanders a total of three victories over the weekend to Clinton\u2019s\u000aone, in the Louisiana primary. The results from Maine Sunday aren't binding,\u000abut will be used to select a slate of delegates to the state convention, where\u000anational delegates will be elected. Maine will send 25 delegates and 30\u000asuperdelegates.On Super Tuesday last week, Clinton won seven states to\u000aSanders\u2019 four. She maintains a sizeable delegate lead \u2013 which before the Maine\u000acontest stood at 1,121 to 481. It takes 2,383 delegates to win the\u000anomination.But Sanders, even by winning lower-profile contests, has managed to\u000aat least demonstrate lingering weaknesses in the front-runner\u2019s campaign as he\u000adraws an enthusiastic response in the grassroots-driven caucus states. Sanders\u000asees upcoming Midwestern primaries as a crucial opportunity to slow her\u000amomentum by highlighting his trade policies \u2013 though Clinton has led in the\u000apolls in Michigan. \u201cGeographically, we\u2019re looking good,\u201d Sanders said Sunday\u000aon ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cWe have a path.\u201dSanders acknowledged his campaign has\u000ayet to connect with African-American voters, which hurt him badly in his South\u000aCarolina loss last month to Clinton.However, he told ABC, \u201cI think you\u2019re\u000agoing to see those numbers change.\u201d _The Associated Press contributed to this\u000areport.___\u000a\u000a

V  As President Obama visited the community rocked by last week's Oregon\u000acollege shooting Friday, the president was reportedly considering executive\u000aaction on gun background checks -- after he called for Americans to turn gun\u000acontrol into a political issue in the wake of the shooting.Obama met Friday\u000awith survivors and families of those killed in the attack at Umpqua Community\u000aCollege in Roseburg, Ore. The gunman killed nine before killing himself. "I've\u000agot some very strong feelings about this, because when you talk to these\u000afamilies, you are reminded that this could be happening to your child, or your\u000amom, or your dad, or your relative, or your friend," Obama said at the end of\u000ahis visit."And so, we're going to have to come together as a country to see\u000ahow we can prevent these issues from taking place," he said.The Washington\u000aPost reported that the White House is considering executive action that would\u000acompel background checks for "individuals who buy from dealers who sell a\u000asignificant number of guns each year." Dealers who exceed a certain number of\u000asales each year would be required to obtain a license and perform background\u000achecks, the Post reported.Current law says only those \u201cengaged in the\u000abusiness\u201d of selling guns need to obtain a license and perform a background\u000acheck. Exempted are those who make occasional sales, or who buy or sell guns\u000aas part of a personal collection or for a hobby.Obama himself had not ruled\u000aout the possibility of acting unilaterally on the issue, saying in his news\u000aconference after the shooting that he had asked his team to see what he could\u000ado on his own to address gun violence. \u201cIn terms of what I can do, I've asked\u000amy team, as I have in the past, to scrub what kinds of authorities do we have\u000ato enforce the laws that we have in place more effectively to keep guns out of\u000athe hands of criminals.  Are there additional actions that we can take that\u000amight prevent even a handful of these tragic deaths from taking place?\u201d Obama\u000asaid at the Oct. 1 news conference.The proposal to expand background checks\u000aoriginally was part of a package of considerations mulled after the 2012\u000ashooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., but was rejected\u000aafter federal lawyers expressed concern that setting a numerical threshold\u000acould be legally challenged, and ATF officials voiced objections that it would\u000abe hard to enforce, the Post reported.On Monday, White House Press Secretary\u000aJosh Earnest refused to rule out executive action from the Oval Office on the\u000aissue \u2013 saying it was an \u201congoing\u201d effort on the part of the president\u2019s\u000ateam.\u201cAnd the fact is there are a lot of things that can be done that don't\u000aundermine the basic constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans,\u201d Earnest\u000asaid.Obama risks being outflanked on the issue by former secretary of state\u000aand 2016 Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton who this week\u000aannounced a number of gun control proposals, including overturning a law that\u000aprevents families of shooting victims from suing gun makers and using\u000aexecutive action to change the definition of who qualifies as a firearms\u000adealer.**RELATED VIDEO: The truth about gun crime in America**Obama\u2019s attempts\u000ato pass gun control measures through Congress previously have been\u000aunsuccessful, and in 2013 he announced 23 executive actions in the wake of the\u000aNewtown massacre. In his remarks after the Roseburg shooting, he called on the\u000aU.S. to turn gun control into a political issue.\u201cAnd, of course, what\u2019s also\u000aroutine is that somebody, somewhere, will comment and say, Obama politicized\u000athis issue. Well, this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to\u000aour common life together, to the body politic,\u201d Obama said.However, any gun\u000aproposals would likely see unified opposition among Republicans in Congress\u000aand GOP 2016 hopefuls. Republicans argue that mental health, not guns, are to\u000ablame for mass shootings and that White House proposals on the issue would\u000aviolate the Second Amendment and wouldn\u2019t do much, if anything, to prevent\u000amass shootings."Talk of gun control makes the liberals feel warm and fuzzy.\u000aHowever, the cold reality is that when you disarm the good guys you put them\u000aat the mercy of the bad guys. That\u2019s what gun control does," Former Arkansas\u000aGov. Mike Huckabee said Friday in an opinion piece for FoxNews.com. The\u000apresident may face opposition to his gun control proposals even in the town of\u000aRoseburg when he visits Friday, although the White House has said that the\u000avisit will be about comforting the victims, not about proposing new gun\u000alaws.Staunchly conservative Douglas County is filled with gun owners who use\u000atheir firearms for hunting, target shooting and self-protection. A commonly\u000aheld opinion in the area is that the solution to mass killings is more people\u000acarrying guns, not fewer."The fact that the college didn't permit guards to\u000acarry guns, there was no one there to stop this man," Craig Schlesinger,\u000apastor at the Garden Valley Church, told The Associated Press._The Associated\u000aPress contributed to this report.___\u000a\u000a

VRick Ector, of Detroit, recently told FoxNews.com that people carrying guns,\u000awhether openly or concealed, lowers crime. Second Amendment groups are\u000aaccusing the gun control lobby of putting law-abiding owners of firearms in\u000adanger by urging people to call the police on anyone carrying a gun in\u000apublic.As more states relax rules about open-carrying of guns, the Coalition\u000ato Stop Gun Violence has taken to social media to urge the public to assume\u000agun-toters are trouble, and to call the cops on anyone they feel may be a\u000athreat.\u201cIf you see someone carrying a firearm in public\u2014openly or\u000aconcealed\u2014and have ANY doubts about their intent, call 911 immediately and ask\u000apolice to come to the scene,\u201d the group wrote on its widely followed Facebook\u000apage. \u201cNever put your safety, or the safety of your loved ones, at the mercy\u000aof weak gun laws that arm individuals in public with little or no criminal\u000aand/or mental health screening.\u201dThat approach, according to a blog post by\u000aOhio-based Buckeye Firearms Association, could give rise to needless, tense\u000aconfrontations between police and gun owners. The association and other\u000asimilar groups liken the tactic to \u201cswatting,\u201d or the act of tricking an\u000aemergency service into dispatching responders based on a false report. Many\u000aonline harassment campaigns have been known to participate in the\u000apractice.\u201cThis practice is exactly what they [Coalition to Stop Gun Violence]\u000aare doing,\u201d said Erich Pratt, spokesman for Virginia-based Gun Owners of\u000aAmerica. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing if someone is using a gun in an illegal or unlawful\u000amanner. No one is questioning that. But this clearly sounds like\u000aswatting.\u201d\u201cThey are inciting their radical base to turn their own neighbors\u000ain.\u201d- Erich Pratt, Gun Owners of America Pratt adds that it may be a move of\u000adesperation by those looking to get guns off the streets.\u201cAnti-gun advocates\u000aare clearly frustrated. They want guns banned,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they have been\u000athwarted in the past, so they are looking for alternative means.\u201cThey are\u000ainciting their radical base to turn their own neighbors in.\u201dIt is not the\u000afirst time supporters of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and other gun\u000acontrol advocates have pressed for the public to call cops on legal gun\u000aowners. An October 2014 National Review article found that the Facebook pages\u000aand websites of groups including the coalition, Moms Demand Action and\u000aGunFreeZone.net included numerous comments from the public advocating that\u000apeople call the police and intentionally exaggerate what they see in the hopes\u000aof getting cops to stop those open-carrying guns.Open carry rules, in one form\u000aor another, are legal in every state except for five\u2014California, Florida,\u000aIllinois, New York, and South Carolina, as well as the District of Columbia.\u000aHowever, many states that do permit open carry have put in place stringent\u000alaws that require some sort of permit or license.In this august posting on\u000atheir Facebook page, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence urges the public to\u000acall the cops on any legal open carry gun owner that they feel may be a\u000athreat. (Buckeye Firearms Association) The main issue that gun advocates have\u000awith the Coalition\u2019s tactics is the potential of putting law-abiding citizens\u000ain real danger. Officials for the anti-gun group say that this is not the\u000acase.\u201cIn an era in which individuals are being allowed to carry loaded guns on\u000aour streets with no permit, background check or required training, it is\u000acommon sense for concerned citizens to call 911 when they see an armed\u000aindividual whose intentions are unclear,\u201d Ladd Everitt, director of\u000acommunications for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence said in a statement to\u000aFoxNews.com. \u201cThese [open carry] laws guarantee that we\u2014and law\u000aenforcement\u2014will have no idea about the criminal and/or mental health\u000abackground of these individuals until they actually commit a crime; and by\u000athen it could be far too late.  We have full confidence in our men and women\u000ain blue to assess these situations. \u201cGun-toters who are truly law-abiding and\u000amentally competent have nothing whatsoever to worry about. Their conversations\u000awith law enforcement will be brief and professional,\u201d he added. \u201cAs for those\u000awho are dangerous and have something to hide which would not withstand the\u000ascrutiny of a background check or permitting process, they should expect to\u000aface some tough questions as a result of these 911 calls. And that makes us\u000aall safer.\u201dBut the Buckeye Firearms Association believes the effort amounts to\u000a"conspiring to obstruct legal justice.\u201dPratt agreed, and said people who call\u000athe police without legitimate reason should be charged.\u201cThey would likely be\u000athe ones arrested for filing a false report,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we are certainly\u000ahoping that would be the case.\u201d__Perry Chiaramonte is a reporter for\u000aFoxNews.com.

VFriday, Oct. 9, 2015: President Obama waves as he boards Air Force One before\u000ahis departure from Andrews Air Force Base, Md. Obama is traveling to Roseburg,\u000aOre., to meet with families of the victims of the Oct. 1, shooting at Umpqua\u000aCommunity College, as part of a four-day West Coast tour. President Obama\u2019s\u000aunwelcome visit to Roseburg, Oregon Friday makes one thing clear: he is\u000aclearly more interested in politicizing the nine dead victims at Umpqua\u000aCommunity College than reducing violence in America. If the president truly\u000awanted to solve the issue, he wouldn\u2019t call for new gun restrictions, he\u2019d\u000ainstead address the root cause of violence in America \u2013 sin and evil and the\u000afamilies broken and torn apart because of it.President Obama\u2019s hometown of\u000aChicago would actually be a perfect place to start. Despite restrictions on\u000aguns in Chicago, bullets spray like summertime sprinklers in Obama\u2019s\u000ahometown.This year alone, there have been 2,300 shooting victims.  Obama\u2019s\u000afellow community organizers on the South Side live in a war zone, and the dots\u000amarking crime spots on these neighborhood maps look like a decade-old\u000adartboard. Local gang territories mirror school district maps, so teachers and\u000aparents protest redrawn school districts because it inevitably means open\u000awarfare. On Sunday a man was shot to death and four others were wounded,\u000aincluding two 14-year-old teens, just a few miles from the President's Chicago\u000ahome. When it comes to advancing his liberal agenda, President Obama will\u000aexploit anything, even death and suffering.On weekend nights throughout the\u000asummer, ambulances and emergency rooms staff-up to treat the inevitable\u000acasualties. In the past two years, there have been 500 murders and more than\u000a5,000 shooting victims.  The South Side of Chicago would be a perfect place\u000afor the president to condemn the root causes of this senseless violence \u2013 the\u000aevil and sin. That evil and sin has broken homes leaving children with no good\u000arole models, devalued life and made people believe the lie that one life is\u000amore important than another. President Obama should use the White House pulpit\u000ato confront this issue head on and crush our culture of violence that\u000aglorifies death and destruction. Lack of respect for life and the ever\u000aincreasing coarseness and crudeness in our culture contribute to a community\u000aof indifference, self-centeredness, and mayhem.  This evil infects\u000aneighborhoods, parks, and bus stops every day. Most of the victims are\u000ateenagers and young adults, but in the past decade, more than 90 children\u000aunder five have been killed in the crossfire.But instead of going to Chicago\u000ato address the real issue, Obama travels to Oregon to politicize last week\u2019s\u000acommunity college shooting and demand ineffective backwards gun-control\u000apolicies that empower criminals and terrorists at the expense of law-abiding\u000acitizens.When it comes to advancing his liberal agenda, President Obama will\u000aexploit anything, even death and suffering.The Oregon shooting occurred in a\u000a\u201cgun-free zone.\u201d  It\u2019s time we realize that \u201cgun-free zones\u201d are \u201csitting duck\u000azones.\u201d If existing gun laws did not prevent this massacre, there\u2019s no reason\u000ato believe more restrictive laws will.  In fact, I keep asking liberals: \u2018What\u000alaw could we pass that would\u2019ve prevented this?\u201d  Liberals never have an\u000aanswer because there isn\u2019t one and they know it.   Obama\u2019s hometown has some\u000aof the toughest, strictest gun laws in America.  Prohibitions, bans,\u000aregistrations, confiscations, and mandates\u2014Chicago has it all. And what has it\u000aaccomplished to make the streets safer? Absolutely nothing. Chicago remains\u000aone of the most dangerous and violence cities in America.  This real issue, at\u000aits core, demonstrates how conservatives differ from liberals whenever any\u000a\u201cnew\u201d law is being discussed:  Liberals ask, \u201cHow does this law make me feel?\u201d\u000aConservatives ask, \u201cWhat does this law do?" Talk of gun control makes the\u000aliberals feel warm and fuzzy.  However, the cold reality is that when you\u000adisarm the good guys you put them at the mercy of the bad guys. That\u2019s what\u000agun control does.  The Second Amendment is the last line of defense against\u000aevil and tyranny and it must be protected.__Former Arkansas Governor Mike\u000aHuckabee is a 2016 Republican candidate for president of the United States.__  \u000a\u005c+ Follow**FoxNewsOpinion** on Facebook\u000a\u000a

V"This is a struggle between two of the largest cultures on Earth, and it is in\u000athe shadow of catastrophic climate conditions," bin Laden wrote. (AP\u000aPhoto/Courtesy of Al-Jazeera via APTN, File)Climate change activists seeking\u000adrastic change have an ally about as welcome as a mountain of burning tires:\u000aUsama bin Laden. In a newly released letter seized during the 2011 raid that\u000akilled the Al-Qaeda leader, he urges Americans to launch a "great revolution\u000afor freedom" to untether President Obama from the influences of corporate\u000alobbyists and fight climate change, Reuters reports.Getting rid of lobbyists\u000awould let Obama make "a rational decision to save humanity from the harmful\u000agases that threaten its destiny," he writes. The rambling letter, which is\u000aaddressed "especially [to] the youth" of America, appears to date from early\u000ain Obama's first term and includes references to the 2008 economic crisis,\u000aMediaite reports.Bin Laden apparently wasn't a fan of bank bailouts: America's\u000afinancial system was 48 hours away from collapse when the administration used\u000ataxpayer money to "rescue the vultures by using the assets of the victims," he\u000awrites.In another letter, he argues that reducing greenhouse gas emissions\u000awould be a good way to mark the 10th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, saying\u000athe world "should put its efforts into attempting to reduce the release of\u000agases" instead of fighting Islam.Both letters are unsigned, but US\u000aintelligence officials have attributed them to bin Laden. Also among the\u000adocuments released Tuesday: a handwritten will that explained where his\u000amillions should go.(An earlier release of bin Laden letters included love\u000anotes and warnings about sinister dentists.)This article originally appeared\u000aon Newser: Osama Wanted Americans to Fight ...

VYale is closing its Climate &amp; Energy Institute. After years of feeling the\u000aheat, Yale\u2019s Climate &amp; Energy Institute is finally facing an inconvenient\u000atruth: the program will close at the end of June.The shuttering follows three\u000aconsecutive years of budget cuts for the program, which was established eight\u000ayears ago to conduct climate change research. The impending closure was\u000aannounced Monday afternoon in an email from the institute\u2019s co-directors,\u000ageology and geophysics professors David Bercovici and Jay Ague, and reported\u000aby the Yale Daily News.\u201cWhile not all good things have to come to an end,\u000asometimes they just do,\u201d the email said.Despite the institute\u2019s termination,\u000aYale\u2019s Energy Studies program will continue.The institute\u2019s purpose is to\u000aanalyze how climate change interacts with modern energy use. Students have\u000aconducted research on topics such as monitoring groundwater during fracking\u000aand how climate change impacts diarrhea rates. Recent lectures have included\u000a\u201cclimate change and human rights,\u201d \u201cclimate change and evolving investment\u000astrategies\u201d and \u201cshould Yale adopt an internal carbon tax?\u201dWarning signs that\u000athe end was near had been on the horizon for years, as budget cuts reportedly\u000agutted the program.\u201cThey eventually cut funding so much that it just became\u000abuying food,\u201d student James Barile told The Daily News.Several students\u000ainvolved with the institute expressed shock and frustration with the\u000adecision.\u201cIt can\u2019t be a budget thing. It can\u2019t be,\u201d YCEI New Haven Energy\u000aScholar Intern Matthew Goldkang said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say that Yale doesn\u2019t\u000asupport [the YCEI], but\u2026I think it\u2019s the administration\u2019s lack of interest. I\u000ahad no idea we were going to be completely cut. It\u2019s really sad.\u201d__\u005c+\u000aFollow**FoxNewsSciTech** on Facebook\u000a\u000a

VFile photo - Heimdal Glacier in southern Greenland is seen in a NASA image\u000acaptured by Langley Research Center's Falcon 20 aircraft Oct. 13, 2015\u000a(REUTERS/NASA/John Sonntag/Handout via Reuters) Climate change may not have\u000aplayed a role in Vikings\u2019 10th-century colonization of Greenland and\u000aabandonment of their colonies 400 years later, according to a new study.The\u000areport published in the journal Science Advances challenges the long-held\u000atheory that Vikings settled on Greenland during warmer temperatures during the\u000aso-called Medieval Warm Period. Researchers analyzed chemical isotopes in\u000aboulders that were left by advancing glaciers over the last 1,000 years in\u000aSouthwestern Greenland and nearby Baffin Island. Evidence points to a\u000adifferent story where Vikings settled a far colder, icier Greenland.The\u000afindings reveal that the Medieval Warm Period, a balmy season that Europe\u000aexperienced from 950-1250, was not felt elsewhere, including Greenland.\u000aRecords show that Vikings first sailed from Iceland to Greenland in 985. They\u000asettled there in the 10th Century and anywhere from 3,000-5,000 settlers lived\u000aon Greenland, farming and harvesting walrus ivory.**Related: **Stonehenge\u000astones may have been first erected in another country\u201cIt\u2019s becoming clearer\u000athat the Medieval Warm Period was patchy, not global,\u201d said lead author\u000aNicolás Young, a glacial geologist at Columbia University\u2019s Lamont-Doherty\u000aEarth Observatory, in a statement. \u201cThe concept is Eurocentric - that\u2019s where\u000athe best-known observations were made. Elsewhere, the climate might not have\u000abeen the same.\u201dThe research not only challenges climate theories about the\u000atime when Greenland was settled by Vikings, it also calls into question long-\u000aheld beliefs about the disappearance of the Viking settlers a handful of\u000agenerations later. It was once believed that the colonies, which vanished\u000asometime between 1360 and 1460, succumbed to a colder climate. The Vikings\u2019\u000adisappearance was thought to have followed the onset of the so-called Little\u000aIce Age, which ran from about 1300-1850. Experts, however, have questioned\u000athis theory, noting the lack of early historical climate records from\u000aGreenland.While the disappearance of the colonies remains a mystery, other\u000atheories now include hostility with the native Inuit, a decline in ivory trade\u000aand soil erosion caused by the Vikings\u2019 cattle.**Related:** Ancient 'wand' may\u000abe oldest example of lead work in the Levant\u201cI do not like the simplistic\u000aargument that the Greenland people went there when it was warm, and then \u2018it\u000agot cold and they died\u2019,\u201d said Astrid Ogilvie, a climate historian based at\u000aIceland\u2019s Akureyri University, in the statement. \u201cI think the Medieval Warm\u000aPeriod has been built on many false premises, but it still clings to the\u000apopular imagination.\u201dEuropeans did not re-inhabit Greenland until the\u000a1700s.The rocks were analyzed at the University of Buffalo, and at the Lamont-\u000aDoherty lab of geochemist and study coauthor Joerg Schaefer. The analyses\u000ameasured buildups of small amounts of Beryllium 10, an isotope created when\u000acosmogenic rays strike rock surfaces newly exposed by melting ice, according\u000ato the statement.In addition to Young and Schaefer, the paper was coauthored\u000aby Avriel Schweinsberg and Jason Briner of the University at Buffalo, who\u000acarried out the Greenland part of the fieldwork.__\u005c+ Follow**FoxNewsSciTech**\u000aon Facebook\u000a\u000a

V  President Obama hailed the approval of a far-reaching global climate accord\u000ato limit greenhouse gas emissions adopted Saturday in Paris, in a statement\u000afrom the White House Cabinet Room Saturday afternoon.Praising the pact as a\u000a\u2018turning point for the world,\u2019 Obama commended leaders from more than 190\u000acountries for working together \u201cto show what is possible when the world stands\u000aas one.\u201dLeaders of the many nations involved had been negotiating the pact for\u000afour years after earlier attempts to reach such a deal failed.Loud applause\u000ashook the large Paris conference hall where the talks were being held after\u000aFrench Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius gaveled final approval of the agreement\u000aearlier in the day. Some delegates started crying. Others embraced.\u201cIn short,\u000athis agreement will mean less of pollution that threatens our planet. Full\u000aimplementation of this agreement and will pave the way for more progress in\u000astages over the years. It sends a powerful signal: a low carbon future, in\u000aclean energy at a scale we have never seen before.\u201d Obama said.The pact, known\u000aas \u201cthe Paris agreement,\u201d is supposed to take effect in 2020 and strives to\u000alimit global temperature rise even more, to 1.5 degrees Celsius.Sky News\u000areported that countries most vulnerable to climate change had lobbied for the\u000a1.5C limit while big polluters such as China, India and Saudi Arabia preferred\u000a2C.In his remarks, Obama also hit back at critics and \u201cskeptics [who] said\u000athese actions would kill jobs.\u201d\u201cInstead\u2026we have driven our economic output to\u000aall-time highs in nearly two decades.\u201d\u201cAll countries have a role to play in\u000aclimate change, wind and solar [energy] \u2026creating a new and steady stream of\u000amiddle class jobs,\u201d Obama said.Responding to the climate pact\u2019s approval,\u000aSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called its goals\u000a\u201cunattainable,\u201d and slammed Obama\u2019s claims about what the international deal\u000awould achieve:\u201cThe President is making promises he can\u2019t keep, writing checks\u000ahe can\u2019t cash, and stepping over the middle class to take credit for an\u000a\u2018agreement\u2019 that is subject to being shredded in 13 months,\u201d the Senate\u2019s top\u000aRepublican, and a staunch Obama critic, said in a statement released following\u000athe speech.Secretary of State John Kerry praised the new accord as a "victory\u000afor all of the planet and for future generations."Kerry told fellow\u000anegotiators Saturday in Paris that "it will help the world prepare for the\u000aimpacts of climate change that are already here and also for those that we\u000aalready know are on our way inevitably."He added the pact would "prevent the\u000aworst most devastating consequences of climate change from ever happening."The\u000avote to adopt the agreement was held up for two hours because of a last-minute\u000asnag involving the U.S., the Associated Press reported, citing a Western\u000adiplomat as its source.The diplomat said the U.S. wanted the word "shall"\u000achanged to "should" in a clause on emissions targets out of fears that it\u000amight require the Obama administration to seek approval from the Republican-\u000acontrolled Senate.Hours earlier, Fabius said the climate talks would be a\u000a\u201chistoric turning point\u201d if delegates were to adopt the final draft as\u000apresented by the French government.The deal on climate change will limit\u000awarming to \u201cwell below\u201d 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), Fabius\u000asaid, according to Sky News.\u201cThe world is holding its breath, it\u2019s counting on\u000aall of us,\u201d the minister added.In the pact, the countries pledge to limit the\u000aamount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that\u000atrees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between\u000a2050 and 2100.In practical terms, achieving that goal means the world would\u000ahave to stop emitting greenhouse gases -- most of which come from the burning\u000aof oil, coal and gas for energy -- altogether in the next half-century,\u000ascientists said. That's because the less we pollute, the less pollution nature\u000aabsorbs.Achieving such a reduction in emissions would involve a complete\u000atransformation of how people get energy, and many activists worry that despite\u000athe pledges, countries are not ready to make such profound and costly\u000achanges.The deal now needs to be ratified by individual governments -- at\u000aleast 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global emissions --\u000abefore taking effect.Negotiators had a few hours to analyze the draft before\u000athe vote to adopt it took place. French President Francois Hollande, who\u000ajoined the meeting Saturday to underscore the deal\u2019s importance, urged\u000aapproval.\u201cThe decisive agreement for the plant is here and now,\u201d Hollande\u000asaid. \u201cFrance calls upon you to adopt the first universal agreement on\u000aclimate.\u201dAn air of optimism surrounded the negotiations late Friday that had\u000abeen missing only hours earlier."We are pretty much there," Egyptian\u000aEnvironment Minister Khaled Fahmy, the chairman of a bloc of African\u000acountries, told The Associated Press late Friday. "There have been tremendous\u000adevelopments in the last hours. We are very close."A top climate scientist who\u000awas critical of draft negotiation texts on Friday has praised the final draft\u000aas being consistent with science.John Schellnhuber, director of Germany's\u000aPotsdam Institute for Climate Research, says that "if agreed and implemented,\u000athis means bringing down greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero within a few\u000adecades."He says the accord presented Saturday "is in line with the scientific\u000aevidence we presented of what would have to be done to limit climate risks\u000asuch as weather extremes and sea-level rise. To stabilize our climate, CO2\u000aemissions have to peak well before 2030 and should be eliminated as soon as\u000apossible after 2050."The  draft removes controversial terms like "climate\u000aneutrality" or "emissions neutrality" which had appeared in earlier drafts but\u000awere met with opposition from countries including China.The deal marks the\u000aworld\u2019s first comprehensive climate agreement with all countries, not just\u000awealthy ones, taking action to tackle global warming.The agreement comes after\u000amore than two decades of U.N. efforts to persuade governments to work together\u000ato reduce the man-made emissions that scientists say are warming the planet.\u000aMelting glaciers, rising seas and expanding deserts linked to such climate\u000achange are threatening populations around the world, the Associated Press\u000areported.Activists held protests across Paris on Saturday, demanding even\u000atougher limits and to call attention to populations threatened by climate\u000achange."This puts the fossil fuel industry on the wrong side of history," said\u000aKumi Naidoo of Greenpeace. "This deal alone won't dig us out of the hole we're\u000ain."The world has already warmed by about 1 degree Celsius since pre-\u000aindustrial times, and poor low-lying nations have pushed to set a goal of\u000alimiting the rise to another half-degree on top of that.Ben Strauss, a sea\u000alevel researcher at Climate Central, said limiting warming to 1.5 degrees\u000ainstead of 2 degrees could potentially cut in half the projected 280 million\u000apeople whose houses will eventually be submerged by rising seas.The previous\u000aemissions treaty, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, included only rich countries and\u000athe U.S. never signed on. The last climate summit, in Copenhagen in 2009,\u000aended in failure when countries couldn't agree on a binding emissions\u000apact._Fox News' Chad Pergram, Wes Barrett and the Associated Press contributed\u000ato this report._Click here for more from Sky News.   __\u000a\u000a

VFeb. 26, 2016: IOC President Thomas Bach waits for the beginning of the\u000aextraordinary FIFA congress in Zurich, Switzerland. (AP)Olympic officials have\u000aidentified 43 candidates for a team of refugee athletes who will compete in\u000athe Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro in a "message of hope" for millions of\u000arefugees around the world, the IOC said Wednesday.IOC President Thomas Bach\u000asaid he expects between five and 10 athletes to be selected for a team that\u000awill compete under the Olympic flag as "Team Refugee Olympic Athletes."The\u000afinal list of athletes will be named by the International Olympic Committee\u000aexecutive board in June.The team will march in the opening ceremony in Rio on\u000aAug. 5 just before the athletes from host Brazil."By welcoming this team of\u000arefugee athletes to Rio, we want to send a message of hope for all refugees of\u000athe world," Bach said at the close of a two-day IOC executive board meeting in\u000aLausanne.The IOC said in December that three potential Olympic athletes had\u000abeen identified from among the wave of refugees and migrants from Syria and\u000aother troubled regions coming into Europe. Dozens of others have now been\u000adiscovered in various refugee camps."These athletes have no national team to\u000abelong to, they have no flag to march behind, no national anthem to be\u000aplayed," Bach said. "We will welcome these refugee athletes with the Olympic\u000aflag and with the Olympic anthem."No details were given on where the potential\u000ateam members come from or which sports they compete in.The IOC had already\u000apledged $2 million to help refugees, and asked authorities in refugee camps to\u000aidentify any top-level international athletes.Bach said candidates for the\u000aOlympic team will be checked for their eligibility, nationality and refugee\u000astatus."We will have to see what qualifications they can achieve," he said.\u000a"My gut feeling is this team will end up with between five and 10\u000aathletes."Bach said the IOC will appoint officials, coaches and other\u000apersonnel for the team. The IOC will also provide team uniforms for the\u000aathletes.Bach stressed the refugees will be treated like all other teams that\u000aare represented by national Olympic committees. They will live together with\u000aother athletes in the Olympic Village.The refugees receive financial and other\u000aassistance from the IOC's Olympic Solidarity program. The IOC is covering all\u000atheir travel and other expenses.Athletes chosen for the Olympic team will go\u000athrough drug-testing procedures administered by the World Anti-Doping Agency,\u000aBach said.__\u000a\u000a

The fire damaged a former hotel that was being converted into\u000aa refugee home and two people were detained after hindering firefighters\u000awork, police said (Rico Loeb/dpa via AP) BERLIN \u2013  Onlookers celebrated as a\u000asuspected arson fire damaged a former hotel being converted into a refugee\u000ahome in eastern Germany, police said Sunday, raising new concerns about\u000aviolence toward new arrivals in a nation that registered more than a million\u000aasylum-seekers last year.The blaze in the roof of the building in Bautzen, in\u000athe eastern state of Saxony, broke out overnight. Police said no one was\u000ainjured but a group of people gathered outside, some "commenting with\u000aderogatory remarks or unashamed joy" at the fire.While most Germans have been\u000awelcoming toward refugees, a vocal minority has staged protests in front of\u000arefugee homes, especially in the east. Germany last year saw a surge in\u000aviolence against such lodgings.Police ordered three people to leave the fire\u000ascene because they were hampering firefighters' work and then temporarily\u000adetained two of them, whom they described as intoxicated 20-year-old locals,\u000aafter they ignored the order.Investigators found traces of a fire accelerant\u000aat the scene and believe the fire was caused by arson, police said. It wasn't\u000aimmediately clear whether the building can be restored.Saxony is home to the\u000aanti-Islam and anti-immigration group PEGIDA, and incidents there have caused\u000aconcern before. In August, a mob in Heidenau, outside Dresden, hurled bottles\u000aand fireworks at police protecting a shelter being set up for refugees.The\u000aBautzen fire came after a mob in the small town of Clausnitz, also in Saxony,\u000aon Thursday screamed "We are the people!" and "Go home!" as they blocked a bus\u000acarrying asylum-seekers outside a new refugee home.Police drew criticism in\u000athat case for roughly hauling some refugees off the bus into the building \u2014\u000awhich they insist was necessary to prevent the situation from escalating \u2014 and\u000afor saying that some of the refugees had made provocative gestures.Saxony\u000aGovernor Stanislaw Tillich called the two incidents "appalling and shocking"\u000aand described the perpetrators as "criminals.""This is abhorrent and\u000adisgusting," Tillich told the Funke newspaper group. He pledged that\u000aauthorities will investigate and "bring everyone responsible to\u000aaccount."Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said that everyone in Germany is\u000aentitled to express their concerns "but there is a threshold of decency and\u000alaw that must not be crossed \u2014 and this threshold was clearly crossed in the\u000aincidents in Saxony," the news agency dpa reported."It is completely\u000aunacceptable for people who are seeking protection from persecution here to be\u000agreeted with hatred and agitation," de Maiziere added.Later Sunday, the\u000aminister defended police actions in Clausnitz, saying they were right to get\u000aall the refugees off the bus quickly and into the building. If the bus had\u000abeen backed away from the refugee home, "these bawling people would have had\u000atheir way," de Maiziere said on ARD television.__\u000a\u000a

VA makeshift camp for migrants near Calais, France. A French court approved\u000arazing tents at a camp known as the "jungle." (AP Photo/Jerome Delay)CALAIS,\u000aFrance \u2013  A French court on Thursday gave the state the green light to raze\u000atents and lean-tos sheltering hundreds of migrants in a sprawling slum camp in\u000aCalais, where thousands dream of getting to Britain.The camp in the northern\u000aport city -- known as the "jungle" -- has been an embarrassing and often\u000ashocking chapter in Europe's migrant crisis, and the state announced this\u000amonth that the densely populated southern half would be razed.Associations\u000aprotesting the move took the issue to court seeking a postponement of a\u000adeadline reached last Tuesday for migrants to move out.The court in Lille\u000aruled that the makeshift shelters used by the migrants can be destroyed -- but\u000athat common spaces like places of worship, schools and a library must\u000astand.Demolition crews have been poised to start what officials say will be a\u000abetter solution for migrants trapped in Calais with borders all but sealed by\u000aincreasing security.Officials estimate the number of migrants who will be\u000aaffected at around 800 to 1,000. Humanitarian organizations say over 3,000\u000amigrants live there.Moving the migrants out of the mini-slum will be the most\u000adramatic step by the French state to end Calais' years-long migrant problem,\u000awhich has transformed the northern city into a high-security tension point,\u000afueled far-right sentiment and defied British and French government efforts to\u000amake it go away. Critics contend that closing the camp may not solve the\u000aproblem.The same court in Lille ordered the state in November to clean up the\u000acamp by adding running water, toilets and garbage bins, and counting the\u000anumber of minors without families -- now 326 -- and help those in\u000adistress.Saving the migrants' temporary homes from bulldozers became a mass\u000aeffort by volunteers, humanitarian groups and a dose of star power. British\u000aactor Jude Law paid a visit last weekend and 260 French figures signed a\u000apetition against destroying the camp.In announcing plans to close the camp,\u000aauthorities cited security and sanitation concerns and the increasingly\u000atarnished image of Calais, a city of nearly 80,000 that takes pride in drawing\u000atourists to its Opal Coast. Its prime location -- with a major ferry port,\u000aEurotunnel rail system and truck traffic crossing the English Channel -- has\u000aput it in the crosshairs of the migrant crisis.Residents have mostly learned\u000ato live with migrants in their midst. But tensions rose when the camp's\u000apopulation spiked to 6,000 last fall before dropping to 4,000 more recently.An\u000aincreasingly vocal backlash is punctuated by militia-style violence. Truckers\u000ahave grown exasperated or fearful of increasingly bold tactics by migrants\u000atrying to sneak rides across the English Channel.The area targeted for\u000adestruction is dotted with rickety shops, cafes, places of worship and\u000aschools, built by aid groups and the migrants, most of whom traveled from\u000aconflict zones like Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan, or came to escape human rights\u000aabuses or poverty in African nations.A sense of anxiety mounted in the camp\u000aahead of the court ruling."Obviously, they are scared and concerned about what\u000ais going to happen," said Ed Sexton, of Help Refugees, one of numerous British\u000aassociations working in the camp.  "The people have been here months, living\u000ain terrible conditions, but they don't want their shelters destroyed."Weary\u000atravelers come to Calais driven by a dream -- circulated among migrants,\u000apeddled by smugglers -- that they will find peace and prosperity in Britain.\u000aLacking papers, they have to sneak across the Channel, and at least 20\u000amigrants have died trying since late June, according to authorities.Camp\u000aresidents were offered the choice of being sent to temporary welcome centers\u000aaround France, or staying in one of 125 heated containers set up last month in\u000aa fenced-in area behind the camp."It's inhuman to live in the jungle. But\u000acertain associations, certain billionaire stars are telling us to leave things\u000aalone," the head of the region, conservative Xavier Bertrand, said during a\u000avisit last weekend. "That's enough. The jungle must be evacuated."Humanitarian\u000aworkers predicted that those who refuse to leave would shelter in small groups\u000aelsewhere around Calais and the coast."You're basically going to scatter a lot\u000aof people," said Maya Konforti of the association Auberge des Migrants.An\u000aAfghan who identified himself only as Jan said he would look elsewhere for a\u000ashelter if Calais were closed."They are the government ... we can't fight with\u000athem," he said.Nearby Belgium, concerned about an influx of Calais evacuees,\u000ahas implemented border checks.Another filthy camp known as a haven for\u000asmugglers, near Dunkirk, France, is being relocated to a more hygienic site\u000awith heated tents under the supervision of Doctors Without Borders.The\u000aprefecture, which announced plans to raze the camp on Feb. 12, said bulldozers\u000awould not touch the camp's makeshift churches, mosques and a just-opened\u000aschool. Facing criticism of the eviction order, Interior Minister Bernard\u000aCazeneuve softened the ultimatum this week, saying the evacuation would be\u000a"progressive."Authorities view the razing of much of the camp as a turning\u000apoint for Calais, but that's a far from certain outcome.A Red Cross-run camp\u000ain nearby Sangatte -- used during its three-year existence by some 68,000\u000arefugees -- was shut down in 2002. Afterward, hundreds moved up the coast to\u000aset up small camps around Calais.Authorities periodically razed them, then\u000aopened a state-sponsored day center in April with showers, plugs to charge\u000aphones and a meal distribution center. That lured migrants chased from inside\u000athe city, who pitched camp nearby.Authorities allowed the camp to grow, and it\u000aevolved into a squalid slum town with some amenities of urban life that\u000ainjected a sense of solidarity and conviviality into migrants' bleak lives.__\u000a\u000a

VPeople gather on the street after bombings in Syria in the Sayyida Zeinab\u000aarea, 6 miles (10 km) south of Damascus, Sunday, Feb. 21, 2016. (AP\u000aPhoto/Natalia Sancha) While the U.S. and Russia have announced \u201cpreliminary\u000aagreement\u201d on the \u201ccessation of hostilities\u201d in Syria, humanitarian workers\u000awarn that the violence on the ground remains unchecked, and the situation is\u000aworsening for tens of thousands of additional Syrians being forced to flee as\u000aa result.Nor, they report, has the highly publicized entry of a small number\u000aof United Nations-sponsored relief convoys into a few of many areas besieged\u000aby the regime of Bashar Assad made much of a difference.The escalating\u000aviolence has made other avenues for filtering relief into embattled Syrian\u000aterritory extremely difficult and dangerous, and the initial U.N. convoys have\u000aso far not been followed by any others.\u201cWe have not seen a cease-fire on the\u000aground,\u201d Christy Delafield, a spokesperson for the U.S.-based international\u000aaid organization Mercy Corps, told Fox News. Her organization says that it is\u000aproviding humanitarian aid to some 500,000 Syrians monthly without the\u000asupervision of the Russian-supported Assad regime, but that is growing more\u000aand more difficult.\u201cThe situation is not good,\u201d she said. \u201cThe violence\u000acontinues. We are looking at an intensification of the conflict, not a\u000acessation of hostilities.\u201dAs a result, aid organizations like Mercy Corps face\u000agreater and greater difficulty in getting supplies to areas of the country\u000awhere regime sanctions supplies do not go -- a subject of growing criticism\u000afor the U.N., which carries out relief operations under the sanction of\u000aAssad.\u201cWe have been cut off from the safest and most direct routes for\u000adelivery,\u201d Delafield reported. \u201cThere are bombs on the road that we do use. It\u000ais really dangerous.\u201d Mercy Corps says that two of its off-duty aid workers\u000awere killed in recent bombing attacks, and two persons killed and 20 injured\u000ain a bombing assault near an aid distribution point.  \u000a\u201cWe have not seen a cease-fire on the ground.\u201d- Christy Delafield, of Mercy\u000aCorpsAs a result of the increasing military pressure, there has been a\u000adramatic hike in the number of northern Syrian refugees headed for camps on\u000athe border with Turkey, and also in other areas of the country where regime\u000aattacks have increased.\u201cDisplacement camps near the Turkish border doubled to\u000a65,000 people since January,\u201d Delafield reported. \u201cNow there are 75,000 people\u000athere, with 27,000 living outside camps, sometimes in mosques and\u000aschools.\u201d\u201cShelter is incredibly hard to come by,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are\u000adesperately trying to get tarps in. It is very challenging.\u201dThe new refugee\u000aflood is producing other desperation issues, including how to provide and\u000amaintain latrines and other sanitary facilities for the ballooning refugee\u000apopulations, to prevent wildfire outbreaks of disease.The rising populations\u000aon the move are straining humanitarian aid in other ways as well. Delafield\u000asays that Mercy Corps has \u201cshifted from our standard relief food kit -- which\u000arequires a kitchen -- to a ready-to-eat kit that only lasts for two weeks, and\u000ais more expensive.\u201dThe switch to different rations also has put a sudden\u000astrain on the new kinds of supplies. \u201cThere are not a lot of these around,\u201d\u000ashe says.For its part, the U.N.\u2019s World Food Program, which led the recent\u000arelief convoys to a scattering of areas where starving residents have been\u000awithout outside food supplies for months, says it is working hard to meet the\u000asame relief surge.A WFP spokesperson said the U.N. organization has\u000adistributed food rations for almost 74,000 people in the camps and itemized a\u000alist of staples as well as ready-to-eat supplies.\u201cWe are sending additional\u000aready-to-eat rations to cover the needs of up to 45,000 more people should\u000adisplacements continue in the coming days,\u201d the spokesperson added.The relief\u000aconvoys that finally proceeded to besieged areas with Assad government\u000aapproval brought supplies for 81,000 people that are intended to last for a\u000amonth, the WFP spokesperson said.But efforts so far for other besieged areas\u000a-- there are at least 15 on a by-no-means exhaustive list -- have not achieved\u000aanything so far.The WFP spokesperson told Fox News that the U.N. organization\u000ahas gotten permission from the Damascus regime to send relief aid to two other\u000abesieged areas, one in rural Damascus and the other in Deir Ezzor, a medium-\u000asized city near Iraq.But even with formal permission, the spokesman noted,\u000a\u201cthe two areas have not been scheduled yet. We are working on the logistical\u000aarrangements for both.\u201dMeantime, she said, WFP, like the non-government aid\u000aorganizations, is growing \u201cvery concerned because access to eastern Aleppo\u000acity is getting more and more difficult due to ongoing fighting close to the\u000aroad that provides access to the city.\u201dShe added that \u201cWFP has started sending\u000aa two-month supply of food stocks to the city to cover the needs of over\u000a100,000 people.\u201dThat aid, however, largely flows through channels that depend\u000aon agreement by the Assad government.While lauding the U.N. relief convoys to\u000aa scattering of areas where starving residents have been without food supplies\u000afor months, Mercy Corps spokesman Delafield observes that \u201cthe need is\u000adesperate not just in areas that the U.N. designates as besieged. Their\u000aresidents deserve no less assistance.\u201d\u201cWe need sustained humanitarian access,\u000aeverywhere.\u201dNot to mention an end to military assaults that so far, still seem\u000aendless._George Russell is editor-at-large of Fox News and can be found on\u000aTwitter:  @GeorgeRussell or on Facebook.com/GeorgeRussell___\u000a\u000a

V  BERLIN \u2013  Rocked by a wave of sexual assaults committed by migrant men,\u000aGermany is fighting back with cartoons, in a PC campaign critics say would be\u000acomical if it didn\u2019t address such a serious issue.In a national effort already\u000ablasted by critics as demonstrating the government\u2019s ineptitude in dealing\u000awith unruly refugees from the Middle East and North Africa, authorities have\u000adistributed anti-sexual harassment cartoon leaflets at public swimming pools\u000aand other public facilities. One depicts a hand reaching for a shapely,\u000abikini-clad woman\u2019s backside, and bears a universal-language slash\u000ademonstrating such behavior is forbidden.\u201cNo verbal and bodily sexual\u000aharassment toward women in any kind of clothing,\u201d reads the caption below.Mass\u000asexual assaults of women by refugees during New Year\u2019s Eve celebrations sent\u000ashockwaves through the nation. The attackers were believed to be among the\u000aestimated wave of 1 million Muslims who have poured into Germany in the last\u000ayear, prompting a culture clash that critics say Berlin has been slow to\u000agrasp.Before and after the New Year\u2019s Eve attacks, hundreds of which occurred\u000ain Cologne, there were widespread reports of male refugees sexually harassing\u000aand assaulting women in public. Many of the incidents occurred at the nation\u2019s\u000apopular public swimming halls, where authorities this week posted signs and\u000aissued codes of conduct to discourage the violent behavior. (Public indoor\u000aswimming pools, like this one in Leipzig, are popular in Germany. (Reuters))\u000aIn the East German city of Leipzig, migrants have followed women into restroom\u000aand changing facilities, according to the newspaper Mitteldeutche Zeitung.\u000aElsewhere, male refugees have jumped into pools fully clothed or wearing\u000aunderwear and groped female bathers. Officials in several communities,\u000aincluding the Bavarian capital of Munich, have responded with anti-sexual\u000aharassment cartoon leaflets to stop the increasing number of sexual attacks\u000aand aggression in public swimming facilities.\u201cThese signs are a good step, but\u000athey can only be a first initiative of more security measures to come,\u201d Saba\u000aFarzan, executive director of Foreign Policy Circle, a Berlin strategy think\u000atank, told FoxNews.com. \u201cProtecting our women from vicious assaults means to\u000ateach refugees as well as migrants about gender equality.\u201dBut critics say\u000alaws, not leaflets and signs, should be used to protect women from assault.\u201cIf\u000aour criminal and asylum laws can\u2019t discourage perpetrators of sexual\u000aharassment and the activity of other offenses, what effect can signs in\u000aswimming facilities have?\u201d  Cologne-based lawyer Stefanie Galla told\u000aFoxNews.com.The codes of conduct and leaflets are being printed in multiple\u000alanguages, including Arabic and English.  The city of Leipzig also plans to\u000arapidly introduce English signs about appropriate conduct and multi-language\u000ainformation pamphlets.  Security cameras are set to be installed in the\u000aswimming facilities. Berlin, the capital of Germany, announced this week that\u000ait will introduce behavioral codes and signs for refugees who enter swimming\u000abuildings.The small western town of Hermeskeil now requires that refugees\u000aparticipate in a 30-minute behavioral class before entering public swimming\u000apools. The city requires that the migrants read 10 rules and sign a pledge\u000athat they will follow them before issuing an entry card for swimming.\u201cSwimming\u000ais only allowed in swimwear (not in underwear  or  jeans or T-shirt)!\u201d reads\u000aone of the rules.Some communities have found the education approach lacking.\u000aLast week, the town of Bornheim began barring adult male refugees from a\u000apublic swimming facility because of sexual assaults. Bornheim has a population\u000aof about 45,000, and has absorbed approximately 800 Muslim refugees.Sexual\u000aassaults also have been reported on public transportation facilities.\u000aChristian Janele, a city council representative in the Bavarian city of\u000aRegensburg, has suggested pink-colored \u201cLady Zones\u201d where women would be\u000aseparated from men. The bill, which was rejected by the city, was not prompted\u000aby the refugees, Janele insisted.In the wake of the Cologne attacks, a\u000aprominent Muslim imam, Sami Abu-Yusuf, told reporters women were to blame\u000abecause they \u201cdress half naked and wear perfume.\u201d The outrageous claim\u000aprompted Green Party Member of Parliament Volker Beck to file a criminal\u000acomplaint against the cleric.___Benjamin Weinthal reports on human rights in\u000athe Middle East and is a fellow at the __Foundation for Defense of\u000aDemocracies__.

VA young Mississippi man pleaded guilty Friday to a terrorism-related charge,\u000amonths after authorities said he and his fiancee thought about using their\u000ahoneymoon as ruse to go to Syria to join the Islamic State.Muhammad Dakhlalla,\u000a23, pleaded guilty to providing material support to terrorism and faces up to\u000a20 years in prison, $250,000 fines and lifetime probation. His sentencing date\u000ahasn't been set.His fiancee, Jaelyn Delshaun Young, is accused in new court\u000adocuments of being the mastermind of the plan to join the Islamic State. Her\u000atrial is set for June 6.Both remain jailed without bail in Oxford.The couple\u000awas arrested Aug. 8 before boarding a flight from Columbus, Mississippi, with\u000atickets for Istanbul. Authorities say they contacted undercover federal agents\u000alast year, seeking online help in traveling to Syria. The two, at one point,\u000atold federal agents posing online as recruiters for the Islamic State that\u000athey planned to disguise their journey to Syria as a honeymoon.The couple's\u000aarrest stunned their families.Dakhlalla is a 2011 psychology graduate of\u000aMississippi State University who grew up in Starkville, a son of a prominent\u000afigure in the college town's Muslim community. He is the youngest of three\u000asons and was preparing to start graduate school at Mississippi State.Young, a\u000asophomore chemistry major from Vicksburg, was the daughter of a school\u000aadministrator and a police officer who served in the Navy reserve. She was a\u000aformer honor student, cheerleader and homecoming maid at Warren Central High\u000aSchool.Court papers filed with the plea portray Young as the mastermind of the\u000acouple's attempt to join the Islamic State, saying she had already expressed\u000aan interest in converting to Islam even before she began dating Dakhlalla in\u000alate 2014.The papers confirm that both Young and Dakhlalla left farewell\u000aletters "that explained they would never be back, with Young acknowledging her\u000arole as the planner of the expedition and that Dakhlalla was going as her\u000acompanion of his own free will."The court papers reiterate earlier government\u000aclaims that Dakhlalla, in online contacts, told an FBI employee that he was\u000agood with computers and media and wanted to contribute to the Islamic State's\u000astruggle. Court papers say Dakhlalla said online that he wanted to become a\u000afighter and learn "what it really means to have that heart in battle."The plea\u000aagreement drops a related charge against Dakhlalla, cutting the possible\u000alength of any imprisonment. However, in the plea agreement signed Wednesday,\u000aDakhlalla and his lawyer acknowledged that the sentencing recommendation would\u000abe adjusted upward because terrorism is involved.__\u000a\u000a

V  The ISIS terror group\u2019s unspeakable acts now include pushing birth control\u000aon young women forced into sex slavery.To keep the sex trade running, ISIS\u000afighters are aggressively forcing birth control on their victims so they won\u2019t\u000aget pregnant as they are raped repeatedly while being passed among them, the\u000aNew York Times reported Saturday.The paper said more than three dozen Yazidi\u000awomen who recently escaped ISIS captivity described in interviews the numerous\u000amethods the militants used to avoid pregnancy, including oral and injectable\u000acontraception and sometimes both.In at least one case, a woman was forced to\u000ahave an abortion in order to make her available for sex and others were\u000apressured to do so, the Times reported.In its warped view, ISIS believes it\u2019s\u000aokay for a man to rape a woman he enslaves, but it is not okay to rape a woman\u000ahe enslaves who is pregnant, according to the paper.The methodical use of\u000abirth control could explain why doctors caring for the recent escapees at a\u000aUnited Nations-run clinic in northern Iraq have seen so few pregnancies.Of the\u000amore than 700 rape victims from the Yazidi ethnic group examined at the clinic\u000ajust 5 percent became pregnant during their enslavement, a gynecologist doing\u000athe exams told the Times.\u201cWe were expecting something higher,\u201d Dr. Nezar Ismet\u000aTaib, who oversees the clinic, told the paper.A 16-year-old with the first\u000ainitial M told the Times that during her 12 months of captivity, she was\u000aforced to swallow a red pill in front of the ISIS fighter who bought\u000aher.\u201cEvery day, I had to swallow one in front of him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe gave me\u000aone box per month. When I ran out, he replaced it. When I was sold from one\u000aman to another, the box of pills came with me.\u201dShe learned months later she\u000awas being forced to swallow birth control pills, the Times reported.Click here\u000afor more from the New York Times.__\u000a\u000a

VA Google search page is seen through a magnifying glass in this photo\u000aillustration taken in Brussels May 30, 2014. (REUTERS/Francois Lenoir) Not all\u000aweapons have a trigger, but that doesn't make them any less effective. No, I'm\u000anot talking about bombs, but rather about Google's new strategy to use its\u000ahighly targeted advertising system in the battle against ISIS. Last week,\u000aAnthony House, the senior manager for public policy and communications at\u000aGoogle, revealed plans to show users anti-radicalization links in response to\u000aterrorism-related searches. The plan was outlined before a committee of the\u000aBritish parliament dedicated to counter-terrorism.The program is still in its\u000apilot stages, but House is hopeful that this new plan may provide a clever\u000atool that protects the freedom of the Internet while protecting the\u000alivelihoods of the world's citizens. "We should get the bad stuff down, but\u000ait's also extremely important that people are able to find good information,\u000athat when people are feeling isolated, that when they go online, they find a\u000acommunity of hope, not a community of harm," said the Google manager.The idea,\u000athe Internet giant says, is to provide a sort of alternative narrative to\u000athose looking for information about extremism. In a statement, a Google\u000aspokesperson further explained, "What was referenced is a pilot Google AdWords\u000aGrants program that's in the works right now with a handful of eligible non-\u000aprofit organizations. The program enables NGOs to place counter-radicalization\u000aads against search queries of their choosing."**Related:** Google reveals\u000aJustin Bieber video is most complained about clip on YouTubeIn addition to the\u000acounter-terrorism ads, Google is also ensuring that its subsidiary YouTube\u000amakes anti-extremism videos more discoverable, further aiding the overall\u000aefforts against ISIS and similar groups.The move comes in the midst of an\u000aongoing debate about the role and responsibility that social media groups\u000ashould accept in responding to the proliferation of extremism. ISIS is known\u000afor leveraging sites like Twitter and Facebook for both recruitment and\u000apropaganda purposes, and a recent lawsuit against Twitter suggested that ISIS\u000ahas only reached its current level of influence with the (albeit\u000aunintentional) help of social media platform.And while Google ads may not be a\u000acomprehensive solution, it's certainly a step in the right direction when it\u000acomes to using tech to fight the bad guys.****  \u000a __\u005c+ Follow**FoxNewsSciTech** on Facebook\u000a\u000a

V  WASHINGTON \u2013  The wife of a senior Islamic State leader who was killed in a\u000aU.S. raid last year has been charged in federal court with holding American\u000aKayla Mueller hostage and with contributing to the aid worker's death, the\u000aJustice Department said Monday.Nisreen Assad Ibrahim Bahar, also known as Umm\u000aSayyaf, admitted after her capture last May that she and her husband kept\u000aMueller captive along with several other young female hostages, according to\u000aan FBI affidavit filed in the case. U.S. officials have said that while in\u000acustody, Mueller was repeatedly forced to have sex with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,\u000athe leader of the Islamic State groupThe criminal complaint, filed in federal\u000acourt in Virginia, charges Umm Sayyaf with conspiracy to provide material\u000asupport to a foreign terror organization, resulting in death.The case comes\u000aone year after Mueller was confirmed dead by her family and the Obama\u000aadministration, though it's not clear when or if Umm Sayyaf will be brought to\u000athe U.S. to stand trial. The 25-year-old Iraqi woman, who was captured last\u000ayear, is currently in Iraqi custody and facing prosecution there. Her husband,\u000aAbu Sayyaf, a former Islamic State minister for oil and gas, was killed last\u000aMay in a Delta Force raid of his compound."We fully support the Iraqi\u000aprosecution of Sayyaf and will continue to work with the authorities there to\u000apursue our shared goal of holding Sayyaf accountable for her crimes,"\u000aAssistant Attorney General John Carlin, head of the Justice Department's\u000anational security division, said in a statement. "At the same time, these\u000acharges reflect that the U.S. justice system remains a powerful tool to bring\u000ato bear against those who harm our citizens abroad. We will continue to pursue\u000ajustice for Kayla and for all American victims of terrorism."Mueller, from\u000aPrescott, Arizona, was taken hostage with her boyfriend, Omar Alkhani, in\u000aAugust 2013 after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria,\u000awhere he had been hired to fix the Internet service for the hospital. Mueller\u000ahad begged him to let her tag along because she wanted to do relief work in\u000athe war-ravaged country. Alkhani was released after two months, having been\u000abeaten.According to the FBI affidavit, Mueller was transferred in September\u000a2014 along with several other female captives from an Islamic State prison to\u000athe Sayyafs. The couple at times handcuffed the captives, kept them in locked\u000arooms, dictated orders about their activities and movements and showed them\u000aviolent Islamic State propaganda videos.After her capture last year, according\u000ato the affidavit, Umm Sayyaf admitted she was responsible for Mueller's\u000acaptivity while her husband traveled for Islamic State business.The Justice\u000aDepartment's case echoes earlier assertions from U.S. intelligence officials,\u000awho had told Mueller's family that their daughter was repeatedly forced to\u000ahave sex with al-Baghdadi.According to the affidavit, Umm Sayyaf said that al-\u000aBaghadi would occasionally stay at her home and that he "owned" Mueller during\u000athose visits, which the FBI says was akin to slavery.A Yazidi teenager who was\u000aheld with Mueller and escaped in October 2014 said al-Baghdadi took Mueller as\u000aa "wife," repeatedly raping her when he visited. The 14-year-old Yazidi girl\u000amade her way to Iraqi Kurdistan, where she talked to U.S. commandos in\u000aNovember 2014. Intelligence agencies corroborated her account and American\u000aofficials passed it on to Mueller's parents in June 2015.__\u000a\u000a

V  The nation\u2019s top intelligence official confirmed Tuesday that the Islamic\u000aState has succeeded in making and deploying chemical agents in Iraq and Syria\u000a-- calling it the first such attack by an extremist group in more than two\u000adecades. The confirmation of mustard gas use came during Director of National\u000aIntelligence James Clapper's testimony before the Senate Armed Services\u000aCommittee, where he spoke to the Islamic State's growing sophistication online\u000aand in the battlefield. He did not elaborate on where and when the chemical\u000aattacks occurred, though there has been mounting evidence the terror group was\u000aexperimenting with chemical weapons.\u201c[The Syrian government] has used\u000achemicals against the opposition on multiple occasions since Syria joined the\u000aChemical Weapons Convention. ISIL has also used toxic chemicals in Iraq and\u000aSyria, including the blister agent Sulfur mustard,\u201d Clapper said. He said this\u000amarks the first time an extremist group has produced and used a "chemical\u000awarfare agent in an attack since Aum Shinrikyo used sarin in Japan in 1995,"\u000areferring to the Tokyo subway terror attack that year. Fox News previously\u000areported on ISIS' potential experimentation with chemical weapons. Photos\u000ataken by the Kurds in northern Iraq last summer and reviewed by Fox News\u000ashowed burns and blistering on skin following exposure to \u201codorless,\u000acolorless\u201d agents absorbed through the clothing. A doctor who was in northern\u000aIraq last year said he treated Kurdish fighters whom ISIS used as "lab rats\u000afor WMD," adding that the variety of burns and illnesses suggested that\u000a"mustard gas, precursors, as well as neurotoxic acids" were being\u000atested.Evidence has also indicated that Damascus has been using chemical\u000aweapons against the Syrian opposition and civilians, despite an agreement to\u000areduce its stockpile two years ago. The Japan attack that Clapper referred to\u000ain his testimony occured in March 1995. Then, perpetrators hailing from the\u000acult Aum Shinrikyo launched five coordinated Sarin gas attacks on the Toyko\u000asubway, killing 12, severely injuring 50 and leaving some 1,000 people with\u000atemporary vision impairment.Clapper dropped the latest revelation amid\u000adiscussions of other worldwide national security threats, including North\u000aKorea, which he said has expanded a uranium enrichment facility and restarted\u000aa plutonium reactor that could start recovering material for nuclear weapons\u000ain weeks or months.Meanwhile, Clapper told the Senate Armed Services Committee\u000athat Islamic militants will continue plotting against U.S. interests overseas\u000aand homegrown attacks will pose the most significant threat from violent\u000aextremists to Americans at home. "The perceived success of attacks by\u000ahomegrown violent extremists in Europe and North America, such as those in\u000aChattanooga and San Bernardino, might motivate others to replicate\u000aopportunistic attacks with little or no warning, diminishing our ability to\u000adetect terrorist operational planning and readiness," he said."ISIL\u000ainvolvement in homeland attack activity will probably continue to involve\u000athose who draw inspiration from the group's highly sophisticated media without\u000adirect guidance from ISIL leadership," he said, using an acronym for the\u000amilitant group. He also, in his prepared testimony, said ISIS has an\u000a"unprecedented online proficiency." Clapper said that the North Korean\u000agovernment announced in 2013 its intention to refurbish and restart nuclear\u000afacilities, to include the uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon and its\u000agraphite-moderated plutonium production reactor, which was shut down in 2007.\u000aHe added that U.S. intelligence had assessed that North Korea has expanded\u000aYongbyon and restarted the plutonium production reactor there.His testimony\u000afollowed the North Koreans' recent underground test explosion and rocket\u000alaunch. He said the communist nation is working to expand what is thought to\u000abe a small nuclear arsenal. U.S.-based experts have estimated that North Korea\u000amay have about 10 bombs, but that could grow to between 20 and 100 by\u000a2020.When asked, separately, if the the intelligence community suspected that\u000athe Iranian government was violating its own nuclear agreement with Washington\u000aand its international partners, Clapper said, \u201cno.\u201d\u201cWe have no evidence thus\u000afar that they are moving toward a violation,\u201d he testified, adding that\u000aWashington is in \u201cthe distrust and verify mode\u201d and is watching closely.On the\u000acybersecurity issue, Clapper said China selectively uses cyber-attacks against\u000atargets Beijing believes threaten Chinese domestic stability or regime\u000alegitimacy."We will monitor compliance with China's September 2015 commitment\u000ato refrain from conducting or knowingly supporting cyber-enabled theft of\u000aintellectual property with the intent of providing competitive advantage to\u000acompanies or commercial sectors," he said.  \u000a  \u000aHe also warned that Afghanistan is at "serious risk of a political breakdown\u000aduring 2016." He said waning political cohesion, rising activities by local\u000apowerbrokers, financial shortfalls and sustained attacks by the Taliban are\u000aeroding stability.Russia, meanwhile, continues to compete \u201cto create an image\u000aof being co-equal with the United States,\u201d and is \u201cvery paranoid about NATO\u000aand about being contained,\u201d he said in response to a question on Russian\u000aaggression in Syria and Ukraine. _Fox News' Catherine Herridge and The\u000aAssociated Press contributed to this report.___\u000a\u000a

V  **EXCLUSIVE:** The dozen failed ObamaCare cooperatives have not repaid any of the $1.2 billion in federal loans they received and still owe more than $1 billion in additional liabilities, according to recent financial statements cited Thursday at a congressional hearing.\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t hold our breath on repayment,\u201d Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said in his opening statement at the hearing.\u201cIn some states, these losses will be absorbed by other insurance companies\u2014which means, by the policyholders of other insurance companies who have to pay increased \u2026 premiums,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other states, doctors, hospitals and individual patients stand to suffer large out-of-pocket losses due to the co-op failures\u2014as our report details.\u201d Portman\u2019s statement, first obtained by Fox News, refers to an investigation by the committee\u2019s majority staff. It claims the most recent balance sheets provided to the subcommittee show the failed cooperatives owe more than $700 million to doctors and hospitals for plan year 2015.The failed cooperatives lost $376 million and exceeded the projected worst-case-scenario losses outlined in their loan applications by more than $260 million in 2014. They lost an additional billion dollars in 2015, according to the report.\u201cOnce the co-ops got going in 2014, things went south in a hurry\u2014both in terms of financial losses and enrollment figures that wildly deviated from the co-ops\u2019 own projections,\u201d Portman said. \u201cDespite getting regular reports that the co-ops were hemorrhaging cash, HHS [the Department of Health and Human Services] took essentially no corrective action for over a year.\u201d  Deloitte Consulting initially granted the cooperatives a passing grade based on an HHS-designed grading scale. However it added seven of the 12 had serious deficiencies in their enrollment strategy, according to the report.  Others submitted budgets that were \u201cincomplete, unreasonable, not cost-effective\u201d and several \u201crelied on unreasonable projections about their own growth.\u201d The report cited in Portman\u2019s statement also claims that from 2014\u20132015, the administration lent an additional $848 million to the failed cooperatives, as they lost more than $1.4 billion.In previous testimony, administration officials have told congressional panels that the administration scrutinized cooperative business plans and then placed them on corrective oversight when necessary. \u201cIn 2015 we conducted 27 financial and operational reviews, 16 in-person visits, and had 43 formal communications,\u201d Andy Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, told the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year.  \u201cNot to mention hundreds of phone calls. And we've kept the states up to speed on every important interaction to help inform their regulatory actions.\u201dWhen questioned how much money the government could salvage from the failed cooperatives, officials said they were only beginning to determine amounts.\u201cWe are in the process of recouping that loan money right now,\u201d said Dr. Mandy Cohen, the chief operating officer and chief of staff of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, last month to a House panel. \u201cWe\u2019ll look at their excess revenue and then use all the tools available to us through their loan agreements and state and federal law to pull back federal tax dollars.\u201dObamaCare provided $2.4 billion in federal loans to establish 23 non-profit cooperatives.  A dozen failed and the administration has required eight of the remaining eleven to adhere to a \u201ccorrective action plan\u201d designed to fix business flaws and prevent additional failures.  The closed cooperatives account for $1.2 billion in federal loans.Defenders of the law and cooperatives say these non-profit  insurers operated in difficult markets and that it often takes years of financial commitment to build a viable business.The failed cooperatives left hundreds of thousands of customers searching for a new insurance company.  In some states, the loss was significant.\u201cHHS gave the New York co-op $90 million to prolong its financial life, rather than allow it to scale down, that co-op went on to lose another $544 million in 2015,\u201d according to Portman\u2019s statement, citing his staff\u2019s report.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner in the Democratic presidential delegate count, pledged she would address the market void left by the failed cooperatives.\u201cWe need to get more companies, more nonprofits, to fill this space. The ones that knew what they were doing have provided good services, but a lot of them have failed because they didn't have the right support,\u201d she said Monday at a Democratic presidential forum hosted by Fox News.\u201cEven in those markets where those co-ops had previously operated, we have seen a commitment on the part of those who are administering the markets to try to facilitate greater competition,\u201d said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.  \u201cAnd creating the co-ops was just one way to do that, but we certainly are going to be open to other ways to encourage other entities, private or public, to get engaged in this process.\u201dWhen previously questioned by Congress, administration officials declined to forecast how many of the remaining cooperatives would survive this year.\u201cThe co-ops themselves are really the ones who are going to be the ones to determine whether or not they ultimately will be successful,\u201d said Cohen.  \u201cThey have a lot of work to do to rapidly mature their entities, their small businesses as you know and they\u2019re still getting their foothold on this business.\u201d__Rich Edson is a Washington correspondent for Fox News Channel. Prior to that, he served as Fox Business Network's Washington correspondent.\u000a\u000a

V  Humana Inc. has added its name to the list of mega-medical insurers to\u000areport big problems under ObamaCare.The Louisville, Ky.- based company does\u000anot expect to make enough money this year in premiums from individual plans to\u000acover what it will pay out in claims, according to a regulatory filing made\u000alast week with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  \u000aHumana, which is being acquired by Aetna Inc., said it is still trying to\u000afigure out how big the gap will be. The company did say it has set aside a\u000apremium deficiency reserve \u2013 meaning, it\u2019s setting aside money to help make up\u000athe difference.Humana, which will provide a deeper dive into its 2016 outlook\u000awhen it releases its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 10, said in the SEC\u000afiling that it expects membership to drop this year by 200,000 to 300,000. The\u000adecrease reflects plans sold under ObamaCare as well as older policies.\u201cWe\u000aexpect Humana will exit Health Insurance Exchange marketplaces in 2017 in\u000alight of this data, and focus on its Medicare Advantage book of business,\u201d\u000aLeerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said in a research note on Friday.Humana is\u000ajust the latest mega-insurer to run into a profit problem under the Affordable\u000aCare Act.Last year, UnitedHealth\u2019s CEO announced $425 million in losses and\u000awarned it may walk away from the health care exchanges altogether.\u000aUnitedHealth is the largest insurer in the country.Many industry watchers warn\u000athe threat from the nation\u2019s largest insurer is just the beginning.Insurers\u000alike UnitedHealth and Humana have had a hard time turning a profit since the\u000agovernment-run marketplaces for plans opened in late 2013. Part of the reason\u000ais because customers flocking to big insurers are using more medical care --\u000asomething that is cutting into company profits.Keeping ObamaCare alive is\u000avital to President Obama\u2019s legacy \u2013 but it won\u2019t be easy.Calls to gut his\u000alandmark legislation have continued and just last week, Obama was forced to\u000afend off another GOP-led challenge. On Friday, Obama vetoed a measure that\u000awould have repealed most of the health care law, saying the bill would do\u000a\u201charm\u201d to millions of Americans. It was the first time Republicans succeeded\u000ain sending an ObamaCare repeal bill to his desk.Some lawmakers vow to keep up\u000athe fight against ObamaCare and argue the legislation is harming the economy\u000aand wrongly forcing Americans to buy insurance.The pushback from Congress\u000acomes as administration officials touted another round of strong signups.\u000a"The marketplace continues to be stable, vibrant and growing," Andy Slavitt,\u000ahead of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers the\u000ahealth overhaul's online insurance market, said on a conference call with\u000areporters last week.The administration is expecting a surge of young\u000aprocrastinators to sign up near the Jan. 31 deadline for 2016 coverage. That\u000acould help hold down premiums the following year.Leading the administration's\u000atally was Florida, with more than 1.5 million signed up. California followed,\u000awith more than 1.4 million.Despite the optimism from the Obama administration,\u000aan increasing number of insurance and medical experts, like Mount Sinai Health\u000aSystem President and CEO Kenneth Davis, have started to speak up about the\u000aproblems facing ObamaCare.\u201cPremiums are going up, deductibles are higher and\u000athat\u2019s a problem,\u201d he said on CNBC, reversing optimistic comments he made only\u000aa year ago.\u201cWhat it\u2019s all about is that not enough healthy people have signed\u000aup,\u201d he said, creating a lopsided business model.   __\u000a\u000a

V  Congress sent an ObamaCare repeal bill to the president\u2019s desk for the first\u000atime on Wednesday, marking an election-year victory of sorts for Republicans\u000awho have tried since 2010 to scrap the law.The bill repealing most of\u000aPresident Obama's signature health care law was approved in a final 240-181\u000aHouse vote Wednesday afternoon, after clearing the Senate late last year. The\u000alegislation also would strip federal funding for Planned Parenthood.The\u000ameasure still faces certain doom at the White House, and Democrats derided the\u000avote Wednesday as pointless. The president is sure to veto, and Republicans do\u000anot have the votes to override.But the political theater marks the opening\u000avolley in a fresh ObamaCare fight under the Paul Ryan-led House, and one\u000alikely to energize the party\u2019s election-year efforts. \u201cI fully anticipate the\u000apresident will veto this, but I mean, how many times have we been saying we\u000awant to put bills on his desk that say who we are, what we believe versus what\u000ahe believes, and that he will veto,\u201d Speaker Ryan, R-Wis., told Fox News\u000aTuesday night before the vote. The new speaker\u2019s next goal is to engineer and\u000apass a bill \u2013 also for the first time \u2013 to replace the Affordable Care Act.\u000aDoing so could help Republicans respond to Democrats\u2019 allegations that they\u000ahave no viable alternative.Ryan is tempering expectations for the GOP in this\u000aexercise.In a recent meeting with reporters, the speaker indicated that the\u000aHouse was practically obligated to pass a health care reform replacement bill.\u000aHe was confident the House could do so this year but underscored that he\u000adidn\u2019t say the president would sign the legislation into law.But this is still\u000apart of Ryan\u2019s effort to contrast Republicans\u2019 plans with the Obama agenda.\u000aDemocrats have long hectored Republicans for failing to cough up a bill to\u000areplace the current health care law even as they try to repeal it. If they at\u000aleast draft a bill, and even pass it, then the parties can argue over a\u000aconcrete policy choice.\u201cWe need to win the election, and the best way to win\u000athe election is give people a choice,\u201d Ryan told Fox News, speaking generally\u000aabout the two parties\u2019 platforms.Republicans have held more than 60 votes so\u000afar to repeal all or part of the health care law.They only cleared this one\u000apast the Senate because they used a special set of budget rules known as\u000a\u201creconciliation.\u201d This allowed the measure to pass with a simple majority \u2013\u000atypically, Republicans would have needed to muster 60 votes to pass it.Planned\u000aParenthood has come under attack since videos surfaced last year of graphic\u000adiscussions about harvesting fetal tissue.Wednesday's vote, meanwhile,\u000aprovided fresh fodder for the Democratic presidential candidates. Hillary\u000aClinton warned in Iowa earlier this week that the vote shows the high stakes\u000aat play in the 2016 race. She, too, accused Republicans of offering no\u000aalternative.\u201cThey have no plan. The Republicans just want to undo what\u000aDemocrats have fought for decades and what President Obama got accomplished,\u201d\u000ashe said._Fox News\u2019 Chad Pergram contributed to this report. ___\u000a\u000a

VOct. 27, 2012: A Tea Party member reaches for a pamphlet titled "The Impact of\u000aObamacare", at a "Food for Free Minds Tea Party Rally" in Littleton, New\u000aHampshire . (Reuters)Illegal immigrants and individuals with unclear legal\u000astatus wrongly benefited from up to $750 million in ObamaCare subsidies and\u000athe government is struggling to recoup the money, according to a new Senate\u000areport obtained by Fox News.The report, produced by Republicans on the Senate\u000aHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, examined Affordable Care\u000aAct tax credits meant to defray the cost of insurance premiums. It found that\u000aas of June 2015, \u201cthe Administration awarded approximately $750 million in tax\u000acredits on behalf of individuals who were later determined to be ineligible\u000abecause they failed to verify their citizenship, status as a national, or\u000alegal presence.\u201dThe review found the credits went to more than 500,000 people\u000a\u2013 who are illegal immigrants or whose legal status was unclear due to\u000ainsufficient records. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services confirmed\u000ato FoxNews.com on Monday that 471,000 customers with 2015 coverage failed to\u000aproduce proper documentation on their citizenship or immigration status on\u000atime \u2013 but stressed that this does not necessarily mean they\u2019re ineligible.\u000a\u201cLack of verification does not mean an individual is ineligible for financial\u000aassistance, but only that a Marketplace did not receive sufficient information\u000ato verify eligibility in the time period outlined in the law,\u201d CMS spokesman\u000aAaron Albright said. The Senate report also accused the administration of\u000alacking a solid plan to get that money back \u2013 and predicted that in the end,\u000athe IRS will be \u201cunable to fully recoup the funds.\u201d\u201cThe information provided\u000ato the Committee by the IRS and HHS reveals a troubling lack of coordination\u000abetween the two agencies ... and demonstrates that the IRS and HHS neglected\u000ato consider how they would recover these wasteful payments,\u201d the report\u000asays.Under the law, the feds can dole out these payments on a temporary basis\u000aif a recipient\u2019s legal status is unclear, but are supposed to cut off funding\u000aand coverage if the recipient does not later come up with the paperwork. Up to\u000aa half-million \u201cineligible\u201d people, according to the report, applied in this\u000away -- with their credits paid in advance to the insurers. The IRS, though, is\u000asupposed to get overpayments back from the individuals themselves.The Senate\u000areport, based on a review launched by committee Chairman Sen. Ron Johnson,\u000aR-Wis., derisively describes this approach as \u201cpay and chase.\u201d In other words,\u000athe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pays credits and subsidies to\u000athe insurance companies on behalf of the applicants \u2013 and the feds then\u000a\u201cchase\u201d after any overpayments to ineligible people once they are\u000adiscovered.\u201cThis \u2018pay and chase\u2019 model has potentially cost taxpayers\u000aapproximately $750 million,\u201d the report says. The 500,000 individuals in\u000aquestion have been removed from coverage, according to the findings, as the\u000agovernment seeks to get the money back. The Senate report says the IRS and HHS\u000ainitially failed to coordinate on a plan for recouping funds, and claimed that\u000aa subsequent plan from the IRS to recoup the money is still \u201cineffective and\u000ainsufficient.\u201dIn a July letter to Johnson, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen\u000aassured that the agency is \u201ccommitted to identifying and efficiently\u000aaddressing\u201d improper payments. He reiterated that anyone \u201cnot lawfully\u000apresent\u201d who enrolls for ObamaCare coverage \u201cmust repay\u201d the advance premium\u000acredit payments, and would be breaking the law if they don\u2019t._Fox News\u2019 Chad\u000aPergram and FoxNews.com\u2019s Judson Berger contributed to this report.___\u000a\u000a

V  Republicans drove legislation toward Senate approval Thursday that would\u000ademolish President Barack Obama's signature health care law and block Planned\u000aParenthood's federal money, edging toward a veto fight the GOP knows it will\u000alose but believes will delight conservative voters in next year's\u000aelections.Congress has voted dozens of times to repeal all or parts of the\u000a2010 statute. If the House as expected sends the Senate bill to Obama, the\u000ameasure will become the first of its kind to reach the White House and be\u000avetoed, an act Republicans say will highlight GOP priorities for voters."It's\u000adefined by failure," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said of\u000athe law, blaming it for rising medical costs and citing problems encountered\u000aby Kentuckians. "It's punctuated with hopelessness. And the scale of its many\u000abroken promises is matched only by the scale of its defenders' rigid and\u000aunfeeling responses to them."The White House promised a veto, saying the bill\u000awould "take away critical benefits and health care coverage" from families.\u000aWith Republicans lacking the two-thirds House and Senate majorities needed for\u000aa successful override, debate on the measure became a political messaging\u000abattlefield as both parties looked toward the 2016 presidential and\u000acongressional campaigns.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., mocked the\u000aRepublicans' "absurd attempt" to repeal the health care law and noted the\u000alarge number of people -- including in McConnell's Kentucky -- who've obtained\u000acoverage under the law."Do they bother to talk to their constituents?" Reid\u000asaid of GOP lawmakers.Senators were voting on a stack of amendments to the\u000abill, all of them symbolic since the measure was destined to never become\u000alaw.In one, the Senate voted 54-46 to reject an attempt by Democrats to\u000aprevent the cuts to Planned Parenthood. The proposal by Sen. Patty Murray,\u000aD-Wash., which came six days after a gunman killed three people at one of the\u000agroup's Colorado clinics, would have also provided $1 billion for safety at\u000awomen's clinics.Republicans fault the health care law for rising insurance\u000apremiums and deductibles and a diminished choice of insurers in some markets.\u000aGovernment officials said this week that health care spending grew last year\u000aat 5.3 percent, in part because of the health law's coverage expansion, the\u000asteepest climb since Obama took office.With GOP leaders insisting they had the\u000avotes they would need, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said he would support the bill,\u000asaying it "lays the groundwork for Obamacare to be erased from the books\u000aaltogether." He and two GOP presidential candidates, Sens. Marco Rubio of\u000aFlorida and Ted Cruz of Texas, threatened in October to oppose the legislation\u000aif it didn't go further than a similar House-passed version.GOP lawmakers\u000asuggested the bill could serve as a bridge to a new Republican health care\u000alaw. Though Obama's overhaul was enacted five years ago and gets tepid support\u000ain public opinion polls, GOP members of Congress have yet to produce a\u000adetailed proposal to replace it.Democrats say repeal would destroy a program\u000athat has reduced the number of uninsured Americans by around 16 million, lets\u000afamilies' policies cover children until age 26 and guarantees coverage for\u000apeople with pre-existing illnesses.The overall Senate bill would effectively\u000adefang the health law's requirements for individual and employer-provided\u000acoverage by annulling the fines that enforce them.It would terminate the law's\u000aexpansion of Medicaid to cover additional lower-earning people and the federal\u000asubsidies it offers people buying policies in insurance marketplaces. It would\u000aalso annul tax increases imposed to cover the law's costs, including levies on\u000athe income of higher-earning people, medical devices, costly insurance\u000apolicies and tanning salons.Republicans wrapped the measure in a filibuster-\u000aproof process that requires just 51 votes for Senate passage, not the 60\u000ausually required to end stalling tactics. The GOP controls the chamber by\u000a54-46.Planned Parenthood, a longtime target of anti-abortion forces, has come\u000aunder fire after secretly recorded videos showed group officials discussing\u000atheir provision of fetal tissue to scientists. The organization says it\u000aconducts such transactions legally.Planned Parenthood gets $450 million of its\u000a$1.3 billion annual budget from federal taxpayers, mostly reimbursements for\u000atreating Medicaid patients. Federal dollars cannot be used for abortions\u000aexcept for rare exceptions.__\u000a\u000a

VANNAPOLIS \u2014 Maryland Democrats on Wednesday introduced a package of three gun-\u000acontrol measures as part of their legislative priorities, aiming to build on\u000athe state\u2019s sweeping 2013 weapons ban that recently was challenged by a\u000afederal court.One measure would ban guns on all college campuses in the state.\u000aAnother would bar state police from issuing gun permits to anyone on the\u000afederal no-fly list.The third measure would mandate courts to inform persons\u000aconvicted of domestic violence to surrender their guns to a federally licensed\u000afirearms dealer or to local police within 48 hours of being convicted. It also\u000awould establish a mandatory five-year prison sentence for anyone found with a\u000agun after being convicted of domestic violence.Democrats hailed the measures\u000aas life-saving and as building on the 2013 Firearms Safety Act, which banned\u000acertain military-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, among other\u000athings. That provision of the law was deemed potentially unconstitutional by a\u000athree-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in\u000aRichmond, and send back to a district court in Baltimore for\u000areconsideration.Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh said he is not\u000aconcerned about the challenge to the Firearms Safety Act, adding that the\u000abills introduced Wednesday will \u201cwithstand legal challenges.\u201d\u201cThree other\u000acircuits \u2026 have held the same types of laws to be constitutional. The Fourth\u000aCircuit is out of step with the country,\u201d Mr. Frosh said.He said the state\u000awould either appeal to the entire Fourth Circuit court or take the case to the\u000aU.S. Supreme Court.\u201cEither way, we think we\u2019ll be successful,\u201d he said.Sen.\u000aJames C. Rosapepe, Prince George\u2019s County Democrat, said Republicans had\u000alabeled unconstitutional the idea of preventing anyone on the terrorist watch\u000alist from owning a gun, but no list is perfect.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to balance the\u000asafety and security of the people of the United States, and the reality is,\u000aterrorism is real, it\u2019s here and if you\u2019re too dangerous to get on an\u000aairplane, you\u2019re too dangerous to buy a gun. It\u2019s not more complicated than\u000athat,\u201d Mr. Rosapepe said.Republican leaders said they had not yet read the\u000abills, but if constitutional issues are sorted out, they would be open to talk\u000aabout them.\u201cThe devil\u2019s in the details,\u201d Senate Minority Leader J.B. Jennings\u000asaid. \u201cOn the domestic violence side, without a doubt, that\u2019s one of the most\u000ahorrible things that you hear a domestic violence case that has gone to that\u000apoint where somebody has actually murdered an individual with a firearm. So\u000athat one, I have no problem looking at, let\u2019s talk about it.\u201dThe Baltimore\u000aCounty Republican also said he could support the no-fly list gun ban as long\u000aas the state ensures it isn\u2019t easy to get someone on the list just because\u000a\u201cthey don\u2019t like somebody.\u201dDemocratic leaders said these are \u201ccommon sense\u000ameasures\u201d that are widely supported by Marylanders.House Speaker Michael E.\u000aBusch said that whether lawmakers are Republican or Democrat, they would\u000alisten to their constituencies and Marylanders are asking for increased gun\u000acontrol._Story Continues \u2192_\u000a\u000a

VRocker Ted Nugent has drawn fire from the Anti-Defamation League with an\u000aonline post insinuating gun control is the product of a vast Jewish\u000aconspiracy.The 67-year-old \u201cCat Scratch Fever\u201d singer shared an image Monday\u000aon Facebook that shows the faces of several U.S. politicians next to Israeli\u000aflags and beneath the caption: \u201cSo who is really behind gun control?\u201d\u201cKnow\u000athese punks. They hate freedom, they hate good over evil, they would deny us\u000athe basic human right to self defense &amp; to KEEP &amp; BEAR ARMS while many\u000aof them have tax paid hired ARMED security! Know them well,\u201d wroteMr. Nugent,\u000areferring to the likes of Michael Bloomberg \u2014 titled as the former mayor of\u000a\u201cJew York City\u201d \u2014 and Sen. Dianne Feinstein \u2014 the California Democrat and\u000a\u201cglobalist political agent\u201d in the image.\u201cLet us raise maximum hell to shut\u000athem down!\u201d the post added.ADL \u2014 the country\u2019s largest group advocating\u000aagainst anti-Semitism \u2014 said that the image had been designed by someone other\u000athan the outspoken musician and had been made its rounds on the Internet\u000abefore, but condemned Mr. Nugent nevertheless for sharing it with his\u000afans.\u201cTed Nugent has a long history of being an equal opportunity offender.\u000aBut his latest share on Facebook, making the outrageous suggestion that Jews\u000aare behind gun control, is nothing short of conspiratorial anti-Semitism,\u201d\u000asaid Jonathan A. Greenblatt, the organization\u2019s CEO. \u201cRegardless of one\u2019s\u000aviews on gun control, this kind of scapegoating of an entire religious group\u000ais completely unacceptable and completely divorced from reality.\u201cIt should go\u000awithout saying that anti-Semitism has no place in the gun control debate,\u201d\u000aadded Mr. Greenblatt, who said Mr. Nugent should \u201cbe ashamed for promoting\u000aanti-Semitic content\u201d and urged him to remove it from his Facebook account.As\u000acriticism mounted, Mr. Nugent fired back several hours later, claiming in a\u000asubsequent post that \u201cJews for guncontrol are nazis in disguise.\u201d\u201cPlummet on\u000apunks. Plummet on. Meanwhile I adjust my yamika at my barmitzva playing my\u000akosher guitar,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMy dad killed nazis &amp; saved Jews in WWII.\u201dMr.\u000aNugent\u2019s first post \u2014 which also blamed prominent lawyer Alan Dershowitz and\u000aChicago Mayor Rahm Emmanuel for being behind gun control efforts \u2014 has been\u000ashared more than 2,700 times since being published Monday.Earlier this year,\u000aMr. Nugent called President Obama a \u201cpsychopathic, America-hating liar\u201d when\u000athe commander in chief teared up while giving a speech on gun control.\u000a\u000a

VANNAPOLIS, Md. \u2014 Democrats in the General Assembly said Wednesday that they\u000awill try to expand gun controls this year, hoping to build on some of the\u000anation\u2019s toughest laws by banning firearms on college campuses and requiring a\u000aprocess for those convicted of domestic violence to turn in their\u000aguns.Lawmakers announced the push even as the state\u2019s strict ban on military-\u000astyle rifles and large-capacity magazines, enacted in the months after the\u000a2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, have run into trouble in federal\u000acourts.\u201cGuns don\u2019t need to be on college campuses,\u201d Attorney General Brian E.\u000aFrosh said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need to be in the hands of domestic abusers. These\u000abills provide real measures of safety for real people.\u201dDemocrats are seeking a\u000apackage of three bills: one to ban firearms on college campuses, one to\u000arequire courts to inform those convicted of domestic violence they have 48\u000ahours to relinquish their guns and one that would prevent police from issuing\u000afirearms permits to anyone listed on the FBI\u2019s terrorist watch list.On\u000aTuesday, Sen. Jamie Raskin, Montgomery County Democrat, announced an\u000aadditional two bills that would mandate background checks before the purchase\u000aof a rifle or shotgun, and one that would alert law enforcement if a\u000aprohibited purchaser attempts to buy a gun.The bills could cause friction with\u000aGov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who received the National Rifle Association\u2019s\u000asupport in his 2014 campaign. His spokesperson said Wednesday that the\u000agovernor had no comment on the bills and was not aware that they would be\u000aintroduced.Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., Prince George\u2019s\u000aDemocrat, said he couldn\u2019t imagine Mr. Hogan opposing them.\u201cThe person he\u2019s\u000ajoined at the hip with is [Gov.] Chris Christie in New Jersey, and Chris\u000aChristie signed the same bill into law, the no-fly zone [in 2013], and no guns\u000aon campus is common sense,\u201d Mr. Miller said. \u201cAnd the domestic violence,\u000athat\u2019s already the law. We just want judges to enforce it, so hopefully he\u2019ll\u000asign all three.\u201dDemocrats said the bills build on the 2013 Firearms Safety\u000aAct, a sweeping law that banned the sale of nearly all semi-automatic rifles\u000aand high-capacity ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 bullets. It also\u000arequired mandatory extensive background checks, that all new gun buyers submit\u000adigital fingerprints to state police, and licensing for guns other than\u000ahunting rifles or shotguns.A federal appeals court last week said the law\u000ainfringes on Second Amendment rights and sent it back to a lower court for\u000astricter review.Mr. Frosh said he will appeal the appeals court\u2019s ruling and\u000aexpressed confidence that the 2013 law and the proposed bills will withstand\u000acourt scrutiny.Republican leaders said they had not yet read the bills but\u000awould be open to talking about them.\u201cThe devil\u2019s in the details,\u201d said Senate\u000aMinority Leader J.B. Jennings, Baltimore County Republican. \u201cOn the domestic\u000aviolence side, without a doubt, that\u2019s one of the most horrible things that\u000ayou hear: a domestic violence case that has gone to that point where somebody\u000ahas actually murdered an individual with a firearm. So that one, I have no\u000aproblem looking at. Let\u2019s talk about it.\u201dMr. Jennings said he would consider\u000athe terrorist watch list proposal as well but wanted to know how easy it would\u000abe for a person to end up on the list.Maryland gun rights groups said the\u000abills would do little to curtail rising crime rates._Story Continues \u2192_\u000a\u000a

VDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson emphasized across the\u000aboard active-shooter training by local law enforcement as one of the best ways\u000ato limit damage in an attack by self-radicalized terrorists, noting the\u000adifficulty of predicting the next target.\u201cActive-shooter training works,\u201d Mr.\u000aJohnson said Thursday as he answered questions following his State of Homeland\u000aSecurity address. \u201cIf you\u2019re not doing active-shooter training, you need to\u000abe.\u201dThe remarks on how to respond to an attack come as intelligence officials\u000awarned this week that the Islamic State terrorist group will likely attempt to\u000alaunch a direct attack on the U.S. in 2016.\u201cThe terrorist-inspired actor makes\u000afor a more complex homeland security challenge,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cAs I see\u000athis threat evolve, I think our relationships and grants to state and local\u000alaw enforcement are becoming more and more important.\u201dMr. Johnson said more\u000athan $2 billion in homeland security assistance was provided to state and\u000alocal law enforcement in 2015 for things like active-shooter training and\u000acommunications and surveillance equipment.One of those initiatives included an\u000aactive-shooter drill held in the New York City subway system in November.Mr.\u000aJohnson\u2019s remarks came in a speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington,\u000aD.C., in which he reflected on accomplishments by the Department of Homeland\u000aSecurity under his leadership and outlined goals the department will strive to\u000ameet during the remainder of his time in office.He stressed that recent\u000achanges to security screening protocols are having a positive effect on the\u000asafety of air travel, noting that stepped-up security screenings at 15\u000aoverseas airports have stopped more than 10,700 travelers who did not pass\u000apre-clearance checks from coming to the United States. He added that the\u000adepartment hopes to get pre-clearance screening capabilities up and running at\u000aanother 10 international airports in nine countries.As a result of new\u000asecurity protocols, the wait times for security screening at airports have\u000aincreased, but Mr. Johnson said \u201cwe believe this is necessary for the public\u2019s\u000aown safety.\u201dEfforts focused on counterterrorism also denied an additional\u000a3,000 people entry into the United States in fiscal 2015 based on the\u000atightening of entry restrictions, he said.Mr. Johnson also highlighted efforts\u000athe U.S. has taken to more narrowly tailor its immigration policies to address\u000athreats to public safety and border security. He said since the administration\u000achanged policy, replacing the Secure Communities program with the Priority\u000aEnforcement Program in July, that 16 counties that were not cooperating with\u000athe federal government on illegal immigration issues have now come on board\u000a.Stepped-up efforts are also having an impact on the recent surge of illegal\u000aborder crossers from Central America that began late last year.According to\u000aDHS data, 3,133 unaccompanied minors were caught at the border in January,\u000awhich was down from 6,786 the month before. And the number of family members\u000atraveling together fell from nearly 9,000 in December to just 3,145 last\u000amonth. Mr. Johnson said thus far the numbers for February appear to be showing\u000athe same \u201cencouraging\u201d trend.\u000a\u000a

VThere is nothing so comforting as a closely held prejudice, even when it\u000arepeatedly harms you. The white-hot passion of Democratic politicians to\u000arestrict and even strip Americans of their constitutionally guaranteed right\u000ato buy, own, keep, shoot and carry firearms continues as a monument to self-\u000aabuse.Simply put, the gun control issue is a loser. It doesn\u2019t matter that the\u000apaid consultants, the lobbyists from the gun-prohibition industry, or the East\u000aCoast media all assure candidates that it\u2019s now safe to come out of hiding and\u000aproclaim their open hatred of the very concept of self-defense and protecting\u000ayour family. The history of Democrats who push to rip away the rights of\u000amillions of Americans constitutes a list of \u201cwhatever happened to\u201d candidates.\u000aFrom dozens of Democrats who lost their seats in Congress because of their\u000agun-ban vote in 1994 to Al Gore\u2019s anti-rights position, which has been\u000acredited with costing him the presidency, the party of \u201ctrust the government\u000afor your personal safety\u201d keeps having to relearn the lesson. In point of\u000afact, their own party put out a paper some years ago warning candidates to not\u000atalk about gun control, calling it a loser issue.How quickly they forget.Now\u000aHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders fight to establish who is the strongest\u000aanti-Constitution candidate. It\u2019s a clear indication neither they nor their\u000aadvisers actually talk to real people outside the Washington cocktail\u000acircuit.For more than 20 years I\u2019ve hosted a national radio talk show about\u000aguns, and through that I\u2019ve talked with thousands of people across the country\u000a\u2014 people who have owned guns all their lives, people who only recently bought\u000aa gun, and people who have never owned a gun but now want to. Typically, I\u2019ll\u000aask why they are thinking of buying their first gun, and the answer always is\u000athat they want to protect themselves and their families. They have looked at\u000athe news, studied the events, watched the videos of attacks on the streets,\u000aand they have concluded that no one else will be on the scene to protect them.\u000aOh, and fully a third of first-time handgun buyers these days are women, so\u000aput aside that mental image of a demographic which can be ignored.Perhaps it\u2019s\u000anatural for a U.S. senator who has Secret Service protection or who works\u000abehind the security veil of the Capitol Police to not understand the desire\u000afor safety. For someone who sees more government as the solution to\u000aeverything, it must seem strange that a mother would opt to protect her\u000achildren rather than trust that the call to the 911 operator will instantly\u000asave her.Callers to \u201cTom Gresham\u2019s Gun Talk\u201d say they look at the well-known\u000aattacks, do the math and understand that the police will show up when they\u000acan, but in most cases it\u2019s too late to actually stop the attack. They\u000acategorize assurances of \u201cjust call the police \u2014 it\u2019s their job\u201d as callous\u000aputdowns from those who never worry about their own safety.It may overstate it\u000ato call gun control the third rail of politics, but it\u2019s certainly a hot stove\u000athat Democrats should have learned to avoid. That\u2019s even more so now than\u000aeight years ago when Hillary Clinton soft-peddled her gun-ban leanings. During\u000athe intervening years, millions of Americans have purchased their first gun,\u000amoving from the undecided to committed. With their dollars they have voted for\u000atheir own safety, and they simply don\u2019t trust anyone who says they are\u000awrong.In 2013, the rush to purchase guns and ammunition emptied shelves at gun\u000astores for nearly a year. That push may have lessened a bit, but gun makers\u000astill operate at maximum capacity. The millions of Americans buying guns do\u000anot think, as Mrs. Clinton has suggested, that we should consider Australian-\u000astyle gun confiscation here.The candidates have not been helped by others in\u000atheir party who introduce bills in Congress and in the states calling for the\u000aconfiscation of the most popular rifles and handguns in the United States.\u000aFaced with clear evidence of the intent to ban guns, the public smirks at\u000areassurances from candidates and President Obama when they proclaim, \u201cNo one\u000awants to take away your guns.\u201d It\u2019s a lie, and everyone knows it.As for the\u000aclaim that \u201c90 percent of the public wants background checks,\u201d it doesn\u2019t hold\u000aup when you look past the misleading polls. If you explain that there\u000acurrently is a national background check requirement, and that every gun\u000apurchase from a licensed dealer includes a background check by the FBI, you\u000atypically get, \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t know that.\u201d Likewise, if you explain that gun\u000ashows are governed by the same laws as all other gun sales, and that there is\u000ano exception for these community gatherings, the result tends to be a puzzled\u000alook, then an angry response, as the duplicity of politicians and the media in\u000amisleading the public on the mythical \u201cgun show loophole\u201d crystallizes.One is\u000aleft wondering why Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have opted to not only reveal,\u000abut to loudly proclaim their enthusiasm for trampling the rights of 100\u000amillion Americans. Have they not looked at the number of people scrambling to\u000aget permits for concealed carry in the swing states? Have they not looked at\u000athe actions in the legislatures in swing states \u2014 actions opening concealed\u000acarry to more areas, laws which allow teachers to carry guns in schools, and\u000aeven calls to eliminate completely any requirement for a permit to carry a gun\u000afor protection? The sea change in public opinion (for the first time, more\u000athan half the people polled oppose a ban on so-called \u201cassault weapons\u201d)\u000aappears to have been missed by Democratic insiders. When it comes to guns, the\u000aswing states in the general election do not have the same take on guns as\u000aeight years ago \u2014 back when Democrats knew better than to out themselves as\u000agun banners.As the Democratic candidates move ever farther from public opinion\u000aon the rights of gun owners, many observers scratch their heads, wondering how\u000athe party can continue to allow its prejudice to outweigh its self-\u000ainterests.**\u2022 **_Tom Gresham hosts the nationally syndicated radio talk show\u000a\u201cTom Gresham\u2019s Gun Talk\u201d (guntalkmedia.com)._\u000a\u000a

VBillionaire climate activist Tom Steyer has spent millions of dollars trying\u000ato make climate change a major issue on the 2016 campaign trail. But neither\u000athe candidates nor the voters seem to notice.After one of the Democratic\u000apresidential debates, Mr. Steyer issued a statement lamenting that the focus\u000aon climate change was \u201cfar too brief.\u201d Following a Republican debate, he\u000aexpressed outrage that \u201cnot a single Republican presidential candidate took\u000athis threat seriously,\u201d to which he added, \u201cAnd that\u2019s why not a single one of\u000athese candidates is qualified to get anywhere near the Oval Office.\u201dTo be\u000afair, Mr. Steyer does appear to hold sway over the Democratic presidential\u000acandidates. Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have, at Mr. Steyer\u2019s\u000ainsistence, pledged to achieve at least 50 percent \u201cclean\u201d energy by 2030. Mr.\u000aSteyer, who has yet to throw his support behind a candidate, appears to be\u000adangling his wealth and endorsement over the Democratic candidates to cajole\u000athem to do even more.Just days before the New Hampshire primary, Mrs. Clinton\u000awas asked if she would support banning the extraction of natural gas, oil, and\u000acoal on public lands. \u201cYeah, that\u2019s a done deal,\u201d was her reply. Clarifying\u000aher position to another activist, she said, \u201cNo future extraction. I agree\u000awith that.\u201d Similarly, Mr. Sanders has co-sponsored legislation in the Senate\u000athat would block the development of these resources on federal lands.\u000aAccording to a recent study commissioned by the Institute for Energy Research,\u000aof which I am president, these \u201ckeep it in the ground\u201d proposals would forgo\u000amillions of jobs, trillions of dollars in higher wages, and $20.7 trillion in\u000aeconomic activity.Fortunately, on the whole, Mr. Steyer\u2019s campaign to restrict\u000aaffordable and reliable energy isn\u2019t getting many converts. Mr. Steyer spent\u000a$73.7 million of his own money in a failed effort to make climate change a\u000amajor issue in the 2014 elections. He wasted millions of dollars on ads that\u000aoften didn\u2019t even address climate change and whose truthfulness was disputed\u000aby fact-checking organizations like Poltifact and Factcheck.org. After his\u000anearly yearlong campaign, climate change actually dropped as a priority among\u000avoters, ending up near the bottom of their list of concerns.Mr. Steyer\u000ashouldn\u2019t be entirely surprised if presidential hopefuls aren\u2019t jumping\u000athrough his hoops with enthusiasm. In a recent Gallup poll of the most\u000aimportant problems facing the United States, climate change was not even\u000alisted. The broader \u201cEnvironment/Pollution\u201d was in 18th place as a concern of\u000ajust 2 percent of the respondents. The political reality is that candidates\u000amust attract the mainstream electorate, who prioritize the economy, jobs and\u000apoverty \u2014 issues that are in direct conflict with Mr. Steyer\u2019s goals.Mr.\u000aSteyer\u2019s own state of California is ripe with examples of his agenda clashing\u000awith the people\u2019s needs. Due in part to regulations that require non-\u000ahydroelectric renewables to represent 33 percent of the state\u2019s electricity\u000asupply by 2020, residential electricity bills are nearly 40 percent higher\u000athan the national average and the ninth highest in the nation. Nevertheless,\u000alast year, Mr. Steyer testified in favor of legislation that would have bumped\u000athe current 33 percent renewables target up to 50 percent by 2030.Mr. Steyer\u000aalso supports California\u2019s cap-and-trade program, which could raise gasoline\u000aprices by anywhere from 16 cents to 76 cents per gallon. Meanwhile, he\u2019s\u000apushing a ballot measure that would impose a 10 percent tax on oil extraction.\u000aThis tax would, of course, raise gasoline prices for the state\u2019s motorists,\u000awho already pay a 59 cents per gallon gas tax \u2014 one of the nation\u2019s highest\u000aand about 11 cents more than the national average. Even without new taxes,\u000aCalifornia already has some of the highest gasoline prices in the\u000acountry.Higher energy costs have created a serious problem in California.\u000aAccording to a report by the Manhattan Institute, one million California\u000ahouseholds live in energy poverty, which is defined as a household in which 10\u000apercent or more of the residents\u2019 income is spent on household energy costs\u000a(excluding gasoline and other transportation-related costs). Higher energy\u000acosts leave these families with less money to spend on other necessities like\u000agroceries or proper healthcare.Candidates seeking the presidential nomination\u000a\u2014 particularly in the Democratic camp \u2014 can\u2019t square their rhetoric with their\u000apolicies. They claim to help the poor, but they support energy policies that\u000awill make it harder for low-income families to make ends meet. Meanwhile, poll\u000aafter poll shows Americans are more concerned about growing the economy and\u000acreating jobs than sacrificing their economic futures at the altar of Tom\u000aSteyer\u2019s climate agenda.**\u2022 **_Thomas J. Pyle is the President of the American\u000aEnergy Alliance._\u000a\u000a

VOsama bin Laden penned a letter \u201cto the American people\u201d asking them to help\u000aPresident Obama fight climate change and \u201csave humanity,\u201d according to\u000adocuments released Tuesday by the Obama administration.The letter was among\u000amaterials seized from the May 2, 2011, Special Forces raid that killed bin\u000aLaden at his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, Reuters reported.The undated,\u000aunsigned letter that U.S. intelligence officials attributed to bin Laden\u000aappeared to have been written shortly after Mr. Obama began his first\u000apresidential term in 2009, based on the letter\u2019s references to events, Reuters\u000areported.** SEE ALSO: Osama bin Laden document dump: His will shows he wanted\u000ato use $29M for jihad **The late al Qaeda leader hoped Americans would launch\u000a\u201ca great revolution\u201d to free Mr. Obama from the influences of lobbyists.That\u000awould enable the president to make \u201ca rational decision to save humanity from\u000athe harmful gases that threaten its destiny,\u201d bin Laden wrote.Another letter\u000afeatured a writer purported to be bin Laden arguing that \u201cthe world should put\u000aits efforts into attempting to reduce the release of gases.\u201d\u201cThis is a\u000astruggle between two of the largest cultures on Earth, and it is in the shadow\u000aof catastrophic climate conditions.\u201dThe letters are among a tranche of 113\u000adocuments \u2014 dating mostly from 2009 to 2011 and translated from Arabic into\u000aEnglish \u2014 published on Tuesday by the Office of the Director of National\u000aIntelligence.\u000a\u000a

VPure science undertaken for science\u2019s own sake is as rare as a rainbow. It\u2019s\u000acertainly scarce in Washington, where the quest for knowledge is vulnerable to\u000athe bias of politics. Skeptics of President Obama\u2019s climate change agenda say\u000athey see new evidence of fraud. If administration officials are colluding with\u000ascientists to cook the evidence, such as it might be, to demonstrate that the\u000aplanet is warming, the skeptics deserve everyone\u2019s thanks.Whistleblowers\u000awithin the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) complained\u000alast year that a major study by agency researcher Thomas Karl, refuting\u000aevidence of a pause in global warming, had been rushed to publication. The\u000aimplication was that the study was coordinated with Obama administration\u000aofficials to add to the urgency of the president\u2019s climate change agenda in\u000aadvance of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. Republicans\u000aon the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology issued a subpoena of\u000arecords of NOAA communications dealing with the study.The inquiry began afresh\u000alast month when Rep. Lamar Smith, wrote to NOAA expressing disappointment\u000a\u201cwith the slow pace and limited scope of the agency\u2019s production [of such\u000arecords],\u201d which had yielded only 301 pages. Mr. Smith directed officials to\u000abroaden their search for relevant documents. He said the committee had\u000areceived a letter signed by 325 scientists, engineers, economists and other\u000ascholars questioning whether the agency had properly peer-reviewed the\u000a\u201cquality, objectivity, utility and integrity\u201d of the data used in the Karl\u000astudy.Data consist of facts, and facts can be cherry-picked to yield a desired\u000aeffect. In the NOAA study, researchers found that ocean temperatures measured\u000aby ships were warmer than those recorded by buoys anchored in place, and\u000ascientists \u201cdeveloped a method to correct the difference between ship and buoy\u000ameasurements.\u201d Ship\u2019s engines, however, can heat nearby water and produce\u000afalse readings. By including those values, critics contend, the agency may\u000ahave effectively erased evidence of the global warming pause.President Obama\u2019s\u000aefforts to \u201cre-engineer\u201d the American energy industry is based on the argument\u000athat combustion of fossil fuels endangers the planet, and a rapid transition\u000ato renewable power sources is essential. The argument was the basis for the\u000aParis climate change agreement, endorsed by nearly 200 nations. If documents\u000awere to emerge suggesting temperature data was doctored to reach an expedient\u000aconclusion in the NOAA study, and if White House officials were part of such a\u000ascheme, that would be proof that science had been recruited to serve politics.\u000aTrust in government would be further eroded.This would not be the first\u000ainstance of Obama-era back-channel scheming. Republican members of the Senate\u000aEnvironment and Public Works Committee issued a report last summer accusing\u000athe Environmental Protection Agency of colluding with the Natural Resources\u000aDefense Council and other \u201cgreen\u201d organizations to develop the president\u2019s\u000alandmark Clean Power Plan, which will saddle Americans with billions of\u000adollars in higher energy bills for decades to come. EPA officials quietly\u000aschemed with environmentalists to write regulations reinforcing their shared\u000aclimate change agenda. The agency has denied the accusations.Science must be\u000afree from pressure to validate political goals. If findings and measurements\u000aare altered to serve a political agenda, the findings are flawed. It\u2019s called\u000afraud, and should be punished.\u000a\u000a

VYesterday it was still February, but the high temperature hit 64 degrees here\u000ain Washington, with snow drifts still melting from last month\u2019s massive East\u000aCoast blizzard. So what are we to make of the weather and the climate change\u000acontroversy? Is it getting warmer or colder?It\u2019s not even a question worth\u000aasking, as far as the analysts at NASA are concerned. Before the blizzard hit,\u000athey had already announced that 2015 was the hottest year on record. Not that\u000athis is anything new for most Americans. We hear dire global warming\u000aproclamations on a near-daily basis, and it\u2019s always just been the hottest\u000aday, week, month or year \u2014 no matter what the weather\u2019s like outside.Yet, as\u000aclimate expert David Kreutzer recently pointed out, NASA is fairly selective\u000aabout which information you\u2019re supposed to believe. The agency\u2019s own satellite\u000adata shows that while last year was indeed warm, it wasn\u2019t as warm as 2010 or\u000a1998.But wait, some may say. You can chalk up this discrepancy to the\u000adifference between what the satellite data says and what the surface\u000atemperatures are (which NASA gathers from thousands of sites worldwide, with a\u000afew \u201cadjustments\u201d thrown in). But it doesn\u2019t matter. Neither data set supports\u000athe wild predictions being bandied about by global warming alarmists.Search\u000aall the data for evidence of the accelerated warming projected by the\u000aIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and you come up empty-handed.\u000aSometimes temperatures go up, but not always. There\u2019s no constant warming.\u000aIndeed, the data show a significant moderation of the warming trend. At times\u000ait appears to have leveled off or even cooled a bit.Should we be surprised?\u000aNot really. When you throw in variables such as measurement errors, as well as\u000aEl Nino and La Nina, it makes sense that the average temperature for some\u000ayears will be higher even if the overall trend is flat.\u201cWill the trend stay\u000aflat? Probably not,\u201d Mr. Kreutzer writes. \u201cThe Earth has been recovering from\u000athe Little Ice Age for a couple of centuries and recovering from a real ice\u000aage for thousands of years. So there is a reasonable chance that we will\u000arevert to an overall warming trend, but there is no guarantee. Who knows? We\u000amight even be headed into another ice age (as was predicted in the\u000a1970s).\u201dNone of this is to say that human-caused carbon-dioxide emissions\u000ahaven\u2019t contributed to some warming. They likely have. But the bottom line is\u000athat, one way or the other, there\u2019s no reason to believe that the sky is\u000afalling. Or, to be more exact, that the earth beneath it is warming up to\u000alevels that should frighten us.No data points to catastrophic warming,\u000ahysterical predications aside. And, it should be noted, the National Oceanic\u000aand Atmospheric Administration and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\u000aChange show that there have been no upward trends in hurricanes, tornadoes,\u000afloods or droughts.Small wonder then, that liberal groups who are vested in\u000aglobal warming alarmism often ignore data that contradict their agenda. They\u000atell us repeatedly that the debate is over, as if there is an expiration date\u000aon free speech. Unfortunately, too many in the media comply. Some outlets,\u000asuch as the Los Angeles Times, won\u2019t even accept letters to the editor that\u000aquestion the gospel of man-made climate change.Hence we get very selective\u000areporting. \u201cFor example, the national media hyped NASA\u2019s finding that 2014 was\u000athe hottest year on record,\u201d writes Republican Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas.\u000a\u201cIgnored was the footnote that revealed that NASA was only 38 percent certain\u000athis was accurate. Less than fifty-fifty. Americans would have been better\u000aserved by a coin toss.\u201dThere\u2019s a lot of hot air circulating, all right.\u000aFortunately, it\u2019s more political than scientific. Leonardo DiCaprio may have\u000abeen taken in, but the rest of us can ignore the overheated rhetoric.**\u2022 **_Ed\u000aFeulner is founder of the Heritage Foundation (heritage.org)._\u000a\u000a

VOnlookers cheered as a suspected arson fire damaged a planned refugee center\u000ain eastern Germany early Sunday, police said.No one was injured in the fire,\u000abut some people gathering outside the building expressed \u201cunashamed joy\u201d while\u000athe roof burned, Bautzen police said, The Associated Press reported.Police\u000aarrested two people, whom they described as intoxicated 20-year-old locals,\u000aafter they ignored an order to leave the fire scene. No arrests in connection\u000awith the fire were made.The incident comes amid heightened tensions in Germany\u000aover the registration of more than a million asylum-seekers from Syria last\u000ayear. Opponents have staged protests in front of the refugee homes, which have\u000areported seeing a surge in violence, AP reported.Investigators in Bautzen, in\u000athe eastern state of Saxony, found traces of a fire accelerant at the scene\u000aand believe the fire was caused by arson, police said. It wasn\u2019t immediately\u000aclear whether the building \u2014 a former hotel \u2014 can be restored.It comes after a\u000amob in the small town of Clausnitz, also in Saxony, on Thursday blocked a bus\u000acarrying asylum-seekers outside a new refugee home, AP reported.Saxony\u000aGovernor Stanislaw Tillich called the two incidents \u201cappalling and shocking,\u000aand he pledged that authorities will \u201cbring everyone responsible to\u000aaccount.\u201dInterior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said everyone is entitled to\u000avoice their opinions in Germany, \u201cbut there is a threshold of decency and law\u000athat must not be crossed \u2014 and this threshold was clearly crossed in the\u000aincidents in Saxony,\u201d the news agency dpa reported.\u201cIt is completely\u000aunacceptable for people who are seeking protection from persecution here to be\u000agreeted with hatred and agitation,\u201d Mr. de Maiziere said.\u000a\u000a

VThe media debate about Western countries accepting \u201crefugees\u201d has been full of\u000amore assertions than facts. Here, then, are a few facts.Sweden is planning to\u000adeport between 60,000 and 80,000 refugees. That would be about 45 percent of\u000athe refugees who came to Sweden last year.This is not a completely new\u000aphenomenon. In 2014, Sweden received 81,000 refugees and rejected 56 percent,\u000aabout 46,000 of them.In Denmark, the government has drastically cut welfare\u000apayments for refugees and run newspaper ads in the Middle East warning that\u000abenefits are being shrunk and that people should not come to Denmark. The\u000aDanish government has also adopted new rules to seize valuables from refugees\u000ato help pay for the cost of their stay in Denmark.According to Reuters,\u000aAustria is also announcing the deportation of 50,000 refugees.A new study\u000aestimates Germany will spend more than 50 billion euros on refugees in 2016\u000aand 2017, according to the Cologne Institute for Economic Research. Some\u000aestimates that indicate Germany is likely to spend more on refugees than it\u000adoes on its military.According to the BBC, in Cologne, Germany, more than 500\u000awomen have filed complaints about attacks by foreign migrants on New Year\u2019s\u000aEve. More than 40 percent of the complaints involved sexual assault, ranging\u000afrom groping to rape. A crowd of more than 1,000 foreign men had gathered\u000aaround the train station in Cologne that night and systematically harassed\u000aGerman women.The American news media and American politicians have not had\u000amuch to say about the alarming news coming out of European countries regarding\u000arefugees from the Middle East. We are witnessing a conspiracy of politically\u000acorrect silence. Our elites do not want to acknowledge that the wave of\u000arefugees brings with it a lot of serious problems.In Germany, this politically\u000acorrect silence meant the police and the news media downplayed the New Year\u2019s\u000aattacks until the stream of complaints on social media overwhelmed their\u000aattempt to hide the truth.In the Scandinavian countries, there has been a\u000aconsistent policy of ignoring or minimizing refugee or migrant violence\u000aagainst Swedes.There is danger that we in the United States are only a few\u000ayears behind Europe in having our society inundated with people who do not\u000ashare our customs, understand our values or feel that violence is\u000ainappropriate. Americans need to take a careful look at the painful experience\u000aof the Europeans before we follow them down that path.The next time someone\u000atells you the United States has nothing to fear from accepting tens or\u000ahundreds of thousands of refugees, ask them to explain what is happening in\u000aEurope. Why are so many European nations rejecting refugees?\u000a\u000a

VThe Twitter account of Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka advocated for\u000abeheading refugees on Wednesday after it was compromised by hackers who\u000aunleashed a wave of anti-migrant tweets over the course of several hours\u000abefore their access was revoked.A formal complaint has been filed by the prime\u000aminister\u2019s office after hackers published around a dozen inflammatory tweets\u000adirected toward refugees from Mr. Sobotka\u2019s account during a seven-hour span,\u000athe Prague Daily Monitor reported.\u201cDemocratic elites are devastating Europe.\u000aThere is no other way but to take up arms, build a guillotine and take justice\u000ainto one\u2019s own hands,\u201d read one of the tweets attributed to the\u000ahackers.\u201cRefugees are an invading army! The few women among them are only the\u000amothers of future terrorists. All who are helping them should be guillotined,\u201d\u000aread another.The prime minister\u2019s office said it wasn\u2019t immediately sure who\u000awas responsible for the tweets, but spokesman Martin Ayrer told AFP that the\u000acontent suggests \u201cit\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s some neo-Nazis.\u201d\u201cIf my Twitter\u000aaccount is attacked by neo-Nazis, I take it as evidence that I\u2019m doing my job\u000awell. I wish a happy Christmas to all people of good will who reject spreading\u000ahatred, prefer humanity and support democracy,\u201d Mr. Sobotka said on\u000aFacebook.Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Sobotka said in an interview that German\u000aChancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s decision to welcome an unlimited number of refugees\u000afrom war-torn Syria posed problems for the rest of Europe.\u201cGermany has, for\u000athe time being, given precedence to the humanitarian aspects of the crisis\u000aover security issues,\u201d he told Germany\u2019s Sueddeutsche Zeitung\u000anewspaper.\u201cGermany sent a signal that could be seen and heard in large parts\u000aof the Middle East and North Africa,\u201d he added. \u201cThat stimulated illegal\u000amigration to Europe. Unfortunately, that cannot be denied.\u201d\u000a\u000a

VKAKUMA, Kenya \u2014 At the sprawling Kakuma Refugee camp here in a remote corner\u000aof northern Kenya, Jael Aluel uses an old South Sudanese folk remedy \u2014 chewing\u000aherbs \u2014 to distract herself from hunger pangs.She waits for food. She waits to\u000aresume her life. She hoped that something would change after a peace deal was\u000asigned last week to end the civil war in her native South Sudan. But that\u000aagreement is already threatening to fall apart, just like all the previous\u000aattempts at reconciliation in the bloody two-year civil war.So she waits for\u000apeace.\u201cI came here with my kids to escape the civil war and to look for food,\u201d\u000amumbled Ms. Aluel, a widow who bore six children and now looks frail and\u000asickly. \u201cBut I am willing to go back when peace prevails and build my own\u000acountry.\u201dThe power-sharing agreement signed last week was supposed to be the\u000aculmination of peace accords reached in August to end the fighting between\u000aSouth Sudanese President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and his rival, former\u000aVice President Riek Machar, of the rival Nuer tribe. The fighting has killed\u000atens of thousands and displaced more than 2 million Sudanese, according to the\u000aUnited Nations. But on Sunday Mr. Machar accused Mr. Kiir of delay tactics and\u000acalled back his negotiating team.That is not good news for those such as Ms.\u000aAluel.The widow arrived in Kakuma two years ago after she fled to Kenya with\u000athree of her surviving children, all six or younger. Her husband and three\u000aother children were killed in fighting in Bor, the provincial capital of\u000aJonglei State, an eastern province in South Sudan where the violence has been\u000amost intense.\u201cI was also raped by rebel soldiers and my house burned,\u201d she\u000asaid. \u201cI would rather risk starving than endure violence that killed my family\u000a[again].\u201dAcross the border between South Sudan and Kenya, a swarm of vultures\u000ahovers in the sky and a sickening smell fills the air. Slain bodies decaying\u000acan be seen on the South Sudan side of the border.\u201cSome of those people killed\u000ayou see are women and children,\u201d Ms. Aluel said. \u201cThey died while trying to\u000across the border to Kenya. Most of them were weak and hungry. They couldn\u2019t\u000asurvive long enough to reach here.\u201dThe existing Kakuma facility, which opened\u000ain 1992, is itself a kind of mini-U.N., home to refugees of 18 nationalities.\u000aAbout 80,000 of the 185,000 camp residents are South Sudanese. Somalis account\u000afor 30 percent. Significant numbers of refugees have also come from Ethiopia,\u000aBurundi, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The overloaded camp was\u000adesigned to hold 125,000 people and is straining at the seams to service the\u000adesperate refugees who flock here.\u201cWe do suffer because of hunger,\u201d said\u000aStephen Pech Gai, a South Sudanese citizen who lives in Kakuma refugee camp.\u000a\u201cWe are not able to learn as well as we were in our country. Most students who\u000awere supposed to join high school have dropped out because of many various\u000achallenges we are facing in camp.\u201d**Deadly power struggle**Violence has\u000aplagued South Sudan since it declared independence in a referendum from Sudan\u000ain 2011. First the country fought Sudan over disputed territory containing\u000avaluable oil deposits. Then the power struggle between Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar\u000adescended into civil war.Under the peace deal, the two longtime rivals would\u000ashare power, with members of the armed opposition sitting in parliament and\u000aMr. Machar controlling a third of government ministries. Voters would then\u000areplace the so-called unity government in elections in three years._Story\u000aContinues \u2192_\u000a\u000a

VLONDON (AP) - Tour company Thomas Cook has cancelled all bookings to Sharm el-\u000aSheikh until November, extending a travel ban that began when the government\u000asuspended flights following the crash of a Russian jetliner.The Islamic State\u000agroup claimed responsibility for the crash that killed 224 people over the\u000aSinai peninsula shortly after it took off from Sharm el-Sheikh. The Islamic\u000aState group said it planted the bomb inside a soda can.Russia suspended all\u000aflights to Egypt in response to the crash and Britain halted flights to Sharm\u000ael-Sheikh.The company extended its cancelled bookings from May 25 to Oct. 31\u000abecause it was not clear when Britain\u2019s Foreign Office would change travel\u000aadvice warning people against all but essential travel to the resort.\u000a\u000a

VIn what could be a major intelligence break in the war against the Islamic\u000aState, American and European officials are poring over a list of some 22,000\u000asuspected Islamic State recruits \u2014 including operatives from the U.S., Britain\u000aand Canada \u2014 whose addresses and phone numbers were on a memory stick leaked\u000ato a British news organization by a purported defector from the Syria-based\u000aterrorist group.While some intelligence sources claimed the information made\u000apublic this week by Sky News was largely outdated or already known to\u000aauthorities, others said it represented an invaluable window into the\u000asecretive world of jihadis from 51 nations who have joined the operation, also\u000aknown as ISIS and ISIL.Among the more chilling nuggets is a file marked\u000a\u201cMartyrs,\u201d detailing an Islamic State brigade manned entirely by fighters\u000aseeking and trained to carry out suicide attacks. Other documents included\u000ainformation on routes traveled by foreign recruits between their home nations\u000aand the Islamic State\u2019s stronghold in Syria and Iraq.The documents come amid\u000aheated debate over the extent to which the various international military\u000acampaigns against the Islamic State \u2014 by the U.S. and its allies, and by\u000aSyrian, Russian, Iraqi and Iranian forces \u2014 are affecting the terrorist\u000agroup\u2019s global reach.Pentagon officials have vowed this week that a revamped\u000aU.S. effort to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels to battle the Islamic\u000aState on the ground won\u2019t repeat the mistakes that doomed a similar program\u000alast year.Army Gen. Joseph Votel, President Obama\u2019s choice to be the next U.S.\u000acommander for the Middle East, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on\u000aWednesday that the new approach will be more of a \u201cthickening effort\u201d than the\u000aprevious effort, which aimed to raise a large defensive force against the\u000aIslamic State.**\u2018Omar the Chechen\u2019 survives?**Separately, there were signs\u000aThursday that a recent American airstrike targeting one of Islamic State\u2019s top\u000amilitary commanders in Syria was not as successful as U.S. officials had\u000ahoped.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that Abu Omar al-\u000aShishani, also known as \u201cOmar the Chechen,\u201d was injured but had survived the\u000aMarch 4 airstrike.Born in 1986 in Georgia, which was then part of the Soviet\u000aUnion, the red-bearded jihadi was a close adviser to Islamic State leader Abu\u000aBakr al-Baghdadi.Bill Roggio, a senior fellow on terrorism at the Foundation\u000afor Defense of Democracies, said there is often difficulty in determining\u000awhether a top jihadi commander has been killed or survived such a\u000astrike.\u201cWithout possession of a body for positive identification, intelligence\u000aservices must rely on other means to determine his status,\u201d Mr. Roggio wrote\u000aThursday in the foundation\u2019s Long War Journal. \u201cOften, the best way to know\u000awhether a leader was killed or not is to get confirmation from the jihadists\u000athemselves, as they wish to eulogize their leaders.\u201d\u201cThis usually is\u000areliable,\u201d he added, \u201cbut you cannot rule out the possibility that various\u000agroups are obscuring the status of their leaders.\u201dSimilar uncertainty has\u000asurrounded the revelation of the memory stick with Arabic language documents,\u000apurportedly containing the identities of thousands of Islamic State recruits\u000afrom around the world.While Sky News initially made headlines with the\u000ainformation, the material was reportedly also obtained by a Syrian newspaper\u000aand by Germany\u2019s intelligence agency, and was being examined by U.S. and\u000aBritish intelligence by Thursday. German officials, including Interior\u000aMinister Thomas de Maiziere, said they were confident the lead was authentic\u000aand matched the format of other internal Islamic State documents obtained by\u000aWestern intelligence services._Story Continues \u2192_\u000a\u000a

VBAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 The Islamic State group has launched two chemical attacks near\u000athe northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk, killing a three-year-old girl, wounding\u000asome 600 people and causing hundreds more to flee, Iraqi officials said\u000aSaturday.\u201cWhat the Daesh terrorist gangs did in the city of Taza will not go\u000aunpunished,\u201d Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said using an alternative\u000aacronym for the IS group during a meeting with village elders in Taza on\u000aSaturday. \u201cThe perpetrators will pay dearly.\u201dSecurity and hospital officials\u000asay the latest attack took place early Saturday in the small town of Taza,\u000awhich was also struck by a barrage of rockets carrying chemicals three days\u000aearlier.**PHOTOS: Iraqi officials: IS chemical attacks kill child, wound\u000a600**Sameer Wais, whose daughter Fatima was killed in the attack, is a member\u000aof a Shiite militia fighting IS in Kirkuk province. He said he was on duty at\u000athe frontline when the attack occurred early in the morning, quickly ran home\u000aand said he could still smell the chemicals in the rocket.\u201cWe took her to the\u000aclinic and they said that she needed to go to a hospital in Kirkuk. And that\u2019s\u000awhat we did, we brought her here to the hospital in Kirkuk,\u201d he said.Wais said\u000ahis daughter appeared to be doing better the next day so they took her home.\u000a\u201cBut by midnight she started to get worse. Her face puffed up and her eyes\u000abulged. Then she turned black and pieces of her skin started to come off,\u201d he\u000asaid.By the next morning, Fatima had died, Wais said.The hundreds of wounded\u000aare suffering from infected burns, suffocation and dehydration, said Helmi\u000aHamdi, a nurse at the Taza hospital. He said eight people were transferred to\u000aBaghdad for treatment.\u201cThere is fear and panic among the women and children,\u201d\u000asaid Adel Hussein, a local official in Taza. \u201cThey\u2019re calling for the central\u000agovernment to save them.\u201d Hussein said a German and an American forensics team\u000aarrived in the area to test for the presence of chemical agents.U.S. and Iraqi\u000aofficials said U.S. special forces captured the head of the IS unit trying to\u000adevelop chemical weapons in a raid last month in northern Iraq.The U.S.-led\u000acoalition said the chemicals IS has so far used include chlorine and a low-\u000agrade sulfur mustard which is not very potent. \u201cIt\u2019s a legitimate threat. It\u2019s\u000anot a high threat. We\u2019re not, frankly, losing too much sleep over it,\u201d U.S.\u000aArmy Col. Steve Warren told reporters Friday.Experts also say the extremist\u000agroup appears incapable of launching a large-scale chemical weapons\u2019 attack,\u000awhich requires not only expertise, but also the proper equipment, materials\u000aand a supply-chain to produce enough of the chemical agent to pose a\u000asignificant threat.The coalition began targeting IS\u2019 chemical weapons\u000ainfrastructure with airstrikes and special operations raids two months ago,\u000aIraqi intelligence officials and a Western security official in Baghdad told\u000athe AP.Airstrikes are targeting laboratories and equipment, and further\u000aspecial forces raids targeting chemical weapons experts are planned, the\u000aofficials said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not\u000aauthorized to brief reporters.The extremist group is believed to have set up a\u000aspecial unit for chemical weapons research made up of Iraqi scientists who\u000aworked on weapons programs under Saddam Hussein as well as foreign\u000aexperts._Story Continues \u2192_\u000a\u000a

VNo, it\u2019s not ISIS or rampaging Shi\u2019a militias. It\u2019s the Mosul Dam, Iraq\u2019s\u000alargest, and its possible collapse, perhaps leading to millions of deaths.\u000aThose in the know worry catastrophe could strike this spring, as snows melt\u000aand build an uncontrollable water pressure.Hastily built in wartime for the\u000adictator Saddam Hussein by a German-Italian consortium, the Mosul Dam was\u000alocated where it is because one of Hussein\u2019s cronies came from the area and\u000aused his pull, despite the fact that engineers knew from the start that its\u000aporous gypsum base could not sustain such a huge structure.What was then\u000acalled the Saddam Dam opened in 1984 and within two years needed constant\u000agrouting, that is, day and night infusions of microfine cement, lots of it \u2014\u000a200 million pounds over the decades \u2014 to keep it from collapsing. The grouting\u000akeeps the foundational problem from worsening but does not solve it.The years\u000awent by; fortunately, there was no disaster on the American watch. Then,\u000aduring a fateful 10-day period, Aug. 7-17, 2014, the Islamic State (ISIS)\u000aseized control of the dam. While the group neither sabotaged nor blew up the\u000astructure, grouting stopped for six weeks and the whole repair regime \u2014\u000aespecially the skilled workers and the supply of cement \u2014 henceforth became\u000aless consistent.As a result, the dam has steadily weakened over the past 19\u000amonths, to the point that experts worry that a surge of spring waters will\u000aoverwhelm it and cause its collapse. That the dam\u2019s two emergency floodgates\u000aare broken and cannot be opened to relieve intense pressure renders the\u000asituation the more fraught.The consequences of a collapse are terrifying: A\u000awall of water 45-70 feet high would reach Mosul, a city of about 1 million\u000ainhabitants, in about four hours. Then the flood wave would roll down the\u000aTigris River valley to other cities, including the capital Baghdad, before\u000adispersing in a wide flood. A huge number of immediate casualties would be\u000afollowed by drought, disease, lack of electricity, chaos, and crime, ensuring\u000abiblical-level miseries and fatalities.For years, quiet grouting and blithe\u000aassurances kept the precariousness of the Mosul Dam obscure. But heightened\u000aalarms coming from the U.S. government since the start of 2016, relying\u000aprimarily on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates, appear finally to have\u000aawakened Iraqis to the dangers they face. The U.S. embassy in Baghdad has even\u000aissued a highly unusual \u201cMosul Dam Preparedness Fact Sheet\u201d with advice (in\u000aEnglish, alas) on evacuation steps, educational needs, and relief efforts.In\u000acontrast, the Iraqi government issues a stream of dishonest assurances that\u000athere\u2019s no problem. Mohsen al-Shimari, Iraq\u2019s minister for Water Resources and\u000aofficial in charge of the dam, says \u201cThe danger is not imminent, it\u2019s far off.\u000aThe danger is 1 in 1,000\u201d (itself, an unacceptable risk). Or he insists that\u000aMosul Dam is in \u201cno greater\u201d danger than other dams. At other times he\u000aactually claims \u201cthere is no problem in the dam that may lead to its\u000acollapse.\u201d Note the inconsistency, itself a sign of duplicity.In keeping with\u000athis irresponsible, even criminal nonchalance, Iraqi authorities have done\u000anext to nothing to prepare for a possible collapse. Yes, they claim that a\u000acontingency plan exists, but no one has seen it, much less learned its\u000adetails, so what use can it have in time of crisis? Yes, they signed a $300\u000amillion deal with Trevi, an Italian company, to repair and maintain the Dam,\u000abut this is a Band-Aid fix, not a long-term solution.To make matters worse,\u000athe dam\u2019s most vulnerable city, Mosul, labors under the rule of the\u000aapocalyptic Islamic State, whose disregard for human life and extreme\u000ahostility toward the outside world negates both crisis planning and\u000ainternational assistance. But there is a silver lining here; ISIS\u2019 monstrous\u000arule has caused Mosul\u2019s population to decline from 2.5 million two years ago\u000ato about 1 million now, thereby reducing the number of potential casualties\u000athere.Assuming the dam survives this year\u2019s snow melt, only one long-term\u000asolution exists: to complete the Badush Dam downstream from the Mosul Dam that\u000awould mitigate the consequences of a collapse. Started soon after the grouting\u000abegan in 1986 but halted in 1990, this ancillary dam will cost US$10 billion\u000athat the Iraqi government cannot afford. But it must be the country\u2019s highest\u000apriority._\u2022 __Daniel Pipes is president of the Middle East Forum._\u000a\u000a

VThe man in charge of implementing Obamacare rallied insurers to the cause\u000aTuesday, saying there is a viable path forward for the law\u2019s insurance markets\u000aso long as health plans stay affordable and meet consumers\u2019 demands.Andy\u000aSlavitt, acting director at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,\u000asaid the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Web-based exchanges have moved beyond their\u000atechnological stumbles in fall 2013 and grown into a $40 billion\u000aindustry.\u201cBigger than the coffee industry,\u201d he told a conference hosted by\u000aAmerica\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry main lobbying group.Nearly 13\u000amillion new and returning customers signed up for 2016 coverage on the Web-\u000abased exchanges, where people can shop for private plans with the help of\u000agovernment subsidies. Now, the Obama administration is using its final 10\u000amonths to bolster the consumer experience on the Web portals, part of a\u000abroader push to promote enrollment and mitigate insurers\u2019 losses.Mr. Slavitt\u000asaid the administration is cracking down on \u201cbad actors\u201d by requiring\u000aconsumers to submit proof of life events that qualify them for special\u000aenrollment periods outside the regular signup season, so they don\u2019t just enter\u000athe marketplace once they become sick.He said insurers, too, play a role in\u000amaking sure their plans are attractive enough to retain enrollees.\u201cThe\u000aexchange is still in its early stages. Consumers are still getting educated\u000aabout what their coverage means. I think the health plans, to be fair, are\u000astill experimenting with how to offer the best products and services. And for\u000aour part, we\u2019re watching closely, looking at the data and making sure that we\u000aoperate an exchange that continues to work,\u201d Mr. Slavitt said.While it may be\u000aa long-term project, the law faces short-term expectations on Capitol Hill.GOP\u000acritics eyeing repeal with a White House ally in 2017 have pointed to\u000aUnitedHealth Group and other insurers who have worried aloud about their\u000afinancial prospects on the exchanges, saying they are losing money as sicker\u000athan expected customers sign up.They say premiums are going up in many places\u000a\u2014 not down \u2014 while out-of-pocket costs tied to some offerings leave enrollees\u000a\u201cfunctionally uninsured.\u201dAlso, congressional budget scorekeepers had projected\u000athat 21 million people should be using the exchanges at this point, compared\u000ato the 13 million that actually signed up. GOP critics say that\u2019s proof that\u000aenrollment is \u201cstalling out,\u201d though the administration says the initial\u000aprojection was wrong.Mr. Slavitt said the 2010 law is already working,\u000aextending coverage to 20 million Americans who didn\u2019t have it.Beyond the\u000aexchanges, officials in 31 states and D.C. have expanded their Medicaid\u000aprograms, while young adults can remain on their parents\u2019 plans until 26.\u201cIt\u000amay be one of the most significant things that any of us have been through or\u000ago through in our careers in health care,\u201d Mr. Slavitt said. \u201cThe question is,\u000awhat happens next?\u201d\u000a\u000a

VHalfway through tax season, uninsured filers are paying more than twice as\u000amuch as they did last year to satisfy Obamacare\u2019s penalty for lacking\u000acoverage, H&amp;R Block said Tuesday in an analysis that found other customers\u000aare still struggling to match their incomes to tax credits they got from Uncle\u000aSam.The tax-prep giant said its customers are paying an average penalty of\u000a$383 because of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s \u201cindividual mandate,\u201d compared to\u000a$172 last year.That\u2019s because the mandate, a lever designed to bring healthy\u000apeople into the new marketplace, rose from $95 or 1 percent of qualified\u000aincome \u2014 whichever is greater \u2014 in 2014 to $325 or 2 percent of income for\u000a2015.H&amp;R Block also said three out of five customers who received advanced\u000atax credits to help them buy private plans on Obamacare\u2019s web-based exchanges\u000amust pay a portion back to the IRS because they underestimated their actual\u000aincome for 2015.Together, the figures suggest filers are struggling with\u000aObamacare, even though it is the law\u2019s second waltz with tax season.Starting\u000ain 2014, Obamacare\u2019s subsidies were designed to lend a helping hand to low-\u000aand moderate-income Americans who do not hold insurance through jobs or a\u000agovernment program such as Medicaid, and cannot afford coverage on the\u000aindividual market.Yet by routing subsidies through the tax system, filers were\u000aforced to reconcile the financial help they received up front with their\u000aactual income during the year. If the two don\u2019t match, then filers will either\u000acough up more to the IRS or get more money back.Only 52 percent had to repay a\u000aportion of government subsidy during last year\u2019s tax season, compared to 60\u000apercent this year \u2014 undercutting the belief that subsidized customers would\u000aget better at estimating their annual pay after a year of practice.The average\u000aamount they\u2019ve paid back to Uncle Sam has also gone up, from $530 last year to\u000a$579.\u201cWith millions of new marketplace enrollees going through the\u000areconciliation process for the first time we expected to see some confusion,\u201d\u000asaid Mark Ciaramitaro, vice president of H&amp;R Block\u2019s taxes and health care\u000aservices. \u201cBut the fact a majority of returning marketplace enrollees are\u000aunderestimating and having to pay back a portion of the [tax credit] signals\u000athere is still a steep learning curve on how to accurately estimate income in\u000aapplying for the premium tax credit when enrolling in a marketplace plan.\u201dHe\u000asaid the problem could be due to high year-to-year volatility in how much low-\u000aincome households take in each year.H&amp;R Block said customers who had to\u000arepay some subsidy still saw an average refund of $2,022, although it is less\u000athan what they would have received.More than a third of taxpayers who claimed\u000aObamacare tax credits overestimated their income and got extra money back from\u000athe IRS \u2014 $450 on average. Only 3 percent of customers didn\u2019t see any impact\u000aon their refunds because of their exchange subsidies.H&amp;R Block\u2019s analysis\u000aadds to data reported last month by TurboTax, a tax-filing company that said\u000aseven in 10 taxpayers using its online system this season claimed an exemption\u000afrom the Obamacare mandate tax.Many of those say even the cheapest plans\u000aavailable to them at work or on the exchanges are still too expensive, and so\u000athey claimed the IRS\u2019s financial burden exemption in refusing to gain\u000acoverage. Others said they were exempt because they\u2019d recently been evicted,\u000ahad a close family member die, or had another hardship that excused them from\u000athe mandate._Story Continues \u2192_\u000a\u000a

VA woman from Pennsylvania who now identifies as a transgender man wants to\u000ahave his uterus surgically removed, and he says Obamacare requires the state\u000ato pay for it.Attorneys for the plaintiff, who is identified only as 30-year-\u000aold schoolteacher \u201cJohn Doe\u201d in court documents, filed a federal complaint\u000aFeb. 18 challenging a Pennsylvania law that prohibits Medicaid funds from\u000abeing used in sex-reassignment surgeries.\u201cUnder Obamacare, it\u2019s got to be\u000aprovided,\u201d said Julie Chovanes, a transgender woman who represents the\u000aplaintiff and is executive director of the Trans Resource Foundation. \u201cIt\u000acan\u2019t be discriminatorily not provided when medically necessary and prescribed\u000aby a doctor.\u201dThe lawsuit is among the first to cite the civil rights provision\u000aof the Affordable Care Act, for which the U.S. Department of Health and Human\u000aService\u2019s Office of Civil Rights issued a proposed rule reinterpretation in\u000aSeptember.Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act prohibits federally\u000asubsidized entities in the health care marketplace from discriminating on the\u000abasis of race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability.But the proposed\u000arule change would also bar discrimination on the basis of gender identity,\u000awhich the HHS says is covered by the provision on sex discrimination, despite\u000athe radical distinction between \u201csex\u201d and \u201cgender\u201d on which transgender\u000aadvocates insist in every other context.\u201cWhat the Obama administration is\u000atrying to do is reinterpret the ban on sex discrimination to include sex\u000astereotyping and gender identity,\u201d said Roger Severino, director of the DeVos\u000aCenter for Religion and Civil Society at The Heritage Foundation. \u201cAnd they\u2019re\u000atrying to do this through these proposed regulations. No one would expect on\u000athe natural reading of the word \u2018sex\u2019 that that would include subjective\u000aconcepts like gender identity, when it\u2019s not specifically mentioned.\u201dThe\u000areinterpretation could strike down laws in states that ban Medicaid funds from\u000abeing used in sex-reassignment procedures.\u201cI think it\u2019s another striking\u000aexample of federal overreach and intrusion, not only into the operations of\u000athe states, but into the operations of individual hospitals, physicians, and\u000ainsurers, who should have the ability to make their own decisions when it\u000acomes to controversial treatments,\u201d Mr. Severino said.Underlying the debate on\u000awho should pay for the surgeries is whether such procedures even work to treat\u000atransgender people.Dr. Paul McHugh, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns\u000aHopkins University School of Medicine, said gender dysphoria is a psychosocial\u000aailment \u2014 similar to anorexia and other body-dysmorphic maladies \u2014 and\u000atherefore should be treated through psychotherapy and counseling.He said there\u000ais scant evidence to suggest that sex change surgeries work and argues that\u000aproponents of the procedures are taking a \u201cgreat shot in the dark for an\u000aideological reason.\u201d\u201cNobody would give this kind of treatment, with this kind\u000aof evidence, for anything other than ideological reasons,\u201d said Dr. McHugh,\u000awho ended such procedures at Johns Hopkins in his capacity as chairman of the\u000aDepartment of Psychiatry in 1979.But Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the\u000aHuman Rights Campaign, said Dr. McHugh\u2019s understanding flies in the face of\u000astandard medical practice, citing the American Psychiatric Association and\u000aAmerican Medical Association, which recommend a physical rather than mental\u000aremedy.\u201cMental health services are important for a wide variety of people for\u000aa wide variety of needs,\u201d Ms. Warbelow said. \u201cAnd certainly transgender people\u000ado seek relationships with mental health care providers, but the appropriate\u000atreatment as deemed by the American Medical Association and every major\u000aphysical and mental health-care organization out there is to affirm people in\u000atheir gender identity.\u201d_Story Continues \u2192_\u000a\u000a

VObamacare\u2019s failed health co-ops could be leaving taxpayers with a massive,\u000aunpayable IOU.A new report released Thursday found that the co-ops, once seen\u000aas a key part of the president\u2019s national health care law, have not repaid a\u000asingle dollar of the combined $1.2 billion they received in federal loans, and\u000aSenate Republicans are arguing that the U.S. Treasury will never be made\u000awhole.Under the Affordable Care Act, the administration extended $2.4 billion\u000ain start-up and solvency loans to 23 nonprofit plans that were supposed to\u000aempower consumers and offer an alternative to big corporate players in the new\u000amarketplace.Yet many of the co-ops had a hard time pricing their products or\u000acompeting for market share, and 12 of them have gone belly-up, forcing 740,000\u000apeople in 14 states scrambling to find new health insurance coverage, the GOP-\u000aauthored report said.Senate Republicans said the failed co-ops\u2019 balance sheets\u000areveal more than $1 billion in unpaid medical claims and other liabilities\u000athat far exceed their reported assets, leaving little \u2014 if any \u2014 cash to repay\u000ataxpayers.\u201cWhere\u2019s it gonna come from?\u201d said Sen. Rob Portman, the Ohio\u000aRepublican who chairs the investigatory panel on the Homeland Security and\u000aGovernmental Affairs Committee.Democrats originally promoted the co-ops, or\u000a\u201cConsumer Operated and Oriented Plans,\u201d during the Obamacare debate of 2009 as\u000aa fallback to attempt to win passage of a \u201cpublic option,\u201d or government-run\u000aplan to be offered alongside private plans in the new web-based health\u000aexchanges to be set up in the states.Designed to give consumers more\u000abargaining power in the marketplace, the co-op program instead has turned into\u000aa major headache for President Obama, who is trying to place his signature law\u000aon firm footing before leaving office.One of the co-op plans, CoOportunity\u000aHealth of Nebraska and Iowa, abruptly shut down in early 2015, foreshadowing\u000athe ill fates of co-ops in Louisiana, Nevada, New York, Kentucky, Tennessee,\u000aColorado, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, Arizona and Michigan.Andy Slavitt,\u000aacting administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,\u000atestified that CoOportunity should have been shut down even before the 2015\u000aplan year, though he argued his agency didn\u2019t have enough claims data to size\u000aup and shutter more co-ops until the middle of last year.As it stands, he said\u000athe Justice Department is doing what it can to wrest back some of the\u000agovernment\u2019s money from the failed co-ops.The department has frozen \u201ctens of\u000amillions\u201d of dollars in payments that the plans expected from Obamacare\u000aprograms designed to spread out risk in the marketplace, and it is eyeing\u000afunds that co-ops might recoup from their vendors.In the end, taxpayers will\u000aonly get back an unknowable fraction of the $1.2 billion, Mr. Slavitt\u000asaid.\u201cThere will be funds recovered for the taxpayers,\u201d he told senators,\u000athough he refused to offer a dollar amount. \u201cI can\u2019t guess. It would be\u000airresponsible for me to guess.\u201d**No bets on recovery**_Story Continues \u2192_\u000a\u000a

VLate last year while playing tennis I reached up to serve and I felt a painful\u000apop in my shoulder. The inflammation got worse over the next few months. Now\u000aanytime I try to put my arm above my head, pain shoots up my arm. I often wake\u000aup at night with an agonizing throb in my shoulder.So I finally and\u000areluctantly went to the orthopedic surgeon and he said that I had a rotator\u000acuff tear and I probably would need surgery. Ugh. He scheduled me for an MRI\u000abut the day I was set to go, the hospital called to tell me my insurance\u000acompany declined to pay for the scans. The insurance company, CIGNA, tersely\u000asent me a note: \u201cYou will need to complete six weeks of conservative\u000atreatment, such as physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medication. Once\u000athat has been completed and you have been re-evaluated, we can try to have the\u000aMRI re-authorized.\u201d Gee, thanks. You guys are the best.What\u2019s that about? I\u2019ve\u000abeen doing therapy for many months already with not much improvement. The\u000adoctor explained that the insurance companies want to make sure that\u000aphysicians aren\u2019t padding bills with unnecessary procedures. Incidentally,\u000aI\u2019ve paid for health insurance for 30 years and have almost never used the\u000amedical care system. I calculate the insurers have made well over $100,000 off\u000aof me.But I am lost inside the bureaucratic maze. They don\u2019t want to pay for\u000athe MRI because they don\u2019t want to have to reimburse for rotator cuff surgery.\u000aSo their hope is that I will just go away. Studies show these delay tactics\u000aand bureaucratic runarounds work to reduce insurance payouts.I\u2019m starting to\u000afeel just like Helen Hunt in the movie \u201cAs Good As It Gets,\u201d during the\u000amemorable scene when she finds out her health coverage won\u2019t pay for the\u000aproper treatment for her son\u2019s asthma condition and out of frustration she\u000ayells: \u201cF*&amp;#ing HMO bastard pieces of @#*@.\u201dEveryone has horror stories of\u000ainsurance companies denying coverage for valid procedures. As an analysis in\u000athe Baltimore Sun recently put it: \u201cAmong insurance professionals, it is\u000acommon knowledge that health insurers are denying claims for coverage with\u000aincreasing frequency.\u201d This is what the health industry calls \u201ccost\u000acontrol.\u201dLook, I get it that the insurance companies are trying to root out\u000athe fraud and abuse of excessive procedures, which drive up costs for\u000aeveryone. But the insurance companies are becoming barriers to care even when\u000ait is for legitimate and necessary procedures.What\u2019s the root of the problem\u000ahere?First, the excess of health insurance actually drives up cost. The more\u000ainsurance for a procedure, the more expensive it is. Health inflation and\u000apremiums has been rising for at least the last decade by nearly double the\u000aCPI. This is also why there are so many frivolous procedures performed.\u000aPatients have been removed from the decision-making process.Second, Obamacare\u000ahas increased demand for health care and is driving up costs, so insurers\u000aappear to be cutting their expenses by denying claims more often. By the way,\u000athe insurance lobby should take note that this sleazy practice only plays into\u000athe hands of the likes of Bernie Sanders who wants a single payer government\u000asystem to take over the health insurance system.That will make medical care\u000aworse \u2014 and more expensive. Studies on Medicaid patients find little or no\u000aimprovement in health outcomes compared to the uninsured population \u2014 because\u000athe level of care is so lousy. Government health care will be Medicaid-type\u000acoverage for all. It will be \u201cfair\u201d because we will all get equally subpar\u000amedical care \u2014 and I would never get my shoulder surgery under that system.The\u000ahealth insurance scandal in America today argues not for a vast expansion of\u000agovernment-run health care, but the medical savings account approach, where\u000apeople put money tax-free into an IRA account and draw it down to pay for\u000atheir first few thousand dollars of coverage. That way it isn\u2019t an insurance\u000acompany who makes the call as to whether I should get an MRI. I make the call\u000awith my own money. Is the pain so bad in my shoulder that I want to shell out\u000a$1,200 to have a scan? Right now, CIGNA says I don\u2019t get to make that choice.\u000aSo it\u2019s \u201cfree\u201d but I don\u2019t get it. Wonderful.The only people who really know\u000awhether my shoulder is in such bad shape that I need surgery is not the\u000afaceless bean-counting claims adjusters living in Toledo, Ohio, but me and my\u000adoctor._\u2022 __Stephen Moore is an economic consultant with Freedom Works and a\u000aFox News contributor._\u000a\u000a

V(CNN)There's a saying that the true character of a person shines in a time of\u000acrisis.There's no doubt of Zaevion William Dobson's character, according to\u000athe 15-year-old's friends and family, who are mourning his death.Thursday\u000aevening, the football player jumped on top of three girls to shield them from\u000aa spray of bullets in Knoxville, Tennessee, according to police and CNN\u000aaffiliate WATE. Police said Friday that the three male suspects believed to be\u000aresponsible for the shooting had gang ties, and had fired upon on a group of\u000aschool kids celebrating the holidays. Zaevion was not only a football player,\u000abut a mentor to his peers, Mayor Madeline Rogero told CNN affiliate WATE. The\u000ateen's coach, Rob Black, said that the sophomore was liked by teachers and\u000astudents at Fulton High School. "This is a fine, fine young man who is a\u000asuccess story," he said. "And I want to try to continue to celebrate the life\u000athat he had here and the impact that he made on his peers," Black said. A\u000acandlelight vigil was held Friday evening. Dozens came out to celebrate the\u000ateenager's life, some placing candles in the shape of the number 24, his\u000ajersey number. Dobson's brother Zach shared the last moments he had with his\u000abrother after the shooting. "I found him on the porch and I picked him up and\u000ahe was laying in my hands dead," he told WATE.Friend Jaylin Posey said\u000aDobson's actions were heroic. "It was good to know he was willing to protect\u000aothers, but then it was sad he had to give up his own life for it," he\u000asaid.The girls were not injured, according to Knoxville police. One of the\u000asuspects died from a gunshot wound late that evening, although not all the\u000adetails are clear. Two others were arrested; the investigation is still\u000aongoing. There were three overnight shootings in Knoxville the evening of\u000aDobson's death. They may have been connected, according to police.Two girls\u000aspoke to CNN affiliate WVLT about the shooting. "If it wasn't for Zaevion, if\u000ahe would have just ran off the porch, we would have probably been shot," Kiara\u000aRucker said.Faith Gordon said by the time the shooting was over she told the\u000ateen he could get up, but he didn't. "So I just went upstairs, and by the time\u000aI came back to make sure everything was real, (I saw) he was shot in the\u000ahead," Gordon said.On Sunday, President Barack Obama focused on Dobson's\u000adeath, tweeting from his @POTUS account: "Zaevion Dobson died saving three\u000afriends from getting shot. He was a hero at 15. What's our excuse for not\u000aacting?" Dobson's brother said it was the teenager's dream to be a football\u000aplayer or a coach. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family lay the\u000ateenager to rest.\u000a\u000a

VWashington (CNN)Presidential contenders split on party lines in their reaction\u000ato President Barack Obama's gun control actions Tuesday, with Democrats\u000asupporting Obama and Republicans vowing to undo his moves. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u000awas perhaps Obama's harshest critic, accusing the President of attempting to\u000atake away Americans' guns. On Twitter, Cruz called Obama's actions -- which\u000ainclude expanding background checks on gun purchases and increasing funding\u000afor mental health and law enforcement agencies that perform those background\u000achecks -- "unconstitutional."In an image included in the tweet, Obama was\u000aportrayed wearing a crown, alongside the message: "Gun control is government\u000acontrol."It linked to a Cruz campaign website featuring Obama dressed in\u000amilitary-style garb, next to the headline, "Obama wants your guns."Donald\u000aTrump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, told CNN's Jake Tapper on "The\u000aLead" that Obama is "making an end-run around the Constitution, trying to go\u000adirectly to executive order and restrict one of the basic, fundamental\u000aprinciples of our country." And Trump himself responded during a rally Tuesday\u000aevening, "Look the Second Amendment is so important. It's so\u000aimportant.""They're not going to take your guns away, folks. They're trying,"\u000ahe said.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted a link to an appearance on Fox News\u000ain which he characterized Obama's moves as "just one more way to make it\u000aharder for law-abiding people to buy weapons or to be able to protect their\u000afamilies. It's going to do nothing to prevent violence or crimes." Former\u000aFlorida Gov. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, tweeted a link to his op-ed in an Iowa\u000anewspaper in which he said Obama's actions trample on the Second Amendment.\u000aRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson tweeted: "The President's actions have\u000aeverything to do with advancing his political agenda &amp; little to do with\u000aactually protecting American citizens." And former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee\u000aused Obama's speech to push for restrictions on abortion -- saying that\u000aObama's case for saving lives should apply to that issue as well. Democratic\u000apresidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, vowed in New Hampshire\u000aon Tuesday that she will "take on that fight" and continue Obama's gun control\u000apush if she's elected.On Twitter, in a tweet signed "-H" to indicate it was\u000awritten by Clinton, rather than her staff, the former secretary of state\u000athanked Obama "for taking a crucial step forward on gun violence. Our next\u000aPresident has to build on that progress\u2014not rip it away." And her campaign\u000ahighlighted Republican candidates' criticism of Obama's comments on its\u000awebsite, warning that a GOP president would undo Obama's actions.Vermont Sen.\u000aBernie Sanders said in a statement that he, too, would keep Obama's actions in\u000aplace if he's elected. "It's become clear that no mass shooting, no matter how\u000abig or bloody, will inspire Republicans to put children and innocent Americans\u000aover the interests of the NRA. They are simply more loyal to gun lobbyists\u000athan our children. That's why I support President Obama's executive actions to\u000amake our communities safer," Sanders said. And former Maryland Gov. Martin\u000aO'Malley vowed to build on Obama's actions. "As President, I will build on\u000aPresident Obama's progress by taking further executive actions to reform our\u000agun laws. These include using the purchasing power of our federal government\u000a-- the biggest customer gun companies have -- to advance gun safety, banning\u000a'cop killer' ammunition, declaring blanket immunity for gun dealers and\u000amanufacturers unconstitutional, and ceasing to defend the federal immunity\u000alaw," he said in a statement.\u000a\u000a

V(CNN)Think the news about climate change couldn't get any worse? Turns out it\u000acould make transatlantic flights even longer -- and travelers can expect\u000adouble the turbulence.Meteorology expert Paul Williams, from the UK's\u000aUniversity of Reading, noticed that when carbon dioxide concentration is\u000adoubled it causes jet stream winds to strengthen.That has a direct impact on\u000aplanes flying 35,000 feet in the air.Williams studied the route between New\u000aYork City's JFK Airport and London's Heathrow Airport.He found that the\u000astrengthened winds could mean eastbound flights shortened to five and a half\u000ahours, but will be lengthened to beyond seven hours in the other direction.\u000a"We found that transatlantic aircrafts will be in the air for another 2,000\u000ahours each year," Williams told CNN. "And this is going to add about $22\u000amillion to airline fuel costs."So while we've all been hoping that\u000aBombardier's Antipode will fly us from New York to London in 11 minutes, or\u000athe Skreemr will do the journey in half an hour, it seems that -- for\u000awestbound fliers at least -- we'll be waiting a while longer.\u000a\u000a

VLas Vegas (CNN)In response to a series of mass shootings last year, Bernie\u000aSanders said that his campaign was assembling a "comprehensive package" of\u000aplans to address gun violence in the United States.Months later, the insurgent\u000acandidate has failed to live up to that pledge.Sanders' campaign has yet to\u000aissue a detailed policy paper on gun control, something the candidate has done\u000afor a slew of other economic and core-Democratic issues. And his campaign does\u000anot list fighting gun violence on his more than 20-position-long issue page on\u000ahis website.Sanders' aides did not respond to multiple requests about why his\u000acampaign has not announced a "comprehensive" gun plan as promised.Gun control\u000ahas been a nagging issue for Sanders since he launched his campaign last year.\u000aWhile Sanders has appealed to the left of the party on campaign finance,\u000aeducation and health care, guns are one issue that Hillary Clinton has\u000asuccessfully used to hurt Sanders' liberal bona fides. That matters in a state\u000alike South Carolina, where the Vermont senator still needs to grow his base of\u000asupport.Clinton's campaign has hammered Sanders on gun control, telling voters\u000athat while the Vermont senator talks about standing up to powerful interests,\u000ahe has failed to do that with the National Rifle Association and the gun\u000alobby.Most notably, Sanders voted against barring the Centers for Disease\u000aControl and Prevention from studying gun violence in 1996 and voted against\u000aversions of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act five times from 1991 to\u000a1993. Sanders has called the Clinton attacks on guns "very disingenuous.""I\u000ahave a D-minus voting record from the NRA," Sanders said during a January\u000adebate in South Carolina. "I support what President Obama is doing in terms of\u000atrying to close the gun show loopholes." Clinton has focused on the issue for\u000amuch of her campaign, pledging to close a series of gun control loopholes and\u000arevoke licenses from bad actor gun sellers.Sanders' most comprehensive\u000astatement on guns came shortly before the January debate, when the senator\u000areversed his position on a 2005 Senate vote that gave gun manufacturers\u000aimmunity from prosecution. As a member of the House of Representatives at the\u000atime, Sanders voted in favor of that bill."I'm pleased that this legislation\u000ais being introduced," Sanders said of Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. Adam\u000aSchiff's proposal to take away immunity from gun manufacturers when their\u000aproducts are used in crimes. "As I have said for many months now, we need to\u000alook at the underlying law and tighten it up." Sanders has declined to call\u000athe 2005 vote a mistake a number of times, citing the fact that he worries\u000aabout the impact rescinding immunity would have on small, family-owned gun\u000ashops.In supporting the legislation, Sanders also said he would propose an\u000aamendment to the bill that "would require the Commerce Department to monitor\u000aand report on the law's impact in rural areas on the availability of hunting\u000asupplies, including firearms, sold by non-negligent local gun stores."In the\u000aface of public pressure after mass shootings, Sanders said last year that "the\u000astatus quo clearly is not working and people on both sides of this issue\u000acannot simply continue shouting at each other."But the Vermont senator has\u000atempered his usual fire and bluntness when it comes to guns, stressing a more\u000acautious approach to addressing mass shootings."If somebody has a gun and it\u000afalls into the hands of a murderer and that murderer kills somebody with the\u000agun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible?" he asked at the Democratic\u000adebate in Las Vegas in October. "Not any more than you would hold a hammer\u000acompany responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer.\u000aThat is not what a lawsuit should be about."\u000a\u000a

VTaya Kyle is the author of "American Wife: A Memoir of Love, War, Faith, and\u000aRenewal." Her late husband, Chris Kyle, was the subject of the movie,\u000a"American Sniper." Taya Kyle was an invited guest for the CNN Town Hall "Guns\u000ain America." Follow her on Twitter: @TayaKyle. The opinions expressed in this\u000acommentary are hers. (CNN)Many of us taking part in the CNN town hall on guns\u000ahave been touched by someone who chose to do evil. I am sharing my thoughts\u000awith you because I feel I can relate to people on both sides of the issue of\u000agun control. I have been afraid of guns, I have sworn I would never use a gun\u000aon another person and so did not need one, and I have wanted to deny the\u000aexistence of evil. I have also become a gun owner, am prepared to defend\u000amyself with a firearm, and understand the fear of my freedoms being taken\u000aaway. I have been touched by extreme violence and I have been robbed of the\u000alife I always wanted by someone who chose to do evil. Because I have felt, and\u000alived, all of these things, I have spent much time thinking about evil,\u000afreedom and not only the world we live in, but the country too. There are many\u000afacts and statistics people will use to argue both sides of the gun control\u000aissue. We can use other countries as examples and we can use crime rates of\u000acities, states and countries. And no matter how thoroughly researched the\u000astatistics are, people have an emotional reaction to this issue that almost\u000aalways overrides the statistics presented, other than this one: The violent\u000acrime rate in the United States has gone down substantially in the last 20\u000ayears. Our fears, though, have gone up, because of the high-profile incidents\u000aof mass killings of people caught unaware. Killers have taken lives in\u000achurches, schools, hospitals, government buildings, the site of a marathon,\u000athe Twin Towers and even a part of a military base where soldiers were known\u000ato be unarmed. These killings highlight the fact that any of us, and any of\u000aour loved ones, are vulnerable when caught with our guard down against another\u000aperson who desires to do harm.Does it matter what weapon they used? If it was\u000aa rifle, a pipe bomb, a truck of fertilizer, a pressure cooker or a plane --\u000athe end result is the same. Yet millions of other people have the freedom to\u000ahave those very same things and will never use them to kill. These horrific\u000amass killings were committed by a _very_ small number of people who wish to\u000aharm and kill others. When they do it, we flock to the scene and ask "Why?"\u000aWho are these people who choose to do harm? What is their story? What went\u000awrong? What are they trying to tell us? Ultimately, in our horror, we give\u000athem a voice they would never have had otherwise. Is our insatiable need to\u000aknow and find out how their lives might have gone wrong part of the result\u000athey are looking for? Is that part of the reason there is an incentive to do\u000asuch harm to innocent people? We know it isn't the availability of the weapon,\u000abecause they used different methods, different weapons. We can't legislate\u000ahuman nature. If we add up the number of these mass killers over the last\u000adecade, how many people are we talking about? Fewer than 40 over the last\u000adecade? Do we want to make laws for millions based on the choices of fewer\u000athan 40 evildoers? Can we fix these people? Can we legislate out of them the\u000adesire to kill? Those in the business of fighting crime and analyzing mental\u000aillness can look into the lives of each of these killers and tell you the red\u000aflags that popped up before the massacre. Why don't we deal with that instead\u000aof banning the tools very few use? By the very nature of these crimes, we know\u000athat evildoers don't care about the laws. After all, murder is against the\u000alaw, and they are choosing to ignore the law from the moment they plan to harm\u000apeople. Beyond that, who among us has the right to tell me I will murder\u000asomeone because I have a gun? And who can tell me that I can only defend and\u000aprotect myself in a way they feel comfortable with? Just having access to a\u000adeadly weapon doesn't turn someone into a killer. Have you ever felt road\u000arage? Many of us who have cars have felt some form of extreme anger at other\u000adrivers because we feel they have put us in harm's way. We might even envision\u000aramming their cars or cutting them off in return, but do we actually do it?\u000aNo, because the overwhelming majority of us never want to take another human\u000alife. Even special ops guys, military and police who are trained to kill for\u000alegitimate purposes, who are familiar with multiple weapons and have access to\u000athe weapons and ammunition -- even these people, who are experienced, will\u000atell you they never know if they can pull the trigger until placed in a\u000aposition to use deadly force to protect another person. My government has\u000aproven that it's not able to protect me against people who want to kill. And I\u000adon't blame the government, because there is only one person to blame here:\u000aThe man or woman who decided to kill. If you put an assault rifle in my hands\u000aor yours, I am not going to murder anyone, and I am guessing you won't either.\u000aBut what makes gun control advocates think that someone who decides to kill\u000awill not use any means necessary to do so?The person who killed my husband,\u000aChris, worked in an armory with daily access to every caliber of high powered\u000aweapon for years. He chose to kill when he got out of an environment of\u000aaccountability and drug testing. Simply having a weapon did not make him a\u000amurderer. His life choices did. What red flags did he display? Well, the\u000aprominence he got after he took the lives of Chris and Chad Littlefield\u000aresulted in many people hearing his claim of post-traumatic stress disorder.\u000aAnd yet, psychiatrists on both the prosecution and defense testified he did\u000anot have PTSD. He was however a known drug user. Based on testimony at his\u000atrial, people around him not only tolerated but sometimes participated in the\u000adrug use and enabled him by seeing him as the "victim." He repeatedly got out\u000aof trouble by claiming PTSD. The officers would take him at his word, deliver\u000ahim to a mental health facility where the facility would write a diagnosis\u000awhich is known in that community as a label for likely drug use, and they\u000awould release him. Because of the HIPAA law and our desire to protect\u000aeveryone's privacy, we allow bad behavior to slip through the cracks. Imagine\u000ahow different things would be if a mental health facility could tell police,\u000a"This is a drug user," and the police could go track him for drugs and put him\u000ain jail for breaking those laws instead of waiting for worse crimes in the\u000afuture. In the state of Texas, there is a fairly new certification process for\u000aour police where officers are trained to notice and recognize mental health\u000aissues and have knowledge of the drugs people take and the effects of them. So\u000ahow they intervene is different based on whether they believe there is a\u000amental health issue vs. a drug issue. Wouldn't it be a better use of our time\u000ato work through this issue? It gives police a different crisis intervention\u000amethod. Some advocates want to restrict certain kinds of guns -- perhaps\u000aallowing a pistol but not an assault rifle. To those who don't know guns well,\u000athe term "assault rifle" brings to mind either a sniper's gun or a fully\u000aautomatic weapon we have seen in the movies, meant to mow down large numbers\u000aof people. In actuality, fully automatic weapons are already highly restricted\u000aand require an additional license most gun owners will never have. The lack of\u000aunderstanding makes it easy to develop rhetoric and legislation that will calm\u000athe fears of people who don't understand a given subject, but that doesn't\u000areally change any end result because we cannot legislate the evil side of\u000ahumanity.Cars are tools that is involved in about as many deaths as guns. If\u000ayou are a driver prone to drinking and driving, should we only allow you to\u000adrive an ultracompact car? Not an SUV which could kill more people? No, we\u000atake away the drunk driver's access to legally drive any car. This is about\u000afreedom to do as you like until you prove incapable of showing good moral\u000ajudgment. In this country, we give freedom and take it away once you prove to\u000abe unworthy of the freedom we have given you. Nobody suggests taking away cars\u000aor going through a battery of tests to determine whether or not you might be a\u000adrunk driver one day.Does every man commit rape? There is a human element here\u000athat is real and we cannot legislate. Would we take away the freedom of all\u000amen by castration because some cannot handle what they have? No, we allow\u000afreedom until an individual chooses to take something that others use for good\u000aand use it to do harm to another. Are our current laws being enforced? Are\u000afelons and known drug users really put in jail when arrested for a lesser\u000acrime and known to have a gun? In most situations, no, because police have\u000amore pressing issues than to incarcerate a felon for having a gun that he or\u000ashe hasn't used in a crime. We have plenty of laws on the books that we cannot\u000aor do not enforce. Let's start enforcing what we have before creating new\u000alaws.Understandably, we want a solution to ensure that we and our loved ones\u000awill never be in the situation of being caught unaware by someone who chose to\u000ado evil. Mass killers have targeted churches, businesses, movie theaters,\u000aschools and hospitals, but they could as easily take their violence to a place\u000awhere people are armed. Yet they do not. Even at Fort Hood, the killer chose a\u000aplace on the base where he knew soldiers would be unarmed. What does that tell\u000aus? That evil targets those who are unprepared for the evil to strike. When\u000aChris and I were looking into our personal security after the book "American\u000aSniper" came out, we took measures and thought of different scenarios, and\u000aChris told me that still, based on his experience, "Babe, if someone wants to\u000akill me, they will." Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan were\u000aarguably some of the best-protected men in our country. Did it stop someone\u000afrom shooting them? As Reagan once said, "You won't get gun control by\u000adisarming law-abiding citizens. There is only one way to get real gun control:\u000aDisarm the thugs and criminals, lock them up and if you don't actually throw\u000aaway the key, lose it for a long time."And what we need to do is find the\u000acourage to accept that from the dawn of time until the day man no longer walks\u000athe earth, evil will find a way. Murder is nothing new, it is not going away\u000aand it is not dependent on one method of killing or another. We can forge\u000aahead knowing that while evil is among us, it involves the few. The good,\u000aresponsible people are the vast majority. We can trust each other with basic\u000afreedoms until one of us proves to be untrustworthy by maliciously,\u000aintentionally harming another of us. If you have never owned a weapon, or have\u000anever known the masses of peaceful gun owners who love their families and are\u000ain nurturing professions such as counseling, nursing, social work and pastoral\u000ajobs, may I suggest you talk to them about why they cherish their freedom to\u000ahave these weapons? We have slipped into a land of government that has\u000apromised the moon, seldom delivered and driven us into a world of more laws,\u000amore government, and less freedom -- and none of that has stopped murder, pain\u000aand suffering. No government can provide the utopia many seek. My hope for\u000athis country is that we remain a people who value freedom, who have the\u000acourage to face the realities with faithful hearts instead of anxious ones. I\u000ahope our people hold tight to the notion that we do not have to be a fear-\u000aridden country focused on restrictions, but rather that we remain the land of\u000athe free and home of the brave.God bless you and thank you for giving me some\u000aof your time._Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.__  \u000aRead CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine._\u000a\u000a

VAmes, Iowa (CNN)Hillary Clinton is turning her stump speech into a near\u000aconstant attack on Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as she suddenly faces the\u000athreat of losing the first two early-voting states next month.Two polls\u000areleased Tuesday find Sanders with leads in both Iowa and New Hampshire, a\u000asurge that has Clinton aides worried.Clinton compared her stance with Sanders\u000aon guns, health care and Wall Street. Since the first Democratic debate in\u000aOctober, Clinton has used different issues to knock Sanders. But on Tuesday,\u000aher speech was different, with more sustained and focused knocks on the\u000aunlikely front-runner in Iowa and New Hampshire.Clinton hit Sanders for\u000abragging about standing up to special interests, but siding with the National\u000aRifle Association on certain legislation. If Sanders is to tout his\u000awillingness to stand up to special interests, Clinton said at her events that\u000aSanders should "stand up to the most powerful special interest, stand up to\u000athat gun lobby."Clinton then turned to Wall Street, an issue Sanders has tried\u000ato use against Clinton by casting her as too close with the nation's biggest\u000abanks. "Don't talk to me about standing up to corporate interests and big\u000apowers," Clinton said to Sanders. "I've got the scars to show for it and I am\u000aproud of every single one of them." Clinton is in a strong position in many of\u000athe states that hold primaries later in the nominating contest. But a loss in\u000athe Iowa caucuses on February 1 will revive memories of Clinton's third-place\u000afinish there in 2008, which ultimately doomed her first presidential bid. New\u000aHampshire, which rewarded Clinton in 2008 and her husband, Bill, in 1992, is\u000aeven tougher for her this year since she's up against a popular senator from\u000aneighboring Vermont.Adding to Clinton's troubles is an interview Vice\u000aPresident Joe Biden gave CNN on Monday in which he praised Sanders and\u000asuggested the former secretary of state was new to addressing income\u000ainequality."It's relatively new for Hillary to talk about that," Biden told\u000aCNN's Gloria Borger, saying that Clinton has "come forward with some really\u000athoughtful approaches to deal with the issue" of income inequality.In response\u000ato the tightening race, Clinton is dispatching two of her best-known\u000asurrogates -- husband Bill and daughter Chelsea Clinton -- onto the campaign\u000atrail. Bill Clinton has already visited New Hampshire and Iowa and will return\u000ato the Granite State on Wednesday; Chelsea Clinton was there Tuesday. The\u000aformer first daughter even went after Sanders in the Granite State, charging\u000athat his healthcare plan would give too much power to Republican governors."I\u000adon't want to live in a country with unequal health insurance," Chelsea\u000aClinton said. "I don't want to empower Republican governors. And I think that\u000ais what Senator Sanders wants to do."At her event here on Tuesday, Hillary\u000aClinton zeroed in on Sanders' proposal to pass a single-payer health care plan\u000awithout raising taxes on the middle class."There is no way that can be paid\u000afor without raising taxes on the middle class, the arithmetic just doesn't add\u000aup," she said.All of this culminated in Clinton using Sanders' oft used line\u000a-- that he is taking launching a political revolution - against him."If that\u000ais the kind of revolution he is talking about, I am worried folks," she said\u000ato applause.The reason behind the focus on Sanders is two-fold: The Iowa\u000acaucuses are less than a month a way and many voters in the audience said they\u000awere attending the event to make up their mind, a fact Clinton acknowledged\u000afrom the stage.But they are also because Clinton and he aides see the race\u000atightening.A new Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday shows that\u000aSanders is now the front-runner in Iowa -- with 49% support to Clinton's 44%\u000aand former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley's 4%. Clinton aides have long said\u000athey expected the race to tighten but there is concern inside Clinton's\u000acampaign that Sanders is catching fire in the important weeks leading up to\u000athe caucuses.The near total focus on Sanders is new for Clinton, a candidate\u000awho spent the early months of the campaign avoiding even mentioning Sanders'\u000aname.Tuesday's event, where Clinton also accepted the endorsement of the Brady\u000aCampaign to Prevent Gun Violence, amplified a trend of Clinton attacks that\u000aSanders said at the Iowa Brown and Black Forum on Monday night that he's\u000anoticed. "It could be that the inevitable candidate for the Democratic\u000anomination may not be so inevitable today," he said. That Sanders now has a\u000ashot at winning the first two states in the Democratic nominating process is\u000ain part a reflection of their makeup: Iowa and New Hampshire are whiter and\u000amore liberal than the broader party electorate. The bigger test would come as\u000athe campaign shifts to Nevada and South Carolina -- where Democrats will have\u000atheir last debate Sunday night in Charleston before the voting begins in Iowa\u000aon February 1. She is also campaigning with high-profile surrogates --\u000aincluding the heads of Planned Parenthood and the Brady Campaign, highlighting\u000aher support on women's health issues and gun control, as well as\u000aTransportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, who underscores Clinton's ties to\u000aPresident Barack Obama's administration. Sanders aides attribute some of their\u000alead in Iowa to the fact that although the Vermont senator went on air with\u000ahis first ad last in 2015, he is currently airing more ads in the state than\u000aClinton, according to CMAG/Kantar Media. Clinton aides believe that count is\u000aslightly misleading, largely because it does not include cable ads, which\u000aClinton has invested heavily on. What's more, Clinton aides are confident that\u000atheir concentrated ads in Cedar Rapids and the Quad Cities area of Iowa will\u000apay off more than Sanders' ads in areas Sioux City and Omaha, more\u000aconservative areas of the state.\u000a\u000a

VJohn D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change\u000aand social justice. Follow him on Snapchat, Facebook and email. The opinions\u000aexpressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)On Thursday night, the remaining\u000aRepublican presidential candidates -- led, of course, by Donald Trump -- will\u000agather in the Miami area for yet another debate.South Florida, whether or not\u000ait's stated, is a crucial front line for climate change. And my hope is that\u000athe candidates, particularly Trump, won't be able to keep dismissing questions\u000aabout this issue. For Trump, it's not only rhetoric and votes that are at\u000astake. It's property. I plugged the addresses of a few luxury hotels bearing\u000athe Trump name into a handy tool developed to visualize the rise in sea levels\u000athat's associated with global warming. The Trump International Beach Resort,\u000ain Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, will sit on a slender island of land at 6 feet\u000aof sea-level rise, which the federal government says is possible this century.\u000aIt looks like Trump Hollywood, meanwhile, will be submerged at that point. (Go\u000ato EyesOnTheRise.org/app, and you can search other locations.)BuzzFeed's Peter\u000aAldhous had a similar idea and used NOAA data to make gifs out of the coming\u000aflood for the Trump-name real estate empire in South Florida. Tellingly, he\u000aquoted a conservative radio host who asked Trump if he believes that "sea\u000alevels are increasing dramatically." Trump's reply: "No, no I don't."Super\u000aobservant of him. I hope he gets pushed on this issue. Even if he doesn't,\u000athough, the location of this debate serves to highlight a troubling irony:\u000aTrump, Ted Cruz (from Houston, another city threatened by rising seas) and\u000aMarco Rubio, who is from South Florida, all have much that is personally at\u000astake when it comes to climate change. They fail to recognize this, however.\u000aAnd they fail to notice that low-income people will be hurt even worse.\u000a"Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and ... a lot of\u000ait's a hoax. It's a hoax," Trump said at a South Carolina rally, according to\u000aPolitiFact. "I mean, it's a money-making industry, OK? It's a hoax, a lot of\u000ait."It's not a hoax. More than 97% of scientists agree it's real and we're\u000acausing it by burning fossil fuels and chopping down rainforests. Failing to\u000aact will lead to coastal flooding, displaced people, poverty, death and mass\u000aextinction in the plant and animal worlds. It's our moral duty to create a\u000acleaner economy. Yet the GOP presidential contenders continue to either deny\u000athe existence of human-made climate change or fail to propose the needed\u000asolutions. To beat this thing, we need to get off of fossil fuels sometime\u000aaround 2050. None of the presidential candidates, including the Democrats, has\u000aa plan that's bold enough to do what the science tells us must be done if\u000awe're not going to imperil future generations. But the Democrats, Hillary\u000aClinton and Bernie Sanders, boldly acknowledge the reality of climate change,\u000athey admit we're causing it, and they have plans to start cutting back on\u000apollution. This is a crucial difference between the parties that must be\u000arecognized. I hope this becomes apparent in Florida on Thursday. Already, the\u000acity of Miami Beach, not far from the site of the debate at the University of\u000aMiami, is spending $400 million to try to pump out floodwater. They're seeing\u000afloods on sunny days associated with higher tides. I recently met a resident\u000athere who is packing up and planning to move to higher ground because of it.\u000aThis problem is real. It's massively important. And, luckily, there is still a\u000alittle time to address it.Thursday is another chance for Trump and the GOP to\u000aprove it can change, that it can adopt a rational and informed stance on\u000aclimate policy and science. South Florida would be the perfect place to do it.\u000aIf not for the rest of us, then at least for the Trump hotels._Join us on\u000aFacebook.com/CNNOpinion.__Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine._\u000a\u000a

VWashington (CNN)The Supreme Court on Tuesday dealt President Barack Obama a\u000ablow by moving to temporarily block his administration's rules to limit\u000agreenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Reacting to a lawsuit from 29\u000astates, as well as the energy industry, justices blocked the Environmental\u000aProtection Agency's Clean Power Plan from going forward while the rule is\u000achallenged in court. The decision means that Obama now has two major legacy\u000aactions -- immigration and climate change -- stuck in the court system with\u000athe specter of a Republican taking over the White House in January. Obama has\u000apushed action on global warming as a key part of his legacy, an effort that\u000areached its peak with the deal at the U.N.-led talks on climate change in\u000aParis in December. Proponents of the plan did not expect the high court to\u000astep in at this juncture , particularly since the United States Court of\u000aAppeals for the D.C. Circuit will hold oral arguments in June and neither the\u000aindustry nor the states would have had to come into compliance for at least\u000atwo years.. That a divided Supreme Court stepped in at this juncture to block\u000athe program after a lower court declined to do so sends a signal that at least\u000afive justices are concerned with some aspect of the plan. "This is an\u000aexceedingly uncommon situation for the court to step in, and it jeopardizes\u000athe plan all together from going into affect while President Obama remains in\u000aoffice," said Bruce Huber, professor of law at Notre Dame Law school. "The\u000aSupreme Court's order signals serious misgivings among some of the justices\u000aabout the legality of the plan."The four liberal justices on the court -- Ruth\u000aBader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elana Kagan -- dissented\u000afrom the order.In a statement, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said\u000a"we disagree" with the court's action."The Clean Power Plan is based on a\u000astrong legal and technical foundation, gives states the time and flexibility\u000athey need to develop tailored, cost-effective plans to reduce their emissions,\u000aand will deliver better air quality, improved public health, clean energy\u000ainvestment and jobs across the country, and major progress in our efforts to\u000aconfront the risks posed by climate change," Earnest said. "We remain\u000aconfident that we will prevail on the merits."The EPA rule would require\u000astates to meet specific carbon emission reduction standards based on their\u000aindividual energy consumption. It also includes an incentive program for\u000astates to get a head start on meeting standards on early deployment of\u000arenewable energy."Power plants are the single biggest source of harmful carbon\u000apollution that contributes to climate change," Obama said in a video released\u000alast August. "Until now, there have been no federal limits to the amount of\u000acarbon pollution plants dump in the air."Senior administration officials said\u000aTuesday they were "surprised" by the high court's action. One official called\u000athe court's move "extraordinary and unprecedented," saying it's rare for the\u000aSupreme Court to grant a stay on a rule whose legality hasn't been reviewed by\u000aa lower court.But officials nonetheless expressed confidence in the\u000apresident's climate plan moving forward, even as it becomes exceedingly\u000aunlikely the litigation process is resolved by the time Obama leaves office.\u000aThey said individual states could still move forward with implementing plans\u000ato reduce carbon output, and added the court's decision was unlikely to affect\u000athe U.S. commitment to the international climate accord agreed to in Paris in\u000aDecember."We've always known that this rule was going to be litigated and that\u000athere were going to be opponents that were going to challenge the rule under\u000aany circumstances. And so I think the bottom line is that this decision is not\u000aone that we agree with, but it's a procedural decision and we'll have the\u000aopportunity to make the case on the merits," one official said.As for the\u000aadministration's strategy using executive actions to advance their agenda, the\u000aofficials were forceful in defending the White House's methods."The President\u000ahas undertaken to do bold things, but only within the parameters of his\u000aauthority. And while that's certainly triggered a good deal of litigation,\u000athat litigation is going to play out, whether it's immigration, or health\u000acare, or anything else," one official said. "Because he's confident in the\u000aadvice he gets from the Department of Justice about the legality of his\u000aactions, he's going to keep doing what he thinks is appropriate to help the\u000aAmerican people," the official continued. "And I don't think there's a single\u000alawsuit, on any issue, that would deter him from doing anything he can to help\u000athe American people in whatever time is left in this\u000aadministration."Congressional Republicans have fought the rules, voting to\u000ablock the EPA limits on the same day Obama spoke at the Paris talks. And the\u000aadministration's actions on climate change have been regularly criticized on\u000athe campaign trail by Republican candidates. House Speaker Paul Ryan called\u000athe rule "unlawful" in a statement Tuesday."This rule should be struck down\u000apermanently before coal country is destroyed completely, and American\u000aconsumers are consigned to higher energy prices," Ryan said. "Great news for\u000aWyoming &amp; American energy. Republicans will do what we can to keep this\u000arule permanently blocked," Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, tweeted.Karen\u000aHarned, executive director of the National Federation of Independent Business\u000aSmall Business Legal Center, celebrated the Supreme Court's action. "What the\u000acourt said today is that states cannot be forced to comply with a regulation\u000athat it may ultimately decide is unconstitutional. This is a temporary but\u000aimportant victory for small businesses, which were facing substantially higher\u000aenergy costs."David Doniger, director of the climate and clean air program at\u000athe Natural Resources Defense Council, said he is "confident the courts will\u000aultimately uphold the Clean Power Plan on its merits. The electricity sector\u000ahas embarked on an unstoppable shift from its high-pollution, dirty-fueled\u000apast to a safer, cleaner-powered future, and the stay cannot reverse that\u000atrend. Nor can it dampen the overwhelming public support for action on climate\u000achange and clean energy.""If there was ever a Supreme Court decision that\u000alooked backwards instead of towards the future, this was it," said Jamie Henn\u000aof the environmental group 350.org.\u000a\u000a

VJohn D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change\u000aand social justice. Follow him on Snapchat, Facebook and e-mail.  (CNN)Miami\u000aBeach is in trouble. The seas are rising, and people are starting to respond.\u000aI recently wrote about one resident of the South Florida city who is so\u000aconcerned about climate change and rising seas that he's packing up his home\u000ain the center of the island and planning to move to higher ground. Pull up a\u000amap of projected sea level rise, and it's easy to see why. At even 2 to 4 feet\u000aof sea level rise, the island will be considerably flooded. The National\u000aOceanic and Atmospheric Administration says 6 feet of sea level increase is\u000apossible by century's end. These are long-term trends -- measured in decades\u000aand generations -- but they're certainly frightening. Others in Miami Beach,\u000ahowever, are vowing to stay and fight. The city is regarded by many as a\u000aproactive leader in efforts to hold back the threats of rising tides. How are\u000athey doing it? And what are the limits of engineering fixes to climate change\u000aand rising seas? To learn about that, I called up Susanne Torriente, assistant\u000acity manager and "chief resiliency officer" for Miami Beach, a 90,000-person\u000aisland municipality off the coast of Miami proper. The following is a\u000atranscript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity: **CNN: Do you\u000athink Miami Beach can survive climate change in the long term? **Torriente: I\u000adon't know what the long term is, but I know Miami Beach is adapting to\u000aclimate change. We're starting already. ... We're starting to adapt today. And\u000athe approach is really incremental adaptation. What can we do in our one-year\u000abudget, in our five-year capital plan -- and maybe in some of our 20-year\u000amaster plans -- to start to really start to deliver government services in a\u000adifferent way? We have more data nowadays. We have sea level rise projections.\u000a**CNN: What are you doing today to try to fight sea-level rise? **What they've\u000adone here in Miami Beach is an aggressive stormwater program that includes\u000ainstalling pumps. ... We're installing these pumps that actually take the\u000awater and push it out. We're elevating roads. We're working on our seawalls.\u000aWe have 63 miles of seawalls. Only three (miles) are actually public. But\u000awe're looking at elevating those and restoring those. **CNN: I'm wondering how\u000athat has worked so far. From what I've read, Miami Beach has seen a lot of\u000aflooding in recent years associated with higher tides. **Last fall, the pumps\u000awere working and those streets were dry. Versus two years ago, you see those\u000apictures of some of our roads that were really flooded rather high. This year,\u000awhere the pumps were installed, they worked. **CNN: When I was driving around\u000aon Miami Beach, I came to these intersections where you feel like you're\u000aalmost going up a ramp into a parking garage or something. The road level just\u000agoes up dramatically. But seeing that I wondered: Does the floodwater just\u000acollect below that? If you're just raising the road level, how is that\u000ahelpful? **Well, you're elevating. So the water's not getting up to you,\u000aessentially. That's on the public side. And we're also looking at our land use\u000acode. Local governments have that kind of building and zoning and planning\u000aauthority. We are looking at private development -- what should be those\u000aelevations as well. **CNN: I've read that for other low-lying cities like New\u000aOrleans there's more potential to put up levees and seawalls to hold the ocean\u000aback. But because Miami sits on limestone, which is porous, it's hard to do\u000athat. The water would just go under them.**I'm not an engineer, but I've heard\u000athe engineers talk about, well, are there ways to combat that? Are there ways\u000ato seal the limestone? I just heard my city engineer talking about that\u000aearlier this week. Yes, that is a challenge for us. The water does come up\u000athrough this porous limestone that we do sit on. It's not as easy as just\u000abuilding a wall. That's why we have to work in other ways, like pumping the\u000awater out or elevating the roads. **CNN: What would you want to say to someone\u000ain Miami Beach -- or another coastal community -- who's worried about sea\u000alevel rise? **The important message is: Climate change is here and sea level\u000ais rising. But our eyes are wide open to the issue. We're actively planning\u000aand we're actively doing. We're actively designing and constructing these\u000akinds of incremental adaptation options that continue to reduce our risk. The\u000awork we're doing today is safeguarding us for the future. As time passes and\u000awe have more information and more data we can continue to build upon what\u000awe're doing today. **CNN: I met a Miami Beach resident who told me he is\u000apacking up and planning to move out of Miami Beach because he's worried about\u000athe long term viability of his home, and, more immediately, he's worried about\u000ahis investment given the risks of climate change. I'm wondering what you think\u000aof that decision. Do you think it's alarmist? Is it prudent?**I think it's a\u000apersonal decision. People have their own circumstances in life, and you make\u000athose personal decisions. But I do think it's important for the residents here\u000ato know -- and they do know -- that this city commission and the residents\u000atoday here in the city are willing to invest. They raised their stormwater\u000arates so we could issue the bonds to pay for these investments. And the\u000ainvestments we're making are in fact reducing those risks. If were a coastal\u000acommunity that was getting flooded and we had our eyes closed and were doing\u000anothing, then there should be some worry. But we're a coastal community\u000aheavily involved in designing and constructing -- and working to reduce that\u000arisk. **CNN: I got some comments with people saying this isn't climate change,\u000athis isn't happening. This is just the coast of Florida and of course it\u000afloods sometimes. How certain are you that what you see happening now is\u000aclimate change? **We're a local government. We have to be responsible. These\u000athings are happening. And so that argument really doesn't happen in South\u000aFlorida anymore. It's about actually doing something about. **CNN: Marco Rubio\u000ais from South Florida and is a Republican presidential contender. And I would\u000asay he's injecting a lot of false doubt into the climate conversation. I'm\u000awondering what you think about that -- or about the election as a whole? **As\u000aa local government appointed official, I'm not going to get into too much of\u000athe politics of it. But the science is there. These things are happening. And\u000awhoever gets in office needs to understand that these are issues that are\u000afacing these communities. We need the help and the coordination from the state\u000aand the feds. Right now it's really the local governments that are stepping up\u000ato this. ... It's not a partisan issue down here. **CNN: Is this a pretty\u000aexpensive problem to deal with? **Yeah. **CNN: I was told you all have pledged\u000asomething like $400 million to fight this. **The estimate is somewhere around\u000a$400 million, and the numbers change as you're out in the field and\u000aconstructing these things. And it's essentially a three- to five-year program\u000ato install these pumps in these low-lying areas of the city. South Florida is\u000acoastal and low-lying. I kind of say we're flat and flatter. You look at the\u000aareas that are most vulnerable and start there. **CNN: I think some people\u000acould see that number -- $400 million -- and think, 'Oh my gosh, that's a lot\u000aof money that's being used to fight something that's unwinnable.'**But you\u000aspent time here, right? This is a vibrant, beautiful coastal community. People\u000astill want to come live, work and play here. So, I'm not ready to give up.\u000a(Laughs). There are a lot of people who are not ready to give up. These\u000ainvestments continue to reduce our risk and make us less vulnerable and buy\u000atime. Yeah, I think the key message is we're not willing to give up. That\u000awould be disappointing for a lot of folks. Our eyes are wide open, and we're\u000aactively involved in making this community beautiful and vibrant and\u000aresilient. You know, 100 years from now, 200 years from now, it'll be\u000adifferent. I joke with my staff that we're creating 'Tomorrowland.' It will\u000alook different. Maybe other generations will have to adapt more and learn to\u000alive with the water even more. The design of the city will be different. But\u000awe're not giving up.**CNN: What do you think that 'Tomorrowland' might look\u000alike? **Maybe some roads are allowed to flood or some areas are allowed to\u000aflood, and we create investments that are built to hold water sometimes and be\u000adry in others. There's a whole kind of opportunity to create a different city.\u000aWe've had conversation with folks from The Netherlands. That's really their\u000aphrase: "Learning to live with the water." Our behavior may be different, the\u000away we conduct our lives, but we've been doing that for years. Generations\u000aadapt. _Add John D.

V(CNN)For Palestinian artist Alaa Minawi, six neon tubes are all it takes to\u000adeliver a powerful reminder of Europe's refugee crisis."When people are forced\u000ato leave their country they don't only lose their schools, toys and cars," he\u000asays. "They drop their skin, organs and memories. They transform into outlines\u000aof human beings."Minawi, who lives in Lebanon, spent three years working as a\u000atranslator for Syrian refugees who were applying for asylum in the United\u000aStates."I heard almost 1,000 stories," he says. "Most of them were\u000atraumatizing. For them, this interview is life-changing. It's like the last\u000arope you throw to a drowned person. My own perception of life changed after\u000athese interviews. You appreciate life differently, you see how these people\u000awant a future, how they are craving it. I felt I had to create something\u000arelated to what I heard."RELATED: Artist William Kentridge's incredible\u000arefugee premonition The resulting sculpture, called "My light is your light",\u000ais a set of custom-made white neon lights that "look like extremely fragile\u000ahuman bones". For Minawi, the entire piece is a stripped down version of one\u000aparticular family in Lebanon whose story affected him deeply."They're crossing\u000athe border," Minawi says. "The father is in front watching out for the family.\u000aThe grandfather trails behind him, bent over and exhausted. The mother is\u000awalking forward but looking down. The teenager has been left behind. He's just\u000aas traumatized as everyone else, but they don't notice. There's also an aunt\u000aand a little child."Like the Syrian refugees they represent, the six figures\u000ain Minawi's installation are crossing borders all over Europe and beyond. The\u000awork, which premiered at the Amsterdam Light Festival in 2013, has also been\u000adisplayed in Beirut, Istanbul and most recently, at London's Winter Lights at\u000aCanary Wharf festival. The sculpture proved so popular that it's staying in\u000aLondon for two months longer than planned."I was surprised that the\u000ainstallation was wanted by so many places," says Minawi. "Now I have a plan.\u000aI'm going to tour it around Portugal and Belgium, but then I'm hoping to sell\u000ait in Germany. I contacted Angela Merkel to do an auction together, but she's\u000areally hard to reach. "RELATED: An artist's portrayal of Syria's struggle So\u000afar, Minawi has written to the German Chancellor, the Minister for Refugees\u000aand has sent a long letter detailing his intentions to the German embassy in\u000aBeirut. He wants to work with the German government to exhibit and auction off\u000athe sculpture at the end of its European tour. Most of the money raised would\u000ago towards helping Syrian refugees in Germany."Angela Merkel was the first\u000aperson who was brave enough to open the doors to refugees," he says. "I\u000aappreciate what she did. I want this to be my contribution to her actions.\u000aDoing this would give the installation another value beyond delivering an\u000aemotional message."According to Minawi, the installation has a message not\u000aonly for Europeans, but also for refugees themselves."I want to tell them that\u000ayou shine light and you can move on," he says. "There are five statues whose\u000aheads are all down. Except for the little kid."Unlike the older figures, the\u000asmallest child in the sculpture looks straight ahead, and was intended as a\u000asymbol of hope and resilience."Children always adapt," Minawi says. "They're\u000astronger than what we think. This little boy was just running and he saw\u000asomething that grabbed his attention. It's enough for him to forget about what\u000ahe's been through."As a refugee himself, Minawi grew up listening to the\u000astories of his grandfather, who fled Palestine in 1948. "My grandfather owned\u000afive houses in Palestine," he recalls. "But when he became a refugee, he lived\u000ain a tent in a graveyard in Beirut. It was a traumatic shift, but 60 years\u000alater we are back on our feet. I want refugees to know that things get better\u000awith time."_'My light is your light' will be on display in Canary Wharf until\u000athe end of March, 2016._\u000a\u000a

V(CNN)Turkey and the European Union say they have agreed on key points of a\u000a"bold" proposal to help resolve the migrant crisis, aimed at deterring\u000amigrants from attempting the perilous journey to Europe.Under the proposed\u000adeal, Ankara would agree to take back all migrants who leave Turkey's shores\u000afor Europe in the future, including those intercepted in its territorial\u000awaters, on the condition that one legitimate Syrian refugee is resettled in\u000aEurope for every Syrian returned to Turkey.EU-Turkey migrant deal in 5\u000aquestions -- how would it actually work?But international humanitarian groups\u000ahave harshly criticized parts of the agreement, with a senior official from\u000athe U.N. refugee agency saying Tuesday that sending back refugees en masse\u000awould not be "consistent with European law.""An agreement that would be\u000atantamount to a blanket return to a third country is not consistent with\u000aEuropean law, not consistent with international law," Vincent Cochetel, Europe\u000aregional director of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,\u000atold reporters in Geneva, Switzerland.The plan would also see the EU provide\u000aTurkey with billions in additional funding for refugees, speed up talks on\u000aTurkey joining the EU and accelerate the lifting of visa requirements for\u000aTurkish citizens in Europe. The proposal still requires details to be hammered\u000aout before being sent for approval by EU leaders next week. "The days of\u000airregular migration to the European Union are over," said Donald Tusk,\u000apresident of the European Council -- as the group of 28 EU leaders is known --\u000aat the end of this week's emergency summit in Brussels, Belgium.He said\u000aTurkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu had "confirmed Turkey's commitment to\u000aaccept the rapid return of all migrants coming from Turkey to Greece that are\u000anot in need of international protection." "The EU will support Greece in\u000aensuring comprehensive, large-scale and fast-track returns to Turkey," Tusk\u000asaid.A statement from EU heads of government said they agreed that "bold moves\u000awere needed" to break the business model of smugglers, highlighting the\u000aimportance of a NATO anti-trafficking mission in the Aegean Sea that just\u000aexpanded into Greek and Turkish territorial waters."We need to break the link\u000abetween getting in a boat and getting settlement in Europe," the statement\u000asaid.Davutoglu said that his country, which hosts more Syrian refugees than\u000aany other, was motivated to enter into the arrangement primarily out of\u000ahumanitarian concern."We don't want to see women and children dying in the\u000aAegean Sea," he told reporters, according to Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu\u000anews agency. European leaders are grappling with the biggest refugee crisis\u000asince World War II, with more than 1 million people having entered EU\u000aterritory since the start of 2015. Most of the migrants are from Syria, where\u000athe civil war has created more than 4 million refugees and displaced a further\u000a6 million within the country.The majority have come by using trafficking\u000anetworks to cross the Aegean, which separates Turkey and Greece, before\u000aheading overland through the Balkans to Germany and other northern European\u000acountries.The crossing is dangerous, with more than 400 migrants having died\u000aso far this year, according to the International Organization for\u000aMigration.Recently, a number of countries along the Balkan migration route\u000aagreed to all but close their borders, leaving a bottleneck of desperate\u000amigrants stranded in Greece, already struggling with a debt crisis. Thousands\u000aof refugees stuck on Greece-Macedonia border as new rules take holdTusk\u000aconfirmed at the summit's end that EU leaders had decided to "end the 'wave-\u000athrough approach'" through countries along the overland route to Western\u000aEurope."Irregular flows of migrants along the Western Balkans route have now\u000acome to an end," the EU heads of government said in a joint statement.Making\u000agood on that vow, Serbia closed its southern borders, with Macedonia and\u000aBulgaria, at midnight Tuesday, before Macedonia followed suit, sealing its\u000aborder with Greece."We stopped accepting migrants at the border with Greece\u000aMarch 8 due to the fact that the Serbian government stopped accepting migrants\u000aon March 6 and the migrants couldn't reach their destination," a spokeswoman\u000afor the Macedonian Interior Ministry told CNN.More than 11,000 people have\u000abeen stuck on the Greece-Macedonia border in a transit camp at Idomeni\u000adesigned for 1,500, according to Doctors Without Borders.Serbia said it\u000alearned from Croatia that Slovenia, another EU member, would not receive\u000amigrants without valid visas and passports, effectively closing the Balkan\u000aroute.** **"Serbia cannot afford to become a collection center for refugees,\u000aso it will consolidate all measures with the European Union, and reciprocally\u000aapply them in its southern and eastern borders with Macedonia and Bulgaria,"\u000aSerbia's Ministry of Internal Affairs told CNN in an email.In Slovenia, the\u000aGovernment Communications Office director confirmed that the country was\u000aclosing its borders at midnight Tuesday. "People who don't have proper\u000adocuments -- i.e. people who don't have papers for Schengen -- cannot enter\u000athe Schengen area," Kristina Krajnc Plavsak told CNN. "We are strictly\u000aimplementing Schengen rules." She said the closure comes in coordination with\u000aSlovenia's neighbors and with other countries on the Balkan route, and it was\u000anot a unilateral decision.Tusk said the EU would deploy "massive humanitarian\u000aassistance" to Greece to help it respond to the effects of the route's closure\u000aand would offer aid for the country to manage its external border.Migrants\u000awere sent back from Greece to Turkey last week, Tusk said, in what he\u000adescribed as the "first visible step" of the Greek-Turkish bilateral\u000aagreement.Other humanitarian organizations were quick to join the U.N. refugee\u000aagency in criticizing the proposal -- in particular, the mass return of\u000arefugees to Turkey. Amnesty International said the plan showed an "alarmingly\u000ashort-sighted and inhumane attitude" to the migrant crisis and would deal a\u000a"death blow to the right to seek asylum."The statement said Amnesty opposed\u000a"the concept of a 'safe third country' in general, as this undermines the\u000aindividual right to have asylum claims fully and fairly processed," and that\u000athere was "huge cause for concern" about sending migrants to Turkey, "given\u000athe current situation and treatment of migrants and refugees."The statement\u000aattacked the "horse trading" concept of resettling a Syrian refugee in Europe\u000afor every compatriot sent back to Turkey, saying the proposal would make\u000a"every resettlement place offered to a Syrian in the EU contingent upon\u000aanother Syrian risking their life by embarking on the deadly sea route to\u000aGreece.""The idea of bartering refugees for refugees is not only dangerously\u000adehumanizing, but also offers no sustainable long-term solution to the ongoing\u000ahumanitarian crisis," said Iverna McGowan, head of Amnesty's European\u000aInstitutions Office.Amnesty also expressed concern about the closure of the\u000aBalkan migration route, which would "lead to thousands of vulnerable people\u000abeing left in the cold with no clear plan on how their urgent humanitarian\u000aneeds and rights to international protection would be dealt with."The\u000aInternational Rescue Committee lauded the meeting in Brussels but warned that\u000a"closing all of Europe's borders without offering alternative routes to safety\u000awill not work.""In fact," the organization said, "the only winners will be the\u000asmugglers, as people take more elaborate and more dangerous routes to\u000asafety."U.N. refugee agency spokesman William Spindler said refugees should be\u000areturned to a third country only if certain safeguards were in place, such as\u000aa protections against "refoulement," a legal term used to describe returning\u000aasylum seekers somewhere they would be at risk.Spindler called for the details\u000aof these safeguards to be clarified before the proposal was next put to EU\u000aleaders at a crisis meeting scheduled for March 17.Late last year, the\u000aEuropean Union and Turkey agreed to a joint action plan in response to the\u000amigrant crisis. European leaders agreed to pay Turkey 3 billion euros ($3.3\u000abillion) to support its refugee population and target people-smuggling\u000anetworks -- a mission that has seen NATO warships deployed to the eastern\u000aMediterranean this year.Tusk said that "despite good implementation" of that\u000aplan, it had failed to reduce the migrant flow sufficiently and that extra\u000asteps were necessary. The new proposal would focus on speeding up the\u000adisbursement of the 3 billion euros already pledged to Turkey as well as\u000aproviding new funding to alleviate the crisis. Turkey requested an extra 3\u000abillion euros at this week's summit, according to European Parliament\u000aPresident Martin Schulz.The EU would bear the cost of returning the migrants\u000ato Turkey under the proposal.Syrian refugees settled in the EU under terms of\u000athe deal would be distributed among member states "within the framework of the\u000aexisting commitments," a joint statement from the EU heads of government\u000asaid.UK sends boats to Aegean Sea ahead of summitLast year, the EU agreed to\u000aresettle 160,000 refugees, but less than 1,000 have been processed so far.\u000aCNN's Arwa Damon, Laura Perez Maestro, Karen Smith and Don Melvin contributed\u000ato this report.\u000a\u000a

V(CNN)Kiwi rugby star Sonny Bill Williams has come under criticism for tweeting\u000aout a graphic photo of two dead children following a UNICEF-sponsored trip to\u000aa Lebanon refugee camp. The All Blacks and Chiefs player, who was key to New\u000aZealand's Rugby World Cup success in London in August, tweeted a photo of what\u000aappears to be two young children who have been killed in an explosion. He\u000aaccompanied the split image with: "What did these children do to deserve this?\u000aThis summer share a thought for the innocent lives lost everyday (sic) in\u000awar." The tweet was posted on Tuesday, after Williams had returned from a\u000avisit to settlements in the Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border with Lebanon,\u000awhere he was working with UNICEF New Zealand as an ambassador. He is not an\u000aofficial UNICEF ambassador, but rather was invited to join the trip with the\u000aorganization to help him understand -- and promote awareness of -- the plight\u000aof those affected by Syria's civil war. The tweet has met with mixed\u000aresponses, and at the time of writing had been retweeted 1,700 times and liked\u000a2,100 times. Some called him "insensitive" while others supported his decision\u000ato "highlight reality." UNICEF New Zealand has distanced itself from Williams'\u000apost, and a spokesman confirmed that the photos were not taken while Willimas\u000awas in Lebanon. While acknowledging that he was clearly "deeply moved" by his\u000aexperience with the Syrian refugees, the organization condemned his decision\u000ato display the photo to his 556,000 followers."We see it as a fundamental\u000ainfringement of those children's rights," UNICEF spokesman Patrick Rose was\u000aquoted as saying in the New Zealand Herald. "But at the same time, we don't\u000ahave the capacity to censor or edit private citizens' showing what they find\u000aon their individual explorations online."We are as disturbed as anyone when we\u000asee those images but we want to offer a positive framework for people to\u000arespond to that."We can't stop the war, we can't stop these things happening\u000ato people, but what we can do is help children by getting them clean water, by\u000agetting them counseling to help them deal with that trauma and to help them\u000ahave a better future by keeping them in school."The organization had\u000apreviously posted images of Williams, or SBW as he is known in New Zealand,\u000aplaying with children at the Lebanese camps. The Herald later reported that\u000athe photos were of two children killed in a Russian airstrike which were\u000acirculated in Turkish media, quoting a Syrian civil defense official who said\u000athat the deadly strike happened in Idlib province. **READ: Sonny Bill\u000aWilliams: Islam brings me happiness****READ: All Blacks star given new World\u000aCup winner's medal **\u000a\u000a

VWashington (CNN)President Barack Obama continued his pushback Tuesday against\u000aefforts to curb refugee entry into the United States, declaring at a\u000anaturalization ceremony in Washington that America risks repeating past\u000ainjustices if it closes its doors to those fleeing war. "In the Syrian seeking\u000arefuge today, we should see the Jewish refugee of World War II," Obama said at\u000athe National Archives, where 31 new citizens -- including a refugee from Iraq\u000a-- had just sworn the Oath of Allegiance to the United States.In his remarks,\u000aObama renewed his tacit criticism of Republican presidential front-runner\u000aDonald Trump, who's proposed to barring all Muslims from entering the country.\u000aStanding before original copies of the Declaration of Independence, U.S.\u000aConstitution and Bill of Rights, Obama warned against drifting from the values\u000aenshrined in those documents."There's no respite from our ideals," Obama said.\u000a"All of us are called to live up to our expectations for ourselves, not just\u000awhen it's convenient, but when it's inconvenient. When it's tough. When we're\u000aafraid.""The tension throughout our history between welcoming or rejecting the\u000astranger: it's about more than just immigration, it's about the meaning of\u000aAmerica," he added. "What kind of country do we want to be?"After terror\u000aattacks in Paris and California, Obama has sought to amplify his message on\u000aISIS, including traveling to the Pentagon on Monday for an update from his\u000amilitary brass and to the National Counterterrorism Center Thursday for a\u000abriefing on holiday threats.But intertwined in those efforts have been\u000aentreaties to Americans to treat Muslims with fairness and respect, and not\u000aallow fear to tinge their views of their neighbors."We must resolve to always\u000aspeak out against hatred and bigoty in all of its forms," he said Tuesday.\u000a"Whether taunts against the child of an immigrant farmworker or threats\u000aagainst a Muslim shopkeeper. We are Americans. Standing up for each other is\u000awhat the values enshrined in the documents in this room compels us to do.\u000aEspecially when it's hard, especially when it's not convenient. That's when it\u000acounts. That's when it matters."Before the Republican candidate's call to ban\u000aMuslims from the country, the White House was pushing back on efforts to curb\u000arefugee entry into the U.S. following the terror attacks in Paris. Those\u000aattempts, mostly Republican-led, were prompted by fears terrorists could join\u000athe massive waves of migrants fleeing violence in Syria and Iraq and\u000ainfiltrate the homeland.Obama has lambasted such efforts, saying those opposed\u000ato admitting refugees were reacting to fear.Since then, however, vetting\u000aprocesses for incoming foreigners have come under more intense scrutiny.\u000aDespite conducting three interviews with Tashfeen Malik, one of the\u000aperpetrators of the San Bernardino attack, officials missed social media\u000apostings supporting violent jihad.The White House says an ongoing review of\u000athe so-called "fiancée visa" program could result in greater allocation of\u000aresources for scrutinizing social media.\u000a\u000a

VJay Parini, a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont and\u000ais the author of "Jesus: The Human Face of God.." The opinions expressed in\u000athis commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)As Christmas arrives,\u000amany of the over two billion people in the world who identify as Christians\u000abegin to refocus in a particular way, thinking about the meaning of this holy\u000acelebration. They do so, of course, with varying degrees of intensity. For\u000asome, it's only a matter of jingle bells and the exchange of gifts, perhaps a\u000akiss under the mistletoe. There is usually a tree with lights and ornaments.\u000aCandles may flicker in the windows. And Santa may play a more important role\u000athan Jesus in many of their lives.But those who care about the practice of\u000atheir faith keep Jesus front and center. His birth and the story that\u000asurrounds it is the reason for Christmas, and its message should sing loudly\u000athrough the season.It is a moving story, with elements of joy and terror. A\u000ayoung family from Galilee comes into a small town as strangers, the mother is\u000apregnant, and there is "no room for them in the inn." (Luke 2:7). When the\u000achild is born, the magicians, or "magi," come looking for him from the East to\u000aworship him, after inadvertently telling a wicked king about this newborn with\u000agreat potential. The king wants to kill him; he believes the child may be a\u000afuture rival. Angel appears to Joseph, and he is told to run with his young\u000afamily and to hide in Egypt; Jesus becomes - at once - a refugee, on the run\u000afor his life.The Christmas story appears in the gospels of Matthew and Luke,\u000aand in the former it's very much a tale of horror and flight, the murderous\u000aking ordering the immediate slaughter of all children younger than 2 in the\u000avicinity of Bethlehem. (Matthew 2:16-18). This is straight from the annals of\u000aterrorism, even though it has perhaps less claim to historical veracity than\u000aone might like. Yet the mythic point is real, undeniable: Jesus arrives into\u000athis troubled world in a threatened situation. Thomas Merton, the poet and\u000aTrappist monk, writes memorably about the manger scene in Bethlehem: "Into\u000athis world, this demented inn, in which there is absolutely no room for him at\u000aall, Christ has come uninvited." It's because of his extreme situation, a\u000anewborn on the run, a refugee who must flee with his parents to Egypt to\u000aescape persecution and death, that Jesus stands for all political refugees,\u000aall those in despair of having a place to lay their head. Jesus is always\u000apresent with those, as Merton says, "for whom there is no room."I love the\u000aChristmas story in its terrifying and beautiful dimensions. Jesus is a human\u000abeing who is fully inhabited by God. Thus he becomes, in the Greek word, the\u000aChristos, or the anointed one, a person in whom God dwells -- as in the word\u000aEmmanuel, which in Hebrew means "God dwelling within." Christmas is, for those\u000awho wish to follow the way of Jesus, an invitation to accept into our\u000acomfortable and safe lives those who come to us from far away, who seem\u000aragged, marginal, in transition. This is how God finds us, at this very dark\u000atime of the year, the winter solstice, when the daylight hours have shrunk to\u000atheir minimal light. He comes knocking at the door, looking for a haven, for a\u000aplace to rest and recover.In John 8:12, Jesus calls himself "the light of the\u000aworld." This light shines into the darkest corners of our bleak midwinter\u000aexistence and offers a glimmering of hope. It's a light coming from an\u000aunexpected place.I don't believe it's possible to imagine a Jesus who would\u000anot welcome refugees with open arms, who would not fight hatred with love, who\u000awould not understand that the "war on terror" -- whether it flashes from the\u000athrone of Herod the Great or Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi -- is fundamentally a war of\u000aideas. You can't defeat ISIS with weapons, with boots on the ground, with\u000acarpet bombing or any vengeful threats. You overcome darkness with light, and\u000athis is not some vague, wishy-washy, "liberal" idea. It's the hard reality\u000athat Jesus taught us, over 2,000 years ago. And every year at Christmas, he\u000acomes to us as a child on the run with his impoverished and terrified parents.\u000aHe knocks at the door of our house and our hearts. And we let him in -- or we\u000aturn him away._Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.__  \u000aRead CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine._\u000a\u000a

V(CNN)A 23-year-old Mississippi man pleaded guilty Friday to conspiring to\u000aprovide material support to ISIS, according to the U.S. Justice Department.\u000aMuhammad Oda Dakhlalla, 23, of Starkville, pleaded guilty before U.S. District\u000aChief Judge Sharion Aycock of the Northern District of Mississippi, the\u000aJustice Department said in a statement. Dakhlalla was remanded to the custody\u000aof the U.S. Marshals Service for sentencing at a later date, the statement\u000asaid. His attorney declined comment.Dakhlalla and his fiancée, Jaelyn Delshaun\u000aYoung, 20, were arrested last August at Golden Triangle Regional Airport in\u000aColumbus, Mississippi, according to a criminal complaint. They were accused of\u000aconspiring and attempting to provide material support and resources to the\u000aterror organization ISIS."Our story will be that we are newlyweds on our\u000ahoneymoon," the young woman allegedly wrote.But the couple actually had\u000aplanned to fly from Mississippi to Europe and then travel to Syria to join\u000aISIS, the complaint said. Young is to face trial in June, according to the\u000aU.S. Attorney's Office. CNN reached out to her attorneys but did not get an\u000aimmediate response.Court documents detailed what federal investigators said\u000awere the couple's plans, as allegedly communicated through social media to the\u000aundercover FBI employees over the past several months.Among the allegations:--\u000aYoung wrote of her plans to marry Dakhlalla so the two could travel to Syria\u000atogether. She allegedly confirmed that the wedding took place in June, and\u000asaid the couple's cover story would be that they were flying to Europe on\u000atheir honeymoon. To avoid suspicion, "We won't be flying to Istanbul. We will\u000afly to a different country and take a bus."-- The couple described their\u000askills and asked how they could help the terror group's efforts.** **"I am\u000agood with computers, education and media," Dakhlalla allegedly wrote in one\u000amessage to an FBI employee. "What could I contribute?" Young also allegedly\u000atold an undercover FBI agent that her skills would be useful. "I am skilled in\u000amath and chemistry and worked at an analytical lab here on my college campus.\u000aMy partner is very good with things like computer science/media. We learn very\u000afast and would love to help with giving medical aid."-- In messages detailed\u000ain the complaint, the couple seemed enthusiastic, but also concerned about how\u000atraining would work once they arrived. "Salaam again," Dakhlalla allegedly\u000awrote in a message to an FBI employee. "I wanted to ask about the military\u000aexperience there. Would I be with people that speak English as well or do they\u000aput me with everyone at basic training? I am excited about coming ... but I\u000afeel I won't know what all I will be doing."According to a law enforcement\u000aofficial, Dakhlalla is the son of a local imam, Young is the daughter of a\u000aVicksburg, Mississippi, police officer and a recent convert to Islam. Both are\u000aformer Mississippi State University students, according to university\u000aspokesperson Sid Salter. Dakhlalla graduated with a degree in psychology, and\u000aYoung was last enrolled in last year as a sophomore studying chemistry. How\u000aISIS is luring so many Americans to join its ranks\u000a\u000a

V(CNN)The FBI arrested a man who told an undercover FBI employee that he wanted\u000ato shoot up a Detroit-area church to show support for ISIS, according to a\u000acriminal complaint released Friday.Khalil Abu Rayyan, 21, said he had picked a\u000achurch but the plan fell apart because "my dad searched my car one day and he\u000afound everything. He found the gun and the bullets and the mask I was going to\u000awear," the complaint said.The FBI charged Rayyan with being an unlawful user\u000aof a controlled substance who possessed a firearm that traveled in interstate\u000acommerce. The complaint said he falsely said on a gun shop form that he wasn't\u000aa marijuana user. The gun he bought in Michigan had been manufactured in\u000aFlorida, the complaint said.He is not charged with terror-related offenses.How\u000aISIS is luring so many Americans to join its ranksThe FBI said agents began\u000awatching Rayyan last May after learning he had made threats to others about\u000acommitting acts of terror, including killing churchgoers, in the name of ISIS,\u000athe complaint said.Last October, Detroit police stopped his vehicle for\u000aspeeding and found a .22-caliber pistol and marijuana inside the vehicle, the\u000acomplaint said. He was charged with the state offenses of carrying a concealed\u000aweapon and possession of a controlled substance. As the FBI further monitored\u000aRayyan after that arrest, he talked online to the FBI employee about shooting\u000aup the church, bragged about owning an AK-47 and said he wanted to kill the\u000apolice officer who arrested him, the complaint said.Study: Unprecedented\u000asupport for ISIS in the U.S.\u000a\u000a

V(CNN)The Joint Terrorism Task Force in Seattle arrested Daniel Seth Franey\u000aduring a raid at his home in Montesano, Washington, on Saturday and charged\u000ahim with unlawful possession of guns, including machine guns.Franey landed on\u000alaw enforcement's radar in April 2015 when a witness went to police to alert\u000athem Franey "regularly talked about his support for ISIL and claimed he wanted\u000ato go oversees to 'join the fight,'" according to the criminal complaint filed\u000ain federal court.The witness said Franey talked about "his desire to kill\u000aAmericans" and that he "wants to travel to Afghanistan to kill American\u000asoldiers, and that all non-Muslim Americans should be killed."Franey was\u000adischarged from the Army in 2008 and told people he "deserted the army" after\u000asix years, according to court documents. The complaint says Army documents\u000auncovered in the investigation confirm the claim.Franey told the witness he\u000awas interested in obtaining an AK-47. According to one witness, Franey also\u000asaid "the U.S. and Iranian governments were corrupt and that he would have no\u000ahesitation 'taking out cops' if they interfered with him.""I just wish I could\u000aget over there (Syria and Iraq.) I would kill everyone," said Franey,\u000aaccording to the criminal complaint.In September another witness told police\u000aFraney asked if they were interested in becoming an "ISIS warrior." He told\u000athat person "things were going to happen" and that "we (would be) cutting\u000acops' heads off" and there was "going to anarchy."Based on the information\u000afrom several witnesses, the FBI launched an undercover operation to further\u000ainvestigate Franey -- using an undercover agent to befriend Franey and pretend\u000ato be black market gun dealer. Franey went with the undercover agent on five\u000astaged firearms trafficking delivery trips. Franey allegedly told the\u000aundercover agent, Osama Bin Laden "is a diamond. He's a holy warrior. He's a\u000abeautiful man." He also allegedly praised Anwar al-Awlaki as a "scholar."\u000a"You're way less ignorant and argumentative than most Americans," Franey told\u000athe agent, according to the documents.Franey is charged with five felony\u000acounts of unlawful possession of weapons, including machine guns.\u000a\u000a

V(CNN)The U.S. military has conducted airstrikes against targets it believes\u000aare crucial to ISIS' chemical weapons program based on information provided by\u000aa senior ISIS operative involved in chemical weapons, several U.S. officials\u000atold CNN.The U.S. captured the operative in Iraq three weeks ago, the first\u000asince a team of Special Operations forces recently began operating in northern\u000aIraq.Officials told CNN that his name is Sleiman Daoud Al-Bakkar. One official\u000acalled him "the key leader," but others could not say if he runs the entire\u000achemical weapons program for ISIS.The information he provided to interrogators\u000ahas given the U.S. enough information to begin striking ISIS areas in Iraq\u000aassociated with the group's chemical weapons program. One U.S. official said\u000athe goal is to locate, target and carry out strikes that will result in the\u000adestruction of ISIS's entire chemical weapons enterprise -- mainly mustard\u000aagent ISIS produces itself.It was not immediately clear if the U.S. was able\u000ato strike all of the necessary targets. Intelligence and surveillance of the\u000atargets had indicated in some Iraqi locations that civilians were present at\u000aprospective sites, officials told CNN.While the goal is to end ISIS'\u000acapability to manufacture and use mustard agent, the actual targets being\u000astruck include people, facilities and vehicles. The agent itself is made in\u000arelatively small quantities and has a fairly short shelf life, the U.S.\u000agovernment believes.RELATED: Army's Delta Force begins to target ISIS in\u000aIraqThe program is one the U.S. military has been tracking, with Defense\u000aSecretary Ash Carter saying last month the Pentagon was prepared to strike\u000aagainst it."It's something we watch very closely and it's something we take\u000aaction against," Carter said in an interview that aired on PBS.Since the\u000aweekend, the U.S. has struck what it is calling "improvised weapons\u000afacilities" and other targets near Mosul, Iraq, but officials would not say if\u000athese were chemical weapons sites.At the request of the Pentagon, CNN\u000ainitially withheld publishing the detainee's connection to ISIS' chemical\u000aweapons program because defense officials said disclosing that would risk\u000aalerting ISIS to potential airstrike targets. With the chemical weapons\u000aprogram undisturbed, it would allow ISIS to use the weapons to strike\u000acivilians, troops the U.S. supports, and possibly even U.S. troops.Officials\u000awould not explain why they believed the detention itself hadn't jeopardized\u000athe airstrikes, or why the U.S. military believes ISIS had not noticed the\u000acaptured operative had gone missing from its ranks. However, the operative is\u000asaid to have regularly moved around in Iraq, and officials said they still\u000abelieve his capture was unknown to ISIS. U.S. Special Operations forces\u000acaptured the operative more than three weeks ago. He has been held and\u000ainterrogated in Irbil, Iraq, for any information he has about the chemical\u000aweapons program and the location of other key ISIS personnel or weapons\u000astocks. While there are other ISIS operatives involved in the program, the\u000aU.S. believes at this point that the captured man is crucial to understanding\u000athis dangerous wing of the organization.The U.S. has long said any ISIS\u000aoperatives captured by U.S. troops would only be held for a short time and\u000athen turned over to either the Iraqis or the Kurds.RELATED: U.S. claims to\u000ahave killed 150 fighters from Al-Shabaab in SomaliaThe operative was captured\u000ain one of the first missions of the so-called Expeditionary Targeting Forces.\u000aIt is a group of some 200 Special Operations troops assembled in northern Iraq\u000ato gather intelligence and pursue ISIS operatives on the ground by either\u000acapturing or killing them in Iraq, and eventually in Syria. Carter recently\u000aacknowledged the ETF is "having an effect and operating."It's a tool that we\u000aintroduced as part of our -- the accelerated operations to conduct raids of\u000avarious kinds, seizing places and people, freeing hostages and prisoners of\u000aISIL, and making it such that ISIL has to fear that anywhere, anytime, it may\u000abe struck," he said in late February, using a different name for ISIS.The U.S.\u000awent after this particular individual due to concerns about the "skills and\u000aintent" he has, one of the officials said. The mission to capture him was\u000aspecifically tailored to the location where he was, and was designed to allow\u000atroops to be able to seize him. U.S. Special Operations forces were certain he\u000awas at the location in Iraq after covertly surveying it for some days.The U.S.\u000aintelligence community has been tracking a number of confirmed chemical\u000aattacks by ISIS where powdered mustard agent was used in artillery shells, the\u000aofficial said. The most recent attack was a month ago.The U.S. intelligence\u000acommunity has confirmed 12 cases of the use of mustard agent. Three other\u000acases are suspected. They include locations in both Syria and Iraq. The\u000amajority of the cases have been in Syria, some as far west as the Maraa line\u000awhere fighting has raged. Other attacks have occurred across Iraq, including\u000aSinjar Mountain and the area around Mosul, as well as locations further south\u000atowards Baghdad.However, U.S. officials are somewhat downplaying the attacks,\u000asaying they believe any deaths were a result of being hit by artillery, not\u000athe agent itself.Since interrogations of the detainee began, U.S. Special\u000aOperations forces have been using the information he has provided to begin to\u000alocate targets.Under the rules of engagement, U.S. Special Operations forces\u000amust have continuous surveillance of a target for a period of time to ensure\u000athey know who is there and the locations of any potential nearby civilians\u000abefore they strike.The U.S. has said all Special Operations missions are\u000acoordinated with the Iraqi government.Vice President Joe Biden has spoken to\u000aIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi twice in the last week, though White\u000aHouse readouts of the call did not mention the detainee.It could not\u000aimmediately be learned if there were Iraqi forces took part in the raid to\u000acapture the man, or whether Iraqis were involved in the airstrikes.Director of\u000aNational Intelligence James Clapper recently hinted at the confirmation of\u000achemical attacks by ISIS in congressional testimony."Chemical weapons continue\u000ato pose a threat in Syria and Iraq," Clapper told the House intelligence\u000acommittee. "ISIL has also used toxic chemicals in Iraq and Syria, including\u000athe blister agent Sulfur Mustard. (It's) the first time an extremist group has\u000aproduced and used a chemical warfare agent in an attack since Aum Shinrikyo\u000aused sarin in Japan in 1995."Defense officials said this was the first public\u000aconfirmation by the U.S. government of mustard agent attacks.The Organization\u000afor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons also continues to track reports of the\u000ause of mustard agent and is talking with the U.S. about other possible\u000aattacks, U.S. officials said.Investigators will also want to know whether ISIS\u000ahas any plans to use chemical agents in attacks against the West. It's unclear\u000awhether the captured operative has that knowledge.\u000a\u000a

V(CNN)A pair of nearly 50-year-old planes has been brought out of retirement to\u000afight ISIS.The Vietnam-era OV-10 Bronco turbo-propeller planes are part of an\u000aexperiment to see if "light turbo-prop aircraft" are more effective in\u000aconducting counterinsurgency operations, a U.S. military representative told\u000aCNN this week.During their deployment, the planes flew 120 combat missions\u000aagainst ISIS targets as part of the counter-ISIS coalition, said spokesman\u000aCapt. Bryant Davis of U.S. Central Command, which oversees military operations\u000ain the Middle East.The Daily Beast first reported on the aircraft trials.The\u000aOV-10s were operated by a two-person crew that consisted of a naval aviator\u000aand a Navy flight officer, according to the military.The experiment aims to\u000adetermine whether slower planes like the Bronco can better support ground\u000atroops battling insurgents than more technologically advanced and expensive\u000acounterparts such as the F-15 Eagle and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets.The\u000aidea is that older aircraft can more cost-effectively fly close air support\u000amissions to help U.S. ground troops and pilots better see and attack low-tech\u000ainsurgents.Retired naval aviator Cmdr. Chris Harmer praised the aircraft's\u000areactivation, telling CNN it was "an excellent idea."Harmer, now the senior\u000anaval analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, called the OV-10 a "great\u000aplane to fly" and said it was likely that U.S. pilots fought over who got the\u000achance to fly it in combat.Harmer told CNN that the planes were a much more\u000acost-effective alternative than jets like the F-15 or F-35, the latter of\u000awhich is estimated to cost more than $150 million each.Using an F-35 to fly\u000aclose air support against insurgents would be akin to "buying a brand new\u000aRolls Royce to take the garbage to the dump," Harmer said.Harmer estimated the\u000acost of flying the more modern jets at $45,000 per hour of flight, while the\u000aolder Bronco could cost less than $5,000 per flight.The F-15 Eagle has a\u000acruising speed of 570 mph, while the OV-10 has a cruising speed of 223 mph,\u000aaccording to an Air Force fact sheet.While he acknowledged that the slower\u000aplanes were vulnerable to other modern enemy aircraft and anti-aircraft\u000amissiles, he said the planes would be "extremely effective" in environments\u000alike Iraq and Afghanistan, where the terrorists have very limited anti-\u000aaircraft weapons.Paul Scharre, a former Army Ranger who served multiple tours\u000ain Iraq and Afghanistan, said these turboprop planes were the perfect middle\u000aground between drones and more technologically advanced jets.Scharre said that\u000alike drones, the OV-10 can loiter over the battlefield for hours, but unlike\u000adrones, the pilot has greater visibility of the battlefield and can see the\u000alocation of enemy forces and attack them directly with machine guns and more\u000abombs and missiles than a drone can carry.More modern jets travel too fast to\u000asee events on the ground and become overly reliant on technology to target\u000aenemy combatants, he said. Additionally, these jets consume fuel at a much\u000afaster rate, which means they cannot fly over the battlefield for as long as\u000atheir propeller-powered counterparts.Scharre, a senior fellow at the Center\u000afor a New American Security, told CNN that 15 years of counterinsurgency\u000amissions had taken a toll on the technologically advanced and expensive\u000aAmerican fighter jet fleet, saying a jet "can only have so many flying hours\u000abefore it is worn out."Both Scharre and Harmer said that these light attack\u000aaircraft would be in high demand by U.S. Special Operations forces because of\u000atheir ability to provide persistent surveillance and close air support and\u000atarget enemy forces up close without risking friendly fire casualties because\u000athe pilots are flying slow enough to visually distinguish between enemy and\u000afriendly forces.However, Harmer and Scharre think that resistance from higher-\u000aups in the military will hamper the drive to acquire these retro aircraft and\u000athat the Air Force is too focused on the more expensive F-35 to give much\u000aconsideration to embracing a 50-year-old technology.READ: B-52s to take on\u000aISISThe Central Command representative told CNN that the results of the\u000ainitial experiment have been passed on to the Office of the Secretary of\u000aDefense Joint Requirements Oversight Council and that the information will\u000ahelp Pentagon "decision makers determine if this is a valid concept that would\u000abe effective in the current battlespace."He added, "because the report is\u000astill a draft, it would be inappropriate and premature to provide details\u000aregarding any findings or potential recommendations.""The American way of\u000afighting since World War II has been to have superior technology. There has\u000abeen a constant focus on leading technological advancement that is on cutting\u000aedge," Harmer said.But Scharre is optimistic that these effective aircraft\u000awill find a niche within the military, possibly with Air Forces Special\u000aOperations acquiring some planes to support Special Operations forces.The need\u000afor close air support in the fight against ISIS also helped convince the Air\u000aForce to reconsider plans to retire the A-10 Warthog, a 1970s-era ground\u000aattack jet.READ: Defense chief says A-10s needed in ISIS fightScharre also\u000athinks that these turboprop aircraft will prove ideal for equipping and arming\u000aU.S. partners that are fighting insurgencies and terrorists.In January, the\u000aUnited States also provided Afghanistan with four turboprop A-29 Super Tucano\u000aplanes, the Afghan air force's first fixed-wing combat aircraft.\u000a\u000a

VWashington (CNN)Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said Thursday he has no health care and\u000alost his coverage "because of Obamacare.""You know who one of those millions\u000aof Americans who's lost their health care because of Obamacare? That would be\u000ame. I don't have health care right now," he told an audience in Manchester,\u000aNew Hampshire."I had purchased an individual policy and Blue Cross Blue Shield\u000acanceled all their individual policies in the state of Texas effective\u000aDecember 31st," Cruz explained. "So our health care got canceled. We got a\u000anotice in the mail. Blue Cross Blue Shield was leaving the market."On the\u000atrail, Cruz regularly promises to repeal Obamacare. Cruz said in 2013 that he\u000areceived his health insurance through his wife's plan at Goldman Sachs,\u000aboasting about not needing to receive government health care benefits.Heidi\u000aCruz, the senator's wife, is on unpaid leave from from her executive post at\u000athe financial company for the duration of her husband's presidential campaign,\u000aand is not receiving company benefits -- including health insurance -- during\u000aher leave, a Goldman spokesperson told CNN last March. Speaking to reporters\u000alater on Thursday, Cruz also dismissed former presidential candidate Bob\u000aDole's description of him as "extremist.""I don't know how he's going to deal\u000awith Congress," Dole told The New York Times on Wednesday. "Nobody likes\u000ahim."Cruz said Dole attacked him because the former senator and "the\u000aestablishment" are "scared" of him."What Bob Dole is effectively saying, and\u000athe establishment is saying, is the one guy that scares the heck out of us is\u000aCruz because Cruz actually will stand with the American people against the\u000acareer politicians in both parties," he said.

VLittle Rock, Arkansas (CNN)Donald Trump on Wednesday leveled a bold accusation\u000aat one of his chief rivals for the Republican nomination: "Ted Cruz gave us\u000aObamacare.""He'll get up and he'll talk about his relationship with God, his\u000arelationship with the Bible, his relationship with all sorts of things and\u000athen he'll say Donald Trump loves Obamacare. It would've been dead if we had a\u000adifferent justice on the United States Supreme Court put there by him," Trump\u000asaid, referring to conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, whose decisive\u000a2012 vote upheld the controversial health care law."He's the one that got\u000aJustice Roberts onto the United States Supreme Court," Trump added.While Cruz\u000avocally supported Roberts' nomination at the time, he was not yet a U.S.\u000asenator and therefore could not vote to confirm Roberts to the Supreme\u000aCourt.The Cruz campaign did not immediately return with a request for\u000acomment.Roberts' nomination passed before the Senate in 2005 and Cruz ascended\u000ato the legislative body more than seven years later.Trump's jab at Cruz was\u000ajust one of many the billionaire leveled at Cruz, who just two days earlier\u000adefeated Trump to win the Iowa caucuses.But that win came after Cruz and his\u000aallies relentlessly knocked Trump, accusing him of supporting Obamacare."A\u000avote for Donald Trump is a vote for Obamacare," Cruz said the day before the\u000acaucuses.Meanwhile, a super PAC supporting Cruz and another opposing Trump ran\u000aattack ads tying Trump to President Barack Obama's signature health care\u000alaw.Trump said in a September interview that "everybody's got to be covered"\u000aand "the government's gonna pay for it" when asked if he supported universal\u000ahealth care. He also noted that it was an "un-Republican thing for me to\u000asay."Still, Trump has repeatedly insisted that he will "repeal and replace\u000aObamacare," which he said once again Wednesday night here to raucous\u000aapplause.Cruz, for his part, has slammed Roberts since the conservative chief\u000ajustice ruled in favor of Obamacare -- despite praising Roberts when his\u000anomination was up for consideration."As an individual, John Roberts is\u000aundoubtedly a principled conservative, as is the president who appointed him,"\u000aCruz wrote in 2005 in the National Review. "As a jurist, Judge Roberts'\u000aapproach will be that of his entire career: carefully, faithfully applying the\u000aConstitution and legal precedent."\u000a\u000a

VManchester, New Hampshire (CNN)Still stinging from his first defeat as a\u000apresidential candidate, Donald Trump rolled into New Hampshire on Thursday\u000awith a new mantra: There is no such thing as too much campaigning.He also\u000abroke from his usual playbook by taking questions from the audience at the\u000afirst of many events planned for Thursday.Trump was originally scheduled to\u000ahold two campaign events in the Granite State, but he squeezed in three\u000aadditional stops including an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper, a meeting\u000awith local business owners and an event with the Manchester Police Department.\u000aThe bulked-up schedule follows Trump's second-place finish behind Ted Cruz in\u000athe Iowa caucuses on Monday. Trump's unconventional campaign style was\u000aparticularly noticeable in Iowa -- a state where retail politics is hugely\u000acritical -- and next to Cruz, who crisscrossed the state relentlessly to\u000aensure he had visited all 99 counties. In contrast, Trump opted for large\u000arallies over intimate settings and extended personal interactions with voters,\u000ajetting in and out on his private jet and rarely spending the night in the\u000astate. Who nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize?While the last-minute\u000aramping up of the campaign schedule in New Hampshire doesn't necessarily mean\u000aTrump is making substantive changes to the way he is running his campaign, it\u000adoes at least suggest that he looking to step up his exposure here just days\u000aaway from next Tuesday's contest. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't comment\u000aon Thursday's schedule.In his first event of the day in Exeter, Trump\u000arepeatedly emphasized the importance of the New Hampshire race. "We're at the\u000abeginning of a very, very important last few days. This is really crunch\u000atime," he said. "This is going to lead to one of the most important\u000apresidential elections, maybe the most important in many, many decades. You're\u000agoing to play such a big role."At one point, Trump used the major hotel\u000aproject he's working on in Washington to crack a joke about losing the 2016\u000arace. "I'm building a hotel next door, which is also located on Pennsylvania\u000aAve.," he said. "I have an alternative if this doesn't work out: I'll still be\u000aon Pennsylvania Ave. one way or another."After brief remarks, Trump did\u000asomething he's largely avoided so far this cycle: take questions from the\u000aaudience. Seemingly chosen at random, some half dozen individuals asked the\u000acandidate about a range of issues, from illegal immigration to Social\u000aSecurity, to corporate inversions and the treatment of veterans. The first\u000aexchange he had with a woman in the crowd was tense, as she asked about the\u000aimportant role that undocumented immigrants play in taking on jobs that nobody\u000aelse wants. "Who told you to be here? Bernie?" he said, referring to\u000aDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. "You know what the backbone\u000aof our country is? People that came here and came here legally ... and they\u000aworked their a--es off."Nearing the end of the Q&amp;A portion of the event,\u000aTrump said he wanted to end things on a high note."It's like Elton John. You\u000aalways want to finish with a strong song," he said. "If it's a lousy question,\u000aI'll take another one."In the afternoon, Trump sat down for a CNN interview at\u000aa popular local pizza joint here, where the candidate fielded questions from\u000aboth Cooper and -- for the second time that day -- attendees in the audience.\u000aRight off the bat, he addressed his recent calls for a rematch in Iowa. "I'm\u000aso much into this, into New Hampshire, that I just \u2014 I don't care about that\u000aanymore," Trump said. "This is the place I'm focused on now." Recent polls\u000ahave shown Trump with a significant lead over his competitors in the state,\u000abut his loss in Iowa and Marco Rubio's stronger-than-expected finish there\u000acould shift the dynamics. For all of his usual bombast and confidence, Trump\u000ahas shown moments of introspection post-Iowa, both about himself and his\u000acampaign operations. The candidate who has openly boasted about running a non-\u000atraditional campaign admitted Tuesday that he "didn't have much of a ground\u000agame" in Iowa, and that he is attempting to be more "understated and\u000astatesman-like."Related: The effort to save New Hampshire's midnight vote\u000a\u000a

VWashington (CNN)The GOP-controlled House of Representatives on Wednesday\u000aafternoon passed legislation that would repeal Obamacare, and after more than\u000a60 votes to roll back all or part of the law, the bill dismantle it will\u000afinally get to the President's desk.But it won't stay there long; President\u000aBarack Obama has vowed to veto any Republican bill that guts his signature\u000ahealth care law, a five-year-and-counting effort.The vote was 240-181, largely\u000aalong party lines.The Senate passed the legislation last month, using a budget\u000amechanism known as "reconciliation" to overcome a Democratic filibuster. House\u000aSpeaker Paul Ryan has told members he will hold an "enrollment ceremony"\u000aThursday to sign the bill before sending it off to the White House.The measure\u000awould also bar any federal money for Planned Parenthood, something\u000aconservatives in Congress vowed to do after a series of videos released by an\u000aanti-abortion group last year triggered a controversy about the sale of fetal\u000atissue. Planned Parenthood maintains the footage was edited and denied any\u000aimproper activity.READ: Paul Ryan's 2016 plans start with Obamacare repeal\u000avoteRyan conceded that the bill wouldn't move beyond Congress, but argued the\u000avote was part of an effort this year to show a contrast with Democrats."The\u000apeople deserve a truly patient-centered health care system, and ultimately --\u000aultimately, this is going to require a Republican president. That's why our\u000atop priority in 2016 is going to be offering the country a clear choice with a\u000abold pro-growth agenda," Ryan said at a press conference before Wednesday's\u000avote.Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell released a statement\u000aafter the House approved the measure, touting the "unprecedented demand" for\u000acoverage under the open enrollment process underway now for 2016."As I travel\u000athe country, I consistently hear Americans say that they want Washington to\u000abuild on the progress we have made to increase access to coverage, drive down\u000athe growth of health costs and improve the quality of care. Unfortunately,\u000atoday's partisan effort in the House of Representatives to repeal key parts of\u000athe ACA, along with its effective defunding of Planned Parenthood, does the\u000aopposite," Burwell said.But House Republicans said voters in their districts\u000acomplain about the cost of the law."Over and over again, people at home tell\u000aus that their insurance has become too expensive to use. Premiums escalated by\u000adouble digits in a single year, copayments and deductibles have likewise\u000arisen. People are learning that simply having an Obamacare insurance card is\u000anot the same as actual access to affordable healthcare," Rep Marsha Blackburn\u000aof Tennessee said.One Democrat taunted the GOP for again voting on a measure\u000ato roll back the law, but still not having a plan to replace it, reminding\u000athem they promised to do so five years ago. "You came up with nothing --\u000anothing! Rep Jim McGovern, D-Massachusetts, said to House Republicans on the\u000aHouse floor, asking them, "Is it hidden in some secret room in the Capitol?\u000aMaybe Donald Trump has it. Perhaps we should alert the Capitol Police or\u000abetter yet, maybe we should call the FBI to help locate the Republican plan on\u000ahealthcare."Ryan told reporters that the GOP would talk about the details of\u000aan alternative health care bill at their retreat in Baltimore next week to\u000aplan the rest of the 2016 legislative agenda.Rep Ben Ray Lujan, the Chair of\u000athe House Democrats' campaign committee, argued the vote would hurt the GOP\u000awith key groups in the election this fall."It's 2016 and House Republicans are\u000astill tightly bound to their old, failed playbook, which not only puts the\u000ahealth of millions of Americans at risk, but also threatens Republicans'\u000astanding with women, Latinos and other important groups of voters this\u000aelection year."\u000a\u000a

VWashington (CNN)The GOP-controlled House of Representatives on Wednesday\u000aafternoon passed legislation that would repeal Obamacare, and after more than\u000a60 votes to roll back all or part of the law, the bill dismantle it will\u000afinally get to the President's desk.But it won't stay there long; President\u000aBarack Obama has vowed to veto any Republican bill that guts his signature\u000ahealth care law, a five-year-and-counting effort.The vote was 240-181, largely\u000aalong party lines.The Senate passed the legislation last month, using a budget\u000amechanism known as "reconciliation" to overcome a Democratic filibuster. House\u000aSpeaker Paul Ryan has told members he will hold an "enrollment ceremony"\u000aThursday to sign the bill before sending it off to the White House.The measure\u000awould also bar any federal money for Planned Parenthood, something\u000aconservatives in Congress vowed to do after a series of videos released by an\u000aanti-abortion group last year triggered a controversy about the sale of fetal\u000atissue. Planned Parenthood maintains the footage was edited and denied any\u000aimproper activity.READ: Paul Ryan's 2016 plans start with Obamacare repeal\u000avoteRyan conceded that the bill wouldn't move beyond Congress, but argued the\u000avote was part of an effort this year to show a contrast with Democrats."The\u000apeople deserve a truly patient-centered health care system, and ultimately --\u000aultimately, this is going to require a Republican president. That's why our\u000atop priority in 2016 is going to be offering the country a clear choice with a\u000abold pro-growth agenda," Ryan said at a press conference before Wednesday's\u000avote.Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell released a statement\u000aafter the House approved the measure, touting the "unprecedented demand" for\u000acoverage under the open enrollment process underway now for 2016."As I travel\u000athe country, I consistently hear Americans say that they want Washington to\u000abuild on the progress we have made to increase access to coverage, drive down\u000athe growth of health costs and improve the quality of care. Unfortunately,\u000atoday's partisan effort in the House of Representatives to repeal key parts of\u000athe ACA, along with its effective defunding of Planned Parenthood, does the\u000aopposite," Burwell said.But House Republicans said voters in their districts\u000acomplain about the cost of the law."Over and over again, people at home tell\u000aus that their insurance has become too expensive to use. Premiums escalated by\u000adouble digits in a single year, copayments and deductibles have likewise\u000arisen. People are learning that simply having an Obamacare insurance card is\u000anot the same as actual access to affordable healthcare," Rep Marsha Blackburn\u000aof Tennessee said.One Democrat taunted the GOP for again voting on a measure\u000ato roll back the law, but still not having a plan to replace it, reminding\u000athem they promised to do so five years ago. "You came up with nothing --\u000anothing! Rep Jim McGovern, D-Massachusetts, said to House Republicans on the\u000aHouse floor, asking them, "Is it hidden in some secret room in the Capitol?\u000aMaybe Donald Trump has it. Perhaps we should alert the Capitol Police or\u000abetter yet, maybe we should call the FBI to help locate the Republican plan on\u000ahealthcare."Ryan told reporters that the GOP would talk about the details of\u000aan alternative health care bill at their retreat in Baltimore next week to\u000aplan the rest of the 2016 legislative agenda.Rep Ben Ray Lujan, the Chair of\u000athe House Democrats' campaign committee, argued the vote would hurt the GOP\u000awith key groups in the election this fall."It's 2016 and House Republicans are\u000astill tightly bound to their old, failed playbook, which not only puts the\u000ahealth of millions of Americans at risk, but also threatens Republicans'\u000astanding with women, Latinos and other important groups of voters this\u000aelection year."\u000a\u000a

VWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama will meet with Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch\u000aon Monday to discuss what he can do to curb gun violence, sidestepping an\u000aentrenched Congress.In his first weekly radio address of the new year on\u000aFriday, Mr. Obama said he would talk to Ms. Lynch after a monthslong\u000aexamination of the measures he can take on his own to halt what he called \u201cour\u000aepidemic of gun violence.\u201dRecalling the 2012 school shooting in Newtown,\u000aConn., that killed 26 people \u2014 20 of them children \u2014 and left many grimly\u000ahopeful it would lead to an overhaul of the nation\u2019s gun laws, the president\u000aaccused lawmakers of bowing to the gun lobby and blocking necessary\u000achanges.\u201cAll across America, survivors of gun violence and those who lost a\u000achild, a parent, a spouse to gun violence are forced to mark such awful\u000aanniversaries every single day,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd yet Congress still\u000ahasn\u2019t done anything to prevent what happened to them from happening to other\u000afamilies.\u201dThe speech was an explicit return to a theme that Mr. Obama has\u000aplayed down in the wake of terrorist attacks that killed 130 people on Nov. 13\u000ain Paris and 14 more on Dec. 2 in San Bernardino, Calif., both of which were\u000ainspired by Islamic extremism. While Mr. Obama\u2019s initial response to the San\u000aBernardino attack emphasized its commonality with other mass shootings and the\u000aneed for gun restrictions, the administration soon realized that this message\u000awas failing to reassure Americans that he was taking seriously enough the\u000athreat from Islamic extremism and the Islamic State.So through much of\u000aDecember, Mr. Obama engaged in public events to convince Americans that his\u000aadministration was doing everything it could to battle the Islamic State. For\u000asome Americans, being vigilant against Islamic extremism involves having more\u000aguns, not fewer, and sales of guns surged in the wake of the San Bernardino\u000aattack.The administration sees such a response as counterproductive not only\u000abecause the number of deaths from gun suicides and routine shootings is far\u000agreater than those from terrorist attacks, but also because the availability\u000aof weapons here makes such attacks far easier to conduct. Rather than fight\u000aboth the anxiety about Islamic extremism and the need for more gun\u000arestrictions at the same time, Mr. Obama focused on calming the nation.Now, a\u000amonth after the San Bernardino attacks, Mr. Obama has decided that he can\u000areturn to his focus on gun measures. \u201cBecause I get too many letters from\u000aparents, and teachers, and kids, to sit around and do nothing,\u201d Mr. Obama said\u000ain his speech Friday.A bipartisan effort in 2013 to bolster gun control\u000ameasures after the Newtown shootings was halted in the Senate, failing to\u000agarner the 60 votes needed to expand background checks and to ban assault\u000aweapons and high-capacity magazines.Facing the reality that lawmakers are\u000aunlikely to strengthen the country\u2019s gun laws anytime soon, the administration\u000ahas been looking at ways Mr. Obama can tighten gun sales unilaterally,\u000afocusing in particular on who could be considered a high-volume dealer for an\u000aexecutive action that could expand background checks.But White House officials\u000ahave said there are many political and legal challenges to doing so,\u000apotentially opening up Mr. Obama to renewed criticism that he is abusing his\u000aauthority.The president\u2019s announcement comes less than two weeks before his\u000afinal State of the Union speech on Jan. 12, addressing \u201cone piece of\u000aunfinished business,\u201d as he called it on Friday.\u000a\u000a

VSAN BERNARDINO, Calif. \u2014 The fear comes up in discussions in line at the\u000amovies, where a group of mothers say there are too many guns on the streets\u000afor them to feel safe. For others, the mass shooting that killed 14 people\u000ahere last month has prompted a rush to buy a gun for the first time, suddenly\u000aconvincing them that only a firearm can protect them.But on one point, many\u000apeople here seem to be in agreement: President Obama\u2019s latest plan to expand\u000abackground checks and law enforcement for some gun sales would do little to\u000astop mass shootings of the kind that shattered this city\u2019s sense of\u000asecurity.\u201cI\u2019m now considering getting a gun,\u201d said Dondi Abarca, 43, a county\u000aemployee. \u201cTimes are changing, and there are these situations that are\u000ahappening.\u201dIn a city as diverse as this one, opinions on guns run the\u000agamut.Like many other county employees, Trish Munoz was personally affected by\u000athe murders here. She knew one of the victims of the massacre \u2014 and one of the\u000aattackers, Syed Rizwan Farook, who worked as a county health inspector.But\u000aoutside a memorial service on Monday commemorating the shooting, Ms. Munoz,\u000a44, scowled at the mention of Mr. Obama\u2019s plan, which includes a requirement\u000athat anyone who makes a living selling firearms register as a licensed gun\u000adealer and conduct background checks.\u201cIt violates our constitutional rights,\u201d\u000aMs. Munoz said. \u201cAnd it distracts from what the real problems are.\u201d No gun\u000alaws could have stopped the attack, she said, and certainly not the ones the\u000apresident is proposing.Across town, Catherine Barragan, 49, said gun control\u000ahad been a frequent topic of discussion with her friends over the last month.\u000aShe applauded the president\u2019s efforts, adding that she would support getting\u000aall guns off the streets.\u201cThere are too many loopholes,\u201d Ms. Barragan, an\u000aadministrator at a car auction, said.But she agreed that the latest measures\u000awould not be enough to prevent another major attack. \u201cIt won\u2019t prevent\u000asomething like what happened,\u201d she said.This week, the office where the Dec. 2\u000ashooting took place reopened, a milestone in San Bernardino\u2019s efforts to\u000aresume life as normal. But as Mr. Obama spoke on Tuesday and listed the mass\u000ashootings during his tenure \u2014 suggesting his resolve to try to slow, if not\u000astop, the barrage \u2014 reminders of the attack here remained hard to avoid.At the\u000acorner outside the reopened office, a makeshift memorial of flags and flowers\u000acommemorates the victims. And the area where the two attackers \u2014 Mr. Farook\u000aand his wife, Tashfeen Malik \u2014 were ultimately killed is scarred by bullet\u000aholes after a shootout with the police in which hundreds of rounds were\u000afired.Jim Mulvihill, a city councilman, said many in the community were still\u000atrying to figure out why the attack had happened here.Mr. Mulvihill said he\u000abelieved the president\u2019s gun control measures did not go far enough; an\u000aoutright ban on assault weapons might have made a difference in the attack\u000alast month, he said, but there would have been no way to keep legal weapons\u000aout of Mr. Farook\u2019s and Ms. Malik\u2019s hands.\u201cIt\u2019s a young married couple with a\u000ababy, a good job,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere\u2019s the tip-off?\u201dBut Mr. Mulvihill said this\u000aarea had responded like much of the country, which has had a surge in firearm\u000asales over the last month. \u201cThere has been a run on gun shops here,\u201d he\u000asaid.One of those considering buying a gun for the first time was Robert\u000aGonzalez. He denounced the president\u2019s executive order as an encroachment on\u000athe Second Amendment that would do little to prevent gun violence.\u201cI want a\u000agun,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez, 34, said, adding that he now felt he needed one to keep\u000ahis family safe. \u201cI\u2019ll probably have to hurry up and try to get one fast\u000anow.\u201dHenry Nickel, another city councilman, said residents\u2019 concerns about\u000asecurity had a number of potential causes. But the surge in demand for guns,\u000ahe said, reflects a nationwide loss of confidence that the government will\u000aprotect people.\u201cOur city has endured some very difficult times: We\u2019re going\u000athrough bankruptcy, escalating crime, dwindling police,\u201d Mr. Nickel said.\u000a\u201cPeople are doing what they can to make sure they are properly defending\u000athemselves.\u201dWhile Ms. Abarca, the county employee, was considering buying a\u000agun, she said she supported the president\u2019s executive order because she did\u000anot see it as an infringement on her own right to own a firearm \u2014 a testament\u000ato just how modest many gun control opponents consider the move. \u201cThose who\u000asell them should definitely be regulated,\u201d she said.She added, however, that\u000amore access to guns, not more restrictions, might halt the run of mass\u000ashootings in recent years that the president talked about during his speech on\u000aTuesday.\u201cIt being a gun-free zone may not have been a smart choice,\u201d she said\u000aof the Inland Regional Center, where the shooting took place.For advocates of\u000agun control, the prospect of even greater access to guns was frightening.At\u000athe city library Tuesday morning, Rose Rangel, 58, said tougher background\u000achecks could stop some mass shootings, even if they might not have stopped the\u000aone here.\u201cMaybe it would be harder to just go out there and start shooting,\u201d\u000ashe said. \u201cThere are so many guns out there. We don\u2019t even know who they\u000abelong to.\u201dMs. Barragan, the auction administrator, said she did not think\u000amore background checks would have much effect. At least as afraid of the day-\u000ato-day violence in this city as of another mass shooting, she said she wanted\u000ato find a way to get rid of more guns.\u201cIf everybody carries a gun, people are\u000astill fighting in the street,\u201d Ms. Barragan said. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy for the wrong\u000aperson to get one.\u201d\u000a\u000a

VALEXANDRIA, Va. \u2014 With President Obama poised to act on his own authority to\u000atry to stem gun violence, his gun control allies are using big-money donors\u000aand shifting tactics to try to remake the political landscape in the national\u000agun debate, challenging and sometimes even besting the powerful National Rifle\u000aAssociation in state-by-state battles.The newfound momentum reflects a\u000astrategy to steer clear of a Republican-led Congress that has proved unwilling\u000ato touch existing federal gun laws after years of intense lobbying on both\u000asides of the debate.With tens of millions of dollars to spend thanks to\u000abackers like Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, gun control\u000agroups have secured a number of surprising recent successes in Connecticut,\u000aDelaware and elsewhere. And they are now looking to state and local officials\u000ato win approval for tougher background checks and other measures from Nevada\u000ato Maine.The N.R.A. remains the dominant force in much of the country,\u000aspending more than $32.5 million last year on campaigns and lobbying. It has\u000ashown continued muscle in stopping new restrictions and loosening existing\u000aones in many localities. But the political landscape has become more hotly\u000acontested as a result of the gun control groups\u2019 shift in focus and infusion\u000aof cash, operatives on both sides say. The axiom that gun control is a losing\u000apolitical issue does not always hold true anymore.\u201cThe money was almost\u000aexclusively on the pro-gun side of the fence before, and we were always\u000aaccused of spending our way to victory,\u201d said Richard Feldman, a former N.R.A.\u000aexecutive who leads the Independent Firearms Owners Association. \u201cNow the\u000aother side has these resources from Michael Bloomberg to get involved in these\u000astate and local races, something they didn\u2019t have before.\u201dThe organization\u000aEverytown for Gun Safety \u2014 which received $36 million in contributions last\u000ayear, with the biggest chunk coming from Mr. Bloomberg \u2014 has eclipsed a number\u000aof older gun control groups in publicity and influence. In its latest push,\u000athe group is funding an ad campaign for players from the National Basketball\u000aAssociation to speak out against gun violence.The group, created in 2014 after\u000athe slaughter in 2012 of 26 children and adults at an elementary school in\u000aNewtown, Conn., says its supporters have now grown to three million\u000anationwide, including survivors of shootings, mayors, police officers,\u000acelebrities, and rank-and-file supporters. It has chapters in all 50 states,\u000awith registered lobbyists in 31 of them, adopting a structure used to great\u000aeffectiveness by the N.R.A. itself. Mr. Bloomberg has pledged to spend at\u000aleast $50 million of his own money in the group\u2019s push for tougher gun\u000arestrictions \u2014 a level of spending that Jennifer Baker, an N.R.A. official,\u000acalled \u201cobscene.\u201dIn some races, gun control advocates are outspending the\u000adeep-pocketed N.R.A. And after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.,\u000aand earlier rampages at a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado, a community\u000acollege in Oregon and a church in Charleston, S.C., gun control advocates said\u000athey planned to expand their push for stiffer local restrictions still\u000afurther. They believe their cause was buoyed last month when the Supreme Court\u000alet stand an ordinance in a Chicago suburb that bans semiautomatic assault\u000aweapons.Mr. Obama is expected to move ahead as soon as this week with a series\u000aof executive actions modifying federal gun laws. On Tuesday, gun control\u000aactivists are expected to gather at the White House to discuss possible\u000aaction, and on Thursday \u2014 a day before the fifth anniversary of the shooting\u000aof former Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona \u2014 he will participate\u000ain a town-hall-style meeting on gun violence that will be shown on CNN. But\u000athe measures he is considering would be a modest tweaking of the law compared\u000awith the more sweeping changes that gun control groups are pushing for at the\u000astate and local levels.The growing importance of state gun laws was made clear\u000alast month when Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut announced that he would\u000aact on his own to bar anyone on the government\u2019s terrorism watch lists from\u000abuying a gun. Congress refused to take that step nationwide.Mr. Malloy, a\u000aDemocrat, said in a telephone interview that afterward, other governors\u000alooking to follow his lead on the issue had contacted him.Changing gun\u000apolicies \u201cis easier to do on a state-by-state basis than it is on a national\u000alevel, because Congress is gerrymandered to such an extent,\u201d Mr. Malloy\u000asaid.Gun control supporters gained another big win in Virginia last month when\u000athe state\u2019s attorney general, Mark R. Herring, a Democrat, barred anyone who\u000aholds a concealed-handgun permit in 25 other states from using it to carry a\u000afirearm in Virginia.Virginia, despite its reputation as a pro-gun state, also\u000aproduced a victory for gun control supporters last month when Jeremy McPike, a\u000aDemocrat from suburban Washington and a political novice running on a gun\u000acontrol platform, was elected to the State Senate. Mr. McPike\u2019s campaign was\u000ahelped by $1.5 million from Everytown. The group blanketed the area with ads\u000apromoting Mr. McPike\u2019s record on gun control, and he was elected despite an F\u000agrade from the N.R.A.\u201cIt takes muscle to counteract the muscle of the N.R.A.,\u201d\u000ahe said in an interview.Mr. McPike grew up in a family of hunters, and as a\u000avolunteer firefighter he said many of his colleagues were vocal gun-rights\u000aadvocates. But his views have been shaped by his own history: He said he\u000aremembered responding to an emergency call for a teenager who had accidentally\u000ashot himself in the groin, and he said his brother had committed suicide at\u000athe age of 16 with a family gun.\u201cAt some point, you can\u2019t sit on the sidelines\u000aanymore,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to find a way to effect change.\u201dIn the closing\u000aweeks of his race and two other campaigns in Virginia that hinged on guns, the\u000aN.R.A. and gun control groups all sent people to the local districts to rally\u000avoters. Candidates backed by the N.R.A. won both of the other races, helping\u000aRepublicans hold a majority in the State Senate. The N.R.A. saw the results as\u000aa rebuke of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s organization.\u201cThey got their butts kicked in\u000aVirginia,\u201d Ms. Baker said. \u201cYou spend all that money, and all you have to show\u000afor it is one win? That\u2019s complete and utter failure.\u201dGun control advocates\u000ahave not given up on Washington completely. They have met repeatedly with\u000aWhite House officials to urge Mr. Obama to issue an executive order to tighten\u000asome gun measures, and the president will meet with Attorney General Loretta\u000aE. Lynch and the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, on Monday to discuss his\u000aoptions. He is limited in what he can do, however, and the advocates see their\u000abest chance for change at the state level \u2014 particularly in pushing ballot\u000ainitiatives that put gun control questions to voters.The shift away from\u000aWashington is rooted in Congress\u2019s rejection in 2013 of expanded background\u000achecks that were proposed in the wake of the shootings in Newtown.Mr. Obama\u000asaid the failure to pass gun control legislation after the Connecticut tragedy\u000awas one of the biggest disappointments of his presidency, and gun control\u000aadvocates said the jolt from that rejection made them realize that changes\u000awere all but impossible in Congress.After that defeat, \u201cwe took a step back,\u000aand we realized we had to go state by state,\u201d said John Feinblatt, the\u000apresident of the Everytown group.Everytown\u2019s big footprint, however, worries\u000aeven some fellow gun control advocates. They say some local officials in\u000aMassachusetts, Rhode Island and elsewhere have resented the perception of a\u000ahigh-profile, billionaire liberal like Mr. Bloomberg trying to change their\u000agun laws.\u201cI see them as a lightning rod,\u201d said an official with another gun\u000acontrol group, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of concerns\u000aabout alienating supporters. \u201cThey\u2019re stirring up this opposition, and the\u000aN.R.A. as a result is putting more resources into its state strategy.\u201dMr.\u000aFeinblatt said Everytown was changing the nature of the debate. He likened the\u000afocus on the states to the push for same-sex marriage, which began with a\u000asmall number of states approving it before the Supreme Court struck down the\u000aDefense of Marriage Act in 2013 and it spread more quickly.The strategy\u000acarries risks. The N.R.A. has five million members and boasts of a political\u000abase that is willing to turn out at the polls for a single issue: gun\u000acontrol.With policies varying from one jurisdiction to the next, each side has\u000aa scorecard of victories to show why it believes it is winning the debate.The\u000aN.R.A. points to 95 bills passed last year nationwide that it considers\u000afavorable to gun enthusiasts and hunters.Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s group can point to\u000alaws passed in nine states last year to keep guns out of the hands of domestic\u000aabusers, the defeat of numerous bills that would have facilitated concealed-\u000acarry permits and, most critically, approval of a measure that expanded\u000abackground checks in Oregon. It was the sixth state to pass a background check\u000ameasure after the shootings in Newtown, and the 18th over all.In Delaware,\u000aGov. Jack Markell, a Democrat, signed a measure in October aimed at keeping\u000aguns out of the hands of domestic abusers; it was personally pushed by Ms.\u000aGiffords, who started a gun safety group after she was shot in the head in a\u000amass shooting in 2011.In Michigan, Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, vowed in\u000aNovember to veto \u2014 for a second time \u2014 a hotly debated bill that would allow\u000apermit-holders to carry concealed weapons in schools.The next big battleground\u000ais Nevada, where a record number of signatures set up a vote this year on an\u000ainitiative to impose a statewide background check. After that on the list of\u000atargets is Maine, where gun control advocates say they are confident they will\u000asoon have enough signatures to get a background check initiative on the state\u000aballot.N.R.A. officials say they are not worried.\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d Ms.\u000aBaker said. \u201cWe know they\u2019re going to spend a lot of money, but I don\u2019t see\u000aany groundswell of support.\u201d\u000a\u000a

VSAN BERNARDINO, Calif. \u2014 The fear comes up in discussions in line at the\u000amovies, where a group of mothers say there are too many guns on the streets\u000afor them to feel safe. For others, the mass shooting that killed 14 people\u000ahere last month has prompted a rush to buy a gun for the first time, suddenly\u000aconvincing them that only a firearm can protect them.But on one point, many\u000apeople here seem to be in agreement: President Obama\u2019s latest plan to expand\u000abackground checks and law enforcement for some gun sales would do little to\u000astop mass shootings of the kind that shattered this city\u2019s sense of\u000asecurity.\u201cI\u2019m now considering getting a gun,\u201d said Dondi Abarca, 43, a county\u000aemployee. \u201cTimes are changing, and there are these situations that are\u000ahappening.\u201dIn a city as diverse as this one, opinions on guns run the\u000agamut.Like many other county employees, Trish Munoz was personally affected by\u000athe murders here. She knew one of the victims of the massacre \u2014 and one of the\u000aattackers, Syed Rizwan Farook, who worked as a county health inspector.But\u000aoutside a memorial service on Monday commemorating the shooting, Ms. Munoz,\u000a44, scowled at the mention of Mr. Obama\u2019s plan, which includes a requirement\u000athat anyone who makes a living selling firearms register as a licensed gun\u000adealer and conduct background checks.\u201cIt violates our constitutional rights,\u201d\u000aMs. Munoz said. \u201cAnd it distracts from what the real problems are.\u201d No gun\u000alaws could have stopped the attack, she said, and certainly not the ones the\u000apresident is proposing.Across town, Catherine Barragan, 49, said gun control\u000ahad been a frequent topic of discussion with her friends over the last month.\u000aShe applauded the president\u2019s efforts, adding that she would support getting\u000aall guns off the streets.\u201cThere are too many loopholes,\u201d Ms. Barragan, an\u000aadministrator at a car auction, said.But she agreed that the latest measures\u000awould not be enough to prevent another major attack. \u201cIt won\u2019t prevent\u000asomething like what happened,\u201d she said.This week, the office where the Dec. 2\u000ashooting took place reopened, a milestone in San Bernardino\u2019s efforts to\u000aresume life as normal. But as Mr. Obama spoke on Tuesday and listed the mass\u000ashootings during his tenure \u2014 suggesting his resolve to try to slow, if not\u000astop, the barrage \u2014 reminders of the attack here remained hard to avoid.At the\u000acorner outside the reopened office, a makeshift memorial of flags and flowers\u000acommemorates the victims. And the area where the two attackers \u2014 Mr. Farook\u000aand his wife, Tashfeen Malik \u2014 were ultimately killed is scarred by bullet\u000aholes after a shootout with the police in which hundreds of rounds were\u000afired.Jim Mulvihill, a city councilman, said many in the community were still\u000atrying to figure out why the attack had happened here.Mr. Mulvihill said he\u000abelieved the president\u2019s gun control measures did not go far enough; an\u000aoutright ban on assault weapons might have made a difference in the attack\u000alast month, he said, but there would have been no way to keep legal weapons\u000aout of Mr. Farook\u2019s and Ms. Malik\u2019s hands.\u201cIt\u2019s a young married couple with a\u000ababy, a good job,\u201d he said. \u201cWhere\u2019s the tip-off?\u201dBut Mr. Mulvihill said this\u000aarea had responded like much of the country, which has had a surge in firearm\u000asales over the last month. \u201cThere has been a run on gun shops here,\u201d he\u000asaid.One of those considering buying a gun for the first time was Robert\u000aGonzalez. He denounced the president\u2019s executive order as an encroachment on\u000athe Second Amendment that would do little to prevent gun violence.\u201cI want a\u000agun,\u201d Mr. Gonzalez, 34, said, adding that he now felt he needed one to keep\u000ahis family safe. \u201cI\u2019ll probably have to hurry up and try to get one fast\u000anow.\u201dHenry Nickel, another city councilman, said residents\u2019 concerns about\u000asecurity had a number of potential causes. But the surge in demand for guns,\u000ahe said, reflects a nationwide loss of confidence that the government will\u000aprotect people.\u201cOur city has endured some very difficult times: We\u2019re going\u000athrough bankruptcy, escalating crime, dwindling police,\u201d Mr. Nickel said.\u000a\u201cPeople are doing what they can to make sure they are properly defending\u000athemselves.\u201dWhile Ms. Abarca, the county employee, was considering buying a\u000agun, she said she supported the president\u2019s executive order because she did\u000anot see it as an infringement on her own right to own a firearm \u2014 a testament\u000ato just how modest many gun control opponents consider the move. \u201cThose who\u000asell them should definitely be regulated,\u201d she said.She added, however, that\u000amore access to guns, not more restrictions, might halt the run of mass\u000ashootings in recent years that the president talked about during his speech on\u000aTuesday.\u201cIt being a gun-free zone may not have been a smart choice,\u201d she said\u000aof the Inland Regional Center, where the shooting took place.For advocates of\u000agun control, the prospect of even greater access to guns was frightening.At\u000athe city library Tuesday morning, Rose Rangel, 58, said tougher background\u000achecks could stop some mass shootings, even if they might not have stopped the\u000aone here.\u201cMaybe it would be harder to just go out there and start shooting,\u201d\u000ashe said. \u201cThere are so many guns out there. We don\u2019t even know who they\u000abelong to.\u201dMs. Barragan, the auction administrator, said she did not think\u000amore background checks would have much effect. At least as afraid of the day-\u000ato-day violence in this city as of another mass shooting, she said she wanted\u000ato find a way to get rid of more guns.\u201cIf everybody carries a gun, people are\u000astill fighting in the street,\u201d Ms. Barragan said. \u201cIt\u2019s too easy for the wrong\u000aperson to get one.\u201d\u000a\u000a

VIn the continuing debate over how to stop mass killings in the United States,\u000aAustralia has become a familiar touchstone.President Obama has cited  the\u000acountry\u2019s gun laws as a model for the United States, calling Australia a\u000anation \u201clike ours.\u201d On the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton has said the\u000aAustralian approach is \u201cworth considering.\u201d The National Rifle Association has\u000adismissed the policies, contending that they \u201crobbed Australians of their\u000aright to self-defense and empowered criminals\u201d without reducing violent\u000acrime.The oft-cited statistic in Australia is a simple one: There have been no\u000amass killings \u2014 defined by experts there as a gunman killing five or more\u000apeople besides himself \u2014 since the nation significantly tightened its gun\u000acontrol laws almost 20 years ago.Mass shootings in Australia were rare anyway.\u000aBut after a gunman massacred 35 people in the Tasmanian town of Port Arthur in\u000a1996, a public outcry spurred a national consensus to severely restrict\u000afirearms. The tightened laws, which were standardized across Australia, are\u000amore stringent than those of any state in the United States, including\u000aCalifornia.Pushed through by John Howard, the conservative prime minister at\u000athe time, the National Firearms Agreement prohibited automatic and\u000asemiautomatic assault rifles and pump shotguns in all but unusual cases. It\u000atightened licensing rules, established a 28-day waiting period for gun\u000apurchases, created a national gun registry and instituted a temporary buyback\u000aprogram that removed more than 20 percent of firearms from public\u000acirculation.Several of the measures, including waiting periods and background\u000achecks, have been adopted piecemeal by different states in America. But the\u000aUnited States has never tried a national gun buyback program; in Australia,\u000athat required raising taxes. And the United States has never been able to do\u000awhat Mr. Howard did: forge a broad agreement on a sweeping set of gun control\u000ameasures that applies to the entire nation.A test of those laws came in\u000aDecember 2014, when a gunman who had expressed sympathy for Islamic extremism\u000atook hostages in a cafe in Sydney. The assailant, Man Haron Monis, brandished\u000aa sawed-off pump action shotgun that he had obtained illegally.An inquest said\u000athe gun may have been in circulation before pump action shotguns were\u000aessentially banned in 1996 and was never confiscated in the buyback. According\u000ato the inquest, his shells were 15 to 20 years old.During the 17-hour siege of\u000athe cafe, Mr. Monis fired several times, once into a wall, before killing the\u000acafe manager. At that point, the police stormed in, killing the gunman and\u000aanother hostage in the crossfire.It is impossible to say whether gun\u000arestrictions saved lives in the siege, but some politicians say they believe\u000aso.\u201cIt is the ready availability of weapons, particularly those that are\u000aautomatic or semiautomatic, that increases the likelihood that people in a\u000amoment of madness, or malice, or hatred, will kill a lot of people,\u201d Mr.\u000aHoward said in October, after a man opened fire on a community college campus\u000ain Oregon, killing nine.Measuring the broad effectiveness of Australia\u2019s gun\u000acontrol laws is complicated. Australians themselves continue to debate their\u000aimpact, and some have sought to loosen restrictions on gun ownership.Critics\u000ahave argued that gun violence was falling in Australia before 1996 and would\u000ahave continued to fall even without the gun control measures. Others have\u000asuggested that even as gun-related deaths fell, people in Australia may have\u000aresorted to using other weapons to kill.To assess these claims, scholars have\u000aexamined not just mass shootings, but also all intentional deaths caused by\u000afirearms, adjusting for population growth.Total intentional gun deaths fell by\u000ahalf in the decade after the 1996 restrictions were put in place, even as\u000aAustralia\u2019s population grew nearly 14 percent. The rate of gun suicides per\u000a100,000 people dropped 65 percent from 1995 to 2006, and the rate of gun\u000ahomicides fell 59 percent, according to a 2010 study by Andrew Leigh of\u000aAustralian National University and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier\u000aUniversity.When the data in that study is updated to include the latest\u000afigures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as well as the numbers going\u000aback to 1968, several facts emerge.First, the rates of intentional firearm\u000adeaths were substantially higher in the 28 years before the gun control\u000ameasures were adopted in 1996 than in the 17 years after. How much of that\u000adecline can be attributed to the new policies can be debated, but the\u000adifference is clear.Second, the initial drop in firearm deaths in the decade\u000aafter the 1996 restrictions were enacted appears to have leveled off. In 2013,\u000athe most recent year for which figures are available, there were 200 gun-\u000arelated homicides and suicides, for a rate of 0.87 deaths per 100,000\u000aresidents. That is up slightly from the low in 2005, when 0.82 deaths per\u000a100,000 residents were recorded, but still far below the 2.71 deaths per\u000a100,000 residents in 1996.The data confirms that gun deaths were already\u000afalling before the National Firearms Agreement. The rate of intentional gun\u000adeaths fell about 33 percent from 1986 to 1996. The decline accelerated,\u000ahowever, under the new gun control measures, with the rate dropping about 60\u000apercent from 1996 to 2006.The impact of the gun laws is difficult to assess\u000apartly because of the low rates of intentional firearms deaths in Australia.\u000aGun-related homicide rates are even lower, because suicides make up about 80\u000apercent of all gun deaths. Looking at gun-related suicides and homicides\u000aseparately shows similar trends \u2014 higher rates of both before 1996 than after,\u000adeclines in the decade before 1996 but sharper declines in the decade after,\u000aand a leveling off in recent years.Mr. Leigh and Ms. Neill tried to measure\u000athe effect of the 1996 measures across Australian states and territories to\u000asee whether different levels of gun confiscation led to different results.\u000aThey found that the places where the most guns were removed from public\u000acirculation also experienced the largest drops in intentional gun deaths.The\u000aimpact of the buyback appeared more pronounced on suicides.\u201cFirearm suicides\u000afell more in states that had more guns bought back than in states with fewer\u000aguns bought back,\u201d Ms. Neill said in an email. \u201cFirearm homicides also fell\u000amore in states with more guns bought back, but the effect was smaller than for\u000afirearm suicides.\u201dThe data also indicates that overall homicide and suicide\u000arates fell in the decade after 1996, meaning Australians did not respond to\u000athe gun control measures by killing one another or themselves using other\u000aweapons at higher rates.Over all, Mr. Leigh and Ms. Neill estimate that at\u000aleast 200 lives are saved annually because of Australia\u2019s gun buyback\u000aprogram.The introduction to the Australian market this year of a shotgun that\u000aallows rapid fire using a lever action rekindled debate over the restrictions,\u000awith some enthusiasts arguing that they felt cheated out of owning a gun. The\u000agovernment banned a version of the shotgun that holds seven rounds but\u000aapproved a five-round version. There are also efforts to lower the legal age\u000aof supervised shooters in Tasmania, to 15 from 16.Senator David Leyonhjelm,\u000awho supports easing gun controls, said Australia resembled Britain, Canada and\u000aNew Zealand, where mass shootings are infrequent. \u201cAmerica is an outlier,\u201d he\u000asaid. \u201cWe are not like America.\u201dIn the 18 years before the Port Arthur\u000amassacre, there were 12 mass shootings in Australia, according to a 2006 study\u000ain the journal Injury Prevention. The deadliest shooting since 1996 occurred\u000alast year, when a farmer in New South Wales fatally shot his wife and three\u000achildren before killing himself.Tasmania\u2019s former premier, Tony Rundle, said\u000areaching the 1996 agreement was difficult and warned against revising it. \u201cI\u000atold people all over the country, in town hall meetings, we don\u2019t want to go\u000adown the path that America has traveled,\u201d said Mr. Rundle, who is now retired.\u000a\u201cEroding those laws now, chipping away at the edges, would be a folly.\u201dMr.\u000aHoward, the prime minister who pushed through the measures, agreed. \u201cThere\u000ashould be no relaxation, complacency or compromise,\u201d he said in an interview.\u000a\u201cThat is the view of people all around Australia.\u201d\u000a\u000a

VThe United States sure knows how to throw cold water on international\u000aharmony.Just two months have passed since the world\u2019s top diplomats cobbled\u000atogether the best plan we\u2019ve ever had to start curbing emissions of heat-\u000atrapping greenhouse gases. Yet already the Supreme Court of the United States\u000asaid no, delaying much of the Obama administration\u2019s strategy to deliver\u000aAmerica\u2019s contribution to the collective effort.The White House claims it will\u000aprevail, assuring a fidgety international community it will deliver on the\u000apromises made at the climate meeting in Paris in December. Those commitments\u000aproved critical to keeping the diplomacy on track and ultimately producing a\u000adeal among more than 185 countries representing more than 98 percent of global\u000aemissions.And yet the Supreme Court\u2019s temporary stay of the administration\u2019s\u000aClean Power Plan \u2014 the last decision of global consequence of the right-\u000aleaning court on which Justice Antonin Scalia had sat since the Reagan\u000aadministration \u2014 underscores just how far the United States remains from its\u000aclimate goals.Consider the administration\u2019s own assessments. Even as the\u000aAmerican delegation in Paris offered to cut emissions to 26 to 28 percent\u000abelow their 2005 levels by 2025, the Energy Information Administration of the\u000aDepartment of Energy was offering a different outlook.Its reference case,\u000abased on federal policies on the books at the end of 2014, forecast that\u000aemissions of carbon dioxide from energy use (the United States\u2019 main source of\u000agreenhouse gases) would not decline but remain flat through 2025 and\u000abeyond.Methane emissions, which account for under 10 percent of greenhouse\u000agases spewed into the atmosphere but trap much more heat than CO2, could\u000aincrease 6 percent over the next 10 years, according to the Environmental\u000aProtection Agency. Emissions of highly potent hydrofluorocarbons could\u000aincrease by half.What\u2019s more, the carbon storage of American forests, which\u000aoffset as much as 13 percent of the nation\u2019s total greenhouse gas emissions in\u000a2013, could start declining as early as 2020.These, of course, are not\u000aforecasts but projections. Emissions could fall faster because of new\u000aregulation, technological breakthroughs, changes in land use and the like.\u000aSome of the nation\u2019s most critical policies to combat climate change were\u000apassed only last year. A case in point is the Clean Power Plan, the crown\u000ajewel of the lot, which would require states to come up with plans to reduce\u000athe CO2 emissions from their electric power plants.Still, the Supreme Court\u2019s\u000adecision last week to delay the plan \u2014 until the United States Court of\u000aAppeals in Washington decides on the merits of a challenge by 27 mostly\u000aRepublican-governed states \u2014 underscores just how politically vulnerable the\u000aUnited States\u2019 promises truly are.Because for all the administration\u2019s claims\u000athat it can deliver on its commitments regardless, the fact remains that even\u000aunder the most optimistic outlook \u2014 if the Supreme Court\u2019s stay were to melt\u000aaway and the Power Plan were to work impeccably \u2014 current policies do not get\u000aus there.Last month, before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, the Rhodium Group, a\u000aresearch firm that has performed extensive analysis of climate-change\u000aprojections, published a report concluding that even if the administration\u000aexecuted all its existing and planned policies with maximum effect, and the\u000amost optimistic forecasts for technological development and forest sink\u000acapacity were borne out, the United States would still not hit the\u000atarget.Using different assumptions \u2014 say, if the economy grew faster or energy\u000atechnology didn\u2019t progress as fast \u2014 it would remain even further behind.\u000aAssuming all the administration\u2019s current and proposed policies were carried\u000aout, the analysis suggests that by 2025 American greenhouse gas emissions\u000awould be, at best, 23 percent lower than in 2005. In the worst case they would\u000abe only 10 percent lower.That suggests we should hurry. \u201cWhile the U.S. still\u000ahas nearly a decade to put additional policy in place,\u201d the report notes, \u201cit\u000awill need to do so relatively quickly for the impact to be felt by the time\u000athe 2025 pledge comes due.\u201dThe pledges offered in Paris are not a magic\u000anumber. They are important nonetheless. Stiff cuts by the United States, the\u000aworld\u2019s second-largest emitter, after China, were crucial to holding the\u000ainternational coalition together. These cuts are supposed to be just the\u000abeginning of a process of increasingly stringent emissions limits.How will the\u000aUnited States get there, then? The Rhodium Group\u2019s analysis proposes stricter\u000alimits for transportation and for electric power generation, which would\u000aremain the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the country over the next\u000adecade even if the Clean Power Plan were put in place.One idea would be\u000afurther tightening the fuel economy standards for cars and trucks. The report\u000asuggests looking at emissions by the industrial sector \u2014 the third-largest\u000aemitter \u2014 which under current policies are expected to increase by 18 percent\u000aby 2025. Land use policies to enhance the forest carbon sink and tighter rules\u000ato reduce methane emissions from oil and gas could also help.But these\u000aproposals just underscore how the American problem is first and foremost\u000apolitical. It is critical, the report concludes, \u201cthat policy makers now\u000aengage in a broad exploration and frank discussion of what additional steps\u000acan help deliver on America\u2019s climate goals.\u201d It will be difficult to hold\u000athis discussion when Congress is run by a party that rejects climate\u000ascience.We have known about these obstacles for some time. The Obama\u000aadministration\u2019s plan to repurpose the Clean Air Act rather than propose new\u000alegislation to combat climate change acknowledged that the courts offered a\u000abetter shot than Congress.And in that regard, the news is not entirely bad. If\u000athe Senate were to confirm whomever President Obama nominates to succeed\u000aJustice Scalia, one of the most conservative justices on the bench, the\u000aSupreme Court would probably become more sensitive to the imperative to combat\u000aclimate change. That\u2019s not just good news for the Clean Power Plan. It could\u000aopen the door to more aggressive policies.Last month, for instance, scholars\u000afrom the law schools of Columbia University, New York University and the\u000aUniversity of California, Los Angeles, released a report that suggested there\u000ais a provision in the Clean Air Act that would allow the E.P.A. to require\u000astates to reduce emissions that endangered other countries if such countries\u000aprovided reciprocal protections to the United States.\u201cE.P.A. and the states\u000acould use the provision to establish an economywide, market-based approach for\u000areducing greenhouse gas emissions,\u201d the group wrote. \u201cSuch a program could\u000aprovide one of the most effective and efficient means to address climate\u000achange pollution in the United States.\u201dLast week, this kind of thinking would\u000ahave been unlikely to survive a spin through the Supreme Court. But perhaps it\u000acould survive a different one \u2014 maybe one that placed more weight on\u000ainternational harmony.\u000a\u000a

VThe global public health emergency involving deformed babies emerged in 2015,\u000athe hottest year in the historical record, with an outbreak in Brazil of a\u000adisease transmitted by heat-loving mosquitoes. Can that be a\u000acoincidence?Scientists say it will take them years to figure that out, and\u000apointed to other factors that may have played a larger role in starting the\u000acrisis. But these same experts added that the Zika epidemic, as well as the\u000arelated spread of a disease called dengue that is sickening as many as 100\u000amillion people a year and killing thousands, should be interpreted as\u000awarnings.Over the coming decades, global warming is likely to increase the\u000arange and speed of the life cycle of the particular mosquitoes carrying these\u000aviruses, encouraging their spread deeper into temperate countries like the\u000aUnited States.Recent research suggests that under a worst-case scenario,\u000ainvolving continued high global emissions coupled with fast population growth,\u000athe number of people exposed to the principal mosquito could more than double,\u000ato as many as 8 billion or 9 billion by late this century from roughly 4\u000abillion today.\u201cAs we get continued warming, it\u2019s going to become more\u000adifficult to control mosquitoes,\u201d said Andrew Monaghan, who is studying the\u000ainteraction of climate and health at the National Center for Atmospheric\u000aResearch in Boulder, Colo. \u201cThe warmer it is, the faster they can develop from\u000aegg to adult, and the faster they can incubate viruses.\u201dAlready, climate\u000achange is suspected \u2014 though not proved \u2014 to have been a factor in a string of\u000adisease outbreaks afflicting both people and animals. These include the spread\u000aof malaria into the highlands of eastern Africa, the rising incidence of Lyme\u000adisease in North America, and the spread of a serious livestock ailment called\u000abluetongue into parts of Europe that were once too cold for it to thrive.In\u000ainterviews, experts noted that no epidemic was ever the result of a single\u000avariable.Instead, epidemics always involve interactions among genes, ecology,\u000aclimate and human behavior, presenting profound difficulties for scientists\u000atrying to tease apart the contributing factors. \u201cThe complexity is enormous,\u201d\u000asaid Walter J. Tabachnick, a professor with the Florida Medical Entomology\u000aLaboratory, a unit of the University of Florida in Vero Beach.The epidemics of\u000aZika and dengue are cases in point. The viruses are being transmitted largely\u000aby the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. That creature adapted long ago to\u000alive in human settlements, and developed a concomitant taste for human\u000ablood.Cities in the tropics, the climate zone most favorable to the mosquito,\u000ahave undergone explosive growth: Humanity passed a milestone a few years ago\u000awhen more than half the population had moved to urban areas. But spending on\u000ahealth care and on basic public health infrastructure, like water pipes and\u000asewers, has not kept pace. Mosquito control has also faltered in recent\u000adecades.The mosquito lays its eggs in containers of water, of a sort that are\u000aespecially common in the huge slums of Latin American cities. With unreliable\u000aaccess to piped water, people there store water in rooftop cisterns, buckets\u000aand the like. Old tires and other debris can also become mosquito\u000ahabitat.Water storage near homes is commonplace in areas where Zika has spread\u000arapidly, like the cities of Recife and Salvador in northeastern Brazil, and\u000awhere dengue experienced a surge in 2015, like São Paulo, Brazil\u2019s largest\u000astate.Altogether, dengue killed at least 839 people in Brazil in 2015, a 40\u000apercent increase from the previous year. Worldwide, dengue is killing more\u000athan 20,000 people a year.Several experts said in interviews that a main\u000areason for the disease outbreaks was most likely the expansion of the number\u000aof people at risk, through urbanization, population growth and international\u000atravel. They see the changing climate as just another stress on top of a\u000asituation that was already rife with peril.While they do not understand to\u000awhat degree rising temperatures and other weather shifts may have contributed\u000ato the outbreaks, they do understand some of the potential mechanisms.The\u000amosquitoes mostly live on flower nectar, but the female of the species needs a\u000ameal of human blood to have enough protein to lay her eggs. If she bites a\u000aperson infected with dengue, Zika or any of several other diseases, she picks\u000aup the virus.The virus has to reproduce in the mosquito for a certain period\u000abefore it can be transmitted to another person in a subsequent bite. The\u000ahigher the air temperature, the shorter that incubation period. Moreover, up\u000ato a point, higher temperatures cause the mosquitoes to mature faster.With\u000arising temperatures, \u201cYou\u2019re actually speeding up the whole reproductive cycle\u000aof the mosquitoes,\u201d said Charles B. Beard, who heads a unit in Fort Collins,\u000aColo., studying insect-borne diseases for the Centers for Disease Control and\u000aPrevention in Atlanta. \u201cYou get larger populations, with more generations of\u000amosquitoes, in a warmer, wetter climate. You have this kind of amplification\u000aof the risk.\u201dAedes aegypti is present across the southern tier of the United\u000aStates. Brief outbreaks of dengue have occurred recently at the warmest\u000amargins of the country, and one is underway in Hawaii. But with pervasive\u000awindow screens and air-conditioning, the risk of disease transmission is far\u000aless for most Americans than for people in poorer countries.The mosquito does\u000anot thrive in areas with cold winters. Some research suggests that continued\u000aclimatic warming could allow the mosquito to colonize more of North America in\u000acoming decades, though how much of a disease risk that would represent is\u000aanybody\u2019s guess.The yellow fever mosquito competes with a cousin, the Asian\u000atiger mosquito, that has also colonized the United States, and is more\u000atolerant of cold weather. Whether one would beat out the other in a hotter\u000aclimate is unclear. Likewise, it is unclear how effective the Asian tiger\u000amosquito might become at transmitting Zika or dengue viruses.In principle, the\u000arisk from continued global warming applies not just to temperate countries,\u000abut to cities at high altitude in tropical countries. Researchers are keeping\u000aa close eye on Mexico City, for instance.With 21 million people in the city\u000aand its suburbs, Mexico City is the largest metropolis of the Western\u000aHemisphere. While the lowlands of Mexico are plagued by yellow fever\u000amosquitoes and the viruses they transmit, the country\u2019s capital sits on a\u000amountain plain that has \u2014 up to now \u2014 been too cold for the mosquitoes.But\u000atemperatures are rising, and the mosquitoes have recently been detected in low\u000anumbers near Mexico City. \u201cThe mosquito is just down the hill, literally,\u201d Dr.\u000aMonaghan said. \u201cI think all the potential is there to have virus transmission\u000aif climatic conditions become a bit more suitable.\u201d\u000a\u000a

VLOS ANGELES \u2014 In his final term as California\u2019s governor, Jerry Brown has made\u000athe battle against climate change a signature issue: He is fighting to vastly\u000areduce the state\u2019s emissions of greenhouse gases, to accelerate the move to\u000aelectric cars and to rewire the state\u2019s electrical grid. In December, he had a\u000astar turn with world leaders at the United Nations climate change conference\u000ain Paris.But despite all his efforts, California\u2019s emissions rose modestly\u000aover the first three years after he took office in 2011, the last years for\u000awhich data is available. The latest blow came from Porter Ranch, a Los Angeles\u000asuburb where a breach at an underground natural-gas storage site in October\u000areleased 107,000 tons of climate-changing methane and ethane \u2014 the largest\u000asuch leak in terms of climate impact in American history \u2014 before it was\u000acapped late last month.A report in the journal Science last week concluded\u000athat the Porter Ranch breach, at its peak, effectively doubled the amount of\u000amethane emitted daily in the Los Angeles Basin, highlighting how such\u000aaccidents can set back even the best-intentioned climate policies.Speaking on\u000abehalf of the Brown administration, Mary D. Nichols, the chairwoman of the\u000aCalifornia Air Resources Board, said her agency had been working on\u000aregulations for methane as a short-lived climate pollutant when the leak\u000aoccurred.She said that the environmental policy makers \u2014 not just the Brown\u000aadministration \u2014 had only recently started to focus on the effects of\u000apollutants like methane, and that the Porter Ranch leak had added a sense of\u000aurgency to address that.\u201cIt\u2019s been a jolt for everybody, realizing what\u000apotential for really major harm can come from this sector, which we have\u000atended to take pretty much for granted,\u201d Ms. Nichols said. New studies have\u000ashown that, even aside from the leak, \u201cthere\u2019s more methane escaping into the\u000aatmosphere than we previously thought,\u201d she added.The leak not only snarled\u000athe state\u2019s climate-change efforts but also prompted complaints that the\u000agovernor was slow to address the problem and that his regulators had failed to\u000aprevent it.Food &amp; Water Watch, a group that works to ban hydraulic\u000afracturing and protect the water supply, sometimes brings a papier-mâché\u000alikeness of Mr. Brown to its rallies to decry what it sees as his support for\u000athe oil and gas industry. The governor has shunned calls to move toward\u000areducing the state\u2019s oil production, and while he has supported strict\u000aregulation of hydraulic fracturing, commonly called fracking, he has opposed a\u000aban on the technique.\u201cJust believing climate change is real doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s\u000adoing anything about it,\u201d said Adam Scow, California director at Food &amp;\u000aWater Watch. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t done anything that constitutes real\u000aleadership.\u201dReferring to some of Mr. Brown\u2019s climate goals, like reducing\u000agreenhouse gas emissions in California to 80 percent below 1990 levels by the\u000ayear 2050, Mr. Scow said: \u201cThat\u2019s a politically convenient approach. We need\u000ato be planning for a 100 percent renewable future in California, and we\u2019re not\u000adoing it.\u201dMs. Nichols of the California Air Resources Board defended the\u000agovernor, saying he had made addressing climate change a priority across state\u000agovernment. \u201cHe is not going to get a perfect score from environmentalists,\u201d\u000ashe said. \u201cEnvironmental advocates are always looking to push for more.\u201dIn the\u000alast year, Mr. Brown has pushed through legislation accelerating a shift to\u000arenewable energy, and struck clean-energy agreements with a host of states and\u000acities. California now gets 26 percent of its power from renewable sources,\u000acompared with an average of 10 percent in other states.Ms. Nichols said that\u000athe governor \u201chas a broad view of what the state needs to be doing on these\u000aissues, and it\u2019s now been incorporated into the work of every relevant\u000aagency.\u201d For example, the Department of General Services now considers the\u000aenvironment when buying fleets, she said, and the Department of Transportation\u000aincludes greenhouse gas emissions in its plans.But there have been setbacks\u000afor the governor and his goals besides Porter Ranch. In 2013, the state was\u000aunexpectedly forced to close the San Onofre nuclear power station north of San\u000aDiego, eliminating a zero-emissions source of electricity. Last October, the\u000aCalifornia State Legislature spurned what was perhaps Mr. Brown\u2019s most\u000aambitious proposal \u2014 to cut petroleum use in half by 2030 \u2014 after a campaign\u000aby the oil industry raised voters\u2019 fears of higher gasoline prices.And there\u000aare signs of fatigue here with environmental regulations in general. Last\u000amonth, the agency charged with preserving California\u2019s coastline ousted its\u000aexecutive director, who was deemed too hostile to development. And on Friday,\u000athe regional commission that oversees air quality for 17 million people in the\u000aLos Angeles area made a similar move: Republicans committed to making\u000apollution regulations more business-friendly, who took control of the\u000acommission last month, ousted its executive director.John Laird, California\u000asecretary for natural resources, offered a laundry list of accomplishments\u000aduring the Brown administration, beginning with the focus on climate change,\u000abut moving on to a variety of habitat protection efforts that are far less\u000aheralded, like negotiating a deal with Nevada to maintain Lake Tahoe and\u000acreating a network of marine protected areas.\u201cSometimes, it\u2019s hard to\u000aappreciate what\u2019s going on around us,\u201d Mr. Laird said. \u201cI think people will\u000aprobably look back with much greater appreciation on what is happening in this\u000atime.\u201dYet even many who applaud that record suggest that Mr. Brown should\u000aguard against overconfidence.\u201cClearly on climate and clean energy, there are\u000alarge promises and commitment and soaring vision,\u201d said V. John White, the\u000aexecutive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable\u000aTechnology, an advocacy group. \u201cBut in the details, there is still much work\u000ato be done.\u201dSome criticisms verge on Monday-morning quarterbacking: Mr. Brown,\u000aenvironmental advocates say, has not courted state legislators enough to\u000asecure their votes on crucial issues \u2014 like the proposal on petroleum use \u2014\u000athat might have passed with more effort.But some are more substantive. Example\u000aone is the San Onofre shutdown, after which Mr. Brown pushed to quickly\u000areplace lost electrical generating capacity with a brace of new gas-fired\u000apower plants. The plants have been approved, but they carry a different cost:\u000aGas-fired generators emit climate-changing gases that nuclear reactors do\u000anot.Some scientists say that the trajectory looks positive. Together with\u000acolleagues, Jeffery Greenblatt, a scientist and expert on low-carbon\u000atechnology at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley has used\u000acomputer models to study whether the first step toward Mr. Brown\u2019s 2050 goal \u2014\u000agetting greenhouse-gas emissions back to 1990 levels by 2020 \u2014 was feasible.\u000aUnder three different scenarios, the resulting graphs show a line representing\u000acarbon emissions steadily dropping until the 2020 goal is met.That the line\u000awas still rising in 2013 is interesting, he said, but not worrisome \u2014 yet.\u201cAs\u000awe get closer to 2020,\u201d Dr. Greenblatt said, \u201cI would start to get concerned\u000aif it does not go down.\u201d\u000a\u000a

VWASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama on Thursday said the United States and Canada\u000awere more closely aligned than ever, using a meeting with Prime Minister\u000aJustin Trudeau to announce joint efforts to curb emissions of planet-warming\u000agases and to promote his personal rapport with the leader of a pivotal\u000aneighbor.Mr. Obama played the older, more experienced host to Mr. Trudeau\u2019s\u000afresh-faced newcomer during the visit, the first official one by a Canadian\u000aleader in 19 years, as the two announced that they were teaming up to reduce\u000athe release of methane, a chemical contained in natural gas.\u201cHe campaigned on\u000aa message of hope and of change; his positive and optimistic vision is\u000ainspiring young people,\u201d Mr. Obama said at a news conference in the White\u000aHouse Rose Garden, drawing unmistakable parallels between Mr. Trudeau\u2019s rise\u000ato power and his own. \u201cOn the world stage, his country is leading on climate\u000achange and cares deeply about development, so from my perspective, what\u2019s not\u000ato like?\u201dMr. Obama, 54, welcomed Mr. Trudeau, 44, with a formal arrival\u000aceremony on the South Lawn featuring a 19-gun salute, color guards and\u000amilitary bands. Mr. Trudeau was greeted by cheering onlookers waving miniature\u000aAmerican and Canadian flags, reflecting the same brand of rock-star adulation\u000athat characterized many of Mr. Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign appearances.The official\u000avisit unfolded against the backdrop of an increasingly intense campaign to\u000asucceed Mr. Obama. Mr. Trudeau, who has joked about welcoming Americans to his\u000acountry if they are afraid of a Donald J. Trump presidency, diplomatically\u000adeclined to criticize the Republican presidential front-runner during the news\u000aconference.\u201cI have tremendous confidence in the American people and look\u000aforward to working with whomever they choose to send to this White House later\u000athis year,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said, answering a question about the stakes for his\u000acountry and its relationship with the United States should Mr. Trump or\u000aSenator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, win the White House.A somewhat amused\u000aMr. Obama rejected the idea that his own tenure had helped to fuel Mr. Trump\u2019s\u000arise, arguing that the \u201cRepublican political elites\u201d and news media were\u000aresponsible for setting a divisive tone and elevating an us-versus-them\u000amentality \u2014 including questions about the president\u2019s birthplace \u2014 that\u000acreated an atmosphere in which Mr. Trump thrived.\u201cI have been blamed by\u000aRepublicans for a lot of things, but being blamed for their primaries and who\u000athey\u2019re selecting for their party is,\u201d Mr. Obama said with a long pause and a\u000agrin, \u201cnovel.\u201d\u201cWhat I\u2019m not going to do is to validate some notion that the\u000aRepublican crackup that\u2019s been taking place is a consequence of actions that\u000aI\u2019ve taken,\u201d he added.On policy, Mr. Obama and Mr. Trudeau promised that their\u000atwo countries would \u201cplay a leadership role internationally in the low-carbon\u000aglobal economy over the coming decades.\u201d As part of the announcement, United\u000aStates officials said they would immediately begin a new push to regulate\u000amethane emissions from existing oil and gas facilities, though finishing that\u000aprocess before the end of Mr. Obama\u2019s tenure is unlikely.The Obama\u000aadministration wants to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by\u000a40 percent to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The Interior Department has\u000aproposed a number of regulations on methane leaks, but it has yet to write a\u000aregulation governing such leaks from current oil and gas drilling on public\u000aland.Mr. Obama and Mr. Trudeau also pledged to cooperate in preserving the\u000aArctic, and to move more quickly to carry out agreements made in climate talks\u000ain Paris last year.\u201cThe president and I agree on many things, including, of\u000aparamount importance, the direction we want to take our countries in to ensure\u000aa clean and prosperous future,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said, thanking the president, whom\u000ahe addressed as Barack, for his leadership on climate change. \u201cCanada and the\u000aU.S. will stand side by side to confront the pressing needs that face not only\u000aour two countries, but the entire planet.\u201dThe official visit was to conclude\u000awith a state dinner in the East Room of the White House.The arrival of Mr.\u000aTrudeau and his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau \u2014 accompanied by their three\u000ayoung children \u2014 has prompted comparisons to a similar visit in 1977 by Pierre\u000aTrudeau, then the prime minister and the current leader\u2019s father. That visit\u000amade headlines when Margaret Trudeau, his wife, wore a short dress that fell\u000ajust below the knee to the White House state dinner.While Canada and the\u000aUnited States have long been close allies, Mr. Obama\u2019s efforts to confront\u000aglobal warming was a major point of contention with Mr. Trudeau\u2019s predecessor,\u000aStephen Harper, who sought to aggressively expand Canada\u2019s oil industry.As Mr.\u000aObama became more determined to leave behind a lasting environmental legacy,\u000ahe delayed and eventually rejected construction of the Keystone XL pipeline,\u000awhich would have transported nearly a million barrels a day of heavily\u000apolluting petroleum from the Alberta oil sands to refineries on the Gulf\u000aCoast.Mr. Obama\u2019s rejection of the pipeline severely strained relations with\u000aMr. Harper, but Mr. Trudeau\u2019s election last year signaled a shift in policy\u000athat was welcomed by the White House. Mr. Trudeau did not criticize Mr.\u000aObama\u2019s stance on the pipeline, and he has pledged to pursue an ambitious\u000aenvironmental agenda dovetailing with Mr. Obama\u2019s policies.In December,\u000aCanadian officials helped to push through a historic global climate agreement\u000ain Paris.In their Oval Office meeting on Thursday, the leaders also discussed\u000amilitary cooperation, efforts to combat terrorism, improvements in trade and\u000aenvironmental concerns.They agreed to push forward on an agreement allowing\u000atravelers from each country to be pre-cleared through immigration and customs,\u000aaiding tourism and commerce. The two leaders also struck a deal to share more\u000ainformation \u2014 including on no-fly lists and border crossings \u2014 in an effort to\u000aprevent foreign fighters from traveling freely between Canada and the United\u000aStates.They parted with some issues unresolved, most prominently a decades-old\u000adispute over softwood lumber. American officials say lumber from Canada is\u000aunfairly subsidized by the government there, an assertion that Canadian\u000aofficials reject. Both leaders said they were optimistic about resolving their\u000adifferences on the matter in the coming months.\u201cIt\u2019s been a longstanding\u000abilateral irritant, but it hardly defines the nature of the U.S.-Canadian\u000arelationship,\u201d Mr. Obama said, adding that while each side would likely be\u000adissatisfied with the outcome, officials would ultimately find a middle ground\u000aon the issue. \u201cPeople will complain and grumble,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cBut it will\u000abe fine.\u201d\u000a\u000a

VLOS ANGELES \u2014 In his final term as California\u2019s governor, Jerry Brown has made\u000athe battle against climate change a signature issue: He is fighting to vastly\u000areduce the state\u2019s emissions of greenhouse gases, to accelerate the move to\u000aelectric cars and to rewire the state\u2019s electrical grid. In December, he had a\u000astar turn with world leaders at the United Nations climate change conference\u000ain Paris.But despite all his efforts, California\u2019s emissions rose modestly\u000aover the first three years after he took office in 2011, the last years for\u000awhich data is available. The latest blow came from Porter Ranch, a Los Angeles\u000asuburb where a breach at an underground natural-gas storage site in October\u000areleased 107,000 tons of climate-changing methane and ethane \u2014 the largest\u000asuch leak in terms of climate impact in American history \u2014 before it was\u000acapped late last month.A report in the journal Science last week concluded\u000athat the Porter Ranch breach, at its peak, effectively doubled the amount of\u000amethane emitted daily in the Los Angeles Basin, highlighting how such\u000aaccidents can set back even the best-intentioned climate policies.Speaking on\u000abehalf of the Brown administration, Mary D. Nichols, the chairwoman of the\u000aCalifornia Air Resources Board, said her agency had been working on\u000aregulations for methane as a short-lived climate pollutant when the leak\u000aoccurred.She said that the environmental policy makers \u2014 not just the Brown\u000aadministration \u2014 had only recently started to focus on the effects of\u000apollutants like methane, and that the Porter Ranch leak had added a sense of\u000aurgency to address that.\u201cIt\u2019s been a jolt for everybody, realizing what\u000apotential for really major harm can come from this sector, which we have\u000atended to take pretty much for granted,\u201d Ms. Nichols said. New studies have\u000ashown that, even aside from the leak, \u201cthere\u2019s more methane escaping into the\u000aatmosphere than we previously thought,\u201d she added.The leak not only snarled\u000athe state\u2019s climate-change efforts but also prompted complaints that the\u000agovernor was slow to address the problem and that his regulators had failed to\u000aprevent it.Food &amp; Water Watch, a group that works to ban hydraulic\u000afracturing and protect the water supply, sometimes brings a papier-mâché\u000alikeness of Mr. Brown to its rallies to decry what it sees as his support for\u000athe oil and gas industry. The governor has shunned calls to move toward\u000areducing the state\u2019s oil production, and while he has supported strict\u000aregulation of hydraulic fracturing, commonly called fracking, he has opposed a\u000aban on the technique.\u201cJust believing climate change is real doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s\u000adoing anything about it,\u201d said Adam Scow, California director at Food &amp;\u000aWater Watch. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t done anything that constitutes real\u000aleadership.\u201dReferring to some of Mr. Brown\u2019s climate goals, like reducing\u000agreenhouse gas emissions in California to 80 percent below 1990 levels by the\u000ayear 2050, Mr. Scow said: \u201cThat\u2019s a politically convenient approach. We need\u000ato be planning for a 100 percent renewable future in California, and we\u2019re not\u000adoing it.\u201dMs. Nichols of the California Air Resources Board defended the\u000agovernor, saying he had made addressing climate change a priority across state\u000agovernment. \u201cHe is not going to get a perfect score from environmentalists,\u201d\u000ashe said. \u201cEnvironmental advocates are always looking to push for more.\u201dIn the\u000alast year, Mr. Brown has pushed through legislation accelerating a shift to\u000arenewable energy, and struck clean-energy agreements with a host of states and\u000acities. California now gets 26 percent of its power from renewable sources,\u000acompared with an average of 10 percent in other states.Ms. Nichols said that\u000athe governor \u201chas a broad view of what the state needs to be doing on these\u000aissues, and it\u2019s now been incorporated into the work of every relevant\u000aagency.\u201d For example, the Department of General Services now considers the\u000aenvironment when buying fleets, she said, and the Department of Transportation\u000aincludes greenhouse gas emissions in its plans.But there have been setbacks\u000afor the governor and his goals besides Porter Ranch. In 2013, the state was\u000aunexpectedly forced to close the San Onofre nuclear power station north of San\u000aDiego, eliminating a zero-emissions source of electricity. Last October, the\u000aCalifornia State Legislature spurned what was perhaps Mr. Brown\u2019s most\u000aambitious proposal \u2014 to cut petroleum use in half by 2030 \u2014 after a campaign\u000aby the oil industry raised voters\u2019 fears of higher gasoline prices.And there\u000aare signs of fatigue here with environmental regulations in general. Last\u000amonth, the agency charged with preserving California\u2019s coastline ousted its\u000aexecutive director, who was deemed too hostile to development. And on Friday,\u000athe regional commission that oversees air quality for 17 million people in the\u000aLos Angeles area made a similar move: Republicans committed to making\u000apollution regulations more business-friendly, who took control of the\u000acommission last month, ousted its executive director.John Laird, California\u000asecretary for natural resources, offered a laundry list of accomplishments\u000aduring the Brown administration, beginning with the focus on climate change,\u000abut moving on to a variety of habitat protection efforts that are far less\u000aheralded, like negotiating a deal with Nevada to maintain Lake Tahoe and\u000acreating a network of marine protected areas.\u201cSometimes, it\u2019s hard to\u000aappreciate what\u2019s going on around us,\u201d Mr. Laird said. \u201cI think people will\u000aprobably look back with much greater appreciation on what is happening in this\u000atime.\u201dYet even many who applaud that record suggest that Mr. Brown should\u000aguard against overconfidence.\u201cClearly on climate and clean energy, there are\u000alarge promises and commitment and soaring vision,\u201d said V. John White, the\u000aexecutive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable\u000aTechnology, an advocacy group. \u201cBut in the details, there is still much work\u000ato be done.\u201dSome criticisms verge on Monday-morning quarterbacking: Mr. Brown,\u000aenvironmental advocates say, has not courted state legislators enough to\u000asecure their votes on crucial issues \u2014 like the proposal on petroleum use \u2014\u000athat might have passed with more effort.But some are more substantive. Example\u000aone is the San Onofre shutdown, after which Mr. Brown pushed to quickly\u000areplace lost electrical generating capacity with a brace of new gas-fired\u000apower plants. The plants have been approved, but they carry a different cost:\u000aGas-fired generators emit climate-changing gases that nuclear reactors do\u000anot.Some scientists say that the trajectory looks positive. Together with\u000acolleagues, Jeffery Greenblatt, a scientist and expert on low-carbon\u000atechnology at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley has used\u000acomputer models to study whether the first step toward Mr. Brown\u2019s 2050 goal \u2014\u000agetting greenhouse-gas emissions back to 1990 levels by 2020 \u2014 was feasible.\u000aUnder three different scenarios, the resulting graphs show a line representing\u000acarbon emissions steadily dropping until the 2020 goal is met.That the line\u000awas still rising in 2013 is interesting, he said, but not worrisome \u2014 yet.\u201cAs\u000awe get closer to 2020,\u201d Dr. Greenblatt said, \u201cI would start to get concerned\u000aif it does not go down.\u201d\u000a\u000a

VThe dissident artist and activist Ai Weiwei said on Wednesday that he would\u000aclose his current exhibition at the Faurschou Foundation in Copenhagen in\u000aprotest of a new law allowing Denmark to confiscate refugees\u2019 valuables to\u000ahelp pay for their stay in the country.The law, which was Parliament approved\u000aon Tuesday, requires refugees to hand over any assets worth over 10,000\u000akroner, or about $1,450, although exceptions would be made for items with\u000asentimental value, like wedding rings.Mr. Ai made the announcement on\u000aInstagram, and the Faurschou, a contemporary art gallery, confirmed on both\u000aits Instagram account and its Facebook page that the exhibition, \u201cRuptures,\u201d\u000awould close ahead of schedule.In a statement on Instagram using language\u000aidentical to that of Mr. Ai\u2019s post, the museum said that its owner, Jens\u000aFaurschou, backed the artist\u2019s decision. It cited regrets over the Danish\u000aParliament\u2019s decision \u201cto be in the forefront of symbolic and inhuman politics\u000aof todays biggest humanitarian crisis in Europe and the Middle East, instead\u000aof being in the forefront of a respectful European solution to solve the acute\u000ahumanitarian crisis.\u201dOpponents have criticized the Danish law as divisive, and\u000athey say it will diminish the country\u2019s reputation for tolerance and\u000apotentially encourage xenophobia.The show, which opened in spring 2015, had\u000abeen scheduled to run through April 15.In the past month, Mr. Ai\u2019s Instagram\u000aaccount has focused on documenting refugees arriving on the shores of the\u000aGreek island of Lesbos.\u000a\u000a

VROME \u2014 Roughly five weeks ago, Donald Tusk, one of the European Union\u2019s most\u000apowerful political figures, issued a blunt warning to its 28 countries: Come\u000aup with a coherent plan to tackle the refugee crisis within two months, or\u000arisk chaos.Surprisingly, given the plodding pace of European Union policy\u000amaking, many of Europe\u2019s national leaders are now moving swiftly, announcing\u000atough new border policies and guidelines on asylum \u2014 even with three weeks\u000aremaining on the deadline set by Mr. Tusk, president of the European\u000aCouncil.The problem is that the leaders are not always adhering to European\u000arules, possibly not sticking to international law and not acting with the\u000aunity envisioned by Mr. Tusk. In some cases, they instead seem to be reverting\u000ato historical alliances rather than maintaining the European Union\u2019s mantra of\u000asolidarity.This week, Austria joined with many of the Balkan countries to\u000aapprove a tough border policy in what some are wryly calling the return of the\u000aHapsburg Empire. Four former Soviet satellites, led by Poland and Hungary,\u000ahave become another opposition power bloc.All the while, a call for unity by\u000aChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is increasingly being ignored, even as she\u000astruggles to tamp down on a political revolt at home while searching for a\u000aformula to reduce the number of refugees still trying to reach Germany.\u201cWe are\u000anow entering a situation in which everybody is trying to stop the refugees\u000abefore they reach their borders,\u201d said Ivan Krastev, chairman of the Center\u000afor Liberal Strategies, a research institute in Sofia, Bulgaria.Mr. Krastev\u000aadded, \u201cThe basic question is, which country turns into a parking lot for\u000arefugees?\u201dFor many months, European Union officials, joined by Ms. Merkel,\u000ahave tried to share the burden by distributing quotas of the refugees already\u000ain Greece and Italy to different member states. Many states have balked, and\u000athe program is largely paralyzed.European Union leaders also agreed to pay 3\u000abillion euros, roughly $3.3 billion, to aid organizations in Turkey to help\u000astanch the flow of migrants departing the Turkish coast for the Greek islands.\u000aBut record numbers of migrants keep coming.Without an effective Europe-wide\u000apolicy response, and facing growing public anger in many countries, Europe\u2019s\u000anational leaders have splintered, searching for allies.Only months ago,\u000aAustria, like Germany, symbolized Europe\u2019s welcoming embrace to Syrians and\u000aother refugees fleeing war and poverty. Now, Austria is defying European Union\u000aofficials \u2014 and frustrating Ms. Merkel \u2014 by placing a cap on refugees.Austria\u000aalso convened a meeting on Wednesday in Vienna with many of the Balkan states\u000athat last year had allowed migrants to cross their borders while traveling\u000anorth toward Germany and Sweden.The group in Vienna agreed to tighten limits\u000aon the number of migrants allowed to travel north, and pledged to help\u000aMacedonia clamp down on its southern border with Greece.Poland and Hungary are\u000aalso providing help to Macedonia. Earlier, police chiefs in Austria, Croatia,\u000aMacedonia, Serbia and Slovenia established tighter rules for screening\u000amigrants.Taken together, these moves threaten to turn Greece into the so-\u000acalled refugee parking lot. Already, the Greek police have had to relocate\u000aseveral thousand migrants from the border checkpoint with Macedonia to refugee\u000acenters on the outskirts of Athens.The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras,\u000ais incensed and Greece on Thursday recalled its ambassador to Austria.\u000aGreece\u2019s Foreign Ministry issued a statement warning against the re-emergence\u000aof Europe\u2019s ancient rivalries.\u201cIt is clear that the major problems of the\u000aEuropean Union cannot be confronted via thoughts, attitudes and extra-\u000ainstitutional initiatives that have their roots in the 19th century,\u201d the\u000astatement said.Greece is now the primary entry point for Syrians and other\u000arefugees trying to reach Europe. Already this year, more than 100,000 migrants\u000ahave landed on Greek islands, the International Organization for Migration has\u000areported, a number that could ultimately top one million or more. Greek\u000aofficials warn that the country \u2014 still reeling from the economic crisis \u2014\u000acould be thrown into civil conflict if it becomes a dumping ground for\u000amigrants trying to reach the rest of Europe.\u201cThis is not a Greek problem,\u201d\u000asaid Megan E. Greene, chief economist for Manulife Asset Management and a\u000alongtime analyst of Europe.\u201cIt is a European problem, and it needs a European\u000asolution. We are seeing \u2018solidarity\u2019 go out the window.\u201dAnalysts say that if\u000athe deal struck this week in Austria becomes integrated into a broader\u000aEuropean Union policy, with Macedonia effectively becoming the bloc\u2019s outer\u000aedge, it would redraw the external borders of the group. Greece would be left\u000aoutside the bloc\u2019s de facto borders, despite being a European Union member.\u000aYet Macedonia and Serbia, neither of which are members, would be inside.The\u000aEuropean Union will hold a pivotal March 7 meeting with Turkey to discuss the\u000aflow of refugees. European leaders will then gather in Brussels on March 17-18\u000afor a summit meeting intended to achieve a unified migration policy \u2014 the\u000asession that represents Mr. Tusk\u2019s deadline.Leaders like Ms. Merkel have long\u000aargued that migration demands a Europe-wide solution and is too big for any\u000asingle country to adequately address. Yet it will not be easy.Hungary is now\u000aplanning to hold a public referendum on whether to accept or reject refugees.\u000aItaly \u2014 which has been dealing with migration for years \u2014 is calling for the\u000acreation of so-called Eurobonds to finance the response to the migration\u000acrisis \u2014 even as Germany and other countries remain wary.In Germany, the\u000apolitical pressure on Ms. Merkel is only growing, and some predict that the\u000aanti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland party could make serious inroads in\u000athree important upcoming state elections.Moreover, Ms. Merkel\u2019s own re-\u000aelection campaign next year could be in doubt. She has criticized Austria and\u000athe other countries for acting outside European Union parameters, and for\u000apotentially isolating Greece. Yet a policy to tighten borders and stem the\u000arefugee flow could likely help her politically.\u201cFor Germany, it is vital to\u000abring the numbers down,\u201d said Almut Möller, head of the Berlin office of the\u000aEuropean Council on Foreign Relations.\u000a\u000a

VWARSAW, N.Y. \u2014 Purna Gurung and Hem Gurung stood in dung-slopped boots and\u000arubber gloves, the heady perfume of wet cow, raw milk and manure permeating\u000athe room. They washed down the dirty stalls in the rotary milking parlor at\u000aNoblehurst Farms in western New York, some 7,500 miles from their birthplace\u000ain Bhutan.\u201cEverything here looks good to me,\u201d Purna Gurung, 52, said in\u000aNepali, through an interpreter. \u201cIt\u2019s hard work here, but I am more happy than\u000abeing in the refugee camp. Now I have everything for my family.\u201dThe men were\u000aonce farmers, and then spent 20 years in refugee camps in Nepal, unable to\u000ahold legal jobs. Now they worked wordlessly alongside two other milkers, both\u000aMexican immigrants, in practiced repetition.The raw product would soon supply\u000aa cross-cultural dairy case: Siggi\u2019s, an Icelandic-style yogurt; Norman\u2019s\u000akosher Greek yogurt; and eggnog for Pittsford Farms Dairy.Hem and Purna Gurung\u000a(no relation) are among 23 Bhutanese refugees who have taken part in a state\u000aprogram, learning to be milkers at Alfred State College and then training on\u000alocal farms.The Refugee Milker Training Program began in 2014 out of mutual\u000aneed: Refugees in Rochester wanted familiar agrarian jobs, and farms needed\u000alabor to fuel the yogurt boom. Since then, it has evolved into a modest social\u000aexperiment in the state\u2019s dairy heartland.\u201cWe need a stable work force; labor\u000ais our No. 1 issue,\u201d said Sarah Noble-Moag, whose family has owned and\u000aoperated Noblehurst Farms for seven generations.Ms. Noble-Moag explained how\u000aseveral years ago agents for Immigration and Customs Enforcement would raid\u000afarms across the county to pick up the Mexican workers, many undocumented, who\u000ahad become the anchor of the work force. Entire shifts would be lost in a\u000aday.\u201cWe need to know that they are going to be here to milk cows,\u201d she said.\u000a\u201cAnd with the enforcement activity that comes and goes, we need to balance our\u000awork force.\u201dThe raids have since decreased, Ms. Noble-Moag added, but the\u000aaddition of the Bhutanese milkers, who work 12-hour shifts four days a week,\u000ahas provided insurance.The sparse break room at Noblehurst\u2019s dairy in the town\u000aof York has a map of Mexico. \u201cI\u2019m going to get a map of Bhutan,\u201d Ms. Noble-\u000aMoag promised.Not long ago, she knew that Bhutan was a landlocked Himalayan\u000anation tucked between China and India. But she had no idea about the refugee\u000acrisis that brought the milkers to her doorstep.It is a cruel irony that\u000aBhutan has become known as a country devoted to gross national happiness (as\u000aopposed to gross national product), considering that more than 100,000 people\u000aof Nepalese ancestry living in southern Bhutan were expelled by the king in\u000athe 1990s during a period of ethnic cleansing.Since 2011, nearly 40,000\u000aBhutanese refugees have settled across the United States, in cities like\u000aAkron, Ohio; Houston; and Buffalo. In Rochester, the Bhutanese are the largest\u000arefugee group, numbering about 2,000, according to the resettlement agency\u000athere, Catholic Family Center.Pat Standish, an indefatigable leader in the\u000aregion, made the connection bridging the Bhutanese and farming\u000acommunities.Twenty years ago, after her husband died, Ms. Standish founded the\u000anonprofit group Community Action Angels to help residents contend with\u000apoverty, literacy and a lack of jobs. In late 2013, working with the Cornell\u000aCooperative Extension of Wyoming County, she contacted the Catholic Family\u000aCenter to enroll the first participants in the milker program, for which she\u000aobtained an initial grant. The state\u2019s Office for New Americans provided\u000a$400,000 to help run the pilot program for two years.The first person she\u000ahired was Manoj Rai, who had recently moved to Rochester after first landing\u000ain Richmond, Va., to stay with a brother. Mr. Rai, 41, would serve as an\u000ainterpreter, mentor and liaison. He called himself a \u201cguardian\u201d of his\u000apeople.\u201cI knew people would follow Manoj,\u201d Ms. Standish, 69, said.For the\u000afirst two winters, Mr. Rai and the milkers made the treacherous hourlong drive\u000afrom Rochester to the farms and back to work. The weather made moving to rural\u000aWyoming County an easy sell. The refugees had lived in Bhutan\u2019s tropical\u000aregion, not the northern Himalayas. They had never owned cars, let alone\u000adriven in blinding snow squalls.On a recent white-swirled ride through the\u000afarm roads, Mr. Rai pointed out the numerous spots where he had rescued fellow\u000arefugees from ditches in the first year.He was the first to move, in September\u000a2014, to a house off Liberty Street with a jungle gym in the yard. Five other\u000afamilies have followed him to the village of Warsaw, population 3,814. Most\u000amoved into homes owned by Action Angels. They cut their commute to 20\u000aminutes.Slowly, and with snow tires, the refugees are adapting to their new\u000alives.\u201cI feel this is a wonderful place,\u201d Mr. Rai said of Warsaw, which before\u000atheir arrival was 97 percent white, according to census figures. Now, 27\u000aBhutanese immigrants live here, with 10 children attending the local\u000aschools.Warsaw also provided the Bhutanese residents shelter from their\u000aanxious urban life. In the last three years, Rochester has seen an increase in\u000acrimes against immigrants, including robberies, assaults and a murder.Kaji\u000aRai, 35, who works at the farm Synergy, said moving closer had relaxed him,\u000aand not just because he drove fewer miles.\u201cIn Rochester, it was no good for\u000athe children,\u201d said Mr. Rai, no relation to Manoj. \u201cThere\u2019s bad guys, too many\u000athere.\u201dThe Action Angels, a division of Community Action for Wyoming County,\u000ahas served as a secondary refugee agency for the Bhutanese, offering ESL\u000aclasses, paying their first month\u2019s rent and providing furniture.When Mr. Rai\u000acould not find a used trumpet for Binuphsa, his 10-year-old daughter, to take\u000alessons, Ms. Standish assembled an entire band\u2019s worth of donated\u000ainstruments.The pilot program expires in December, and if not renewed, Ms.\u000aStandish said she was determined to keep it running.The industry\u2019s fortune\u000aplays a role, too. When milk prices plummeted in 2015, the farms restricted\u000atheir hiring. Currently, five Bhutanese are working at Noblehurst and Synergy\u000afarms. Another 12 Bhutanese who completed training are waiting for the market\u000ato recover.Last spring, Ms. Standish found jobs for some of the farmworkers\u2019\u000awives when American Classic Outfitters, a local company that sews college\u000afootball and baseball uniforms, called asking for workers. The employees were\u000ainitially skeptical, worried that the Bhutanese were taking away jobs from\u000aAmerican-born workers. But that was not the case, Lisa Carpenter, the\u000acompany\u2019s human resources administrator, said.Then there were the cultural\u000adifferences. The women from Bhutan wiped their noses on their sleeves and spit\u000ainto trash cans. Mr. Rai gave them a lesson in American workplace etiquette,\u000ajust as he had taught the farmers how to use forks and knives.By Christmas,\u000athe divide started to dissolve when the Bhutanese women were sharing food in a\u000apotluck holiday lunch and taking part in the American tradition of Secret\u000aSanta.Back in Nepal, Kamali Gurung used to sew pink saris in the refugee\u000acamp.On this day she was sewing seams on gold football pants. It was for the\u000amost American of uniforms, the Navy Midshipmen. On the waist, the letters\u000aembroidered in-house read: \u201cDon\u2019t Give Up the Ship.\u201d\u000a\u000a

V_(The death of David Stoliar, in 2014, received little attention outside\u000aOregon, where he lived. The New York Times, which had prepared an obituary,\u000alearned of his death on Friday.)_For more than a half-century, David Stoliar\u000aremained a silent witness to the worst civilian maritime disaster of World War\u000aII, the only survivor among nearly 800 Jews fleeing the Holocaust in Romania\u000aaboard a refugee ship that was barred from Palestine, interned by Turkey for\u000amonths, set adrift without power and torpedoed by a Soviet submarine in the\u000aBlack Sea in 1942.The sinking of the overloaded ship, a 150-foot steamer\u000acalled the Struma, was a calamity compounded by Britain\u2019s refusal to admit the\u000arefugees into Palestine and by Turkey\u2019s 71-day quarantine, ending with the\u000avessel being towed out to sea. The coup de grâce was fired by the submarine as\u000athe ship lay dead in the water seven miles offshore.The doomed voyage of the\u000aStruma might have been a forgotten footnote to Holocaust history had it not\u000abeen for Mr. Stoliar\u2019s survival and his willingness years later to attest to\u000athe indifference and brutal decisions that put Palestine out of reach and led\u000ato the deaths of hundreds at the hands of nominal allies against Hitler.Mr.\u000aStoliar died on May 1, 2014, at his home in Bend, Ore., at the age of 91, his\u000awife, Marda, said. News of his death was not widely reported, although a short\u000aitem appeared in The Oregonian. The loss of the Struma, and Mr. Stoliar\u2019s\u000asurvival, were largely unknown until the turn of the century, when he spoke to\u000aa New York Times reporter.The war in Europe had been underway for two years\u000aand Jews in Romania, their numbers swollen by refugees from Czechoslovakia,\u000aAustria and Hungary, were perishing under the nation\u2019s fascist Iron Guard.\u000aThousands hoped for passage out of Constanza, Romania\u2019s port on the Black Sea,\u000aand through the Bosporus to Palestine. Their desperation was ripe for\u000aexploitation.On Dec. 11, 1941, the Struma left Constanza with more than 790\u000aRomanian, Bulgarian and Russian Jews \u2014 the number is still disputed \u2014 crammed\u000ainto a squalid, leaky former cattle boat with bunks stacked 10 high, little\u000afood or fresh water, no kitchen and only eight toilets. There were no life\u000apreservers and just two small lifeboats. The crew of 10 were mostly\u000aBulgarians.Passengers paid up to $1,000 each, gouged by a charlatan who lied\u000aabout the ship\u2019s seaworthiness and visas, which were never provided. Mr.\u000aStoliar\u2019s father, a textile manufacturer, paid his passage. When the engine\u000afailed a few miles out, the captain of a passing tug repaired it in exchange\u000afor the passengers\u2019 wedding rings, their last valuables.Three days later, as\u000athe Struma limped toward Turkey, the engines failed again. Turkish tugs towed\u000ait into the Bosporus, the divide of Europe and Asia. Neutral Turkey, whose\u000aleaders feared angering either Britain or Germany, interned the Struma\u000aoffshore while its fate was considered. Istanbul\u2019s Jews donated food, but\u000aconditions onboard deteriorated as talks dragged on.Britain, which had control\u000aof Palestine, limited Jewish immigration to avoid antagonizing the Arabs, and\u000arefused to let the passengers continue without visas. Ten were allowed to\u000adisembark in Istanbul: a woman who suffered a miscarriage, and nine others\u000ahelped by an American oil executive, the Jewish Agency in Palestine and a\u000aTurkish Jew who aided refugees.Finally, the Turks cut the Struma\u2019s anchor,\u000atowed the ship back into the Black Sea and set it adrift. It was spotted the\u000anext day by a Soviet sub, identified years later as SC-213. Its commander had\u000astanding orders from Stalin to sink all neutral ships in the Black Sea to\u000aprevent supplies from reaching Germany.Despite the target\u2019s benign profile, a\u000atorpedo was fired at it dawn on Feb. 24, 1942. In a gray overcast, it struck\u000aamidships with an explosion that tore the Struma apart.Most of the passengers\u000aand crew went down with the groaning ship in 250 feet of water. But scores\u000amore, including Mr. Stoliar, 19, who had been asleep in a deckhouse, were\u000ahurled into the sea with a rain of debris, mostly planking from the shattered\u000adeck.After years of silence, Mr. Stoliar told the story in 2000 in an\u000ainterview with Douglas Frantz, then a reporter for The Times.\u201cI was one of the\u000alucky ones who was blown up into the air, and I fell into the sea,\u201d Mr.\u000aStoliar said. \u201cWhen I came to the surface, there was nothing except a\u000atremendous amount of debris and many, many people swimming in the water. It\u000awas very, very cold, and we had a hard time moving our feet and our hands.\u201dMr.\u000aFrantz and Catherine Collins later recounted the sinking in a 2003 book,\u000a\u201cDeath on the Black Sea.\u201d Mr. Stoliar told them he saw people screaming and\u000athrashing in waves strewn with kindling. Many were clinging to a partly\u000asubmerged section of the wooden deck, with cables and twisted metal from the\u000aship\u2019s railing attached to it.He swam to the group, still clad in his heavy\u000aleather jacket, grabbed the railing and looked about at the terrified faces,\u000ashivering and sobbing in the cold. There was nothing to do but hang on. Hours\u000apassed and the cries gradually faded as people succumbed to hypothermia and\u000aexhaustion. Some floated off, others slipped into the deep.One man lost his\u000agrip, grabbed Mr. Stoliar by the collar and dragged him under. But Mr. Stoliar\u000abroke free and regained his hold as the man sank out of sight. Soon birds\u000aappeared, flying over the corpses. As the dead drifted away, the decking grew\u000alighter and rose in the water. Mr. Stoliar, a strong youth, dragged himself on\u000atop.In the afternoon, the Struma\u2019s first mate, Lazar Ivanof Dikof, floated by\u000aon a door. Mr. Stoliar pulled him onto his raft of wreckage. He told Mr.\u000aStoliar of seeing the torpedo\u2019s approach. In the numbing cold, they were\u000asurrounded by floating bodies. No one else appeared to be alive as night fell,\u000aand in the morning Mr. Dikof, too, was dead.Alone now, Mr. Stoliar thought of\u000agiving up. He took out a jackknife to slit his wrists, but his fingers were\u000atoo numb to open the blade. A short while later, about 24 hours after the\u000aStruma had sunk, a large ship appeared in the distance. He waved frantically,\u000aand saw figures on deck waving back.Soon a rowboat approached. He was pulled\u000aaboard, wrapped in blankets and taken to a Turkish fishing village. His hands\u000aand feet were frostbitten. He was hospitalized in Istanbul, then jailed for\u000asix weeks, apparently to keep him from the news media. Referring to the Turks,\u000ahe recalled, \u201cI was the only witness to their inhumanity, really, from the\u000abeginning to the end.\u201dDavid Stoliar was born in Kishinev, Romania, on Oct. 31,\u000a1922, the son of Jacob Stoliar, a Jewish textile manufacturer in Bucharest.\u000aHis parents were divorced when he was 10, and he lived with his mother in\u000aParis for several years.In 1936, he returned to Bucharest and finished high\u000aschool. He wanted to become an engineer, but the war intervened. He was taken\u000afor forced labor, digging trenches. As brutality against Jews spread, his\u000afather tried to save him by arranging his passage aboard the Struma.For months\u000athe ship\u2019s sinking became a rallying cry for Jews around the world. It\u000agenerated protests, a general strike in Palestine, death threats against\u000aBritish officials and responses by Turkey and Britain that voiced regrets but\u000adenied responsibility.Mr. Stoliar reached Palestine eventually and joined the\u000aBritish Army\u2019s Jewish Brigade in 1943, serving in Egypt and Libya. He also\u000afought with the Israeli Army in the 1948 war of independence. He became an oil\u000aexecutive in the early 1950s and lived in Japan for 18 years.In 1945 he\u000amarried Adria Nacmias. They had one son, Ronnie. His wife died in 1961. In\u000a1968 he married Marda Emslie. Besides his wife, he was survived by his son and\u000aa granddaughter.Mr. Stoliar moved to Oregon in 1971 and later retired. For\u000adecades he said nothing about the Struma, whose sinking was largely forgotten,\u000anoted mainly in scholarly books. But interest was revived in 2000, when Greg\u000aBuxton, a Briton whose grandparents had died onboard, organized a successful\u000asearch for the vessel, which they photographed.Mr. Stoliar spoke to newspapers\u000aand magazines and appeared in a 2001 documentary, \u201cThe Struma,\u201d by the\u000aCanadian director Simcha Jacobovici. \u201cFor 58 years, no one asked me about the\u000aStruma,\u201d he said, \u201cand I felt that no one cared. I carried the memories in my\u000ahead as if it happened yesterday.\u201d\u000a\u000a

V**It was a grisly start** to the new era for Libya, broadcast around the world. The dictator was dragged from the sewer pipe where he was hiding, tossed around by frenzied rebel soldiers, beaten bloody and sodomized with a bayonet. A shaky cellphone video showed the pocked face of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, \u201cthe Leader\u201d who had terrified Libyans for four decades, looking frightened and bewildered. He would soon be dead.The first news reports of Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s capture and killing in October 2011 reached the secretary of state in Kabul, Afghanistan, where she had just sat down for a televised interview. \u201cWow!\u201d she said, looking at an aide\u2019s BlackBerry before cautiously noting that the report had not yet been confirmed. But Hillary Clinton seemed impatient for a conclusion to the multinational military intervention she had done so much to organize, and in a rare unguarded moment, she dropped her reserve.\u201cWe came, we saw, he died!\u201d she exclaimed.Two days before, Mrs. Clinton had taken a triumphal tour of the Libyan capital, Tripoli, and for weeks top aides had been circulating a \u201cticktock\u201d that described her starring role in the events that had led to this moment. The timeline, her top policy aide, Jake Sullivan, wrote, demonstrated Mrs. Clinton\u2019s \u201cleadership/ownership/stewardship of this country\u2019s Libya policy from start to finish.\u201d The memo\u2019s language put her at the center of everything: \u201cHRC announces \u2026 HRC directs \u2026 HRC travels \u2026 HRC engages,\u201d it read.It was a brag sheet for a cabinet member eyeing a presidential race, and the Clinton team\u2019s eagerness to claim credit for her prompted eye-rolling at the White House and the Pentagon. Some joked that to hear her aides tell it, she had practically called in the airstrikes herself.But there were plenty of signs that the triumph would be short-lived, that the vacuum left by Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s death invited violence and division.In fact, on the same August day that Mr. Sullivan had compiled his laudatory memo, the State Department\u2019s top Middle East hand, Jeffrey D. Feltman, had sent a lengthy email with an utterly different tone about what he had seen on his own visit to Libya.The country\u2019s interim leaders seemed shockingly disengaged, he wrote. Mahmoud Jibril, the acting prime minister, who had helped persuade Mrs. Clinton to back the opposition, was commuting from Qatar, making only \u201ccameo\u201d appearances. A leading rebel general had been assassinated, underscoring the hazard of \u201crevenge killings.\u201d Islamists were moving aggressively to seize power, and members of the anti-Qaddafi coalition, notably Qatar, were financing them.On a task of the utmost urgency, disarming the militia fighters who had dethroned the dictator but now threatened the nation\u2019s unity, Mr. Feltman reported an alarming lassitude. Mr. Jibril and his associates, he wrote, \u201ctried to avert their eyes\u201d from the problem that militias could pose on \u201cthe Day After.\u201dIn short, the well-intentioned men who now nominally ran Libya were relying on \u201cluck, tribal discipline and the \u2018gentle character\u2019 of the Libyan people\u201d for a peaceful future. \u201cWe will continue to push on this,\u201d he wrote.In the ensuing months, Mr. Feltman\u2019s memo would prove hauntingly prescient. But Libya\u2019s Western allies, preoccupied by domestic politics and the crisis in Syria, would soon relegate the country to the back burner.And Mrs. Clinton would be mostly a bystander as the country dissolved into chaos, leading to a civil war that would destabilize the region, fueling the refugee crisis in Europe and allowing the Islamic State to establish a Libyan haven that the United States is now desperately trying to contain.\u201cNobody will say it\u2019s too late. No one wants to say it,\u201d said Mahmud Shammam, who served as chief spokesman for the interim government. \u201cBut I\u2019m afraid there is very little time left for Libya.\u201dMedia reports referred to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s one brief visit to Libya in October 2011 as a \u201cvictory lap,\u201d but the declaration was decidedly premature. Security precautions were extraordinary, with ships positioned off the coast in case an emergency evacuation was needed. As it turned out, there was no violence. But the wild celebratory scenes in the Libyan capital that day actually highlighted the divisions in the new order.At a hospital, a university and government offices, Mrs. Clinton posed for photos with the Western-educated interim leaders and hailed the promise of democracy.\u201cI am proud to stand here on the soil of a free Libya,\u201d she declared, standing alongside a beaming Mr. Jibril. \u201cIt is a great privilege to see a new future for Libya being born. And indeed, the work ahead is quite challenging, but the Libyan people have demonstrated the resolve and resilience necessary to achieve their goals.\u201dBut everywhere Mrs. Clinton went, there was the other face of the rebellion. Crowds of Kalashnikov-toting fighters \u2014 the thuwar, or revolutionaries, as they called themselves \u2014 mobbed her motorcade and pushed to glimpse the American celebrity. Mostly they cheered, and Mrs. Clinton remained poised and unrattled, but her security detail watched the pandemonium with white-knuckled concern.At the University of Tripoli, students were trampling wall hangings of Colonel Qaddafi that had been pulled to the ground, recalled Harold Koh, the State Department\u2019s top lawyer, who had flown in with Mrs. Clinton on an American military aircraft. One grateful student pointed out the gallows where anti-Qaddafi protesters had been hanged, while others wondered what the United States might do to help win the peace.\u201cWe know what the U.S. can do with bombs,\u201d one student told Mr. Koh. \u201cWhat else can you do?\u201dWhen Mrs. Clinton\u2019s entourage finally departed, Gene A. Cretz, the American ambassador, wrote a relieved email to Cheryl Mills, the secretary of state\u2019s chief of staff. The visit, he wrote, had been \u201cpicture perfect given the chaos we labor under in Libya.\u201dMrs. Clinton certainly understood how hard the transition to a post-Qaddafi Libya would be. In February, before the allied bombing began, she noted that political change in Egypt had proved tumultuous despite strong institutions."So imagine how difficult it will be in a country like Libya,\u201d she had said. \u201cQaddafi ruled for 42 years by basically destroying all institutions and never even creating an army, so that it could not be used against him.\u201dEarly on, the president\u2019s national security adviser, Tom Donilon, had created a planning group called \u201cPost-Q.\u201d Mrs. Clinton helped organize the Libya Contact Group, a powerhouse collection of countries that had pledged to work for a stable and prosperous future. By early 2012, she had flown to a dozen international meetings on Libya, part of a grueling schedule of official travel in which she kept competitive track of miles traveled and countries visited.Dennis B. Ross, a veteran Middle East expert at the National Security Council, had argued unsuccessfully for an outside peacekeeping force. But with oil beginning to flow again from Libyan wells, he was pleasantly surprised by how things seemed to be going.\u201cI had unease that there wasn\u2019t more being done more quickly to create cohesive security forces,\u201d Mr. Ross said. \u201cBut the last six months of 2011, there was a fair amount of optimism.\u201dEven so, the gulf separating the suave English speakers of the interim government from the thuwar was becoming more and more pronounced.After decades in exile, some leaders were more familiar with American and European universities than with Libyan tribes and the militias that had sprung from them. Others, like Mr. Jibril, were suspect in some quarters because of previous roles in the Qaddafi regime. It was increasingly evident that the ragtag populist army that had actually done the fighting against Colonel Qaddafi was not taking orders from the men in suits who believed they were Libya\u2019s new leaders.\u201cIt should have been clear to anyone,\u201d said Mohammed Ali Abdallah, an opposition member who now heads a leading political party, \u201cthat there were clear contradictions in the makeup of the opposition and that unity could not last.\u201dJeremy Shapiro, who handled Libya on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s policy staff, said the administration was looking for \u201cthe unifier \u2014 the Nelson Mandela.\u201d He added: \u201cThat was why Jibril was so attractive. We were always saying, \u2018This is the guy who can appeal to all the factions.\u2019 What we should have been looking for \u2014 but we were never good at playing that game \u2014 is a power balance.\u201dUnder the circumstances, Libya\u2019s push for elections by July 2012, nine months after Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s death, appeared to some to be premature. But the schedule fulfilled the opposition\u2019s promises to the West and had the backing of competing factions.\u201cSuddenly you had people who belonged to political parties,\u201d said Abdurrazag Mukhtar, a member of the interim government who lived in California for many years and is now Libya\u2019s ambassador to Turkey. \u201cThe Muslim Brotherhood. Jibril. All these guys thinking, \u2018Time for an election.\u2019\u201d\u201cBut we were not ready,\u201d he said. \u201cYou needed a road map for security first.\u201dBy January 2012, there was an unmistakable drumbeat of trouble.His popularity sagging, Mr. Jibril had stepped down as transitional prime minister. A prominent Muslim scholar had accused him of guiding the nation toward a \u201cnew era of tyranny and dictatorship.\u201d In a deal struck between two powerful militias, he was replaced by Abdurrahim el-Keib, an engineering professor who had taught for years at the University of Alabama.On Jan. 5, Mrs. Clinton\u2019s old friend and adviser Sidney Blumenthal emailed her with the latest in a series of behind-the-scenes reports on Libya, largely written by a retired C.I.A. officer, Tyler Drumheller, who died last year.The memo detailed the roiling tensions between Islamists and secularists over the role of Islamic law, fighting between rival militias associated with two different towns and four visits to Mr. Keib\u2019s office by \u201cangry militiamen\u201d demanding concessions.Mr. Keib, the email said, \u201cbelieves that if he does not disarm the militias and meet their demands in the next six months, there is a good chance of increased fighting among rival groups that could lead to civil war.\u201d Mrs. Clinton forwarded the message to Mr. Sullivan, her policy aide, with a single comment: \u201cWorrying.\u201dSuch alarming reports might have been expected to spur action in Washington. They did not.After Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s fall, with minimal violence and friendly interim leadership, Libya had moved quickly off the top of the administration\u2019s agenda. The regular situation room meetings on Libya, often including the president, simply stopped. The revolt in Syria, in the heart of the Middle East and with nearly four times Libya\u2019s population, took center stage.Libya, Mr. Ross said, \u201cwas farmed out to the working level.\u201dThe inattention was not just neglect. It was policy.\u201cThe president was like, \u2018We are not looking to do another Iraq,\u2019\u201d said Derek Chollet, then handling Libya for the National Security Council. \u201cAnd by the way, the Europeans were all along saying: \u2018No, no, no, we\u2019re doing this. We got it. We believe in Libya. This is in our neighborhood.\u2019\u201dSo the president and the National Security Council set what one official called \u201cfierce limits\u201d on the American role: The United States would provide help only when it could offer a unique capability, only when Libya explicitly requested the services and only when Libya paid for them with its oil revenue. In practice, those conditions meant the United States would do very little.And though the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the British prime minister, David Cameron, visited Libya together, they, too, were soon distracted, by re-election campaigns and economic worries.The neglect was made easier by the Libyans themselves. Displaying both naïveté and nationalism, the interim leaders insisted, at least in public, that they wanted no outside interference. They were so wary of foreign troops that they refused to let the United Nations maintain a basic security force to protect its compound.\u201cThey were very keen to take responsibility for their country,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cAnd we were very keen to let them, for our own reasons. So there was a sort of conspiracy there.\u201dAs the months passed and the factional fighting grew worse, Mrs. Clinton pressed for the administration to do more, asking the Pentagon, for example, to help train security forces. But she was boxed in by the president\u2019s strictures and the Libyans\u2019 resistance.\u201cIt\u2019s like you\u2019re twisting yourself into a pretzel to try to say, \u2018O.K., we won\u2019t have boots on the ground, but we know we got to do something,\u2019\u201d Mr. Ross said.Even modest proposals foundered. When Mrs. Clinton proposed sending a hospital ship to treat wounded Libyan fighters, the National Security Council rejected the idea, aides said.But whatever her misgivings, Mrs. Clinton prized her relationship with the president and respected his authority to set policy. So she went along, as disciplined as ever.Andrew Shapiro was trying to make the best of a bad situation. He had to explain what the United States was doing to secure the vast military arsenal that Colonel Qaddafi had left behind \u2014 a notable exception to the hands-off policy.Speaking in Washington in February 2012, Mr. Shapiro, the assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, described efforts to \u201cgalvanize an international response\u201d to find and destroy arms caches. But he acknowledged that the $40 million program Mrs. Clinton had announced was not going as well as hoped, even when it came to the most worrisome weapons, the Manpads, shoulder-fired missiles capable of shooting down an airliner.\u201cHow many are still missing? The frank answer is we don\u2019t know and probably never will,\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. \u201cWe cannot rule out that some weapons may have leaked out of Libya.\u201dThe covert coals-to-Newcastle effort to arm the rebels during the revolution was the least of it. The dictator had stashed an astonishing quantity of weapons in the desert.\u201cWe knew he had a lot, but he had 10 times that,\u201d said Jean-David Levitte, then a top aide to Mr. Sarkozy.While the C.I.A. moved quickly to secure Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s chemical weapons, other efforts fell short. \u201cThere was one arsenal that we thought had 20,000 shoulder-fired, surface-to-air missiles, SA-7s, that basically just disappeared into the maw of the Middle East and North Africa,\u201d recalled Robert M. Gates, the American defense secretary at the time.A major stumbling block was that the Obama administration was negotiating with interim Libyan ministers as if they represented a unified government. In fact, they were often rivals, jockeying for power in advance of the elections.\u201cI know this sounds incredible, but for months and months and months on end we could not get anyone in authority in the government to just sign an agreement on anything, including our detailed offers of security assistance,\u201d said Antony J. Blinken, then the top security aide to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cThere was total paralysis.\u201dWhen it came to securing weapons, the Americans\u2019 initial idea \u2014 to give the interim government assistance to buy them back itself \u2014 foundered when the Libyan ministers failed to carry out the program, several Libyan officials said.So the State Department, working with the C.I.A., was left to try to strike its own deals with the militias. But there was little incentive to sell. As Mr. Shammam, the former spokesman for the interim government, put it: \u201cHow are you going to buy a Kalashnikov for $1,000? With a Kalashnikov, someone can make $1,000 a day kidnapping people.\u201dWorse, the program created an incentive for militias to import weapons to sell to the Americans, said Ali Zeidan, an adviser to the interim government who would inherit the problem in November 2012 when he became prime minister.\u201cIf you want to buy weapons, you have to control the border,\u201d Mr. Zeidan said, adding that the failure to do that led fighters to \u201csell them, get more and sell them again.\u201dAsked by a reporter that spring why it was so difficult for the United States to \u201cget it right\u201d when it intervened in the Middle East, Mrs. Clinton was still holding up Libya as a model of success. \u201cI would take issue with the premise of that question,\u201d said Mrs. Clinton, who declined to be interviewed for these articles.But she was well aware of the deteriorating security situation.In a February 2012 report, Amnesty International had called Libya\u2019s militias \u201cout of control.\u201d The same month, Mr. Cretz, the American ambassador, warned in an email that the July elections would take place \u201cin the context of militia control.\u201d\u201cContinuing rivalries among the militias remain dangerous from the perspective of the havoc they can wreak with their firepower,\u201d he wrote to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s policy adviser, Mr. Sullivan, who sent it on to her.In Mrs. Clinton\u2019s inner circle, the boasting about her achievements in Libya had given way to a \u201cnagging worry that it would go south,\u201d one senior aide said. The aide recalled being instructed jokingly by Mr. Sullivan \u201cto make sure that didn\u2019t happen\u201d before the American presidential election in November.So when Libyans went to the polls on July 7, in what international observers characterized as a fair election with high turnout and little violence, Mrs. Clinton and other advocates of the intervention were relieved. In the wake of the Arab Spring in Egypt and Tunisia, voters had chosen Islamist-led governments. But in Libya, the winning coalition consisted of Western-friendly political parties led by Mr. Jibril.The next month, with crowds in Tripoli chanting that the \u201cblood of the martyrs will not be wasted,\u201d power was handed over to the newly elected General National Congress, the first peaceful transition in Libya\u2019s history.Mrs. Clinton, who one aide said privately shared the worry that the country was not ready for elections, nevertheless congratulated the Libyans on \u201cthis historic milestone.\u201d\u201cNow the hard work really begins to build an effective, transparent government that unifies the country,\u201d she said.But unity was already impossible.\u201cIn a sense it was lost from the beginning,\u201d said Gérard Araud, France\u2019s ambassador to the United States and an early advocate of the intervention. \u201cIt was the same mistake you made in Iraq. You organize elections in a country with no experience of compromise or political parties. So you have an election, and you think that everything is solved. But eventually tribal realities come back to haunt the country.\u201dWhile the Americans struggled against weapons proliferation and hoped for the best, a former rebel officer took on the problem at the core of Libya\u2019s predicament: disbanding the volatile forces that had ousted Colonel Qaddafi and helping the fighters find a place in a peaceful new Libya. The officer, M. Mustafa El Sagezli, would never meet Mrs. Clinton. But the outcome of his lonely campaign would decide to a considerable degree Libya's place in her record as secretary of state.As deputy commander of the February 17 Martyrs Brigade, one of the largest and most capable rebel militias, Mr. Sagezli had tried his best to look after his recruits. It was, he felt, an obligation that did not end with the revolution.Shortly after Colonel Qaddafi was killed, Mr. Sagezli had gathered a group of fighters in Benghazi. A businessman with degrees from Utah State University and the London School of Economics, he knew the rebel militias had been organized along Libya\u2019s deepest fault lines: tribal divisions, regional loyalties and differing stances on Islam\u2019s proper role. Yet the country could not progress unless the militias were reintegrated into civil society and replaced by a regular army.\u201cWhat do you need?\u201d he asked the fighters. \u201cWhat are your dreams?\u201dTheir modest answers surprised and encouraged him.\u201cSome were very simple dreams,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Help us get married.\u2019 Some wanted a scholarship.\u201dThe transitional government soon set up a Warriors Affairs Commission, headed by Mr. Sagezli. Many of the 162,000 former fighters it registered were illiterate and needed education. Some wanted to join a police force or a new army, but nearly half hoped to start small businesses.Mr. Sagezli said he had taken a proposal to the transitional government: The Labor Ministry could help would-be businessmen, the Interior Ministry could train customs and police officers, the Defense Ministry would absorb others into a national army, and so on.It was ambitious, but the government had plenty of money; Mrs. Clinton had worked hard to free up billions of dollars in Libyan assets that had been frozen by anti-Qaddafi sanctions. Her view, said one top aide, was that if the interim government \u201ccouldn\u2019t rule by force, let them rule by finance.\u201dBut instead of giving priority to demobilizing the militias, as an aide said Mrs. Clinton had hoped, the transitional regime simply began paying fighters salaries that many viewed as protection money. In one illustrative incident in May 2012, Kikla militiamen stormed the office of Mr. Keib, the interim prime minister, demanding back pay as gunfire filled the air.\u201cDon\u2019t give them salaries for nothing,\u201d Mr. Sagezli recalls begging. \u201cGiving a commander money means giving strength to the militias, more loyalty for the commander, more armaments and more corruption. They never listened.\u201d Instead, he said, \u201cthe politicians started bribing them to buy loyalty.\u201dWith the July elections, precedent became political imperative.In the run-up to the vote, a powerful militia shut down roads to press its demand that its eastern Libyan region have a greater say when the incoming Parliament drafted a constitution. The authorities capitulated, leaving the writing of the constitution for a second assembly to be elected later, with more seats from the east.That, in turn, made it harder to disarm the militias, since each faction and town knew its weapons might be needed to protect its interests in the constitutional process. That was how the game would be played.Mr. Zeidan, who became prime minister in November 2012, financed a few of Mr. Sagezli\u2019s programs. But he continued to pay off militia leaders. Political parties aligned themselves with various commanders, and with no army or police force to carry out their will, the elected officials became increasingly dependent on the fighters extorting them.Haig Melkessetian, a former American intelligence operative whose company provided security for European embassies in Libya, described militia rule as \u201canarchy \u2014 there\u2019s just no other word for it.\u201d\u201cWe had to have five or six IDs to be able to pass, depending on the street,\u201d he said.Assassinations and \u201cthe worst kind of vigilantism\u201d became commonplace, said Sarah Leah Whitson, who was tracking abuses in Libya for Human Rights Watch. One militia leader told her, \u201cThe G.N.C. may have had electoral legitimacy, but we have revolutionary legitimacy.\u201dMr. Sagezli said he had discussed the difficulties with United Nations representatives and with the new American ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens. \u201cI kept asking them for support,\u201d he recalled.But if there was any pressure from American or European officials to stop the government payoffs, he said, \u201cit wasn\u2019t loud enough.\u201dThe American ambassador was hearing it from both sides.Officials from Libya\u2019s moderate governing coalition were demanding that the United States stop the wealthy nation of Qatar from sending money and arms to militias aligned with Libya\u2019s Islamist political bloc. The Islamists, in turn, were accusing a rival gulf power, the United Arab Emirates, of providing similar patronage to fighters aligned with their political enemies.The shipments violated a United Nations arms embargo. But Mr. Stevens told Mr. Abdallah, the Libyan party chief, that when he raised the issue with his Qatari and Emirati counterparts, he was met either with outright denials or with protestations that the shipments had gone through blessed official channels, namely government ministers aligned with various factions.\u201cWhen I go to the U.A.E., they say, \u2018I\u2019m dealing with the minister of defense \u2014 how much more official can I get?\u2019\u201d Mr. Abdallah recalled the ambassador saying.It was bad enough that Libya\u2019s elected officials lacked the will to force militias to lay down the arms they already possessed. Now, with Libya veering toward civil war, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates \u2014 waging a broader war for influence throughout the region \u2014 were providing opposing militia commanders with back-channel resupply routes.In Washington, though, it was the Islamists\u2019 patrons, the Qataris, who were of paramount concern.During the 2011 Libyan revolution, Mrs. Clinton had successfully pushed the administration to take a direct role in arming opposition groups, hoping that would persuade the Qataris to stop sending weapons to extremist rebel factions. Though that clearly had not worked, she explored a similar play as she wrangled with what to do about \u201cthe Qatar problem\u201d in 2012, aides said.Mrs. Clinton was already pushing for an aggressive American program to arm and train Syrian rebels trying to topple President Bashar al-Assad. What if she could secure what one top aide called a \u201cbank shot\u201d deal in which the United States would provide assistance to certain of Qatar\u2019s allies in Syria in return for Qatar\u2019s dropping its support for Islamist militias in Libya?But Mrs. Clinton\u2019s activist streak ran up against President Obama\u2019s deep wariness of further entanglement in the Middle East, and she lost the debate on arming the Syrian opposition. With no carrot to offer the Qataris, she asked aides to prepare a memo on how the United States might wield a stick.Mrs. Clinton typically relied heavily on a tiny circle of close advisers. But facing a thorny problem, she sometimes convened a larger group, 15 or more aides, in her outer office, where her long sofa sat beneath a window with a view of the Lincoln Memorial.\u201cShe really liked to get people to think through the what-if pieces \u2014 what if we do this, what are the consequences of doing that, and exploring alternatives,\u201d said James B. Steinberg, her deputy secretary of state.Some advisers suggested trimming military aid to Qatar or threatening to move American military assets elsewhere in the region. But Middle East hands at the State Department pushed back, saying that pressuring the gulf monarchy would only backfire. And the Defense Department strongly objected: It had a 20-year history of close cooperation with Qatar, which hosted critical American military bases.In the end, there was no appetite for anything beyond quiet diplomacy. \u201cWe didn\u2019t do nearly enough,\u201d said Mr. Ross, who also explored ways to \u201craise the price\u201d on Qatar, to no avail.Only last year did President Obama rebuke the nations meddling in Libya, and by then it was too late.\u201cThey created the monsters we are dealing with today,\u201d Mr. Abdallah said, \u201cwhich is these militias that are so empowered they will never subordinate themselves to any government.\u201dOn Aug. 8, 2012, a month after the elections, Mr. Stevens, the American ambassador, signed off on a cable sent to Washington titled "The Guns of August,\u201d playing on the title of a classic history of the first days of World War I. It described Benghazi as moving \u201cfrom trepidation to euphoria and back as a series of violent incidents has dominated the political landscape\u201d and warned of \u201ca security vacuum.\u201dNo American official knew Libya better. He would pay with his life for his determination to see Libya\u2019s tumultuous reality up close. A month after the cable was sent, Islamist extremists attacked the United States mission in Benghazi, and Mr. Stevens was one of four Americans killed.In the assaults on the diplomatic compound and nearby C.I.A. annex, the most worrisome trends in the country came together: the feeble central government, the breakdown of law and order, the rise of militants and the months of minimal attention from Washington. Republicans quickly seized on the episode for what would become years of inquiries, hearings and fund-raising focused on Mrs. Clinton.Still, in her last months at the State Department, Mrs. Clinton rode a wave of popularity, bolstered by an Internet meme called \u201cTexts From Hillary.\u201d Its emblem was a photograph of the secretary of state gazing through dark glasses at her BlackBerry. Few knew that it had been taken aboard the military transport plane taking her to Libya in those heady days after the dictator\u2019s fall.If the attempt to pin blame for the Benghazi attack on Mrs. Clinton would largely fail, the notion that the Libyan intervention was among her successes had become steadily more threadbare. Libya would not conform, either as cudgel or brag, to the needs of American politics.As she exited the State Department in February 2013, factional violence, which would break into open civil war in 2014, was on the rise. The flow of refugees paying smugglers for a hazardous trip across the Mediterranean was swelling. And the Libyan chaos would give rise to two rival governments \u2014 one backed by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, the other by Qatar, Turkey and Sudan \u2014 providing sanctuary to extremists, soon to be joined by emissaries of the Islamic State.The weapons that had made it so hard to stabilize Libya were turning up in Syria, Tunisia, Algeria, Mali, Niger, Chad, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, Egypt and Gaza, often in the hands of terrorists, insurgents or criminals.In the fall of 2012, American intelligence agencies produced a classified assessment of the proliferation of arms from Libya. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Oh, my God,\u2019\u201d said Michael T. Flynn, then head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. \u201cWe\u2019ve not had that kind of proliferation of weapons since really the end of the Vietnam War.\u201dA cynical line would begin to circulate in Washington: In Iraq, the United States had intervened and occupied \u2014 and things had gone to hell. In Libya, the United States had intervened but not occupied \u2014 and things had gone to hell. And in Syria, the United States had neither intervened nor occupied \u2014 and things had still gone to hell.It was a dark jest designed to shift blame from baffled American policy makers to a troubled region. But it raised a serious question about Libya: If overthrowing a hated dictator in a small and relatively rich country produced such epic troubles, was American intervention ever justified?\u201cIt\u2019s true that things went wrong,\u201d said Mr. Sagezli, of the warriors commission. \u201cBut from a Libyan point of view, things could not go right. We had 42 years of Qaddafi\u2019s rule, no infrastructure, a terrible education system, thousands of political prisoners, divisions among tribes, destruction of the army. When you have such a state, when you take out the dictator, it\u2019s like taking the cover off the pot.\u201dGiven that background, Ms. Whitson, who monitored Libya for Human Rights Watch, thought the United States\u2019 failure to follow up was unforgivable.\u201cIf you are going to carry out a military intervention to decapitate the government, you are making a commitment to the stability of that country over the long haul,\u201d she said. \u201cDoing nothing, as we did here? A bunch of eighth graders can agree that is not an approach that is going to work.\u201dThe history that Mrs. Clinton often cited should have been instructive, Ms. Whitson said. \u201cIn Bosnia, yes, we intervened. But there\u2019s been peacekeeping troops there for 20 years,\u201d she said.Strikingly, President Obama said in 2014 that such criticism was just, and that Libya had provided his biggest lesson in foreign policy.He did not regret the intervention, he told Thomas L. Friedman, the New York Times columnist, because without Colonel Qaddafi\u2019s overthrow, \u201cLibya would have been like Syria, right? Because Qaddafi was not going to be able to contain what had been unleashed there.\u201dBut Mr. Obama said the United States and its allies \u201cunderestimated the need to come in full force\u201d after the dictator\u2019s fall. The Libyan experience, he said, is \u201ca lesson that I now apply every time I ask the question: Should we intervene militarily? Do we have an answer for the day after?\u201dLibya, aides say, has strongly reinforced the president\u2019s reluctance to move more decisively in Syria. \u201cLiterally, this has given him pause about what would be required if you eliminated the Syrian state,\u201d a top adviser said.Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, pushed for greater American involvement early in the Syrian civil war and has repeatedly called for a no-fly zone, a move Mr. Obama has so far rejected. The lessons of the Libya experience have not tempered her more aggressive approach to international crises.While remaining political allies, the president and his former top diplomat have taken revealing shots at each other. In a rare flash of emotion after leaving office, Mrs. Clinton derided the president\u2019s guiding principle in foreign relations: \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid stuff.\u201d\u201cGreat nations need organizing principles, and \u2018Don\u2019t do stupid stuff\u2019 is not an organizing principle,\u201d she said in a 2014 interview with The Atlantic.Last fall, frustrated with calls for greater American involvement in Syria, Mr. Obama dismissed them as \u201chalf-baked\u201d and \u201cmumbo jumbo.\u201d Asked whether those labels applied to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s proposals, the president denied it, not entirely convincingly.When asked to defend her record on Libya, Mrs. Clinton has taken a line quite the opposite of her aides\u2019 previous insistence on her central role in the intervention. \u201cAt the end of the day, this was the president\u2019s decision,\u201d she told a House committee in October.She has said the military alliance that overthrew Colonel Qaddafi represented \u201csmart power at its best,\u201d but called Libya \u201ca classic case of a hard choice.\u201d Mostly, she has insisted that history\u2019s judgment on the intervention, and her role in it, are not yet final.\u201cI think it sometimes shows American impatience,\u201d she said in 2014, \u201cthat, \u2018O.K., you got rid of this dictator who destroyed institutions. Why aren\u2019t you behaving like a mature democracy?\u2019 That doesn\u2019t happen overnight.\u201dYet if, for Mr. Obama, the Libyan experience has underscored doubts about the United States\u2019 power to shape outcomes in other countries, it has demonstrated for Mrs. Clinton just how crucial an American presence can be.\u201cWe have learned the hard way when America is absent, especially from unstable places, there are consequences,\u201d she said at a House hearing on Benghazi in October, articulating what sounded like a guiding principle. \u201cExtremism takes root, aggressors seek to fill the vacuum, and security everywhere is threatened, including here at home.\u201d_Read Part 1 of our examination of the American intervention in Libya and Hillary Clinton\u2019s role in it._\u000a\u000a

VDOHUK, Iraq \u2014 Locked inside a room where the only furniture was a bed, the 16\u000a-year-old learned to fear the sunset, because nightfall started the countdown\u000ato her next rape.During the year she was held by the Islamic State, she spent\u000aher days dreading the smell of the ISIS fighter\u2019s breath, the disgusting\u000asounds he made and the pain he inflicted on her body. More than anything, she\u000awas tormented by the thought she might become pregnant with her rapist\u2019s\u000achild.It was the one thing she needn\u2019t have worried about.Soon after buying\u000aher, the fighter brought the teenage girl a round box containing four strips\u000aof pills, one of them colored red.\u201cEvery day, I had to swallow one in front of\u000ahim. He gave me one box per month. When I ran out, he replaced it. When I was\u000asold from one man to another, the box of pills came with me,\u201d explained the\u000agirl, who learned only months later that she was being given birth control.It\u000ais a particularly modern solution to a medieval injunction: According to an\u000aobscure ruling in Islamic law cited by the Islamic State, a man must ensure\u000athat the woman he enslaves is free of child before having intercourse with\u000aher.Islamic State leaders have made sexual slavery as they believe it was\u000apracticed during the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s time integral to the group\u2019s\u000aoperations, preying on the women and girls the group captured from the Yazidi\u000areligious minority almost two years ago. To keep the sex trade running, the\u000afighters have aggressively pushed birth control on their victims so they can\u000acontinue the abuse unabated while the women are passed among them.More than\u000athree dozen Yazidi women who recently escaped the Islamic State and who agreed\u000ato be interviewed for this article described the numerous methods the fighters\u000aused to avoid pregnancy, including oral and injectable contraception, and\u000asometimes both. In at least one case, a woman was forced to have an abortion\u000ain order to make her available for sex, and others were pressured to do\u000aso.Some described how they knew they were about to be sold when they were\u000adriven to a hospital to give a urine sample to be tested for the hCG hormone,\u000awhose presence indicates pregnancy. They awaited their results with\u000aapprehension: A positive test would mean they were carrying their abuser\u2019s\u000achild; a negative result would allow Islamic State fighters to continue raping\u000athem.The rules have not been universally followed, with many women describing\u000abeing assaulted by men who were either ignorant of the injunction or defiant\u000aof it. But over all, the methodical use of birth control during at least some\u000aof the women\u2019s captivity explains what doctors caring for recent escapees\u000aobserved: Of the more than 700 rape victims from the Yazidi ethnic group who\u000ahave sought treatment so far at a United Nations-backed clinic in northern\u000aIraq, just 5 percent became pregnant during their enslavement, according to\u000aDr. Nagham Nawzat, the gynecologist carrying out the examinations.It is a\u000astunningly low figure given that the normal fertility rate for a young woman\u000ais between 20 percent and 25 percent in any given month, four to five times\u000athe rate that has been recorded so far, said Dr. Nezar Ismet Taib, who heads\u000athe Ministry of Health Directorate in Dohuk, which oversees the clinic where\u000athe victims are being treated.\u201cWe were expecting something much higher,\u201d he\u000asaid.The captured teenage girl, who agreed to be identified by her first\u000ainitial, M., has the demeanor of a child and wears her hair in a bouncy\u000aponytail. She was sold a total of seven times. When prospective buyers came to\u000ainquire about her, she overheard them asking for assurances that she was not\u000apregnant, and her owner provided the box of birth control as proof.That was\u000anot enough for the third man who bought her, she said. He quizzed her on the\u000adate of her last menstrual cycle and, unnerved by what he perceived as a\u000adelay, gave her a version of the so-called morning-after pill, causing her to\u000astart bleeding.Even then, he seemed unsatisfied.Finally he came into her room,\u000aclosed the door and ordered her to lower her pants. The teenager feared she\u000awas about to be raped. Instead he pulled out a syringe and gave her a shot on\u000aher upper thigh. It was a 150-milligram dose of Depo-Provera, an injectable\u000acontraceptive, a box of which she showed to a reporter.\u201cTo make sure you don\u2019t\u000aget pregnant,\u201d she recalled him saying.When he had finished, he pushed her\u000aback onto the bed and raped her for the first time.Thousands of women and\u000agirls from the Yazidi minority remain captives of the Islamic State, after the\u000ajihadists overran their ancestral homeland on Mount Sinjar on Aug. 3, 2014. In\u000athe months since then, hundreds have managed to escape, returning to a\u000acommunity now living in tents in the plains of the yellow massif, hours from\u000atheir former homes.Many of the women interviewed for this article were\u000ainitially reached through Yazidi community leaders, and gave their consent.\u000aAll the underage rape victims who agreed to speak were interviewed alongside\u000amembers of their family.In its official publications, the Islamic State has\u000astated that it is legal for a man to rape the women he enslaves under just\u000aabout any circumstance. Even sex with a child is permissible, according to a\u000apamphlet published by the group. The injunction against raping a pregnant\u000aslave is functionally the only protection for the captured women.The Islamic\u000aState cites centuries-old rulings stating that the owner of a female slave can\u000ahave sex with her only after she has undergone istibra\u2019 \u2014 \u201cthe process of\u000aensuring that the womb is empty,\u201d according to the Princeton University\u000aprofessor Bernard Haykel, one of several experts on Islamic law consulted on\u000athe topic. The purpose of this is to guarantee there is no confusion over a\u000achild\u2019s paternity.Most of the Sunni scholars who ruled on the issue argued\u000athat the requirement could be met by respecting a period of sexual abstinence\u000awhenever the captive changes hands, proposing a duration of at least one\u000amenstrual cycle, according to Brill\u2019s Encyclopedia of Islam.In its own manual,\u000athe Islamic State outlines the abstinence method as one option. But it also\u000aquotes the minority opinion of a Tunisian cleric who in the 1100s argued that\u000ait was enough to fulfill merely the spirit of the law. That opens the way for\u000aother means, including modern medicine, to circumvent the waiting period.A\u000atotal of 37 women abducted by the Islamic State who agreed to be interviewed\u000aover three trips to northern Iraq described an uneven system: Some fighters\u000ainsisted on double and even triple forms of contraception, while others\u000aviolated the guidelines entirely. Although it remains unclear why some hewed\u000aclosely to the regulations while others flouted them, one emerging pattern was\u000athat women held by senior commanders were more likely to be given\u000acontraception, in contrast to those held by junior fighters, who perhaps were\u000aless versed on the rules.J., an 18-year-old, said she had been sold to the\u000aIslamic State\u2019s governor of Tal Afar, a city in northern Iraq. \u201cEach month, he\u000amade me get a shot. It was his assistant who took me to the hospital,\u201d said\u000aJ., who was interviewed alongside her mother, after escaping this year.\u201cOn top\u000aof that he also gave me birth control pills. He told me, \u2018We don\u2019t want you to\u000aget pregnant,\u2019\u201d she said.When she was sold to a more junior fighter in the\u000aSyrian city of Tal Barak, it was the man\u2019s mother who escorted her to the\u000ahospital.\u201cShe told me, \u2018If you are pregnant, we are going to send you back,\u2019\u201d\u000aJ. said. \u201cThey took me into the lab. There were machines that looked like\u000acentrifuges and other contraptions. They drew three vials of my blood. About\u000a30 or 40 minutes later, they came back to say I wasn\u2019t pregnant.\u201dThe fighter\u2019s\u000amother triumphantly told her son that the 18-year-old was not pregnant,\u000avalidating his right to rape her, which he did repeatedly.When that fighter\u000atired of her, he gave her as a gift to his brother. Yet the brother did not\u000atake her back to have another blood test, forcing her to have sex without\u000aascertaining whether she was carrying another man\u2019s child. Several other women\u000areported a similar set of circumstances, including being given birth control\u000aby some of their owners but not by others.However, the low pregnancy rate, say\u000amedical professionals, is evidence that the rules intended to avoid pregnancy\u000awere more likely to have been applied than not.In his office in Dohuk\u2019s\u000aMinistry of Health Directorate, Dr. Taib, the physician tasked with overseeing\u000athe treatment of the hundreds of victims, was initially puzzled by the low\u000apregnancy rate.In other conflicts where rape has been used as a weapon of war,\u000ait has led to waves of unwanted pregnancies \u2014 either because the attackers did\u000anot use birth control or, as was the case in the former Yugoslavia, because\u000athey purposefully tried to impregnate their victims. One medical study of 68\u000aCroatian and Bosnian rape victims found that 29 had become pregnant.With more\u000athan 700 cases of rape recorded so far, Dr. Taib\u2019s center has treated only 35\u000apregnancies. He expected to see at least 140. \u201cEven higher than that, if you\u000aconsider that these women had multiple partners and were raped every day over\u000amany months,\u201d Dr. Taib said.\u201cI concluded that either they did an abortion\u000abefore they came back or they used contraception. And if there were abortions,\u000athen there would have been physical signs,\u201d which would have been noted by the\u000agynecologist treating the returnees, he said. \u201cThere were no signs.\u201dThe\u000aprohibition surrounding pregnancy is perhaps the only instance when the codes\u000athat the jihadists were applying lined up with the concerns of their victims,\u000awho dreaded carrying their rapists\u2019 children.Ahlam, a middle-aged woman who\u000awas kidnapped with her six children, said she had been not raped because she\u000ahad been deemed unattractive. Because she spoke Arabic, the Islamic State used\u000aher as an interpreter.One day, she was asked to chaperone a group of young\u000aYazidi women to the hospital in Tal Afar, where each woman was given 150\u000amilligrams of Depo-Provera.Over the months that followed, she said, she\u000aescorted in all around 30 victims to get the injection both in Tal Afar and\u000alater in the Iraqi city of Mosul. Twice she was asked to escort her own\u000ateenage daughter, who was raped by multiple fighters.She explained the\u000aconflicted feelings she had at the time. \u201cISIS took our girls as slaves, only\u000afor sex,\u201d Ahlam said, but the insistence on birth control brought some relief.\u000a\u201cNo one wants to carry the child of their enemy.\u201dOthers described how the\u000afighters so opposed pregnancy that some tried to force young women to\u000aabort.Abdal Ali said his sister, 20, was in her second trimester at the time\u000aof her capture in 2014. Still, one commander so urgently wanted her as his\u000aslave that he tried to end the pregnancy by giving her pills that would cause\u000aher to miscarry.\u201cShe hid them under her tongue, and then when they weren\u2019t\u000alooking, she spit them out,\u201d said Mr. Ali, who related the story on behalf of\u000ahis sister because she is undergoing medical treatment abroad for the injuries\u000ashe suffered. \u201cThey wanted to get rid of the child so that they could use the\u000awoman.\u201dA 20-year-old who asked to be identified only as H. began to feel\u000anauseated soon after her abduction. \u201cThe smell of rice made me gag,\u201d she\u000asaid.Already pregnant at the time of her capture, she considered herself one\u000aof the fortunate ones. For almost two months, H. was moved from location to\u000alocation and held in locked rooms, but she was spared the abuse that was by\u000athen befalling most of the young women held alongside her.Despite being\u000arepeatedly forced to give a urine sample and always testing positive, she,\u000atoo, was eventually picked.Her owner took her to a house, shared by another\u000acouple. When the couple was present, he did not approach her, suggesting he\u000aknew it was illegal. Only when the couple left did he forcibly have sex with\u000aher, and when he did he appeared drugged.\u201cI was telling him: \u2018I\u2019m pregnant. In\u000ayour book it says that you can\u2019t do this.\u2019 He had bloodshot eyes. He acted\u000alike he was high,\u201d she said.Eventually he drove her to a hospital with the aim\u000aof making her have an abortion, and flew into a rage when she refused the\u000asurgery, repeatedly punching her in the stomach. Even so, his behavior\u000asuggested he was ashamed: He never told the doctors that he wanted H. to\u000aabort, instead imploring her to ask for the procedure herself.When he drove\u000aher home, she waited until he left and then threw herself over the property\u2019s\u000awall. \u201cMy knees were bleeding. I was dizzy. I almost couldn\u2019t walk,\u201d she\u000asaid.Weeks later, with the help of smugglers hired by her family, she was\u000aspirited out of Islamic State territory. Her belly was sticking so far out\u000athat she could no longer see her toes when she finally crossed to safety.Her\u000afirst child, a healthy baby boy, was born two months later.\u000a\u000a

VDOHUK, Iraq \u2014 Locked inside a room where the only furniture was a bed, the 16\u000a-year-old learned to fear the sunset, because nightfall started the countdown\u000ato her next rape.During the year she was held by the Islamic State, she spent\u000aher days dreading the smell of the ISIS fighter\u2019s breath, the disgusting\u000asounds he made and the pain he inflicted on her body. More than anything, she\u000awas tormented by the thought she might become pregnant with her rapist\u2019s\u000achild.It was the one thing she needn\u2019t have worried about.Soon after buying\u000aher, the fighter brought the teenage girl a round box containing four strips\u000aof pills, one of them colored red.\u201cEvery day, I had to swallow one in front of\u000ahim. He gave me one box per month. When I ran out, he replaced it. When I was\u000asold from one man to another, the box of pills came with me,\u201d explained the\u000agirl, who learned only months later that she was being given birth control.It\u000ais a particularly modern solution to a medieval injunction: According to an\u000aobscure ruling in Islamic law cited by the Islamic State, a man must ensure\u000athat the woman he enslaves is free of child before having intercourse with\u000aher.Islamic State leaders have made sexual slavery as they believe it was\u000apracticed during the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s time integral to the group\u2019s\u000aoperations, preying on the women and girls the group captured from the Yazidi\u000areligious minority almost two years ago. To keep the sex trade running, the\u000afighters have aggressively pushed birth control on their victims so they can\u000acontinue the abuse unabated while the women are passed among them.More than\u000athree dozen Yazidi women who recently escaped the Islamic State and who agreed\u000ato be interviewed for this article described the numerous methods the fighters\u000aused to avoid pregnancy, including oral and injectable contraception, and\u000asometimes both. In at least one case, a woman was forced to have an abortion\u000ain order to make her available for sex, and others were pressured to do\u000aso.Some described how they knew they were about to be sold when they were\u000adriven to a hospital to give a urine sample to be tested for the hCG hormone,\u000awhose presence indicates pregnancy. They awaited their results with\u000aapprehension: A positive test would mean they were carrying their abuser\u2019s\u000achild; a negative result would allow Islamic State fighters to continue raping\u000athem.The rules have not been universally followed, with many women describing\u000abeing assaulted by men who were either ignorant of the injunction or defiant\u000aof it. But over all, the methodical use of birth control during at least some\u000aof the women\u2019s captivity explains what doctors caring for recent escapees\u000aobserved: Of the more than 700 rape victims from the Yazidi ethnic group who\u000ahave sought treatment so far at a United Nations-backed clinic in northern\u000aIraq, just 5 percent became pregnant during their enslavement, according to\u000aDr. Nagham Nawzat, the gynecologist carrying out the examinations.It is a\u000astunningly low figure given that the normal fertility rate for a young woman\u000ais between 20 percent and 25 percent in any given month, four to five times\u000athe rate that has been recorded so far, said Dr. Nezar Ismet Taib, who heads\u000athe Ministry of Health Directorate in Dohuk, which oversees the clinic where\u000athe victims are being treated.\u201cWe were expecting something much higher,\u201d he\u000asaid.The captured teenage girl, who agreed to be identified by her first\u000ainitial, M., has the demeanor of a child and wears her hair in a bouncy\u000aponytail. She was sold a total of seven times. When prospective buyers came to\u000ainquire about her, she overheard them asking for assurances that she was not\u000apregnant, and her owner provided the box of birth control as proof.That was\u000anot enough for the third man who bought her, she said. He quizzed her on the\u000adate of her last menstrual cycle and, unnerved by what he perceived as a\u000adelay, gave her a version of the so-called morning-after pill, causing her to\u000astart bleeding.Even then, he seemed unsatisfied.Finally he came into her room,\u000aclosed the door and ordered her to lower her pants. The teenager feared she\u000awas about to be raped. Instead he pulled out a syringe and gave her a shot on\u000aher upper thigh. It was a 150-milligram dose of Depo-Provera, an injectable\u000acontraceptive, a box of which she showed to a reporter.\u201cTo make sure you don\u2019t\u000aget pregnant,\u201d she recalled him saying.When he had finished, he pushed her\u000aback onto the bed and raped her for the first time.Thousands of women and\u000agirls from the Yazidi minority remain captives of the Islamic State, after the\u000ajihadists overran their ancestral homeland on Mount Sinjar on Aug. 3, 2014. In\u000athe months since then, hundreds have managed to escape, returning to a\u000acommunity now living in tents in the plains of the yellow massif, hours from\u000atheir former homes.Many of the women interviewed for this article were\u000ainitially reached through Yazidi community leaders, and gave their consent.\u000aAll the underage rape victims who agreed to speak were interviewed alongside\u000amembers of their family.In its official publications, the Islamic State has\u000astated that it is legal for a man to rape the women he enslaves under just\u000aabout any circumstance. Even sex with a child is permissible, according to a\u000apamphlet published by the group. The injunction against raping a pregnant\u000aslave is functionally the only protection for the captured women.The Islamic\u000aState cites centuries-old rulings stating that the owner of a female slave can\u000ahave sex with her only after she has undergone istibra\u2019 \u2014 \u201cthe process of\u000aensuring that the womb is empty,\u201d according to the Princeton University\u000aprofessor Bernard Haykel, one of several experts on Islamic law consulted on\u000athe topic. The purpose of this is to guarantee there is no confusion over a\u000achild\u2019s paternity.Most of the Sunni scholars who ruled on the issue argued\u000athat the requirement could be met by respecting a period of sexual abstinence\u000awhenever the captive changes hands, proposing a duration of at least one\u000amenstrual cycle, according to Brill\u2019s Encyclopedia of Islam.In its own manual,\u000athe Islamic State outlines the abstinence method as one option. But it also\u000aquotes the minority opinion of a Tunisian cleric who in the 1100s argued that\u000ait was enough to fulfill merely the spirit of the law. That opens the way for\u000aother means, including modern medicine, to circumvent the waiting period.A\u000atotal of 37 women abducted by the Islamic State who agreed to be interviewed\u000aover three trips to northern Iraq described an uneven system: Some fighters\u000ainsisted on double and even triple forms of contraception, while others\u000aviolated the guidelines entirely. Although it remains unclear why some hewed\u000aclosely to the regulations while others flouted them, one emerging pattern was\u000athat women held by senior commanders were more likely to be given\u000acontraception, in contrast to those held by junior fighters, who perhaps were\u000aless versed on the rules.J., an 18-year-old, said she had been sold to the\u000aIslamic State\u2019s governor of Tal Afar, a city in northern Iraq. \u201cEach month, he\u000amade me get a shot. It was his assistant who took me to the hospital,\u201d said\u000aJ., who was interviewed alongside her mother, after escaping this year.\u201cOn top\u000aof that he also gave me birth control pills. He told me, \u2018We don\u2019t want you to\u000aget pregnant,\u2019\u201d she said.When she was sold to a more junior fighter in the\u000aSyrian city of Tal Barak, it was the man\u2019s mother who escorted her to the\u000ahospital.\u201cShe told me, \u2018If you are pregnant, we are going to send you back,\u2019\u201d\u000aJ. said. \u201cThey took me into the lab. There were machines that looked like\u000acentrifuges and other contraptions. They drew three vials of my blood. About\u000a30 or 40 minutes later, they came back to say I wasn\u2019t pregnant.\u201dThe fighter\u2019s\u000amother triumphantly told her son that the 18-year-old was not pregnant,\u000avalidating his right to rape her, which he did repeatedly.When that fighter\u000atired of her, he gave her as a gift to his brother. Yet the brother did not\u000atake her back to have another blood test, forcing her to have sex without\u000aascertaining whether she was carrying another man\u2019s child. Several other women\u000areported a similar set of circumstances, including being given birth control\u000aby some of their owners but not by others.However, the low pregnancy rate, say\u000amedical professionals, is evidence that the rules intended to avoid pregnancy\u000awere more likely to have been applied than not.In his office in Dohuk\u2019s\u000aMinistry of Health Directorate, Dr. Taib, the physician tasked with overseeing\u000athe treatment of the hundreds of victims, was initially puzzled by the low\u000apregnancy rate.In other conflicts where rape has been used as a weapon of war,\u000ait has led to waves of unwanted pregnancies \u2014 either because the attackers did\u000anot use birth control or, as was the case in the former Yugoslavia, because\u000athey purposefully tried to impregnate their victims. One medical study of 68\u000aCroatian and Bosnian rape victims found that 29 had become pregnant.With more\u000athan 700 cases of rape recorded so far, Dr. Taib\u2019s center has treated only 35\u000apregnancies. He expected to see at least 140. \u201cEven higher than that, if you\u000aconsider that these women had multiple partners and were raped every day over\u000amany months,\u201d Dr. Taib said.\u201cI concluded that either they did an abortion\u000abefore they came back or they used contraception. And if there were abortions,\u000athen there would have been physical signs,\u201d which would have been noted by the\u000agynecologist treating the returnees, he said. \u201cThere were no signs.\u201dThe\u000aprohibition surrounding pregnancy is perhaps the only instance when the codes\u000athat the jihadists were applying lined up with the concerns of their victims,\u000awho dreaded carrying their rapists\u2019 children.Ahlam, a middle-aged woman who\u000awas kidnapped with her six children, said she had been not raped because she\u000ahad been deemed unattractive. Because she spoke Arabic, the Islamic State used\u000aher as an interpreter.One day, she was asked to chaperone a group of young\u000aYazidi women to the hospital in Tal Afar, where each woman was given 150\u000amilligrams of Depo-Provera.Over the months that followed, she said, she\u000aescorted in all around 30 victims to get the injection both in Tal Afar and\u000alater in the Iraqi city of Mosul. Twice she was asked to escort her own\u000ateenage daughter, who was raped by multiple fighters.She explained the\u000aconflicted feelings she had at the time. \u201cISIS took our girls as slaves, only\u000afor sex,\u201d Ahlam said, but the insistence on birth control brought some relief.\u000a\u201cNo one wants to carry the child of their enemy.\u201dOthers described how the\u000afighters so opposed pregnancy that some tried to force young women to\u000aabort.Abdal Ali said his sister, 20, was in her second trimester at the time\u000aof her capture in 2014. Still, one commander so urgently wanted her as his\u000aslave that he tried to end the pregnancy by giving her pills that would cause\u000aher to miscarry.\u201cShe hid them under her tongue, and then when they weren\u2019t\u000alooking, she spit them out,\u201d said Mr. Ali, who related the story on behalf of\u000ahis sister because she is undergoing medical treatment abroad for the injuries\u000ashe suffered. \u201cThey wanted to get rid of the child so that they could use the\u000awoman.\u201dA 20-year-old who asked to be identified only as H. began to feel\u000anauseated soon after her abduction. \u201cThe smell of rice made me gag,\u201d she\u000asaid.Already pregnant at the time of her capture, she considered herself one\u000aof the fortunate ones. For almost two months, H. was moved from location to\u000alocation and held in locked rooms, but she was spared the abuse that was by\u000athen befalling most of the young women held alongside her.Despite being\u000arepeatedly forced to give a urine sample and always testing positive, she,\u000atoo, was eventually picked.Her owner took her to a house, shared by another\u000acouple. When the couple was present, he did not approach her, suggesting he\u000aknew it was illegal. Only when the couple left did he forcibly have sex with\u000aher, and when he did he appeared drugged.\u201cI was telling him: \u2018I\u2019m pregnant. In\u000ayour book it says that you can\u2019t do this.\u2019 He had bloodshot eyes. He acted\u000alike he was high,\u201d she said.Eventually he drove her to a hospital with the aim\u000aof making her have an abortion, and flew into a rage when she refused the\u000asurgery, repeatedly punching her in the stomach. Even so, his behavior\u000asuggested he was ashamed: He never told the doctors that he wanted H. to\u000aabort, instead imploring her to ask for the procedure herself.When he drove\u000aher home, she waited until he left and then threw herself over the property\u2019s\u000awall. \u201cMy knees were bleeding. I was dizzy. I almost couldn\u2019t walk,\u201d she\u000asaid.Weeks later, with the help of smugglers hired by her family, she was\u000aspirited out of Islamic State territory. Her belly was sticking so far out\u000athat she could no longer see her toes when she finally crossed to safety.Her\u000afirst child, a healthy baby boy, was born two months later.\u000a\u000a

VDOHUK, Iraq \u2014 Locked inside a room where the only furniture was a bed, the 16\u000a-year-old learned to fear the sunset, because nightfall started the countdown\u000ato her next rape.During the year she was held by the Islamic State, she spent\u000aher days dreading the smell of the ISIS fighter\u2019s breath, the disgusting\u000asounds he made and the pain he inflicted on her body. More than anything, she\u000awas tormented by the thought she might become pregnant with her rapist\u2019s\u000achild.It was the one thing she needn\u2019t have worried about.Soon after buying\u000aher, the fighter brought the teenage girl a round box containing four strips\u000aof pills, one of them colored red.\u201cEvery day, I had to swallow one in front of\u000ahim. He gave me one box per month. When I ran out, he replaced it. When I was\u000asold from one man to another, the box of pills came with me,\u201d explained the\u000agirl, who learned only months later that she was being given birth control.It\u000ais a particularly modern solution to a medieval injunction: According to an\u000aobscure ruling in Islamic law cited by the Islamic State, a man must ensure\u000athat the woman he enslaves is free of child before having intercourse with\u000aher.Islamic State leaders have made sexual slavery as they believe it was\u000apracticed during the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s time integral to the group\u2019s\u000aoperations, preying on the women and girls the group captured from the Yazidi\u000areligious minority almost two years ago. To keep the sex trade running, the\u000afighters have aggressively pushed birth control on their victims so they can\u000acontinue the abuse unabated while the women are passed among them.More than\u000athree dozen Yazidi women who recently escaped the Islamic State and who agreed\u000ato be interviewed for this article described the numerous methods the fighters\u000aused to avoid pregnancy, including oral and injectable contraception, and\u000asometimes both. In at least one case, a woman was forced to have an abortion\u000ain order to make her available for sex, and others were pressured to do\u000aso.Some described how they knew they were about to be sold when they were\u000adriven to a hospital to give a urine sample to be tested for the hCG hormone,\u000awhose presence indicates pregnancy. They awaited their results with\u000aapprehension: A positive test would mean they were carrying their abuser\u2019s\u000achild; a negative result would allow Islamic State fighters to continue raping\u000athem.The rules have not been universally followed, with many women describing\u000abeing assaulted by men who were either ignorant of the injunction or defiant\u000aof it. But over all, the methodical use of birth control during at least some\u000aof the women\u2019s captivity explains what doctors caring for recent escapees\u000aobserved: Of the more than 700 rape victims from the Yazidi ethnic group who\u000ahave sought treatment so far at a United Nations-backed clinic in northern\u000aIraq, just 5 percent became pregnant during their enslavement, according to\u000aDr. Nagham Nawzat, the gynecologist carrying out the examinations.It is a\u000astunningly low figure given that the normal fertility rate for a young woman\u000ais between 20 percent and 25 percent in any given month, four to five times\u000athe rate that has been recorded so far, said Dr. Nezar Ismet Taib, who heads\u000athe Ministry of Health Directorate in Dohuk, which oversees the clinic where\u000athe victims are being treated.\u201cWe were expecting something much higher,\u201d he\u000asaid.The captured teenage girl, who agreed to be identified by her first\u000ainitial, M., has the demeanor of a child and wears her hair in a bouncy\u000aponytail. She was sold a total of seven times. When prospective buyers came to\u000ainquire about her, she overheard them asking for assurances that she was not\u000apregnant, and her owner provided the box of birth control as proof.That was\u000anot enough for the third man who bought her, she said. He quizzed her on the\u000adate of her last menstrual cycle and, unnerved by what he perceived as a\u000adelay, gave her a version of the so-called morning-after pill, causing her to\u000astart bleeding.Even then, he seemed unsatisfied.Finally he came into her room,\u000aclosed the door and ordered her to lower her pants. The teenager feared she\u000awas about to be raped. Instead he pulled out a syringe and gave her a shot on\u000aher upper thigh. It was a 150-milligram dose of Depo-Provera, an injectable\u000acontraceptive, a box of which she showed to a reporter.\u201cTo make sure you don\u2019t\u000aget pregnant,\u201d she recalled him saying.When he had finished, he pushed her\u000aback onto the bed and raped her for the first time.Thousands of women and\u000agirls from the Yazidi minority remain captives of the Islamic State, after the\u000ajihadists overran their ancestral homeland on Mount Sinjar on Aug. 3, 2014. In\u000athe months since then, hundreds have managed to escape, returning to a\u000acommunity now living in tents in the plains of the yellow massif, hours from\u000atheir former homes.Many of the women interviewed for this article were\u000ainitially reached through Yazidi community leaders, and gave their consent.\u000aAll the underage rape victims who agreed to speak were interviewed alongside\u000amembers of their family.In its official publications, the Islamic State has\u000astated that it is legal for a man to rape the women he enslaves under just\u000aabout any circumstance. Even sex with a child is permissible, according to a\u000apamphlet published by the group. The injunction against raping a pregnant\u000aslave is functionally the only protection for the captured women.The Islamic\u000aState cites centuries-old rulings stating that the owner of a female slave can\u000ahave sex with her only after she has undergone istibra\u2019 \u2014 \u201cthe process of\u000aensuring that the womb is empty,\u201d according to the Princeton University\u000aprofessor Bernard Haykel, one of several experts on Islamic law consulted on\u000athe topic. The purpose of this is to guarantee there is no confusion over a\u000achild\u2019s paternity.Most of the Sunni scholars who ruled on the issue argued\u000athat the requirement could be met by respecting a period of sexual abstinence\u000awhenever the captive changes hands, proposing a duration of at least one\u000amenstrual cycle, according to Brill\u2019s Encyclopedia of Islam.In its own manual,\u000athe Islamic State outlines the abstinence method as one option. But it also\u000aquotes the minority opinion of a Tunisian cleric who in the 1100s argued that\u000ait was enough to fulfill merely the spirit of the law. That opens the way for\u000aother means, including modern medicine, to circumvent the waiting period.A\u000atotal of 37 women abducted by the Islamic State who agreed to be interviewed\u000aover three trips to northern Iraq described an uneven system: Some fighters\u000ainsisted on double and even triple forms of contraception, while others\u000aviolated the guidelines entirely. Although it remains unclear why some hewed\u000aclosely to the regulations while others flouted them, one emerging pattern was\u000athat women held by senior commanders were more likely to be given\u000acontraception, in contrast to those held by junior fighters, who perhaps were\u000aless versed on the rules.J., an 18-year-old, said she had been sold to the\u000aIslamic State\u2019s governor of Tal Afar, a city in northern Iraq. \u201cEach month, he\u000amade me get a shot. It was his assistant who took me to the hospital,\u201d said\u000aJ., who was interviewed alongside her mother, after escaping this year.\u201cOn top\u000aof that he also gave me birth control pills. He told me, \u2018We don\u2019t want you to\u000aget pregnant,\u2019\u201d she said.When she was sold to a more junior fighter in the\u000aSyrian city of Tal Barak, it was the man\u2019s mother who escorted her to the\u000ahospital.\u201cShe told me, \u2018If you are pregnant, we are going to send you back,\u2019\u201d\u000aJ. said. \u201cThey took me into the lab. There were machines that looked like\u000acentrifuges and other contraptions. They drew three vials of my blood. About\u000a30 or 40 minutes later, they came back to say I wasn\u2019t pregnant.\u201dThe fighter\u2019s\u000amother triumphantly told her son that the 18-year-old was not pregnant,\u000avalidating his right to rape her, which he did repeatedly.When that fighter\u000atired of her, he gave her as a gift to his brother. Yet the brother did not\u000atake her back to have another blood test, forcing her to have sex without\u000aascertaining whether she was carrying another man\u2019s child. Several other women\u000areported a similar set of circumstances, including being given birth control\u000aby some of their owners but not by others.However, the low pregnancy rate, say\u000amedical professionals, is evidence that the rules intended to avoid pregnancy\u000awere more likely to have been applied than not.In his office in Dohuk\u2019s\u000aMinistry of Health Directorate, Dr. Taib, the physician tasked with overseeing\u000athe treatment of the hundreds of victims, was initially puzzled by the low\u000apregnancy rate.In other conflicts where rape has been used as a weapon of war,\u000ait has led to waves of unwanted pregnancies \u2014 either because the attackers did\u000anot use birth control or, as was the case in the former Yugoslavia, because\u000athey purposefully tried to impregnate their victims. One medical study of 68\u000aCroatian and Bosnian rape victims found that 29 had become pregnant.With more\u000athan 700 cases of rape recorded so far, Dr. Taib\u2019s center has treated only 35\u000apregnancies. He expected to see at least 140. \u201cEven higher than that, if you\u000aconsider that these women had multiple partners and were raped every day over\u000amany months,\u201d Dr. Taib said.\u201cI concluded that either they did an abortion\u000abefore they came back or they used contraception. And if there were abortions,\u000athen there would have been physical signs,\u201d which would have been noted by the\u000agynecologist treating the returnees, he said. \u201cThere were no signs.\u201dThe\u000aprohibition surrounding pregnancy is perhaps the only instance when the codes\u000athat the jihadists were applying lined up with the concerns of their victims,\u000awho dreaded carrying their rapists\u2019 children.Ahlam, a middle-aged woman who\u000awas kidnapped with her six children, said she had been not raped because she\u000ahad been deemed unattractive. Because she spoke Arabic, the Islamic State used\u000aher as an interpreter.One day, she was asked to chaperone a group of young\u000aYazidi women to the hospital in Tal Afar, where each woman was given 150\u000amilligrams of Depo-Provera.Over the months that followed, she said, she\u000aescorted in all around 30 victims to get the injection both in Tal Afar and\u000alater in the Iraqi city of Mosul. Twice she was asked to escort her own\u000ateenage daughter, who was raped by multiple fighters.She explained the\u000aconflicted feelings she had at the time. \u201cISIS took our girls as slaves, only\u000afor sex,\u201d Ahlam said, but the insistence on birth control brought some relief.\u000a\u201cNo one wants to carry the child of their enemy.\u201dOthers described how the\u000afighters so opposed pregnancy that some tried to force young women to\u000aabort.Abdal Ali said his sister, 20, was in her second trimester at the time\u000aof her capture in 2014. Still, one commander so urgently wanted her as his\u000aslave that he tried to end the pregnancy by giving her pills that would cause\u000aher to miscarry.\u201cShe hid them under her tongue, and then when they weren\u2019t\u000alooking, she spit them out,\u201d said Mr. Ali, who related the story on behalf of\u000ahis sister because she is undergoing medical treatment abroad for the injuries\u000ashe suffered. \u201cThey wanted to get rid of the child so that they could use the\u000awoman.\u201dA 20-year-old who asked to be identified only as H. began to feel\u000anauseated soon after her abduction. \u201cThe smell of rice made me gag,\u201d she\u000asaid.Already pregnant at the time of her capture, she considered herself one\u000aof the fortunate ones. For almost two months, H. was moved from location to\u000alocation and held in locked rooms, but she was spared the abuse that was by\u000athen befalling most of the young women held alongside her.Despite being\u000arepeatedly forced to give a urine sample and always testing positive, she,\u000atoo, was eventually picked.Her owner took her to a house, shared by another\u000acouple. When the couple was present, he did not approach her, suggesting he\u000aknew it was illegal. Only when the couple left did he forcibly have sex with\u000aher, and when he did he appeared drugged.\u201cI was telling him: \u2018I\u2019m pregnant. In\u000ayour book it says that you can\u2019t do this.\u2019 He had bloodshot eyes. He acted\u000alike he was high,\u201d she said.Eventually he drove her to a hospital with the aim\u000aof making her have an abortion, and flew into a rage when she refused the\u000asurgery, repeatedly punching her in the stomach. Even so, his behavior\u000asuggested he was ashamed: He never told the doctors that he wanted H. to\u000aabort, instead imploring her to ask for the procedure herself.When he drove\u000aher home, she waited until he left and then threw herself over the property\u2019s\u000awall. \u201cMy knees were bleeding. I was dizzy. I almost couldn\u2019t walk,\u201d she\u000asaid.Weeks later, with the help of smugglers hired by her family, she was\u000aspirited out of Islamic State territory. Her belly was sticking so far out\u000athat she could no longer see her toes when she finally crossed to safety.Her\u000afirst child, a healthy baby boy, was born two months later.\u000a\u000a

VROME \u2014 Secretary of State John Kerry said on Tuesday that members of the\u000aAmerican-led coalition fighting the Islamic State had agreed at a meeting here\u000ato intensify their efforts to defeat the group, but he ruled out sending\u000aUnited States forces to intervene in Libya, where the Sunni extremists are\u000apressing to claim territory.The United States and 22 other nations agreed to\u000a\u201ca very specific schedule\u201d for backing the formation of a national unity\u000agovernment in Libya, Mr. Kerry said, and discussed contributions that would be\u000aneeded from each nation to stabilize Iraq and address the humanitarian crisis\u000ain Syria.\u201cEvery single country there agreed that each of us has to do more in\u000aorder to more rapidly and completely defeat Daesh,\u201d Mr. Kerry told reporters\u000aas he wrapped up a day of meetings in Rome devoted to planning the next stages\u000aof the battle against the group, using an Arabic acronym to refer to it.But he\u000asaid President Obama had made clear that he had no appetite for sending\u000aAmerican troops into Libya. \u201cThe president will never eliminate every option\u000aforever, if common sense dictated that the situation changed, or it required\u000ahim to adjust, but that\u2019s not in his horizon at the moment,\u201d Mr. Kerry\u000asaid.Mr. Kerry warned earlier on Tuesday that the group, also known as ISIS or\u000aISIL, was threatening to gain a \u201cstranglehold\u201d in Libya and with it access to\u000avast oil wealth.Paolo Gentiloni, the foreign minister of Italy, and Laurent\u000aFabius, the foreign minister of France, also said their governments were not\u000acurrently contemplating military operations inside Libya.For now, the\u000acoalition plans to work with Martin Kobler, the United Nations envoy for\u000aLibya, to help the country form a unity government, said Mr. Kerry. He said\u000athat process was crucial to prevent it from sliding into the hands of the\u000aIslamic State.\u201cWe\u2019re still not at the victory that we want to achieve and will\u000aachieve in either Syria or Iraq, and we have seen Daesh playing a game of\u000ametastasizing out to other countries, particularly Libya,\u201d he said as the\u000ameetings began. \u201cThe last thing in the world you want is a false caliphate\u000awith access to billions of dollars of oil revenue.\u201dMr. Kerry said that the\u000acoalition\u2019s gains in pushing back the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria were\u000a\u201cundeniable,\u201d but that its members had to do more to sustain the success. On\u000aTuesday, some countries were asked to provide additional training, medical\u000asupplies or other services for Iraqis, while Norway agreed to help clear mines\u000afrom liberated areas of Iraq, including Ramadi, where the Islamic State left\u000abehind explosives and booby-trapped buildings.At a conference in London on\u000aThursday, Mr. Kerry said, the United States and other nations will announce\u000aadditional humanitarian aid for Syria, where he said 13.5 million people,\u000aincluding six million children, were in urgent need. Next week in Munich,\u000adiplomats will discuss \u201cadditional contributions\u201d that can be made by a group\u000aof nations pushing for a resolution of Syria\u2019s civil war, he said. And defense\u000aministers of the coalition countries will assemble for the first time next\u000aweek in Brussels to talk about expanding the military offensive against the\u000aIslamic State.\u201cWe are committed to using every resource at our disposal in\u000aorder to remain on the offensive on every front,\u201d Mr. Kerry said.He described\u000aa United Nations-led effort unfolding in Geneva to bring about a political\u000asolution to the Syrian conflict as a vital piece of that process, calling\u000aPresident Bashar al-Assad \u201ca magnet for terrorism\u201d and accusing his government\u000aof war crimes for preventing humanitarian relief efforts to reach starving\u000aSyrians.\u201cStarvation as a tactic of war is against the laws of war, and it is\u000abeing used every single day as a tactic by the Assad regime,\u201d Mr. Kerry said\u000aat the start of the gathering. He said there was an urgent need for the talks\u000ain Geneva to deliver a cease-fire, immediate humanitarian assistance and\u000aprotection for civilians at risk from daily airstrikes.\u201cIt would help\u000aenormously if those who say they are there to fight Daesh fight Daesh,\u201d Mr.\u000aKerry said later, apparently referring to Russian forces that have carried out\u000aairstrikes far from the Islamic State\u2019s strongholds, in areas dominated by\u000aanti-Assad rebels.His remarks came amid reports of a government drive in\u000anorthern Syria that threatened supply lines from Turkey to rebel forces in and\u000aaround the Syrian city of Aleppo. The new offensive, backed by heavy Russian\u000aairstrikes, threatened to render meaningless the Geneva talks.\u000a\u000a

VDOHUK, Iraq \u2014 Locked inside a room where the only furniture was a bed, the 16\u000a-year-old learned to fear the sunset, because nightfall started the countdown\u000ato her next rape.During the year she was held by the Islamic State, she spent\u000aher days dreading the smell of the ISIS fighter\u2019s breath, the disgusting\u000asounds he made and the pain he inflicted on her body. More than anything, she\u000awas tormented by the thought she might become pregnant with her rapist\u2019s\u000achild.It was the one thing she needn\u2019t have worried about.Soon after buying\u000aher, the fighter brought the teenage girl a round box containing four strips\u000aof pills, one of them colored red.\u201cEvery day, I had to swallow one in front of\u000ahim. He gave me one box per month. When I ran out, he replaced it. When I was\u000asold from one man to another, the box of pills came with me,\u201d explained the\u000agirl, who learned only months later that she was being given birth control.It\u000ais a particularly modern solution to a medieval injunction: According to an\u000aobscure ruling in Islamic law cited by the Islamic State, a man must ensure\u000athat the woman he enslaves is free of child before having intercourse with\u000aher.Islamic State leaders have made sexual slavery as they believe it was\u000apracticed during the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s time integral to the group\u2019s\u000aoperations, preying on the women and girls the group captured from the Yazidi\u000areligious minority almost two years ago. To keep the sex trade running, the\u000afighters have aggressively pushed birth control on their victims so they can\u000acontinue the abuse unabated while the women are passed among them.More than\u000athree dozen Yazidi women who recently escaped the Islamic State and who agreed\u000ato be interviewed for this article described the numerous methods the fighters\u000aused to avoid pregnancy, including oral and injectable contraception, and\u000asometimes both. In at least one case, a woman was forced to have an abortion\u000ain order to make her available for sex, and others were pressured to do\u000aso.Some described how they knew they were about to be sold when they were\u000adriven to a hospital to give a urine sample to be tested for the hCG hormone,\u000awhose presence indicates pregnancy. They awaited their results with\u000aapprehension: A positive test would mean they were carrying their abuser\u2019s\u000achild; a negative result would allow Islamic State fighters to continue raping\u000athem.The rules have not been universally followed, with many women describing\u000abeing assaulted by men who were either ignorant of the injunction or defiant\u000aof it. But over all, the methodical use of birth control during at least some\u000aof the women\u2019s captivity explains what doctors caring for recent escapees\u000aobserved: Of the more than 700 rape victims from the Yazidi ethnic group who\u000ahave sought treatment so far at a United Nations-backed clinic in northern\u000aIraq, just 5 percent became pregnant during their enslavement, according to\u000aDr. Nagham Nawzat, the gynecologist carrying out the examinations.It is a\u000astunningly low figure given that the normal fertility rate for a young woman\u000ais between 20 percent and 25 percent in any given month, four to five times\u000athe rate that has been recorded so far, said Dr. Nezar Ismet Taib, who heads\u000athe Ministry of Health Directorate in Dohuk, which oversees the clinic where\u000athe victims are being treated.\u201cWe were expecting something much higher,\u201d he\u000asaid.The captured teenage girl, who agreed to be identified by her first\u000ainitial, M., has the demeanor of a child and wears her hair in a bouncy\u000aponytail. She was sold a total of seven times. When prospective buyers came to\u000ainquire about her, she overheard them asking for assurances that she was not\u000apregnant, and her owner provided the box of birth control as proof.That was\u000anot enough for the third man who bought her, she said. He quizzed her on the\u000adate of her last menstrual cycle and, unnerved by what he perceived as a\u000adelay, gave her a version of the so-called morning-after pill, causing her to\u000astart bleeding.Even then, he seemed unsatisfied.Finally he came into her room,\u000aclosed the door and ordered her to lower her pants. The teenager feared she\u000awas about to be raped. Instead he pulled out a syringe and gave her a shot on\u000aher upper thigh. It was a 150-milligram dose of Depo-Provera, an injectable\u000acontraceptive, a box of which she showed to a reporter.\u201cTo make sure you don\u2019t\u000aget pregnant,\u201d she recalled him saying.When he had finished, he pushed her\u000aback onto the bed and raped her for the first time.Thousands of women and\u000agirls from the Yazidi minority remain captives of the Islamic State, after the\u000ajihadists overran their ancestral homeland on Mount Sinjar on Aug. 3, 2014. In\u000athe months since then, hundreds have managed to escape, returning to a\u000acommunity now living in tents in the plains of the yellow massif, hours from\u000atheir former homes.Many of the women interviewed for this article were\u000ainitially reached through Yazidi community leaders, and gave their consent.\u000aAll the underage rape victims who agreed to speak were interviewed alongside\u000amembers of their family.In its official publications, the Islamic State has\u000astated that it is legal for a man to rape the women he enslaves under just\u000aabout any circumstance. Even sex with a child is permissible, according to a\u000apamphlet published by the group. The injunction against raping a pregnant\u000aslave is functionally the only protection for the captured women.The Islamic\u000aState cites centuries-old rulings stating that the owner of a female slave can\u000ahave sex with her only after she has undergone istibra\u2019 \u2014 \u201cthe process of\u000aensuring that the womb is empty,\u201d according to the Princeton University\u000aprofessor Bernard Haykel, one of several experts on Islamic law consulted on\u000athe topic. The purpose of this is to guarantee there is no confusion over a\u000achild\u2019s paternity.Most of the Sunni scholars who ruled on the issue argued\u000athat the requirement could be met by respecting a period of sexual abstinence\u000awhenever the captive changes hands, proposing a duration of at least one\u000amenstrual cycle, according to Brill\u2019s Encyclopedia of Islam.In its own manual,\u000athe Islamic State outlines the abstinence method as one option. But it also\u000aquotes the minority opinion of a Tunisian cleric who in the 1100s argued that\u000ait was enough to fulfill merely the spirit of the law. That opens the way for\u000aother means, including modern medicine, to circumvent the waiting period.A\u000atotal of 37 women abducted by the Islamic State who agreed to be interviewed\u000aover three trips to northern Iraq described an uneven system: Some fighters\u000ainsisted on double and even triple forms of contraception, while others\u000aviolated the guidelines entirely. Although it remains unclear why some hewed\u000aclosely to the regulations while others flouted them, one emerging pattern was\u000athat women held by senior commanders were more likely to be given\u000acontraception, in contrast to those held by junior fighters, who perhaps were\u000aless versed on the rules.J., an 18-year-old, said she had been sold to the\u000aIslamic State\u2019s governor of Tal Afar, a city in northern Iraq. \u201cEach month, he\u000amade me get a shot. It was his assistant who took me to the hospital,\u201d said\u000aJ., who was interviewed alongside her mother, after escaping this year.\u201cOn top\u000aof that he also gave me birth control pills. He told me, \u2018We don\u2019t want you to\u000aget pregnant,\u2019\u201d she said.When she was sold to a more junior fighter in the\u000aSyrian city of Tal Barak, it was the man\u2019s mother who escorted her to the\u000ahospital.\u201cShe told me, \u2018If you are pregnant, we are going to send you back,\u2019\u201d\u000aJ. said. \u201cThey took me into the lab. There were machines that looked like\u000acentrifuges and other contraptions. They drew three vials of my blood. About\u000a30 or 40 minutes later, they came back to say I wasn\u2019t pregnant.\u201dThe fighter\u2019s\u000amother triumphantly told her son that the 18-year-old was not pregnant,\u000avalidating his right to rape her, which he did repeatedly.When that fighter\u000atired of her, he gave her as a gift to his brother. Yet the brother did not\u000atake her back to have another blood test, forcing her to have sex without\u000aascertaining whether she was carrying another man\u2019s child. Several other women\u000areported a similar set of circumstances, including being given birth control\u000aby some of their owners but not by others.However, the low pregnancy rate, say\u000amedical professionals, is evidence that the rules intended to avoid pregnancy\u000awere more likely to have been applied than not.In his office in Dohuk\u2019s\u000aMinistry of Health Directorate, Dr. Taib, the physician tasked with overseeing\u000athe treatment of the hundreds of victims, was initially puzzled by the low\u000apregnancy rate.In other conflicts where rape has been used as a weapon of war,\u000ait has led to waves of unwanted pregnancies \u2014 either because the attackers did\u000anot use birth control or, as was the case in the former Yugoslavia, because\u000athey purposefully tried to impregnate their victims. One medical study of 68\u000aCroatian and Bosnian rape victims found that 29 had become pregnant.With more\u000athan 700 cases of rape recorded so far, Dr. Taib\u2019s center has treated only 35\u000apregnancies. He expected to see at least 140. \u201cEven higher than that, if you\u000aconsider that these women had multiple partners and were raped every day over\u000amany months,\u201d Dr. Taib said.\u201cI concluded that either they did an abortion\u000abefore they came back or they used contraception. And if there were abortions,\u000athen there would have been physical signs,\u201d which would have been noted by the\u000agynecologist treating the returnees, he said. \u201cThere were no signs.\u201dThe\u000aprohibition surrounding pregnancy is perhaps the only instance when the codes\u000athat the jihadists were applying lined up with the concerns of their victims,\u000awho dreaded carrying their rapists\u2019 children.Ahlam, a middle-aged woman who\u000awas kidnapped with her six children, said she had been not raped because she\u000ahad been deemed unattractive. Because she spoke Arabic, the Islamic State used\u000aher as an interpreter.One day, she was asked to chaperone a group of young\u000aYazidi women to the hospital in Tal Afar, where each woman was given 150\u000amilligrams of Depo-Provera.Over the months that followed, she said, she\u000aescorted in all around 30 victims to get the injection both in Tal Afar and\u000alater in the Iraqi city of Mosul. Twice she was asked to escort her own\u000ateenage daughter, who was raped by multiple fighters.She explained the\u000aconflicted feelings she had at the time. \u201cISIS took our girls as slaves, only\u000afor sex,\u201d Ahlam said, but the insistence on birth control brought some relief.\u000a\u201cNo one wants to carry the child of their enemy.\u201dOthers described how the\u000afighters so opposed pregnancy that some tried to force young women to\u000aabort.Abdal Ali said his sister, 20, was in her second trimester at the time\u000aof her capture in 2014. Still, one commander so urgently wanted her as his\u000aslave that he tried to end the pregnancy by giving her pills that would cause\u000aher to miscarry.\u201cShe hid them under her tongue, and then when they weren\u2019t\u000alooking, she spit them out,\u201d said Mr. Ali, who related the story on behalf of\u000ahis sister because she is undergoing medical treatment abroad for the injuries\u000ashe suffered. \u201cThey wanted to get rid of the child so that they could use the\u000awoman.\u201dA 20-year-old who asked to be identified only as H. began to feel\u000anauseated soon after her abduction. \u201cThe smell of rice made me gag,\u201d she\u000asaid.Already pregnant at the time of her capture, she considered herself one\u000aof the fortunate ones. For almost two months, H. was moved from location to\u000alocation and held in locked rooms, but she was spared the abuse that was by\u000athen befalling most of the young women held alongside her.Despite being\u000arepeatedly forced to give a urine sample and always testing positive, she,\u000atoo, was eventually picked.Her owner took her to a house, shared by another\u000acouple. When the couple was present, he did not approach her, suggesting he\u000aknew it was illegal. Only when the couple left did he forcibly have sex with\u000aher, and when he did he appeared drugged.\u201cI was telling him: \u2018I\u2019m pregnant. In\u000ayour book it says that you can\u2019t do this.\u2019 He had bloodshot eyes. He acted\u000alike he was high,\u201d she said.Eventually he drove her to a hospital with the aim\u000aof making her have an abortion, and flew into a rage when she refused the\u000asurgery, repeatedly punching her in the stomach. Even so, his behavior\u000asuggested he was ashamed: He never told the doctors that he wanted H. to\u000aabort, instead imploring her to ask for the procedure herself.When he drove\u000aher home, she waited until he left and then threw herself over the property\u2019s\u000awall. \u201cMy knees were bleeding. I was dizzy. I almost couldn\u2019t walk,\u201d she\u000asaid.Weeks later, with the help of smugglers hired by her family, she was\u000aspirited out of Islamic State territory. Her belly was sticking so far out\u000athat she could no longer see her toes when she finally crossed to safety.Her\u000afirst child, a healthy baby boy, was born two months later.\u000a\u000a

VTed Cruz had a teachable moment in Iowa, although he himself will learn\u000anothing from it. A voter told Mr. Cruz the story of his brother-in-law, a\u000abarber who had never been able to afford health insurance. He finally got\u000ainsurance thanks to Obamacare \u2014 and discovered that it was too late. He had\u000aterminal cancer, and nothing could be done.The voter asked how the candidate\u000awould replace the law that might have saved his brother-in-law if it had been\u000ain effect earlier. Needless to say, all he got was boilerplate about\u000agovernment regulations and the usual false claims that Obamacare has destroyed\u000a\u201cmillions of jobs\u201d and caused premiums to \u201cskyrocket.\u201dFor the record, job\u000agrowth since the Affordable Care Act went fully into effect has been the best\u000asince the 1990s, and health costs have risen much more slowly than before.So\u000aMr. Cruz has a truth problem. But what else can we learn from this encounter?\u000aThat the Affordable Care Act is already doing enormous good. It came too late\u000ato save one man\u2019s life, but it will surely save many others. Why, then, do we\u000ahear not just conservatives but also many progressives trashing President\u000aObama\u2019s biggest policy achievement?Part of the answer is that Bernie Sanders\u000ahas chosen to make re-litigating reform, and trying for single-payer, a\u000acenterpiece of his presidential campaign. So some Sanders supporters have\u000ataken to attacking Obamacare as a failed system.We saw something similar back\u000ain 2008, when some Obama supporters temporarily became bitter opponents of the\u000aindividual mandate \u2014 the requirement that everyone buy insurance \u2014 which\u000aHillary Clinton supported but Mr. Obama opposed. (Once in office, he in effect\u000aconceded that she had been right, and included the mandate in his\u000ainitiative.)But the truth is, Mr. Sanders is just amplifying left-wing\u000acritiques of health reform that were already out there. And some of these\u000acritiques have merit. Others don\u2019t.Let\u2019s start with the good critiques, which\u000ainvolve coverage and cost.The number of uninsured Americans has dropped\u000asharply, especially in states that have tried to make the law work. But\u000amillions are still uncovered, and in some cases high deductibles make coverage\u000aless useful than it should be.This isn\u2019t inherent in a non-single-payer\u000asystem: Other countries with Obamacare-type systems, like the Netherlands and\u000aSwitzerland, do have near-universal coverage even though they rely on private\u000ainsurers. But Obamacare as currently constituted doesn\u2019t seem likely to get\u000athere, perhaps because it\u2019s somewhat underfunded.Meanwhile, although cost\u000acontrol is looking better than even reform advocates expected, America\u2019s\u000ahealth care remains much more expensive than anyone else\u2019s.So yes, there are\u000areal issues with Obamacare. The question is how to address those issues in a\u000apolitically feasible way.But a lot of what I hear from the left is not so much\u000aa complaint about how the reform falls short as outrage that private insurers\u000aget to play any role. The idea seems to be that any role for the profit motive\u000ataints the whole effort.That is, however, a really bad critique. Yes,\u000aObamacare did preserve private insurance \u2014 mainly to avoid big, politically\u000arisky changes for Americans who already had good insurance, but also to buy\u000asupport or at least quiescence from the insurance industry. But the fact that\u000asome insurers are making money from reform (and their profits are not, by the\u000away, all that large) isn\u2019t a reason to oppose that reform. The point is to\u000ahelp the uninsured, not to punish or demonize insurance companies.And speaking\u000aof demonization: One unpleasant, ugly side of this debate has been the\u000atendency of some Sanders supporters, and sometimes the campaign itself, to\u000asuggest that anyone raising questions about the senator\u2019s proposals must be a\u000acorrupt tool of vested interests.Recently Kenneth Thorpe, a respected health\u000apolicy expert and a longtime supporter of reform, tried to put numbers on the\u000aSanders plan, and concluded that it would cost substantially more than the\u000acampaign says. He may or may not be right, although most of the health wonks I\u000aknow have reached similar conclusions.But the campaign\u2019s policy director\u000aimmediately attacked Mr. Thorpe\u2019s integrity: \u201cIt\u2019s coming from a gentleman\u000athat worked for Blue Cross Blue Shield. It\u2019s exactly what you would expect\u000asomebody who worked for B.C.B.S. to come up with.\u201d Oh, boy.And let\u2019s be clear:\u000aThis kind of thing can do real harm. The truth is that whomever the Democrats\u000anominate, the general election is mainly going to be a referendum on whether\u000awe preserve the real if incomplete progress we\u2019ve made on health, financial\u000areform and the environment. The last thing progressives should be doing is\u000atrash-talking that progress and impugning the motives of people who are\u000afundamentally on their side.\u000a\u000a

VLast year, we encouraged returning Obamacare customers to shop around for a\u000abetter deal. This year, a lot of people will have no choice.In markets\u000athroughout the country, the plan in the most popular category that was least\u000aexpensive this year will not be offered next year. That means that some people\u000awho took our advice and shopped for a bargain will need to shop again, even if\u000athey\u2019re happy with their plan.There are 499 markets for Obamacare plans in the\u000aUnited States. In 89 of them, the insurance company that offered this year\u2019s\u000abest deal in the \u201csilver\u201d category will not be returning for 2016. We\u2019ve\u000amarked those areas in dark grey on our map. Most of those exits are a result\u000aof insurance co-op plans that failed. A few exits came as insurers that are\u000astill operating elsewhere decided to leave particular markets. People in these\u000acanceled plans can\u2019t simply renew their current policy if they like it \u2014 they\u000ahave to go back into the marketplace and find a new insurer.The widespread\u000acancellations reflect continuing shifts in the new health insurance markets,\u000awhich sprang into being in 2014. Insurers are still learning what sorts of\u000aplans will be most popular and what prices will be low enough to attract\u000acustomers while still covering their medical bills.The numbers come from an\u000aanalysis from the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform, which did the\u000awork of examining all the plans and matching 2015 products with 2016\u000aofferings. McKinsey examined the larger market areas that insurance companies\u000ause to set their rates, instead of individual counties. That means that our\u000aestimate of terminated plans may be an undercount, because there are some\u000aadditional counties where renewing customers will be out of luck.Our advice\u000afrom last year still applies. Even people who aren\u2019t forced back into the\u000amarketplace could be well served by examining their options. The McKinsey\u000aanalysis finds that, in many markets, people willing to switch plans could\u000aexperience significant savings on their premiums. A government analysis, which\u000alooked at all the plans people currently hold, found that more than 80 percent\u000aof federal marketplace shoppers could find a better deal if they were willing\u000ato switch. And a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation published Wednesday\u000aestimated that renewers in the kind of plan we looked at would benefit from\u000aswitching in 73 percent of counties.And some of the 2016 plans that are\u000aconsidered renewals really aren\u2019t identical to their 2015 counterparts; they\u000amay have subtle changes in what customers have to pay for or what services are\u000acovered. The government\u2019s website for the marketplaces in most states,\u000aHealthCare.gov, is set up to provide more information about the differences\u000abetween plans this year.Of course, switching insurance plans may mean even\u000abigger changes. Different plans may have different structures of deductibles\u000aand other out-of-pocket payments. They may also mean switching to new doctors\u000aor other caregivers. My colleague Abby Goodnough has written about some\u000aObamacare shoppers who are planning to switch plans for the third time this\u000ayear. Many have found the shifts disorienting, even as they welcome new\u000achoices that didn\u2019t exist before the Obamacare market existed.\u000a\u000a

VBeyond the headline numbers showing a substantial decline in the number of\u000aAmericans without health insurance, today\u2019s Census Bureau report contained\u000asome important details, including:Enrollment numbers from the federal\u000agovernment have told us that millions of Americans signed up for private\u000ahealth insurance in the new Obamacare marketplaces. But some skeptics had\u000aworried that those sign-ups weren\u2019t uninsured people, but instead previously\u000ainsured people whose employers had stopped offering coverage once government-\u000asubsidized options were available.Edmund Haislmaier at the Heritage Foundation\u000ahas been the most prominent proponent of this theory. Using data from\u000ainsurance company filings, he estimated that only a small minority of\u000amarketplace participants represented previously uninsured people.Before today,\u000ait has been really hard to know for sure. Most private surveys have a poor\u000atrack record in measuring what kind of health insurance people have. The\u000acensus report, in contrast, asks more questions and is more reliable. The\u000areport found that the number of Americans with employer coverage held steady \u2014\u000athere was no statistically significant change between 2013 and 2014. Some\u000aemployers probably did stop offering their workers coverage. And maybe more\u000awill follow suit. But in 2014, it looks as if the new marketplace customers\u000acame from the ranks of the previously uninsured. So far, it doesn\u2019t look as if\u000athe new insurance options mean the beginning of the end of employer-sponsored\u000acoverage.Before Obamacare, most uninsured Americans were poor or near-poor, so\u000ait\u2019s not surprising that Americans with the lowest incomes benefited the most\u000afrom the insurance coverage expansion. The law made Medicaid available to low-\u000aincome people in many states and offered highly subsidized coverage to people\u000abuying private plans who earned just above the poverty line.But the census\u000anumbers show a trend that worries some experts on the health law: Takeup among\u000amiddle-class Americans looks weaker than it does among those earning the least\u000amoney. There were fewer middle-class people without insurance to begin with,\u000abut the numbers still suggest that new options may be unappealing or out of\u000areach to people earning higher incomes.The health law was intended to expand\u000athe federal-state Medicaid program to people earning less than 138 percent of\u000athe federal poverty level \u2014 about $16,000 for a single person \u2014 in every state\u000aof the country. But the Supreme Court made the Medicaid expansion optional,\u000aand not every state has signed on.The census confirms the findings of several\u000aearlier studies: States that expanded Medicaid saw substantially bigger\u000areductions in their uninsured rates than those that didn\u2019t. The effect appears\u000ato travel up the income scale, too. Even people who didn\u2019t qualify for\u000aMedicaid appear to have obtained insurance in greater numbers in states where\u000athe Medicaid expansion took place. That may be because states that expanded\u000aembraced the health law more fully, and worked harder to get people at all\u000aincomes enrolled in insurance.A year ago, my colleague Kevin Quealy and I\u000areported on estimates, produced by Enroll America and Civis Analytics, of how\u000athe uninsured rate had changed. The two groups used tools perfected by\u000apolitical campaigns to model exactly who had benefited from the Affordable\u000aCare Act\u2019s coverage expansion.We wrote then that the data showed how the\u000aAffordable Care Act was pushing back against inequality, by offering insurance\u000ato groups that had fared poorly in recent decades.On the big demographic\u000atrends, the model performed admirably. The census confirms that insurance\u000acoverage improved disproportionately among groups the model identified: black\u000aand Hispanic Americans, the young and the poor.But the model wasn\u2019t perfect.\u000aIts rankings of state-level reductions in the uninsured rate matched the\u000acensus findings in most cases, but not all. It appears to have overestimated\u000ainsurance gains in Nevada, New Mexico and New Hampshire, for example, and\u000aunderestimated improvements in Iowa and Kansas.Of course, we\u2019re now most of\u000athe way through 2015, and the effects of the Affordable Care Act continue to\u000abe felt. More states have expanded Medicaid. More people have signed up for\u000anew private coverage. More employers may have changed their minds about what\u000ato offer their workers. The census report gives us a reliable, but old,\u000asnapshot of what has happened to the insurance landscape. It will be tempting\u000ato rely on models to help us understand what\u2019s happening until the Census\u000aBureau updates its numbers again next September.\u000a\u000a

VA disaster has been averted. The nuclear deal concluded by six major powers\u000awith Iran is now unstoppable in Congress. The only question is whether\u000aPresident Obama will have to veto a Republican resolution of disapproval or\u000aDemocrats will have enough votes to spare him that obligation by filibustering\u000athe resolution and ensuring it never leaves the Senate.The second outcome\u000awould be preferable. An override-proof presidential veto of a congressional\u000aresolution of disapproval is not the best path to a historic international\u000aaccord. Major arms control treaties used to be bipartisan affairs. Those days\u000aare gone. Still, Republican maneuvering, backed by Prime Minister Benjamin\u000aNetanyahu of Israel, has not prevailed. That\u2019s a victory for reason in a\u000aseason of rage.Why has a disaster been averted? Because if the deal had\u000aunraveled in Congress, so would America\u2019s standing as a global power. Russia,\u000aChina and the European Union would have concluded that the United States was\u000anot serious. To negotiate over years a tough compromise obliging Iran, among\u000aother measures, to slash its stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent and\u000aits operating centrifuges by two-thirds, and then walk away in a righteous and\u000adeluded funk \u2014 well, that\u2019s not how America won the respect of the world. It\u000adid so by being consequential in hot wars and cold.Perhaps American power\u000amatters less these days. I don\u2019t think so. If America\u2019s word is shot, so are\u000athe underpinnings of global security. What would have been left of that word\u000aafter an Iranian volte-face \u2014 to follow the Syrian volte-face and ongoing\u000adebacle \u2014 would have been meager indeed. America the Undependable would have\u000abecome a watchword.Then there\u2019s Iranian power. Absent the nuclear deal, it\u000awould have grown. Tehran would have secured its objective of relief from\u000asanctions \u2014 because the current coalition would have crumbled \u2014 without having\u000ato scale back its nuclear program or submit it to international inspection of\u000aunprecedented intensity.Iran would have resumed installation of new\u000acentrifuges and increased the quantity and quality of its enriched uranium,\u000ajust as it did for many years before Obama\u2019s diplomacy reversed things. As\u000aSecretary of State John Kerry remarked this week, rejection would have left\u000athe United States and its allies in \u201cthe very dangerous spot that we were in\u000atwo years ago\u201d \u2014 only \u201cdevoid of any realistic plan or option.\u201dOf course, one\u000aoption would have resurfaced: the military one, a certain catastrophe with a\u000amaximum setback of Iran\u2019s nuclear program of perhaps three years, against 15\u000ayears in a deal that would avoid a third unwinnable American war certain to\u000aconvince every wavering Iranian of the need for a nuclear weapon.There was no\u000a\u201cbetter deal.\u201d That\u2019s the fantasy of all those who hate Iran and hate Obama\u000a(which one more is often unclear). The nuclear deal has become \u201csuch a\u000aluscious piece of Republican propaganda,\u201d William Luers, the director of the\u000aIran Project, whose goal is to improve American-Iranian relations, told me.\u000aAnd a long election season has already begun.I said a disaster had been\u000aaverted. A disaster has also been revealed. It is that not one \u2014 not one \u2014 of\u000athe 301 Republican members of Congress (the largest Republican majority since\u000a1929-31) supports the deal, despite the overwhelming evidence that the accord,\u000awhile far from perfect, is the best achievable, as almost all Democrats\u000aconcluded after often agonized review.Republicans, prodded by Netanyahu and\u000athe American Israel Public Affairs Committee (in overdrive on the Iran\u000aquestion), are not about to let go of their Iran toy. It\u2019s a way to attack the\u000apresident; it\u2019s also a way to raise money.The deal will become the \u201cObamacare\u000aof foreign policy,\u201d Nicholas Burns, a Harvard professor and former under\u000asecretary of state, told me. Yes, it will. That is, it will be something\u000asensible (at least in the eyes of most people across the world) to which\u000aRepublicans will never acquiesce and which they will try to use in every\u000aconceivable way to undermine a president they loathe.Prepare for congressional\u000aattempts to step up enforcement of non-nuclear-related Iran sanctions,\u000aincrease military aid to Israel over the next decade, constrain Iran\u2019s options\u000ain spending the windfall from sanctions relief, bolster Persian Gulf allies,\u000aand so on. There\u2019s a good case for doing much of this, as Obama himself has\u000aargued. But that case gets undermined when the underlying Republican objective\u000ais to sabotage the nuclear deal. Implacable hostility to Iran will be met in\u000akind.Aipac recently put out a memo called \u201cPromises Cannot Fix a Bad Deal.\u201d In\u000aessence it said nothing Obama promises Israel will help because the deal\u2019s\u000a\u201cfatal flaw\u201d is it \u201clegitimizes Iran as a nuclear-threshold state in 15\u000ayears.\u201dHere\u2019s some breaking news for Aipac: Iran is a nuclear-threshold state\u000atoday. The great merit of the deal is to slash and ring-fence acquired Iranian\u000anuclear capacity until 2030. To say that is not in Israel\u2019s security interest\u000ais utterly unpersuasive.\u000a\u000a

VWas I on the edge of my seat, waiting for the Supreme Court decision on\u000aObamacare subsidies? No \u2014 I was pacing the room, too nervous to sit, worried\u000athat the court would use one sloppily worded sentence to deprive millions of\u000ahealth insurance, condemn tens of thousands to financial ruin, and send\u000athousands to premature death.It didn\u2019t. And that means that the big\u000adistractions \u2014 the teething problems of the website, the objectively ludicrous\u000abut nonetheless menacing attempts at legal sabotage \u2014 are behind us, and we\u000acan focus on the reality of health reform. The Affordable Care Act is now in\u000aits second year of full operation; how\u2019s it doing?The answer is, better than\u000aeven many supporters realize.Start with the act\u2019s most basic purpose, to cover\u000athe previously uninsured. Opponents of the law insisted that it would actually\u000areduce coverage; in reality, around 15 million Americans have gained\u000ainsurance.But isn\u2019t that a very partial success, with millions still\u000auncovered? Well, many of those still uninsured are in that position because\u000atheir state governments have refused to let the federal government enroll them\u000ain Medicaid.Beyond that, you need to realize that the law was never intended\u000aor expected to cover everyone. Undocumented immigrants aren\u2019t eligible, and\u000aany system that doesn\u2019t enroll people automatically will see some of the\u000apopulation fall through the cracks. Massachusetts has had guaranteed health\u000acoverage for almost a decade, but 5 percent of its nonelderly adult population\u000aremains uninsured.Suppose we use 5 percent uninsured as a benchmark. How much\u000aprogress have we made toward getting there? In states that have implemented\u000athe act in full and expanded Medicaid, data from the Urban Institute show the\u000auninsured falling from more than 16 percent to just 7.5 percent \u2014 that is, in\u000ayear two we\u2019re already around 80 percent of the way there. Most of the way\u000awith the A.C.A.!But how good is that coverage? Cheaper plans under the law do\u000ahave relatively large deductibles and impose significant out-of-pocket costs.\u000aStill, the plans are vastly better than no coverage at all, or the bare-bones\u000aplans that the act made illegal. The newly insured have seen a sharp drop in\u000ahealth-related financial distress, and report a high degree of satisfaction\u000awith their coverage.What about costs? In 2013 there were dire warnings about a\u000alooming \u201crate shock\u201d; instead, premiums came in well below expectations. In\u000a2014 the usual suspects declared that huge premium increases were looming for\u000a2015; the actual rise was just 2 percent. There was another flurry of scare\u000astories about rate hikes earlier this year, but as more information comes in\u000ait looks as if premium increases for 2016 will be bigger than for this year\u000abut still modest by historical standards \u2014 which means that premiums remain\u000amuch lower than expected.And there has also been a sharp slowdown in the\u000agrowth of overall health spending, which is probably due in part to the cost-\u000acontrol measures, largely aimed at Medicare, that were also an important part\u000aof health reform.What about economic side effects? One of the many, many\u000aRepublican votes against Obamacare involved passing something called the\u000aRepealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act, and opponents have consistently\u000awarned that helping Americans afford health care would lead to economic doom.\u000aBut there\u2019s no job-killing in the data: The U.S. economy has added more than\u000a240,000 jobs a month on average since Obamacare went into effect, its biggest\u000agains since the 1990s.Finally, what about claims that health reform would\u000acause the budget deficit to explode? In reality, the deficit has continued to\u000adecline, and the Congressional Budget Office recently reaffirmed its\u000aconclusion that repealing Obamacare would increase, not reduce, the\u000adeficit.Put all these things together, and what you have is a portrait of\u000apolicy triumph \u2014 a law that, despite everything its opponents have done to\u000aundermine it, is achieving its goals, costing less than expected, and making\u000athe lives of millions of Americans better and more secure.Now, you might\u000awonder why a law that works so well and does so much good is the object of so\u000amuch political venom \u2014 venom that is, by the way, on full display in Justice\u000aAntonin Scalia\u2019s dissenting opinion, with its rants against \u201cinterpretive\u000ajiggery-pokery.\u201d But what conservatives have always feared about health reform\u000ais the possibility that it might succeed, and in so doing remind voters that\u000asometimes government action can improve ordinary Americans\u2019 lives.That\u2019s why\u000athe right went all out to destroy the Clinton health plan in 1993, and tried\u000ato do the same to the Affordable Care Act. But Obamacare has survived, it\u2019s\u000ahere, and it\u2019s working. The great conservative nightmare has come true. And\u000ait\u2019s a beautiful thing.\u000a\u000a
