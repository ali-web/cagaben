They hate freedom, they hate good over evil, they would deny us\nthe basic human right to self defense &amp; to KEEP &amp; BEAR ARMS while many\nof them have tax paid hired ARMED security!

It also\nwould establish a mandatory five-year prison sentence for anyone found with a\ngun after being convicted of domestic violence.Democrats hailed the measures\nas life-saving and as building on the 2013 Firearms Safety Act, which banned\ncertain military-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, among other\nthings. That provision of the law was deemed potentially unconstitutional by a\nthree-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in\nRichmond, and send back to a district court in Baltimore for\nreconsideration.Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh said he is not\nconcerned about the challenge to the Firearms Safety Act, adding that the\nbills introduced Wednesday will “withstand legal challenges.”“Three other\ncircuits … have held the same types of laws to be constitutional. The Fourth\nCircuit is out of step with the country,” Mr. Frosh said.He said the state\nwould either appeal to the entire Fourth Circuit court or take the case to the\nU.S. Supreme Court.“Either way, we think we’ll be successful,” he said.Sen.\nJames C. Rosapepe, Prince George’s County Democrat, said Republicans had\nlabeled unconstitutional the idea of preventing anyone on the terrorist watch\nlist from owning a gun, but no list is perfect.“You’ve got to balance the\nsafety and security of the people of the United States, and the reality is,\nterrorism is real, it’s here and if you’re too dangerous to get on an\nairplane, you’re too dangerous to buy a gun. It’s not more complicated than\nthat,” Mr. Rosapepe said.Republican leaders said they had not yet read the\nbills, but if constitutional issues are sorted out, they would be open to talk\nabout them.“The devil’s in the details,” Senate Minority Leader J.B. Jennings\nsaid. “On the domestic violence side, without a doubt, that’s one of the most\nhorrible things that you hear a domestic violence case that has gone to that\npoint where somebody has actually murdered an individual with a firearm. So\nthat one, I have no problem looking at, let’s talk about it.”The Baltimore\nCounty Republican also said he could support the no-fly list gun ban as long\nas the state ensures it isn’t easy to get someone on the list just because\n“they don’t like somebody.”Democratic leaders said these are “common sense\nmeasures” that are widely supported by Marylanders.House Speaker Michael E.\nBusch said that whether lawmakers are Republican or Democrat, they would\nlisten to their constituencies and Marylanders are asking for increased gun\ncontrol._Story Continues →_\n\n", "title" : "Maryland Democrats offer 3 gun control bills as legislative priorities - Washington Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Maryland Democrats offer 3 gun control bills as legislative priorities http://goo.gl/gr7n9R", "link" : "https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/697478834770354176", "retweets" : 7, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-10T01:54:47.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 3, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "697478834770354176" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "washtimes", "link" : "http://goo.gl/gr7n9R" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56dc7c62955d142bd0af68c5" }, "content" : "ANNAPOLIS, Md. — Democrats in the General Assembly said Wednesday that they\nwill try to expand gun controls this year, hoping to build on some of the\nnation’s toughest laws by banning firearms on college campuses and requiring a\nprocess for those convicted of domestic violence to turn in their\nguns.Lawmakers announced the push even as the state’s strict ban on military-\nstyle rifles and large-capacity magazines, enacted in the months after the\n2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, have run into trouble in federal\ncourts.“Guns don’t need to be on college campuses,” Attorney General Brian E.\nFrosh said. “They don’t need to be in the hands of domestic abusers. These\nbills provide real measures of safety for real people.”Democrats are seeking a\npackage of three bills: one to ban firearms on college campuses, one to\nrequire courts to inform those convicted of domestic violence they have 48\nhours to relinquish their guns and one that would prevent police from issuing\nfirearms permits to anyone listed on the FBI’s terrorist watch list.On\nTuesday, Sen. Jamie Raskin, Montgomery County Democrat, announced an\nadditional two bills that would mandate background checks before the purchase\nof a rifle or shotgun, and one that would alert law enforcement if a\nprohibited purchaser attempts to buy a gun.The bills could cause friction with\nGov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who received the National Rifle Association’s\nsupport in his 2014 campaign. His spokesperson said Wednesday that the\ngovernor had no comment on the bills and was not aware that they would be\nintroduced.Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., Prince George’s\nDemocrat, said he couldn’t imagine Mr. Hogan opposing them.“The person he’s\njoined at the hip with is [Gov.] Chris Christie in New Jersey, and Chris\nChristie signed the same bill into law, the no-fly zone [in 2013], and no guns\non campus is common sense,” Mr. Miller said. “And the domestic violence,\nthat’s already the law. We just want judges to enforce it, so hopefully he’ll\nsign all three.”Democrats said the bills build on the 2013 Firearms Safety\nAct, a sweeping law that banned the sale of nearly all semi-automatic rifles\nand high-capacity ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 bullets. It also\nrequired mandatory extensive background checks, that all new gun buyers submit\ndigital fingerprints to state police, and licensing for guns other than\nhunting rifles or shotguns.A federal appeals court last week said the law\ninfringes on Second Amendment rights and sent it back to a lower court for\nstricter review.Mr. Frosh said he will appeal the appeals court’s ruling and\nexpressed confidence that the 2013 law and the proposed bills will withstand\ncourt scrutiny.Republican leaders said they had not yet read the bills but\nwould be open to talking about them.“The devil’s in the details,” said Senate\nMinority Leader J.B. Jennings, Baltimore County Republican. “On the domestic\nviolence side, without a doubt, that’s one of the most horrible things that\nyou hear: a domestic violence case that has gone to that point where somebody\nhas actually murdered an individual with a firearm. So that one, I have no\nproblem looking at. Let’s talk about it.”Mr. Jennings said he would consider\nthe terrorist watch list proposal as well but wanted to know how easy it would\nbe for a person to end up on the list.Maryland gun rights groups said the\nbills would do little to curtail rising crime rates._Story Continues →_\n\n", "title" : "Maryland gun control expansion fills Democrats' package of 3 bills - Washington Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Maryland Democrats are trying to expand on some of the nation's toughest gun control laws: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/10/maryland-gun-control-expansion-fills-democrats-pac/ pic.twitter.com/4XVmK1r4g8", "link" : "https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/697584985155436544", "retweets" : 8, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-10T08:56:35.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 4, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "697584985155436544" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "washtimes", "link" : "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/10/maryland-gun-control-expansion-fills-democrats-pac/" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56dc7c62955d142bd0af68c6" }, "content" : "There is nothing so comforting as a closely held prejudice, even when it\nrepeatedly harms you. The white-hot passion of Democratic politicians to\nrestrict and even strip Americans of their constitutionally guaranteed right\nto buy, own, keep, shoot and carry firearms continues as a monument to self-\nabuse.Simply put, the gun control issue is a loser. It doesn’t matter that the\npaid consultants, the lobbyists from the gun-prohibition industry, or the East\nCoast media all assure candidates that it’s now safe to come out of hiding and\nproclaim their open hatred of the very concept of self-defense and protecting\nyour family. The history of Democrats who push to rip away the rights of\nmillions of Americans constitutes a list of “whatever happened to” candidates.\nFrom dozens of Democrats who lost their seats in Congress because of their\ngun-ban vote in 1994 to Al Gore’s anti-rights position, which has been\ncredited with costing him the presidency, the party of “trust the government\nfor your personal safety” keeps having to relearn the lesson. In point of\nfact, their own party put out a paper some years ago warning candidates to not\ntalk about gun control, calling it a loser issue.How quickly they forget.Now\nHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders fight to establish who is the strongest\nanti-Constitution candidate. It’s a clear indication neither they nor their\nadvisers actually talk to real people outside the Washington cocktail\ncircuit.For more than 20 years I’ve hosted a national radio talk show about\nguns, and through that I’ve talked with thousands of people across the country\n— people who have owned guns all their lives, people who only recently bought\na gun, and people who have never owned a gun but now want to. Typically, I’ll\nask why they are thinking of buying their first gun, and the answer always is\nthat they want to protect themselves and their families. They have looked at\nthe news, studied the events, watched the videos of attacks on the streets,\nand they have concluded that no one else will be on the scene to protect them.\nOh, and fully a third of first-time handgun buyers these days are women, so\nput aside that mental image of a demographic which can be ignored.Perhaps it’s\nnatural for a U.S. senator who has Secret Service protection or who works\nbehind the security veil of the Capitol Police to not understand the desire\nfor safety. For someone who sees more government as the solution to\neverything, it must seem strange that a mother would opt to protect her\nchildren rather than trust that the call to the 911 operator will instantly\nsave her.Callers to “Tom Gresham’s Gun Talk” say they look at the well-known\nattacks, do the math and understand that the police will show up when they\ncan, but in most cases it’s too late to actually stop the attack. They\ncategorize assurances of “just call the police — it’s their job” as callous\nputdowns from those who never worry about their own safety.It may overstate it\nto call gun control the third rail of politics, but it’s certainly a hot stove\nthat Democrats should have learned to avoid. That’s even more so now than\neight years ago when Hillary Clinton soft-peddled her gun-ban leanings. During\nthe intervening years, millions of Americans have purchased their first gun,\nmoving from the undecided to committed. With their dollars they have voted for\ntheir own safety, and they simply don’t trust anyone who says they are\nwrong.In 2013, the rush to purchase guns and ammunition emptied shelves at gun\nstores for nearly a year. That push may have lessened a bit, but gun makers\nstill operate at maximum capacity. The millions of Americans buying guns do\nnot think, as Mrs. Clinton has suggested, that we should consider Australian-\nstyle gun confiscation here.The candidates have not been helped by others in\ntheir party who introduce bills in Congress and in the states calling for the\nconfiscation of the most popular rifles and handguns in the United States.\nFaced with clear evidence of the intent to ban guns, the public smirks at\nreassurances from candidates and President Obama when they proclaim, “No one\nwants to take away your guns.” It’s a lie, and everyone knows it.As for the\nclaim that “90 percent of the public wants background checks,” it doesn’t hold\nup when you look past the misleading polls. If you explain that there\ncurrently is a national background check requirement, and that every gun\npurchase from a licensed dealer includes a background check by the FBI, you\ntypically get, “Oh, I didn’t know that.” Likewise, if you explain that gun\nshows are governed by the same laws as all other gun sales, and that there is\nno exception for these community gatherings, the result tends to be a puzzled\nlook, then an angry response, as the duplicity of politicians and the media in\nmisleading the public on the mythical “gun show loophole” crystallizes.One is\nleft wondering why Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have opted to not only reveal,\nbut to loudly proclaim their enthusiasm for trampling the rights of 100\nmillion Americans. Have they not looked at the number of people scrambling to\nget permits for concealed carry in the swing states? Have they not looked at\nthe actions in the legislatures in swing states — actions opening concealed\ncarry to more areas, laws which allow teachers to carry guns in schools, and\neven calls to eliminate completely any requirement for a permit to carry a gun\nfor protection? The sea change in public opinion (for the first time, more\nthan half the people polled oppose a ban on so-called “assault weapons”)\nappears to have been missed by Democratic insiders. When it comes to guns, the\nswing states in the general election do not have the same take on guns as\neight years ago — back when Democrats knew better than to out themselves as\ngun banners.As the Democratic candidates move ever farther from public opinion\non the rights of gun owners, many observers scratch their heads, wondering how\nthe party can continue to allow its prejudice to outweigh its self-\ninterests.**• **_Tom Gresham hosts the nationally syndicated radio talk show\n“Tom Gresham’s Gun Talk” (guntalkmedia.com)._\n\n", "title" : "TOM GRESHAM: Why gun control is a loser for the Democrats - Washington Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Tom Gresham on why #guncontrol is a loser for the #Democrats http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/10/tom-gresham-why-gun-control-is-a-loser-for-the-dem/#.Vrvlb1uNkPQ.twitter  #Election2016 pic.twitter.com/vn1CGb7nHc", "link" : "https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/697596248744988672", "retweets" : 14, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-10T09:41:21.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 10, "hashtags" : "#guncontrol #Democrats # #Election2016", "id" : "697596248744988672" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "washtimes", "link" : "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/10/tom-gresham-why-gun-control-is-a-loser-for-the-dem/" }

He added that the\ndepartment hopes to get pre-clearance screening capabilities up and running at\nanother 10 international airports in nine countries.As a result of new\nsecurity protocols, the wait times for security screening at airports have\nincreased, but Mr. Johnson said “we believe this is necessary for the public’s\nown safety.”Efforts focused on counterterrorism also denied an additional\n3,000 people entry into the United States in fiscal 2015 based on the\ntightening of entry restrictions, he said.Mr. Johnson also highlighted efforts\nthe U.S. has taken to more narrowly tailor its immigration policies to address\nthreats to public safety and border security. He said since the administration\nchanged policy, replacing the Secure Communities program with the Priority\nEnforcement Program in July, that 16 counties that were not cooperating with\nthe federal government on illegal immigration issues have now come on board\n.Stepped-up efforts are also having an impact on the recent surge of illegal\nborder crossers from Central America that began late last year.According to\nDHS data, 3,133 unaccompanied minors were caught at the border in January,\nwhich was down from 6,786 the month before. And the number of family members\ntraveling together fell from nearly 9,000 in December to just 3,145 last\nmonth.

Gabrielle Giffords,\nArizona Democrat, spent around $13.8 million on the 2014 campaign, CNHI\nreported on Wednesday. With the National Rifle Association having contributed\n$31 million during that same cycle, however, proponents of firearm safety saw\ntheir lobbying efforts greatly outmatched by Second Amendment advocacy groups\nopposed to new gun laws.Campaign contributions aside, the Center for\nResponsive Politics determined that gun-rights groups also gave upwards of $27\nmillion in 2014 towards outside ad campaigns that either supported their\npreferred candidates or took aim at its opponents, or roughly twice as much\nspent by gun control groups ahead of Election Day.Preliminary data suggests\ngun-rights groups have so far given $806,409 to candidates running for office\nin 2016, CNHI reported, compared to $300 offered this cycle by gun-control\ngroups.Catherine Mortensen, a spokeswoman for the NRA, the nation’s largest\npro-gun group, told CNHI that lobbyists don’t have a “stranglehold” over any\npoliticians, but instead insisted that the majority of Americans simply oppose\nany new laws that would limit the types of firearms.“The American people\nsupport gun-rights over gun-control. That’s why Congress hasn’t chosen to pass\nmore gun-control laws,” she said.“The NRA doesn’t try to force people to vote\nwith them, instead they support candidates that are already committed to the\nSecond-Amendment rights of all law-abiding citizens,” added Sen. James\nLankford, Oklahoma Republican.

Asked whether she would take time to see the new feature film\n“13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi,” Mrs. Clinton replied, “I’m just\ntoo busy campaigning.”**SUPPOSING THERE’S AN INDICTMENT?**Former federal\nprosecutor **Joe DiGenova** recently suggested **Hillary Clinton** could be\nindicted over her use of a private email system as secretary of state in the\nnext 60 days. The prediction has attracted a pollster. Without naming any\nnames, Rasmussen Reports asked 1,000 likely voters this question: “If a\npolitical candidate is charged with a felony while running for office, should\nhe or she immediately stop campaigning, or should they continue running until\na court determines their guilt or innocence?”Forty-six percent overall said\nthe candidate in question should leave the campaign trail; 54 percent of\nRepublicans and 40 percent of Democrats agree. Meanwhile, 47 percent overall\nsaid the candidate should continue running; 41 percent of Republicans and 53\npercent of the Democrats agree.**TRUMP AND THE STUDENTS OF FAITH**Lest we\nforget, Republican front-runner **Donald Trump** addresses a huge audience of\nChristian students at Liberty University on Monday morning. The faith-driven\nspirit of the campus founded by the Rev. **Jerry Falwell** may inspire Mr.\nTrump to speak of his own faith, of keen interest to evangelical voters. Yes,\nC-SPAN will cover the event beginning at 10:30 a.m.But Mr. Trump is Mr. Trump.\nHe won’t linger long on the Virginia campus. The candidate is due at a second\nevent in New Hampshire just five hours later and journeys to Iowa Tuesday for\na town hall with **John Wayne**’s daughter, **Aissa Wayne**, at the John Wayne\nBirthplace Museum in Winterset. Then he’s off to Ames and a jumbo rally at\nIowa State University. “I will have a major announcement and a very special\nguest in attendance,” Mr. Trump tweeted on Sunday. Well, stay tuned.**YEAH,\nABOUT THAT IRAN ‘DEAL’**Critics of the White House deal with Iran are happy\nU.S. citizens held prisoner are finally home. But reality looms.“This deal\nconfirms **Hillary Clinton**’s approach to foreign policy is dangerously\nmisguided. While it is a relief to see unjustly held Americans returned home\nto their families, the Clinton-Obama nuclear agreement gives Iran too much in\nreturn for too little. Iran will have access to more than $100 billion in\nunfrozen assets to fuel its increasing aggression, and is ultimately never\nblocked from obtaining a nuclear weapon,” says Republican National Committee\nChairman **Reince Priebus**.“The need for new sanctions on Iran’s ballistic\nmissile program just one day after implementation of the nuclear deal began\nunderscores how flawed Hillary Clinton’s and **President Obama**’s approach\nreally is. An empowered Iran is not a result worth celebrating, and it’s clear\nonly a Republican president will take the steps necessary to ensure Iran’s\ndangerous nuclear ambitions are never realized,” Mr. Priebus concludes._Story\nContinues →_\n\n", "title" : "Inside the Beltway: Hillary Clinton's UFO story becomes a favorite topic of the global media: Study - Washington Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "'Inside the Beltway' on #HillaryClinton thoughts on UFOs, Americans ring on #guncontrol and more. #politics http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/17/inside-the-beltway-hillary-clinton-and-the-ufos-pa/", "link" : "https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/688890954602950657", "retweets" : 3, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-17T09:09:37.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 1, "hashtags" : "#HillaryClinton #guncontrol #politics", "id" : "688890954602950657" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "washtimes", "link" : "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/17/inside-the-beltway-hillary-clinton-and-the-ufos-pa/" }

Traxler Jr. wrote in the majority opinion.\nHe added that the law “significantly burdens the exercise of the right to arm\noneself at home.”** SEE ALSO: D.C. gun law casts pall over Md. resident five\nyears after plea deal **Maryland’s ban was enacted in 2013 in the wake of the\nSandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut. It prohibits\nthe sale or ownership of 45 types of military-style rifles, and of magazines\nthat hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.Proponents of the law, including\nMaryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh, said most mass violence incidents\nhave involved military-style weaponry and high-capacity magazines, and such\nweapons are not necessary for self-defense.“There is sound reason to conclude\nthat the Second Amendment affords no protection whatsoever to the assault\nrifles and shotguns, copycat weapons and large-capacity detachable magazines\nthat are banned by the state of Maryland,” said Mr. Frosh, who was a state\nsenator and a driving force behind enactment of the law in 2013.U.S. District\nJudge Catherine C. Blake in Baltimore upheld the ban in 2014, ruling that the\nlaw promotes public safety without trampling on core constitutional rights.\nShe used a standard known as “intermediate scrutiny,” which tests whether a\nlaw furthers an important government interest in a way that is substantially\nrelated to that interest.But the appeals court, based in Richmond, Virginia,\nsaid U.S. Supreme Court precedents established that individuals do have a\nfundamental right to own firearms and that Maryland’s law appears to be a ban\non entire classifications of weapons. The court majority said laws that go\nthat far must be subjected to the strictest scrutiny — which requires a law to\nbe narrowly tailored and the least restrictive means to further a compelling\ngovernment interest — something the lower court didn’t do.“This is not a\nfinding that Maryland’s law is unconstitutional. It is simply a ruling that\nthe test of its constitutionality is different from that used by the district\ncourt,” Judge Traxler wrote.The Supreme Court held in the 2008 Heller case and\nthe 2010 McDonald v. City of Chicago case that the Second Amendment applies to\nindividuals and guarantees their right to arms — though the court said\ngovernments can impose reasonable restrictions to protect public safety.Both\nsides in the gun rights debate now are arguing over the boundaries of those\nrestrictions, with several other appeals courts having upheld bans similar to\nMaryland’s.John P. Sweeney, attorney for gun rights supporters who challenged\nthe law, declined to comment, but a National Rifle Association official\ndeclared the ruling “an affirmation of the Heller decision and a victory for\nthe Second Amendment.”Chris Cox, executive director of the NRA’s Institute for\nLegislative Action, said his group is “optimistic that when the lower court\napplies the strict scrutiny standard, it will overturn Maryland’s ban on\nfirearms commonly used for self-protection. Today’s victory underscores the\nimportance of electing a president who believes in the Second Amendment and\nwill appoint judicial nominees who will uphold the Constitution.”Judge Robert\nB. King, the dissenting vote in Thursday’s ruling, wrote that the types of\nweapons banned by Maryland hardly constitute a Second Amendment\nviolation.“Let’s be real: The assault weapons banned by Maryland’s [law] are\nexceptionally lethal weapons of war,” Judge King wrote. “I am far from\nconvinced that the Second Amendment reaches the AR-15 and other assault\nweapons prohibited under Maryland law, given their military-style features,\nparticular dangerousness, and questionable utility for self-defense.”_Story\nContinues →_\n\n", "title" : "Maryland gun control law infringes on Second Amendment rights, appeals court rules - Washington Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "#Maryland #guncontrol law infringes on #SecondAmendment rights, appeals court rules: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/4/maryland-gun-control-law-infringes-second-amendmen/", "link" : "https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/695390106371256321", "retweets" : 7, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-04T07:34:55.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 10, "hashtags" : "#Maryland #guncontrol #SecondAmendment", "id" : "695390106371256321" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "washtimes", "link" : "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/4/maryland-gun-control-law-infringes-second-amendmen/" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56dc7c62955d142bd0af68cd" }, "content" : "  President Obama’s executive action to expand gun sale background checks has\nopened up a legal can of worms, specifically the president’s bid to broaden\nthe definition of who’s a dealer -- and therefore must get a license and\nconduct background checks. Under current federal law passed by Congress, only\nfederally licensed dealers must conduct background checks on buyers. The law\ndoes not specify whether this applies to online sales and other areas -- so\nthose selling or trading guns on websites or in informal settings such as flea\nmarkets often don’t register.As the centerpiece of Obama's new gun push, the\nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives on Monday night issued\nupdated guidance that now deems anyone “in the business” of selling guns a\ndealer, regardless of where they sell. All of which puts a constitutional\nspotlight on Obama’s actions, raising questions of interpretation that may\nhave to be settled by the courts.“Mr. Obama will now require that anyone who\nsells a gun, that is even an 'occasional' seller, will be required to perform\na background check. By defining what an 'occasional seller' is, the president\nis essentially interpreting the law, a job reserved for the courts,” Judge\nAndrew Napolitano, Fox News' senior judicial analyst, said in a FoxNews.com\nopinion piece. Until the courts weigh in, it falls on the sellers to figure\nout who technically is \"in the business\" of dealing. It's a tough question --\nand one with serious implications. As Obama noted during remarks at the White\nHouse Tuesday, failure to follow these rules can result in criminal\nprosecution. While the new guidance says collectors and gun hobbyists are\nlargely exempt, the exact definition of who must register and conduct\nbackground checks is vague. Some officials suggested that selling just one or\ntwo firearms could subject a seller to these rules. Philip Dacey, president of\nthe Pennsylvania Gun Collectors Association, told FoxNews.com that while he\nthinks the new orders will not have a huge impact on collectors, the devil is\nin the details.\"I think [to require a license for] one or two guns would be\nridiculous, and how will you enforce it? If there’s no paperwork trail, how\nwould you know when people are selling one or two guns to their neighbor?\"\nDacey said.Dacey also noted that getting a federal license could take over\nthree months and entail a complex process involving fingerprints, photographs\nand a visit by ATF agents. The guidance says determining whether someone is\n“engaged in the business” of dealing requires looking at \"the specific facts\nand circumstances of your activities.”“As a general rule, you will need a\nlicense if you repetitively buy and sell firearms with the principal motive of\nmaking a profit. In contrast, if you only make occasional sales of firearms\nfrom your personal collection, you do not need to be licensed,” the guidance\nsays.Click here to read the guidance.   However, the document also notes the\ncourts have deemed people dealers in some cases even if they only sell a\ncouple guns.“Note that while quantity and frequency of sales are relevant\nindicators, courts have upheld convictions for dealing without a license when\nas few as two firearms were sold, or when only one or two transactions took\nplace, when other factors were also present,” the guidance says.In a\nconference call with Attorney General Loretta Lynch and White House Press\nSecretary Josh  Earnest, senior adviser Valerie Jarrett sought to clarify, but\nrisked making the confusion even greater.“ATF will make clear that whether you\nare ‘engaged in the business’ depends on the facts and circumstances,” Jarrett\nsaid, according to The Washington Free Beacon. “On factors such as: whether\nyou represent yourself as a dealer, such as making business cards or taking\ncredit card statements. Whether you sell firearms shortly after they’re\nacquired or whether you buy or sell in the original packaging.”On the question\nof the number of guns sold, Lynch said: “It can be as few as one or two\ndepending upon the circumstances under which the person sells the gun.\" Adding\nto the questions, the background check provision rests in the murky realm of\nagency \"guidelines,\" which carry less weight than formally issued federal\nregulations and can easily be rescinded.Republicans blasted the new guidance\nas a form of intimidation that would only target law-abiding citizens.“[Obama]\nknows full well that the law already says that people who make their living\nselling firearms must be licensed, regardless of venue,” said House Speaker\nPaul Ryan, R-Wis., in a statement. “Still, rather than focus on criminals and\nterrorists, he goes after the most law-abiding of citizens. His words and\nactions amount to a form of intimidation that undermines\nliberty.”_FoxNews.com's Adam Shaw and The Associated Press contributed to this\nreport.___\n\n", "title" : "Obama's gun control actions open legal can of worms | Fox News", "twitter" : { "body" : "Obama's gun control actions open legal can of worms http://fxn.ws/1Z6oNUf via @foxnewspolitics pic.twitter.com/qeiYKMaVwW", "link" : "https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/684507193320722432", "retweets" : 119, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-05T06:50:07.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "@foxnewspolitics", "favs" : 155, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "684507193320722432" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "FoxNews", "link" : "http://fxn.ws/1Z6oNUf" }

White House\nPress Secretary Josh Earnest said Friday that there is a way to pass gun\ncontrol that doesn’t infringe on the rights of law-abiding Americans.  But\nSecond Amendment advocates and Republican politicians aren't convinced.\nApparently, neither are a number of Americans, who appear to be buying up guns\nat record levels.While there is no official data on gun sales, numbers on the\nFBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) can be used as\nan indicator of an increase or decrease in sales – although a one-to-one\ncorrelation cannot be made between a background check and a sale.The anecdotal\nevidence from store owners is backed up by the figures, which suggest recent\nmass shootings are followed by a strong push for gun control measures, the\ndemand for guns spikes dramatically.There have been 19.82 million checks so\nfar through November this year, and it is on pace to break the record. Black\nFriday saw the most background checks -- 185,345 -- in a single day. While\nBlack Friday frequently sees a high number of checks, this year’s Black Friday\nwas unique in that it came in the wake of the terror attacks in Paris, and\nless than two months after the Oct. 1 shooting at Umpqua Community College in\nOregon, after which President Obama angrily called again for stricter\nrestrictions on gun access.“We do see increases after these kinds of events\nthat cause people to be concerned about their own safety or because they fear\nlegislation may pass either on a state or federal level that may limit their\nfuture access to firearms or ammunition,” Mike Bazinet, a spokesman for the\nNational Shooting Sports Foundation, told FoxNews.com.The most significant\nincrease in background checks came after the Dec. 14, 2012 shooting at Sandy\nHook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 20 children and six\nadults were killed. In the emotional aftermath of the shooting, the push for\ngun control measures was at its most aggressive and passionate.\"If the media\nreally starts pushing gun control again, it’ll just be unreal what’s going to\nhappen.\"- Derrick Meyers, owner of River City FirearmsFour of the top 10 days\nfor background checks were in the days post-Newtown, while the highest week\nfor background checks on record was between December 17 and 23 2012, where\n953,613 checks were conducted – the first recorded week following the\nmassacre. That December finished with 2.78 million background checks – the\nmost for any month on record.Meyers told FoxNews.com that during that time his\nnormally significant stock almost ran out in his store.“If the media really\nstarts pushing gun control again, it’ll just be unreal what’s going to\nhappen,” Meyers said.The trend has been similar around other mass shootings\nthat occured while President Obama was in office. After 13 people were killed\nin the Nov. 5, 2009 Fort Hood massacre, background checks rose 14.1 percent\nthe next month.   After the July 12, 2012 movie theater shooting in Aurora,\nColorado, checks increased 17.3 percent to 1.53 million in August, which was\nat the time by far the highest August on record.Yet this was not always the\ncase. After the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting in Blacksburg Va,, in which gunman\nSeung-Hui Cho killed 32 people, background checks decreased 13.8% from the\nprevious month, and would drop three consecutive months after the\nshooting.After the Columbine shooting in 1999, background checks also\ndecreased from the previous month, with the shooting apparently having no\neffect on background checks.Gun store owners say the key to why recent\nshootings have boosted gun buying is due to the accompanying push for gun\ncontrol.“It depends on how much they’re all screaming about gun control,”\nWiley said, adding that when politicians push Second Amendment restrictions,\nbusiness can double or even triple.However, Meyers said that he believes that\nright now, fear is the driving factor. \"Right this second, it’s the shootings\nthemselves and people  \nare scared,\" he said, but added that a push for gun control is also a key\nfactor.\"Everytime the media puts out gun control, gun control, gun control,\nall that does is drive people into these stores.\"As calls for gun control\nincrease, however, the environment may sour for the gun industry.Democrats are\nincreasingly vocal in their calls for stricter gun control, with President\nObama staying focused on the issue and Democratic presidential candidates\nHillary Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley united on the need\nfor more gun control measures.Polls show that the increased anti-gun rhetoric\nis having at least a slight effect on public attitudes toward guns. An October\nGallup poll found that 55 percent of Americans want stricter gun laws, up from\n44 percent in October 2009 – the year President Obama took office. However, a\nSeptember Quinnipiac poll found that only 45 percent of voters support\nstricter gun laws.Other polls consistently show widespread support, as high as\n93 percent, for a federal law requiring universal background checks on all\npotential gun owners.While the industry may be seeing a short-term spike in\nsales, owners and industry advocates fear that in the long-term this could\nhave costs for business.Mike Flick, owner of Crosshairs USA in Torrance,\nCalif. told FoxNews.com that already the level of regulations can make selling\nguns take a lot longer, and more expensive.“The amount of documentation we\nmust maintain on file and have available at any time for state and federal\nregulators to inspect us, it’s laborious and tedious and you have to maintain\nit. That’s overhead and that’s cost. So when you add additional layers to that\n– I’m not saying all of it is a bad idea, some of it Is a good idea – but now\nin California it seems more punitive than about public safety,” Flick\nsaid.Other gun store owners in less regulated states shared Flick's\nconcern.“Do I worry about it? Yes I do as [the government] could make it a lot\nharder to do business and I could go from selling 30-40 guns a day to one or\ntwo guns a day,” Meyers said. “But we knew that when we got into this business\n– it is dictated by the government.”___Adam Shaw is a Politics Reporter for\nFoxNews.com.

Obama is traveling to Roseburg,\nOre., to meet with families of the victims of the Oct. 1, shooting at Umpqua\nCommunity College, as part of a four-day West Coast tour. President Obama’s\nunwelcome visit to Roseburg, Oregon Friday makes one thing clear: he is\nclearly more interested in politicizing the nine dead victims at Umpqua\nCommunity College than reducing violence in America. If the president truly\nwanted to solve the issue, he wouldn’t call for new gun restrictions, he’d\ninstead address the root cause of violence in America – sin and evil and the\nfamilies broken and torn apart because of it.President Obama’s hometown of\nChicago would actually be a perfect place to start. Despite restrictions on\nguns in Chicago, bullets spray like summertime sprinklers in Obama’s\nhometown.This year alone, there have been 2,300 shooting victims.  Obama’s\nfellow community organizers on the South Side live in a war zone, and the dots\nmarking crime spots on these neighborhood maps look like a decade-old\ndartboard. Local gang territories mirror school district maps, so teachers and\nparents protest redrawn school districts because it inevitably means open\nwarfare. On Sunday a man was shot to death and four others were wounded,\nincluding two 14-year-old teens, just a few miles from the President's Chicago\nhome. When it comes to advancing his liberal agenda, President Obama will\nexploit anything, even death and suffering.On weekend nights throughout the\nsummer, ambulances and emergency rooms staff-up to treat the inevitable\ncasualties. In the past two years, there have been 500 murders and more than\n5,000 shooting victims.  The South Side of Chicago would be a perfect place\nfor the president to condemn the root causes of this senseless violence – the\nevil and sin. That evil and sin has broken homes leaving children with no good\nrole models, devalued life and made people believe the lie that one life is\nmore important than another. President Obama should use the White House pulpit\nto confront this issue head on and crush our culture of violence that\nglorifies death and destruction. Lack of respect for life and the ever\nincreasing coarseness and crudeness in our culture contribute to a community\nof indifference, self-centeredness, and mayhem.  This evil infects\nneighborhoods, parks, and bus stops every day. Most of the victims are\nteenagers and young adults, but in the past decade, more than 90 children\nunder five have been killed in the crossfire.But instead of going to Chicago\nto address the real issue, Obama travels to Oregon to politicize last week’s\ncommunity college shooting and demand ineffective backwards gun-control\npolicies that empower criminals and terrorists at the expense of law-abiding\ncitizens.When it comes to advancing his liberal agenda, President Obama will\nexploit anything, even death and suffering.The Oregon shooting occurred in a\n“gun-free zone.”  It’s time we realize that “gun-free zones” are “sitting duck\nzones.” If existing gun laws did not prevent this massacre, there’s no reason\nto believe more restrictive laws will.  In fact, I keep asking liberals: ‘What\nlaw could we pass that would’ve prevented this?”  Liberals never have an\nanswer because there isn’t one and they know it.   Obama’s hometown has some\nof the toughest, strictest gun laws in America.  Prohibitions, bans,\nregistrations, confiscations, and mandates—Chicago has it all. And what has it\naccomplished to make the streets safer? Absolutely nothing. Chicago remains\none of the most dangerous and violence cities in America.  This real issue, at\nits core, demonstrates how conservatives differ from liberals whenever any\n“new” law is being discussed:  Liberals ask, “How does this law make me feel?”\nConservatives ask, “What does this law do?\" Talk of gun control makes the\nliberals feel warm and fuzzy.  However, the cold reality is that when you\ndisarm the good guys you put them at the mercy of the bad guys.

Clinton also called for closing loopholes in federal laws\nthat allow for gun-sale transactions to be completed if the buyer’s background\ncheck is not finished within three days.Clinton will unveil more details about\nher plans Monday during a campaign swing through New Hampshire.Her campaign\nsays her proposals also include a repeal of legislation shielding gun\nmanufacturers, distributors and dealers from most liability suits, even in the\ncase of mass shootings like the one that killed nine students and teachers at\nan Oregon community college on Thursday.The fatal shootings have sparked\nrenewed interest in Washington, the 2016 presidential campaign trails and\nelsewhere across the country about curbing gun violence.Clinton’s proposals\nalso mark an attempt to make up ground among the liberal wing of the\nDemocratic Party against her closest rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. While\nSanders has wooed the Democratic base with his liberal positions on issues\nlike income inequality and college debt, he's struggled to defend a more mixed\nrecord on gun legislation -- a reflection, he says, of his rural, gun-friendly\nhome-state.Sanders backed all the Democratic gun bills brought up in Congress\nafter the Sandy Hook shooting in 2012. But in 1993, he voted against the\nlandmark Brady handgun bill, which imposed a five-day waiting period for gun\npurchasers, and he backed the 2005 legislation granting legal immunity to many\nin the gun industry.Sanders now says he supports banning assault weapons and\nclosing the so-called \"gun show loophole\" that exempts private, unlicensed gun\nsales from background checks.“I’m going to try in every way,” Clinton said\nMonday. “I am going to get those guns out of people’s hands.”Clinton last week\nalso used the recent campus shootings to slam Republican lawmakers, whom she\nsays \"refuse to do anything\" about mass shootings.\"We need to make every\npolitician who sides with [the NRA] to look in the eyes of parents whose kids\nhave been murdered,\" Clinton said. \"The GOP counts on a dedicated group that\nscares politicians and says 'We will vote against you' ... So we will take\nthem on. We took them on in the '90s; we're gonna take them on again.\"_The\nAssociated Press contributed to this report._ __\n\n", "title" : "Clinton unveils plan for tighter gun control including executive action, expanded background checks | Fox News", "twitter" : { "body" : "Hillary Clinton to push new gun control proposals days after Oregon college shooting http://fxn.ws/1Rq9Moo via @foxnewspolitics", "link" : "https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/650895768572809216", "retweets" : 69, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-10-04T14:50:18.000-0700" }, "mentions" : "@foxnewspolitics", "favs" : 64, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "650895768572809216" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "FoxNews", "link" : "http://fxn.ws/1Rq9Moo" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56dc7c62955d142bd0af68d1" }, "content" : "  Americans desperately want something done about mass public shootings.\nHillary Clinton took a page from President Obama’s playbook Monday, vowing\nthat as president she will bypass Congress and use executive action to change\nhow guns can be purchased.She is angry that Republicans \"refuse to do\nanything\" about mass shootings.But that isn’t accurate. Clinton isn’t the only\none to speak out boldly on this topic. On Saturday, Donald Trump said: “And by\nthe way, it was a gun-free zone. ... I’ll tell you, if you had a couple of the\nteachers or someone with guns in that room, you would have been a hell of a\nlot better off.” Others such as Sen. Marco Rubio have made a similar\npoint.”The Republican push has at least the virtue of potentially stopping\nthese crimes. The Umpqua Community College in Oregon shooting shows yet\nanother case where guns were banned. With these killers explicitly picking\nplaces where victims are defenseless, at some point it should be impossible to\nignore.Clinton may claim she cares about the poor, but poor people in the\nhighest-crime areas benefit the most from gun ownership, and they are the\npeople who would be priced out of owning guns for protection.Clinton’s\nproposals wouldn’t have stopped these attacks. The “universal” background\nchecks on private transfers may raise the cost of law-abiding citizens getting\nguns.They wouldn’t have stopped any of the mass public shootings during Barack\nObama’s presidency, including last Thursday’s in Oregon. At some point an\nenterprising reporter might ask Obama or Clinton to name just one of the cases\nthey have used to push this law where the law would have stopped the\nattack.Clinton is proposing three other measures:**1\\. Prohibiting domestic\nabusers and stalkers from buying and possessing guns.** This sounds\nreasonable, but the change from existing law would allow people to have their\nguns taken from them without a court hearing. If people are committing crimes,\nthey should be prosecuted for felonies or misdemeanors, but Clinton’s solution\nis to take away their guns even when they aren’t being prosecuted.**2. Closing\nthe “Charleston Loophole,” where the federal background check worker didn’t\ncontact the right law enforcement agencies.** But the truth is more\ncomplicated. First, even a perfectly functioning background check system very\nlikely wouldn’t have stopped the suspect, Dylann Roof, from getting a gun.\nSecond, the current background check system is a much worse mess than Clinton\nrecognizes.Roof allegedly planned his attack for at least six months, so it’s\nhard to believe he couldn’t have figured out some way to obtain a gun. Indeed,\nhe stole the gun he used in this attack.The truth is, the databases the\ngovernment uses to determine eligibility for gun purchases are rife with\nerrors.FBI Director James Comey’s comments in July about the FBI’s background\ncheck system focus on one type of error, where someone who should have been\nprohibited from getting a gun wasn’t stopped. But a much more common error\ninvolves people who _should_ be able to buy guns but_ are_ stopped.**3\\.\nRepeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which prevents the\nmanufacturers and dealers of firearms from being held liable for crimes\ncommitted with their weapons.** It might be hard to remember, but gun makers\nwere being sued because they \"specifically geared\" their weapons to make them\nattractive to gang members. Among the offending characteristics listed are low\nprice, easy concealability, corrosion resistance and high firepower. Suing an\nindustry for making affordable products shows how far the liability-litigation\nmadness has gone.The lawsuits were simply an attempt to raise the costs of\ndoing business and to bankrupt the companies. Hillary may claim she cares\nabout the poor, but poor people in the highest-crime areas benefit the most\nfrom gun ownership, and they are the people who would be priced out of owning\nguns for protection.Vowing to do something concrete about mass public\nshootings on the campaign trail may be popular. But Clinton’s proposed gun-\ncontrol solutions refuse to address the obvious problem of gun-free zones and\nwill make ultimately make Americans less safe.___John R.

And his campaign does\nnot list fighting gun violence on his more than 20-position-long issue page on\nhis website.Sanders' aides did not respond to multiple requests about why his\ncampaign has not announced a \"comprehensive\" gun plan as promised.Gun control\nhas been a nagging issue for Sanders since he launched his campaign last year.\nWhile Sanders has appealed to the left of the party on campaign finance,\neducation and health care, guns are one issue that Hillary Clinton has\nsuccessfully used to hurt Sanders' liberal bona fides. That matters in a state\nlike South Carolina, where the Vermont senator still needs to grow his base of\nsupport.Clinton's campaign has hammered Sanders on gun control, telling voters\nthat while the Vermont senator talks about standing up to powerful interests,\nhe has failed to do that with the National Rifle Association and the gun\nlobby.Most notably, Sanders voted against barring the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention from studying gun violence in 1996 and voted against\nversions of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act five times from 1991 to\n1993. Sanders has called the Clinton attacks on guns \"very disingenuous.\"\"I\nhave a D-minus voting record from the NRA,\" Sanders said during a January\ndebate in South Carolina. \"I support what President Obama is doing in terms of\ntrying to close the gun show loopholes.\" Clinton has focused on the issue for\nmuch of her campaign, pledging to close a series of gun control loopholes and\nrevoke licenses from bad actor gun sellers.Sanders' most comprehensive\nstatement on guns came shortly before the January debate, when the senator\nreversed his position on a 2005 Senate vote that gave gun manufacturers\nimmunity from prosecution.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56dc7c62955d142bd0af68dc" }, "content" : "Washington (CNN)Presidential contenders split on party lines in their reaction\nto President Barack Obama's gun control actions Tuesday, with Democrats\nsupporting Obama and Republicans vowing to undo his moves. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\nwas perhaps Obama's harshest critic, accusing the President of attempting to\ntake away Americans' guns. On Twitter, Cruz called Obama's actions -- which\ninclude expanding background checks on gun purchases and increasing funding\nfor mental health and law enforcement agencies that perform those background\nchecks -- \"unconstitutional.\"In an image included in the tweet, Obama was\nportrayed wearing a crown, alongside the message: \"Gun control is government\ncontrol.\"It linked to a Cruz campaign website featuring Obama dressed in\nmilitary-style garb, next to the headline, \"Obama wants your guns.\"Donald\nTrump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"The\nLead\" that Obama is \"making an end-run around the Constitution, trying to go\ndirectly to executive order and restrict one of the basic, fundamental\nprinciples of our country.\" And Trump himself responded during a rally Tuesday\nevening, \"Look the Second Amendment is so important. It's so\nimportant.\"\"They're not going to take your guns away, folks. They're trying,\"\nhe said.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted a link to an appearance on Fox News\nin which he characterized Obama's moves as \"just one more way to make it\nharder for law-abiding people to buy weapons or to be able to protect their\nfamilies. It's going to do nothing to prevent violence or crimes.\" Former\nFlorida Gov. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, tweeted a link to his op-ed in an Iowa\nnewspaper in which he said Obama's actions trample on the Second Amendment.\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson tweeted: \"The President's actions have\neverything to do with advancing his political agenda &amp; little to do with\nactually protecting American citizens.\" And former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee\nused Obama's speech to push for restrictions on abortion -- saying that\nObama's case for saving lives should apply to that issue as well. Democratic\npresidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, vowed in New Hampshire\non Tuesday that she will \"take on that fight\" and continue Obama's gun control\npush if she's elected.On Twitter, in a tweet signed \"-H\" to indicate it was\nwritten by Clinton, rather than her staff, the former secretary of state\nthanked Obama \"for taking a crucial step forward on gun violence. Our next\nPresident has to build on that progress—not rip it away.\" And her campaign\nhighlighted Republican candidates' criticism of Obama's comments on its\nwebsite, warning that a GOP president would undo Obama's actions.Vermont Sen.\nBernie Sanders said in a statement that he, too, would keep Obama's actions in\nplace if he's elected. \"It's become clear that no mass shooting, no matter how\nbig or bloody, will inspire Republicans to put children and innocent Americans\nover the interests of the NRA. They are simply more loyal to gun lobbyists\nthan our children. That's why I support President Obama's executive actions to\nmake our communities safer,\" Sanders said. And former Maryland Gov. Martin\nO'Malley vowed to build on Obama's actions. \"As President, I will build on\nPresident Obama's progress by taking further executive actions to reform our\ngun laws. These include using the purchasing power of our federal government\n-- the biggest customer gun companies have -- to advance gun safety, banning\n'cop killer' ammunition, declaring blanket immunity for gun dealers and\nmanufacturers unconstitutional, and ceasing to defend the federal immunity\nlaw,\" he said in a statement.\n\n", "title" : "GOP 2016 candidates bash Obama's gun control push - CNNPolitics.com", "twitter" : { "body" : "GOP 2016 candidates bash @POTUS ' gun control push #GunsInAmerica http://cnn.it/1ZQKhkW pic.twitter.com/tkZVabIXgy", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CNN/status/685247295714127872", "retweets" : 88, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-07T07:51:01.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "@POTUS", "favs" : 118, "hashtags" : "#GunsInAmerica", "id" : "685247295714127872" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "cnn", "link" : "http://cnn.it/1ZQKhkW" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56dc7c62955d142bd0af68dd" }, "content" : "Ames, Iowa (CNN)Hillary Clinton is turning her stump speech into a near\nconstant attack on Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as she suddenly faces the\nthreat of losing the first two early-voting states next month.Two polls\nreleased Tuesday find Sanders with leads in both Iowa and New Hampshire, a\nsurge that has Clinton aides worried.Clinton compared her stance with Sanders\non guns, health care and Wall Street. Since the first Democratic debate in\nOctober, Clinton has used different issues to knock Sanders. But on Tuesday,\nher speech was different, with more sustained and focused knocks on the\nunlikely front-runner in Iowa and New Hampshire.Clinton hit Sanders for\nbragging about standing up to special interests, but siding with the National\nRifle Association on certain legislation. If Sanders is to tout his\nwillingness to stand up to special interests, Clinton said at her events that\nSanders should \"stand up to the most powerful special interest, stand up to\nthat gun lobby.\"Clinton then turned to Wall Street, an issue Sanders has tried\nto use against Clinton by casting her as too close with the nation's biggest\nbanks. \"Don't talk to me about standing up to corporate interests and big\npowers,\" Clinton said to Sanders. \"I've got the scars to show for it and I am\nproud of every single one of them.\" Clinton is in a strong position in many of\nthe states that hold primaries later in the nominating contest. But a loss in\nthe Iowa caucuses on February 1 will revive memories of Clinton's third-place\nfinish there in 2008, which ultimately doomed her first presidential bid. New\nHampshire, which rewarded Clinton in 2008 and her husband, Bill, in 1992, is\neven tougher for her this year since she's up against a popular senator from\nneighboring Vermont.Adding to Clinton's troubles is an interview Vice\nPresident Joe Biden gave CNN on Monday in which he praised Sanders and\nsuggested the former secretary of state was new to addressing income\ninequality.\"It's relatively new for Hillary to talk about that,\" Biden told\nCNN's Gloria Borger, saying that Clinton has \"come forward with some really\nthoughtful approaches to deal with the issue\" of income inequality.In response\nto the tightening race, Clinton is dispatching two of her best-known\nsurrogates -- husband Bill and daughter Chelsea Clinton -- onto the campaign\ntrail. Bill Clinton has already visited New Hampshire and Iowa and will return\nto the Granite State on Wednesday; Chelsea Clinton was there Tuesday. The\nformer first daughter even went after Sanders in the Granite State, charging\nthat his healthcare plan would give too much power to Republican governors.\"I\ndon't want to live in a country with unequal health insurance,\" Chelsea\nClinton said. \"I don't want to empower Republican governors. And I think that\nis what Senator Sanders wants to do.\"At her event here on Tuesday, Hillary\nClinton zeroed in on Sanders' proposal to pass a single-payer health care plan\nwithout raising taxes on the middle class.\"There is no way that can be paid\nfor without raising taxes on the middle class, the arithmetic just doesn't add\nup,\" she said.All of this culminated in Clinton using Sanders' oft used line\n-- that he is taking launching a political revolution - against him.\"If that\nis the kind of revolution he is talking about, I am worried folks,\" she said\nto applause.The reason behind the focus on Sanders is two-fold: The Iowa\ncaucuses are less than a month a way and many voters in the audience said they\nwere attending the event to make up their mind, a fact Clinton acknowledged\nfrom the stage.But they are also because Clinton and he aides see the race\ntightening.A new Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday shows that\nSanders is now the front-runner in Iowa -- with 49% support to Clinton's 44%\nand former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley's 4%. Clinton aides have long said\nthey expected the race to tighten but there is concern inside Clinton's\ncampaign that Sanders is catching fire in the important weeks leading up to\nthe caucuses.The near total focus on Sanders is new for Clinton, a candidate\nwho spent the early months of the campaign avoiding even mentioning Sanders'\nname.Tuesday's event, where Clinton also accepted the endorsement of the Brady\nCampaign to Prevent Gun Violence, amplified a trend of Clinton attacks that\nSanders said at the Iowa Brown and Black Forum on Monday night that he's\nnoticed. \"It could be that the inevitable candidate for the Democratic\nnomination may not be so inevitable today,\" he said. That Sanders now has a\nshot at winning the first two states in the Democratic nominating process is\nin part a reflection of their makeup: Iowa and New Hampshire are whiter and\nmore liberal than the broader party electorate. The bigger test would come as\nthe campaign shifts to Nevada and South Carolina -- where Democrats will have\ntheir last debate Sunday night in Charleston before the voting begins in Iowa\non February 1. She is also campaigning with high-profile surrogates --\nincluding the heads of Planned Parenthood and the Brady Campaign, highlighting\nher support on women's health issues and gun control, as well as\nTransportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, who underscores Clinton's ties to\nPresident Barack Obama's administration. Sanders aides attribute some of their\nlead in Iowa to the fact that although the Vermont senator went on air with\nhis first ad last in 2015, he is currently airing more ads in the state than\nClinton, according to CMAG/Kantar Media. Clinton aides believe that count is\nslightly misleading, largely because it does not include cable ads, which\nClinton has invested heavily on. What's more, Clinton aides are confident that\ntheir concentrated ads in Cedar Rapids and the Quad Cities area of Iowa will\npay off more than Sanders' ads in areas Sioux City and Omaha, more\nconservative areas of the state.\n\n", "title" : "Clinton attacks as polls show Sanders winning in Iowa - CNNPolitics.com", "twitter" : { "body" : ". @HillaryClinton slams @BernieSanders for his stance on gun control http://cnn.it/1TTybE0 #HillaryOnCNN http://cnn.it/1Q3CVb1", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CNN/status/687069965753671680", "retweets" : 74, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-12T08:33:39.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "@HillaryClinton @BernieSanders", "favs" : 136, "hashtags" : "#HillaryOnCNN", "id" : "687069965753671680" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "cnn", "link" : "http://cnn.it/1TTybE0" }

That person didn't know whether it would be based on the\nnumber of guns sold or revenue generated through gun sales.The source, a\nmember of a gun control advocacy group, was not authorized to discuss details\nbefore the announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity. White House\nofficials won't confirm the timing, the AP reported.The Obama administration\nis also expected to** **impose tighter rules for reporting guns that get lost\nor stolen on their way to a buyer, _Politico_ reported**.**The National Rifle\nAssociation opposes expanding background check systems. The organization's\nInstitute for Legislative Action (ILA) says studies show that people sent to\nstate prison because of crimes involving firearms typically get the weapons\nthrough theft, the black market or family and friends.\"Facts tell us that\ncriminalizing private transfers of firearms among family members and friends\nunder a universal background check system would do nothing to prevent 'gun\nviolence,' and importantly, would not have prevented the profound tragedies\nthat gun banners use to promote such a system,\" the ILA said. \"Perpetrators of\nthose acts either successfully passed background checks to get the guns or\nthey stole the guns.\"The group adds that many purchases of firearms by\ncriminals are carried out by straw purchasers who pass background checks. \"No\namount of background checks can stop these criminals,\" says the group's\nwebsite.Obama has often spoken out about gun violence, particularly after such\nmass killings at the Sandy Hook school shootings in Newtown, Conn., in 2012\nthat left 26 people dead, and the fatal shooting of nine people at a black\nchurch in Charleston last summer.\"Last month, we remembered the third\nanniversary of Newtown,” Obama said in his radio address, referencing the\nmassacre that he has called the worst day of his presidency. \"This Friday,\nI’ll be thinking about my friend Gabby Giffords, five years into her recovery\nfrom the shooting in Tucson. And all across America, survivors of gun violence\nand those who lost a child, a parent, a spouse to gun violence are forced to\nmark such awful anniversaries every single day.”He notes that a bipartisan\nbill from three years ago requiring background checks for virtually everyone\nhad huge support, including among a majority of NRA households. But the Senate\nblocked it. Since then, he said, tens of thousands of Americans have died as a\nresult of gun violence.\"Each time, we're told that commonsense reforms like\nbackground checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before\nthat, so we shouldn't do anything,\" he said. \"We know that we can't stop every\nact of violence.

Bank interest rates also need to be reined in, he\nsaid.Clinton wants more Pell grants and tuition relief for kids who attend\npublic universities. “I disagree with free college for everybody,” she said,\nnoting taxpayers shouldn’t have to fund college for Donald Trump’s\nkids.**10:28 p.m.**O’Malley defends his record on criminal justice reform in\nMaryland, including repealing the death penalty. “Yes indeed, black lives\nmatter,” O’Malley says.Sanders says a black male born today has a 1 in 4\nchance of ending up in the criminal justice system and that the U.S. is\nspending $80 billion to lock up mostly Latino and black males in calling for\n“major, major” reform of the system. When police kill unarmed people, “they\nmust be held accountable,” and the U.S. must end minimum sentencing and end\nselling marijuana as a federal crime.Clinton cites her recent meeting with the\nmothers of young black people killed by gun and police violence. “Every single\none of our children deserves a chance to live up to his or her God-given\npotential,” says Clinton.**10:25 p.m.**The conversation turns to Sanders'\nstatement in the last debate about being “sick” of Clinton’s “damned\nemails.”Asked whether he’s changed his mind on the matter: “That’s just media\nstuff,” he says.  “I am still sick and tired” of her emails, says\nSanders.“We’ve gotten off of Hillary’s emails, good, let’s get on to the major\nissues facing America,” says Sanders.Clinton: “I agree completely. I couldn’t\nhave said it better myself.” Further, she says after 11 hours of grilling by a\nspecial Benghazi committee last month, “it’s pretty clear” there’s not much\nmore to be learned about her emails.**10:22 p.m.**Sanders is asked how he can\nwork with conservatives in bringing about a liberal “revolution.”His\nrevolution will bring working people, seniors and young people together, says\nSanders. That includes breaking up Wall Street banks, building infrastructure\nand raising the minimum wage. All of those things are supported by significant\nmajority of American people, says Sanders.The revolution is about “bringing\npeople together” to say “enough is enough.”**10:10 p.m.**The candidates spar\nover guns, with Clinton attacking Sanders and O’Malley attacking\nClinton.Clinton jabs at Sanders over an earlier vote he cast granting gun\nmanufacturers immunity from prosecution. That was a “terrible mistake,” she\nsays. “Let’s reverse the immunity,” says Clinton.Sanders says he’s voted time\nand again for background checks, among other measures. “I don’t know that\nthere’s any disagreement here,” says Sanders. “Oh yes, there is,” quips\nO’Malley.“We’re the only nation on the planet that buries as many people as we\ndo from gun violence,” says O’Malley. “We do need to repeal that\nimmunity,”O’Malley says Clinton’s “been on three sides of this” issue. In\n2008, “you were portraying yourself as Annie Oakley” and saying we didn’t need\nsome of the same regulations, O’Malley said, suggesting Clinton is a flip-\nflopper on the issue.“Baltimore is not one of the safest cities in America,”\nSanders pokes back.**10:00 p.m.**Clinton and Sanders clash over her Wall\nStreet contributions.Clinton she will not be beholden to big banks as\npresident. She says there are already hedge fund billionaires advertising\nagainst her in Iowa. She also says she proposed Senate legislation to rein in\nCEO compensation and give shareholders more control. She reiterates her plan\nto go after the “shadow banking industry” including companies like Lehman\nBrothers, saying her plan is the most comprehensive.Sanders says her answer is\n“not good enough.” Why has Wall Street been “the major campaign contributor to\nHillary Clinton?” Sanders draws a distinction by saying he will actually break\nup the big banks. “I’ve never heard a candidate, never,” who’s received such\nhuge contributions then insist they won’t influence them. The Wall Street\ncontributors “expect to get something, everybody knows that.”Clinton says\nSanders is trying “to impugn my integrity.” Clinton explains her ties to Wall\nStreet by saying she represented New York on 9/11 in downtown Manhattan, where\nWall Street is. She spent a lot of time helping them to rebuild. It was a good\nway to “rebuke the terrorists” who attacked our country, she said. Reinstating\nGlass-Steagall may help but “it is nowhere near enough,” says Clinton. “I go\nafter all of Wall Street, not just the big banks,” she said.O’Malley calls her\nplan “weak tea.” He says “Bernie’s right” and we “need to reinstate a modern\nversion of Glass Steagall.”**9:50 p.m.**The candidates differ on how high the\nfederal minimum wage should go.Sanders, asked about whether some jobs might be\nlost from a $15-an-hour minimum wage, says there are consequences to any\npolicy.“The wages they are earning are just too low,” he says. “This country\nneeds to move toward a living wage,” he says. “I apologize to nobody about\nit,” says Sanders.The average worker in this country has no disposable income.\nAmericans will compensate for any job losses by going out and using that\nincome to purchase goods and services, says Sanders.O’Malley says the highest\nhe could get the minimum wage in Maryland was $10.10 an hour. The more money\npeople make, the more they spend and the more the economy grows.Clinton says\nshe supports a $12 national federal minimum wage, saying that is what Senate\nDemocrats propose.“That is the smartest way to move forward,” she says, saying\nit would be the highest historical average ever.**9:48 p.m.**The discussion\nturns to immigration.O’Malley is asked whether the U.S. should be focused on\nborder security before immigration. He says the U.S. has already instituted a\nrecord number of deportations and stepped up border security. Still that\nhasn’t brought “our Republican friends” to the negotiating table.He refers,\nspecifically, to that “immigrant bashing, carnival barker Republican Donald\nTrump.”Clinton says Obama is acting within his authority to shield some\nimmigrants from deportation. She says the “net immigration” from the south has\n“basically zeroed out.”She says the U.S. now needs to make it possible for\nhard-working, law-abiding immigrants to “come out of the shadows.”**9:43\np.m.**Clinton praises Obamacare but says we need to expand it by addressing\nrising drug costs.We need to figure out how to get more competition in the\ninsurance market and get other out of pocket expenses down. “There’s a\nsignificant difference I have with Senator Sanders,” she says.Sanders says\nhealth care should be a right and that we have to take on the pharmaceutical\nindustry which is “ripping off the American people every day,”**9:36 p.m.**The\ncandidates are asked how they will pay for new policies including paid\nmandatory leave, expanded health care benefits, including prescription drug\nbenefits, and debt-free college.Who will pay for it? “It isn’t the middle\nclass,” says Clinton. \"I will pay for it by, yes, taxing the wealthy more,”\nincluding closing loopholes and deductions. “We can be fiscally responsible at\nthe same time,” she says.In Maryland, O’Malley says he increased income taxes\non the top 14% of earners. “I actually got these things done,” said O’Malley.\nHe also said he supports increasing capital gains tax rates.Sanders says in\nthe past 30 years there’s been a “massive redistribution of wealth” away from\nlower earners. He says we have to end major corporate loopholes, and a tax\n“Wall Street speculation.” He said he won’t increase tax rates as high as\nformer President Dwight D. Eisenhower, without providing a number. “I’m not a\nsocialist compared to Eisenhower,” he said.**9:25 p.m.**Clinton is asked\nwhether this is a war and the discussion turns to Syrian refugees.\"We have an\nauthorization,” from Congress, passed after the Sept. 11 terror attacks and it\nneeds to be “upgraded.”O’Malley says he still supports accepting 65,000\nrefugees from the war-torn nations including Syria. “That needs to be done\nwith proper screening,” he said.Clinton says she supports the 65,000 threshold\nbut only if we have a very strict screening policy. “I do not want us to in\nany way inadvertently allow people who wish us harm to come into our country,”\nshe said.**9:20 p.m.**O’Malley digs in on his criticism that there has not\nbeen a broad enough policy in the Middle East by the current\nadministration.“Please don’t use the term ‘boots on the ground,” he said. “My\nson is not a pair of boots on the ground,” says O’Malley. He said the\ngovernment must also invest in sustainable development, diplomacy and aligning\neconomic power in alignment.Sanders calls attention to the 5,000 soldiers who\ncame home with post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury,\ncalling on people not to “turn their backs” on military veterans.The\ncandidates debate the use of the term “radical Islam.”“We are not at war with\nIslam. We are at war with extremism,” says Clinton.**9:10 p.m.**The candidates\ndraw distinctions on the invasion of Iraq, which Clinton voted for.Sanders\ncriticizes her approach as secretary of State. “We have a disagreement,” he\nsaid, noting that he voted against the war. More broadly, “These regime\nchanges have unintended consequences,” he said. “I am not a big fan of regime\nchange,” said Sanders.O’Malley gets in on the action: “It was not just the\ninvasion of Iraq. ... It was a failure to invest in human intelligence, says\nO’Malley. “It’s not just about getting rid of a single dictator,” he\nsays.Clinton responds that “You can’t paint with a broad brush,” and the\nMiddle East security situation is “incredibly complicated.” Many of the fights\nin the Middle East do not have U.S. fingerprints, says Clinton.**9:05\np.m.**Opening statements: The start of the debate laid bare that national\nsecurity is perhaps the biggest area of contrast between the candidates.\nSanders gave a short statement on the attacks, saying he is ``shocked and\ndisgusted’’ by what we saw. He expresses optimism that the U.S. will prevail\nover this “barbarism” before pivoting to a broader message: I’m running for\npresident because ``what I hear is people’s concern that the economy we have\nis a rigged economy.’’Clinton draws an immediate contrast: “Our prayers are\nwith the people of France tonight but that is not enough. She says the\nelection “is also about choosing our next commander in chief” and pledges to\nlay out a detailed plan “to do a better job of coordinating efforts against\nthe scourge of terrorism.” Says Clinton: “All the other issues we want to deal\nwith depend on us being secure and strong.”O’Malley uses his statement to say\nthe terrorist attack shows the nation requires `new thinking, fresh approaches\nand new leadership.”**MORE COVERAGE OF THE DEMOCRATIC DEBATE:**\n\n", "title" : "Highlights from Des Moines: Clinton, Sanders, O'Malley face off in debate", "twitter" : { "body" : "On gun control @MartinOMalley claims @HillaryClinton has taken \"three sides,\" once like \"Annie Oakley\" http://usat.ly/1lpgD7t #demdebate", "link" : "https://twitter.com/USATODAY/status/665730545360486400", "retweets" : 97, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-11-14T11:18:25.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "@MartinOMalley @HillaryClinton", "favs" : 120, "hashtags" : "#demdebate", "id" : "665730545360486400" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "usatoday", "link" : "http://usat.ly/1lpgD7t" }

The new coalition will be announced at\nthe event.Giffords survived an assassination attempt on Jan. 8, 2011, during a\nconstituent event at a Tucson supermarket. Six people were killed and another\n13 were injured.Giffords suffered a severe brain injury during the shootout,\nand she resigned from the House in January 2012.In January 2013, she and\nhusband and space shuttle astronaut Mark E.

Among the statistics that organizers cite are:• Abused\nwomen in the U.S. are five times more likely to be killed by their abuser if\nthat person has access to a gun.• More than half of all murders of women in\nthe U.S. are committed with a gun.• More than two-thirds of spouse and ex-\nspouse homicide victims between 1980 and 2008 were killed with firearms.The\ncoalition hopes to address two gaps in the law.

No,\" Carson told USA TODAY's\nweekly newsmaker series. \"Would it have prevented the one before? No. I'm for\ndoing things that work, not for things that stroke the emotions.\"Carson\noutlines how he says his political philosophy on gun control and other issues\nis grounded in the Constitution in a new book, _A More Perfect Union_, being\npublished Tuesday by Sentinel.

Including the teacher?\n\"If the teacher was trained in the use of that weapon and had access to it, I\nwould be much more comfortable if they had one than if they didn't.\"He says\nthe idea of declaring gun-free zones may be counterproductive. The gunmen\n\"tend to pick places that are gun-free zones,\" he says. \"They aren't likely to\ngo into a place where they are likely to get shot.\"He keeps a gun himself at a\nhome he owns in a secluded area, \"way out in the country, away from the\npolice, away from anybody,\" he says. \"If someone is, you know, threatening\nyour life or the life of your family and you don't have ready access to the\npolice, I would prefer to have a mechanism for protecting myself.\"But he's\nnever had to use it.The nation's continuing debate over gun control has been\nspotlighted by the shooting rampage last week at Umpqua Community College in\nRoseburg, Ore., that left nine victims dead before the shooter allegedly\nkilled himself. Umpqua bans guns and other weapons, but state law allows\npeople with concealed permits to carry guns on the campus.While Carson once\nsupported the idea of banning assault weapons and armor-piercing ammunition,\nhe says he changed his mind after he read more about the history of tyranny, a\nsubject explored in his new 240-page book.Ben Carson greets audience members\nfollowing a town hall meeting on Oct. 2, 2015, in Ankeny, Iowa. (Photo:\nCharlie Neibergall, AP)\"Reading people like Daniel Webster, who talked about\ntyranny in Europe and said it would never occur in America because the\nAmerican people were armed,\" he says. \"When you look at tyranny and how it\noccurs, the pattern is so consistent: Get rid of the guns for the people first\nso you can go in and dominate them.\"Asked whether many Americans worried less\nabout the threat from the government and more about the threat of fellow\ncitizens armed with assault rifles, Carson replied: \"You need to be able to\nprotect yourself from both.\"Carson, now 64, admits to being surprised with his\npolitical rise since his address to the National Prayer Breakfast in 2013 drew\nthe attention of evangelical Christians and others who urged him to get into\npolitics. In the RealClearPolitics average of recent national polls, Trump\nruns first in the Republican field at 23%, followed by Carson at 17% and\nformer CEO Carly Fiorina at 11%. Among the more traditional contenders — that\nis, those who have previously held elective office —only Florida Sen. Marco\nRubio breaks into double digits, at 10%.\"It says that the people are actually\nstarting to wake up and recognize that politics-as-usual is not taking us\nwhere we want to be,\" Carson says of the strength of the outsider candidates.\n\"In fact, it's leading us in exactly the opposite direction.\"He rejects any\nparallel to the observation that a president should have experience in\npolitics, just as most people wouldn't choose a brain surgeon who had never\nbeen in an operating room before. \"Neurosurgery is considerably more\ncomplicated than politics,\" he scoffs. \"You don't need to know nearly as much\nto be able to maneuver in the political world as you do in the operating room\ninside of somebody's brain.

It's Sunday, Jan. 10, and here's what we're talking about:I've seen\nthings and I've watched things.  \nRead moreHillary Clinton's new television ad does not mention any of her\nchallengers for the Democratic presidential nomination. Instead, the focus of\nthe 30-second spot, titled \"Incredible,\" is on Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and\nother Republican presidential hopefuls. From GOP calls to repeal the\nAffordable Care Act to defunding Planned Parenthood, the ad touts Clinton as\nthe best candidate to take on Republicans. Despite Clinton's strong lead\nnationally for the Democratic presidential nomination, she does trail Vermont\nSen. Bernie Sanders in the early nominating state of New Hampshire. In recent\nweeks, she has hammered Sanders on gun-control, but on the campaign trail her\nfocus has mostly centered on Republicans.  The three candidates for the\nDemocratic presidential nomination don't disagree on much - except, perhaps,\non gun control.Hillary Clinton, the front runner, has sought to showcase a\nclear difference with Bernie Sanders, her chief rival in the party’s 2016\nprimary. In debates and at town hall-style events, the former secretary of\nState has assailed the senator from Vermont for his vote in favor of a 2005\nlaw giving gun manufacturers and dealers immunity from product liability\nlawsuits. It’s a proposal that then-Sen. Clinton did not support.“I think he\nhas been consistently confusing to say that he would vote to repeal this\nabsolute immunity from any kind of responsibility or liability,” she said\nSunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”The Dec. 2 massacre in San Bernardino and\nother recent mass shootings have brought gun violence back into the public\nspotlight, and renewed the debate over whether federal gun laws should be\nstrengthened.In a tearful speech at the White House last week, President Obama\nannounced an executive action that calls for law enforcement officials to\nessentially warn private gun sellers that they may be vulnerable to\nprosecution if they don’t conduct background checks on gun buyers.National\npolls have repeatedly shown that Americans support background checks on gun\nsales to help weed out felons and the mentally ill.Sanders has said his vote\non the 2005 measure was “complicated” and has said he’s open to revisiting the\nissue.“If you have a small gun shop owner in northern Vermont who sells a gun\nlegally to somebody and then, you know, something happens to that guy, he goes\nnuts or something, and he kills somebody, should the gun shop owner be held\nliable? I think not,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”But if a manufacturer is\nsending guns “into an area and really knows that those guns are not being used\nor bought by the people in that area … should we hold that manufacturer\nliable? Absolutely,” he added. On Sunday, seeking to bolster her standing\namong gun-control supporters, Clinton announced the endorsement of former Rep.\nGabby Giffords of Arizona. Giffords was injured in a 2011 shooting outside a\nTucson grocery store and ever since the incident she has been a staunch\nadvocate of stricter gun-control reforms. \"Most of the people running for\npresident talk a lot about how tough they are,\" Giffords wrote in her\nendorsement of Clinton. \"But most of them have shown they aren’t tough enough\nto stand up to the gun lobbyists.\"  \n_**UPDATE: 4:05 p.m. **This post was updated with information about Gabby\nGiffords' endorsement of Clinton. _The 2016 presidential contest kicks off on\nFeb.1 with Iowa caucuses and polls seem to be released almost daily in the\nrace for the White House.On Sunday, a new NBC News/Marist poll was released of\nIowa and New Hampshire voters. Here are some highlights from the polls.\n**Republican side - Iowa: **Ted Cruz - **28%**Donald Trump - **24%**Marco\nRubio - **13%**The Iowa poll of likely Republican caucus-goers has a margin of\nerror of plus or minus 4.6 percentage points. **Democratic side - New\nHampshire: **Bernie Sanders - **50%**Hillary Clinton - **46%**The New\nHampshire poll of likely Democratic primary voters has a margin of error of\nplus or minus 4.8 percentage points.  \nRead more Donald Trump is trailing in Iowa with about three weeks until GOP\ncaucus-goers cast the first ballots of 2016, but should he falter in the state\nthe billionaire businessman has no plans to exit the race for the Republican\npresidential nomination.

Trump didn't back down, however. “From Ted's standpoint and from\nthe party's standpoint, he has to solve this problem,\" Trump said. \"Because\nthe Democrats will sue him if he's the nominee.\"Appearing on CNN, Cruz argued\nthat Trump is only pushing the issue because Trump is in danger of losing.\n“Three weeks ago, almost every Republican candidate was attacking Donald\nTrump,\" he said. \"Today, almost every Republican candidate is attacking me.\nAnd that kind of suggests maybe something has changed in the race.\" They can\nsay whatever they want. More power to them. I think it's a deadend, blind\nalley for them, but let them go.  Donald Trump launched his TV advertising\njust after New Year's with his familiar swagger: He was so far ahead in the\npolls that it might be a waste, he said, but he felt guilty for not spending\nhis money.The reality was more sobering.After six months of branding opponents\nand critics as losers, Trump faces the threat of becoming one himself in Iowa,\nthe first state to hold a Republican presidential nominating contest. The ads\nare a crucial part of Trump's strategy to keep Ted Cruz from beating him in\nthe Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1.Cruz's appeals to evangelicals, tea party\nfollowers and other conservatives have made the Texas senator the current\nfavorite in Iowa, though the New York billionaire remains a solid front-runner\nin the rest of the country.Cruz's surge in Iowa is jeopardizing Trump's quest\nto \"run the table\" by winning every GOP primary and caucus nationwide.Read\nmore\n\n", "title" : "If Donald Trump loses Iowa, he's not backing down - LA Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Hillary Clinton continues to assail Bernie Sanders on gun control http://lat.ms/22UiQJm", "link" : "https://twitter.com/latimes/status/686428620147953664", "retweets" : 23, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-10T14:05:10.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 25, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "686428620147953664" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "latimes", "link" : "http://lat.ms/22UiQJm" }

Fear not, you can read the full text of the State of the State,\nwith helpful annotations from our Sacramento politics team, here. Read\nmoreGov. Jerry Brown dusted off his rarely used campaign email account to send\nsupporters a copy of his State of the State address not long after delivering\nthe speech. The email had the subject line \"California: The Great Exception\"\nand included a prominent link to a video promoting the Sacramento-San Joaquin\nDelta tunnels project, which would replumb the state's water hub.\"One of the\nkey points is the need for a reliable system for moving water in California,\"\nreads the email's introduction, before directing viewers to a \"cool video\" on\nthe plan. The twin tunnels — a legacy project for the governor — were notably\nnot mentioned in his address.  \nSpecial interest groups will have to disclose many more details of how they\nare spending money to influence California officials under new rules approved\nThursday by the state’s ethics panel.Currently, corporations, labor unions and\nother groups must report the money they pay directly to lobbyists, along with\nthe identity of the advocate.But the rest of the cash they spend on\nconsultants, television and radio campaigns, public affairs and mail is\nreported as a lump sum in a category called \"other payments to influence,\"\nwithout any explanation.“The amount of money that is being spent in the dark\nis extremely compelling,” said state Fair Political Practices Commission\nmember Eric Casher.The panel on Thursday voted to require, starting in July,\nthat lobbying firms report details of any payment to influence of $2,500 per\ncalendar quarter, including money spent on mailers, TV ads and polls.“In order\nto make sure people are playing by the rules, we need this type of\ninformation,” said Jodi Remke, chairwoman of the panel. “It puts a light on\nwhat is going on.”The newly disclosed information will include the name and\nbusiness address of the payee, the amount paid and the primary purpose of the\npayment. Purposes will be disclosed by codes broadly designating activities\nthat include:--Payments for public affairs, which includes coalition building,\ngrass-roots campaigns,, news releases, media campaigns, literature and\nmailings.--Polling and public opinion research:--Lobbying events, including\nrallies or hearings to influence legislative or administrative action.--\nAdvertising spending, including billboards, print, radio, television, text,\nemail and other electronic communication.--Money paid to lobbyists and\nconsultants for researching, analyzing or drafting legislation, and\nrecommending strategy on pending bills and administrative proposals.Remke said\nthe new rules may reveal which former legislators are working behind the\nscenes to help clients without registering as lobbyists because they don’t\nmeet thresholds for payments received to directly communicate with elected\nofficials.Remke made reference, without using names, to former state Sen.\nMichael Rubio (D-Bakersfield) and former state Assemblyman Henry Perea\n(D-Fresno), who resigned from the Legislature to go to work in the government\naffairs offices of Chevron and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers\nof America, respectively. “I think we are going to get [disclosure of] the\npeople like the former members who leave the Legislature early, join Chevron,\njoin the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers, but call themselves\ngovernment relations advocates,” Remke said. “But we know what they are doing.\nThey are exposing their clients to the [legislative] members and doing other\nthings short of direct communication.”\"Water goes to the heart of what\nCalifornia is and what it has been over centuries,\" Gov.

It's Nov. 14, and this is\nwhat we're watching: Bernie Sanders passed up an opportunity during Saturday's\ndebate to take a shot at one of Hillary Rodham Clinton’s biggest\nvulnerabilities: her use of a private email server while secretary of State.\nAsked whether he was reconsidering his comment in the last debate that he was\nsick of hearing about Clinton’s emails, Sanders emphatically said he is not.\n“I was sick and tired of Hillary Clinton’s email,” he said. “I am still sick\nand tired.” Sanders joked about how the issue faded from the headlines after\nhe declared it wasn't worth all the attention it is getting. “I didn’t know I\nhad so much power,” he said. “What I would like for the media now is for us to\nbe talking about why the middle class is disappearing, or we have more people\nin jail than any other country, or we have massive levels of income and wealth\ninequality,” Sanders said. “We’ve gotten off of Hillary Clinton’s emails.\nGood. Let’s go to major issues facing America.” Clinton had no objection. “I\nagree completely,” she said. “I couldn’t have said it better myself.” While\nthe email topic did not spark any tension, the issue of Wall Street repeatedly\ndid. At one point, a moderator read a tweet from a debate watcher who took\numbrage at Clinton’s suggestion that large campaign contributions she received\nfrom Wall Street were a product of partnering with financial firms in the\neffort to rebuild Lower Manhattan after 9/11. Clinton said she regretted the\nperception her earlier answer may have left, but she made no apologies for her\nplan to rein in Wall Street. But Sanders and Martin O’Malley pounded her on an\neconomic plan that does not include reauthorizing the Glass-Steagall Act,\nintended to break up the big banks. “Their business model is greed and fraud,”\nSanders said. “For the sake of our economy, the major banks must be broken\nup.” Clinton said the prescription of her rivals would do less to curb Wall\nStreet excess than her own bank plan. She cited prominent liberal economists\nwho have sided with her, including Paul Krugman and Paul Volcker. “I have\nnothing against the passion my two friends have,” she said of the attacks from\nSanders and O’Malley on her Glass-Steagall position. “I just don’t think it\nwould get the job done. I am about actually making sure we get results.\"  Read\nmore  To the delight of the crowd, all of the candidates in Saturday night's\ndebate positioned themselves as aggressively pro-immigrant and drew a sharp\ncontrast between their outlook and that of the Republicans. “The fact of the\nmatter is -- and let’s say it in our debate because you will never hear it\nfrom that immigrant-bashing carnival barker Donald Trump -- the truth of the\nmatter is net immigration from Mexico last year was zero,” former Maryland\nGov. Martin O’Malley said in response to weighing immigration reform against\nthe need for border security. “We’ve been focusing on border security to\nexclusion of talking about comprehensive immigration reform,” he said. “Our\nsymbol is the Statue of Liberty, it is not a barbed wire fence.” Hillary\nRodham Clinton said much the same, adding that she believes the recent federal\ncourt decision blocking President Obama’s executive action temporarily\nprotecting some immigrants from deportation will not stand. “Let’s move toward\nwhat we should be doing as a nation and follow the values of our immigration\nhistory and make it possible for [people in the U.S. illegally] to come out of\nthe shadows and to have a future that gives them a real path to citizenship,”\nshe said. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont has been repositioning himself on gun\ncontrol, trying to square his record of voting several times against landmark\nfirearms restrictions with his push for an assault weapon ban. Sanders says\nhis background representing a rural state full of hunters positions him\nideally to break the political logjam on the issue. His Democratic opponents,\nthough, are seizing on his mixed record in their efforts to weaken his\nstanding with progressives. When Sanders suggested gun control is not getting\ntraction in Congress because advocates spend too much time “shouting” instead\nof building consensus, Hillary Rodham Clinton pounced. She suggested the\nremark was sexist. “I haven’t been shouting, but sometimes when a woman speaks\nout, some people think it’s shouting,” Clinton said at a speech in Des Moines\nlate last month.  She went after him again Saturday night, given an opening by\nmoderator John Dickerson of CBS News. “This is an emergency. … We have also\ngot to go after the gun lobby,” she said, demanding that Congress close the\nloophole that allows firearms to be purchased at gun shows without a\nbackground check. Sanders noted that he has repeatedly voted in favor of\nbackground checks and wants “radical changes in mental health in this\ncountry.” In a South Carolina candidates’ forum last week, Sanders returned to\nthe shouting theme. “If we are going to make progress on this issue – and I\nknow that Hillary Clinton has kind of misstated my view – as a nation, we are\ngoing to have to stop shouting at each other, and we’re going to have to come\ntogether. … Very strong gun control advocates may not get everything they\nwant. And people who think they should have a missile launcher in their\nbackyard as a constitutional right may not have that.” In an interview with\nThe Times in September, Martin O'Malley, the former Maryland governor,\ndetailed his immigration plan that calls for protection from deportation for\nall 11 million or so people in the U.S. illegally:  Read more  Democratic\npresidential candidates are debating the appropriate response to Islamic State\nterrorism at a time when Congress has been paralyzed for months over how to\nact. \"We have an authorization to use military force against terrorists,”\nHillary Rodham Clinton said during Saturday night’s debate. “We passed it\nafter 9/11. I would like to see it updated.\" President Obama called for\nCongress to authorize use of military force against the terrorist group, also\nknown as ISIS or ISIL,  back in February  . Congress has yet to move on it.\nThe president’s request came as the U.S. military was already engaged in a\ncoalition campaign that had dropped thousands of bombs on Islamic State\ntargets. The bombing had been going on since the previous August, set in\nmotion by the Obama administration after the militants swept out of Syria and\noverran western Iraq so quickly that they reached the edge of Baghdad before\nthey were stopped. Obama sought the resolution in the hopes of displaying to\nthe world that American use of force had broad, bipartisan support back home.\nBut Republicans warned the resolution was too weak. They wanted more\naggressive action than the administration was pushing. Democrats warned the\nlanguage was too open-ended and could result in bombing campaigns spreading\nthrough the region. The politics of the president’s proposal, which would\nexpire in three years, does not limit the missions Obama or his successor\ncould approve, barring only what it calls “enduring offensive ground combat\noperations.” Military leaders were vague about what that meant. The\npresident’s effort has been complicated by Democrats who remain skeptical of\ncasting such votes after authorizing the use of force in Iraq more than a\ndecade ago. Many say they were misled by the Bush administration about the\nsituation in that country. Others have been elected to office since then,\ncampaigning on vows to vote against authorization for another such open-ended\nconflict. When Obama asked Congress in September of 2014 to approve a narrow\ncomponent of his strategy against Islamic State, training and equipping Syrian\nopposition fighters, House Democrats voted only 114 to 85 to support it, for\nexample. Politicians’ use of the phrase “Islamic extremism” has been debated\nsince 9/11, and the Paris attacks started a new chapter in the discussion.\nObama administration officials generally avoid using it, following the\npresident’s reasoning that the U.S. is not at war with a religion. That has\nopened him up to criticism from Republicans. Asked about the phrase during the\ndebate, Hillary Rodham Clinton sought to credit former President George W.\nBush with insisting it not be used. “That was one of the real contributions,\ndespite all the other problems, that George W. Bush made after 9/11,” Clinton\nsaid. She quoted Bush as saying the U.S. is not at war with Islam but with\nviolent extremism. Earlier this year, The Times examined the debate over the\nterm “Islamic extremism\" that has begun anew since the rise of Islamic State.\nRead more  All three candidates opened by condemning the Paris attacks and the\nterrorist group Islamic State, which has claimed responsibility. Each Democrat\nsought to shape their answers to their strengths as candidates. “Leading the\nworld, our country will rid this planet of this barbarous menace known as\nISIS,” Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said, before turning to his core issues of\ninequality and the economy. “Our prayers are with the people of France\ntonight, but that is not enough. We need to have a resolve that will bring the\nworld together to root out the kind of radical jihadist ideology that\nmotivates organizations like ISIS,” former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham\nClinton said, seeking to position herself as determined and authoritative on\nhow to defeat Islamic State militants. “My hearts go out to the people of\nFrance in this moment of loss: sons and daughters and family members.… This is\nthe new face of conflict and warfare … in the 21st century.… We must be able\nto work collaboratively with others. We must be able to anticipate these\nthreats before they happen,” former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley said, also\nreminding viewers of his executive-branch experience.  Read more  Latino\nvoters may be scarce in Iowa, but even here Hillary Rodham Clinton’s campaign\nis constantly working to cultivate them. On Saturday morning, U.S. Rep. Xavier\nBecerra of Los Angeles was touring a market popular with Latino shoppers in\nthe central Iowa burg of Marshalltown, promoting Clinton. The congressman, one\nof the most prominent Latinos  to endorse her,  had been sent by the campaign\nto the state to serve as one of the surrogates that candidates bring into\npresidential debates to talk up their performance to the media afterward. “The\nLatino community is a growing presence in the United States in every aspect,”\nhe said. “In Iowa, it is no different. It is a growing presence. … I am going\nto go out there and work it hard.” With Republicans badly divided over\nstrategy to combat the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, several GOP candidates\naimed at an easier target Saturday -- refugees. In the aftermath of the\nmassive terrorist attacks in Paris, in which some of the attackers may have\nentered Europe along with Syrian refugees, Obama's plan to admit at least\n10,000 Syrian refugees to the U.S. came under sustained criticism from the GOP\nfield. \"With the problems our country has, to take in 250,000 people, some of\nwhom are going to have problems, big problems, is just insane,\" Donald Trump\ndeclared at a rally in Beaumont, Texas, exaggerating the size of Obama's plan\nby a factor of 25. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, in an interview on Fox News, said\nthe U.S. should admit Christian refugees, \"who are being targeted for genocide\nor persecution.\" But \"President Obama and Hillary Clinton's idea that we\nshould bring tens of thousands of Syrian Muslim refugees to America is nothing\nless than lunacy,\" Cruz said. In statements and campaign appearances, Mike\nHuckabee and Rick Santorum also criticized the refugee plan. Sen. Marco Rubio\nof Florida and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush both avoided direct comment on the\nrefugee issue, instead calling for a more robust effort with U.S. allies to\ncombat Islamic State, also known as ISIS, which controls a large swath of\nterritory in eastern Syria and northern and western Iraq. What such an effort\nmight look like has sharply divided the GOP field. Some candidates, notably\nSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have argued for sending U.S. ground\ntroops to combat Islamic State. Others oppose sending troops but have\nadvocated enforcing a \"no fly\" zone along the Syrian-Turkish border to serve\nas a refuge for Syrians pushed out of their homes by the 4 1/2-year civil war\nin Syria. That's similar to a position taken by Democratic front-runner\nHillary Rodham Clinton. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has sharply criticized the\nno-fly zone idea. At the GOP debate earlier this week he suggested it could\nlead to war with Russia, which has warplanes flying over Syria. His position\nresembles that of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Trump has also criticized\nthe idea of a no-fly zone, suggesting that it is premature. As the Democratic\npresidential candidates scrambled to prepare for a debate here Saturday that\nwill now focus heavily on the attacks in Paris and the broader issue of\nnational security, the event promises to highlight the clearest contrasts yet\namong the candidates. On issues such as economic policy, criminal justice and\ncivil rights, the candidates are not always easily distinguishable. But when\nit comes to national defense, the front-runner, Hillary Rodham Clinton, stands\nout as a hawk among Democrats, while Sen. Bernie Sanders, her insurgent rival\nfrom Vermont, is a longstanding and staunch opponent of most international\nintervention. Leading up to the Paris attacks Friday night, Clinton’s foreign\npolicy record had been a point of vulnerability on the campaign trail. Her\nrivals have consistently pointed out that she voted in 2003 to authorize\nmilitary force in Iraq, which Clinton herself said she had come to regret.\nIt’s a point they raised repeatedly in highlighting their concerns with her\ncall recently for a no-fly zone over Syria. But in the aftermath of the\nbloodshed in Europe, the former secretary of State will likely argue she is\nthe only candidate on the stage with a viable plan to confront the Islamic\nState extremists — and with the experience to execute it. Her rivals will\nhighlight the failures of such intervention in the past.

Debate questions prepared earlier\nthis week by CBS News political director John Dickerson and the network's\ncongressional correspondent, Nancy Cordes, were designed to burrow deep into\nthe candidates' views on domestic issues such as the Affordable Care Act and\ngun legislation. But once the news of the deadly coordinated killing rampage\nin Paris circulated late Friday afternoon, the moderators and producers\nstarted planning a greater emphasis on security in the debate queries. \"This\nbecomes the first segment,\" said Steve Capus, the executive editor for CBS\nNews who is overseeing the production of the event at Drake University in Des\nMoines. \"You've got to get into how do you handle international terrorism?

Gov. Gavin\nNewsom frames the battle he hopes to wage next year as a personal one.\"Since\nSandy Hook, I have sat back as a father and been mesmerized by the inability\nof the federal government to do anything substantively on gun safety,\" he said\nin a recent telephone interview, referring to the 2012 shooting deaths of 26\nchildren and staff at a Connecticut school.But the expanded background checks\nand stolen-gun reporting requirements that Newsom seeks to put on the state\nballot next fall also fit neatly into an unfolding national effort championed\nby billionaire and former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.Bloomberg\nannounced last year that he was launching Everytown for Gun Safety, a tax-\nexempt social welfare organization into which he merged gun-control groups he\nhad formed or funded. He started the new group with $50 million of his own\nmoney.Bloomberg's stated strategy: Confront the gun lobby at the local level,\nby backing legislative candidates who favor gun control and supporting gun-\ncontrol initiatives on state ballots, rather than rely on Congress, where the\nNational Rifle Assn. is perceived to have its greatest political influence, to\nfoster change.Campaign finance records show Everytown last year provided more\nthan $4 million to a successful $11 million campaign in Washington state that\nwidened background checks on gun buyers. By contrast, the NRA and its\nsupporters spent less than $600,000.Additional support for the Washington\ninitiative came from other foundations and a short list of billionaire donors,\nincluding more than $1 million from Napster co-founder Sean Parker.Similar\nmeasures proposed this year in Nevada and Maine suggest more of the\nsame.Campaign finance reports filed in those states show Everytown is\nproviding staff and most of the money for the moves there. The political\ncommittee filing the Nevada ballot proposal registered with the secretary of\nstate as an affiliate of Everytown, for example.The National Rifle Assn.\ncharacterizes the state initiatives as an assault by Bloomberg on the 2nd\nAmendment.\"We want voters to know this is the work of one billionaire,\" said\nAmy Hunter, spokeswoman for the NRA's political lobbying arm in Virginia, the\nInstitute for Legislative Action. \"We know they are working on the ground to\nget on the ballot in other states too.\"Everytown representatives declined to\ndiscuss whether the organization intends to become involved in the proposed\nCalifornia initiative. Neither would Newsom or his political advisors talk\nabout how deeply he plans to tap the Bloomberg vein if his measure is cleared\nto circulate petitions to place it on California's November 2016 ballot.But\nNewsom acknowledges he has met with Bloomberg. He used his Twitter account to\nthank the former mayor for seeing him seven days after announcing his Safety\nfor All campaign last month.In the interview, he said he was encouraged to\npursue a California initiative by both local gun-control advocates, whom he\ncalled \"lawyers in the trenches,\" and \"national groups … who feel we need a\nsustained conversation with the public.\"Bloomberg is not Newsom's only\nconnection to the gun-control push in other states.He was a guest at Parker's\nwedding and has received campaign donations from the Silicon Valley\nentrepreneur.Parker has already contributed the legal maximum to Newsom's 2018\ngubernatorial effort and has agreed to provide millions for a Newsom-endorsed\ninitiative, also proposed for next fall's ballot, that would legalize and tax\ngeneral use of marijuana.Newsom's proposed gun initiative was written by the\nLaw Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a San Francisco organization that drafts\nmodel regulations and defends such measures in court.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56dc7c62955d142bd0af68f8" }, "content" : "Just a few weeks after endorsing the #PrayForParis hashtag campaign, the Daily\nNews decided that prayer is a perverse response to the San Bernardino\nmassacre. The News’ cover Thursday shouted “God Isn’t Fixing This!” next to\ntweets from Republican presidential candidates, each one with the word\n“prayers” highlighted to embarrass them. The implication was that the\npoliticians were hiding behind their prayers when they could be solving the\n“gun scourge.”The New York tabloid wasn’t alone. The Huffington Post ran an\narticle that extended the accusatory finger beyond politicians to the broader\npublic on social media who offered their thoughts and prayers in messages of\nsympathy and grief. There was a simple takeaway: Screw your prayers, do\nsomething!Of course it’s annoying to see rote statements from politicians\nabout their prayers. They feel scripted and repetitive now that America\nsuffers through high-profile mass shootings on a regular basis. Besides,\nTweeting about prayers is a good indication that you’re not actually praying.\nOr, at least, not praying well. (Matthew 6:5)On the other hand, in the age of\nTwitter, the press and the public now demand statements from politicians about\nenormities even as they are unfolding. What else can they say?**FULL COVERAGE:\nSan Bernardino shooting | Shooting updates**The suddenly popular accusation\nthat prayer is an ugly, insincere and insufficient response to tragedy\nmisconstrues why people pray. Mary Elizabeth Williams, in a scorching essay\nfor Salon on these empty gestures, wrote that “it’s actually offensive for\npublic figures who could take action to curtail gun violence to foist the\nburden of healing the broken lives that violence leaves behind on God.\"But the\ntruth is that people pray for things that our laws and government cannot\nprovide: eternal rest for the victims, consolation for the bereaved, resolve\nand strength for first responders. They pray seeking understanding of God’s\nwill in a world marred by sin and death. Prayer doesn’t exhaust all of our\nduties in a human tragedy, and nobody claims that it does. Believers hope that\nprayer will strengthen them to respond to tragedy with actions tempered by\ngood will, wisdom and compassion. Politicians may be praying this way, and\nsincerely, even if their judgment leads them to different conclusions later.\nEven if their judgment is terrible.An anti-prayer critic might respond:\nPoliticians should instead publicly promise to work for policies that that\nwould prevent future violence. And some did just that. Perceiving the events\nat San Bernardino first as an issue of firearms control, not terrorism,\nHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders sent out messages about taking action to\nstop gun violence. Martin O’Malley named an enemy: the National Rifle\nAssn.Yet, like prayer, rote tweets urging us toward policy responses, whether\nthey are aimed at controlling guns or discovering terror plots before they\nhappen, demand a kind of blind faith and hope. Arguably they demand even more\ncredulity than prayer.If the American public suddenly acceded to restrictive\ngun-control laws, mass shootings like the one in San Bernardino would likely\nhappen from time to time anyway. Even those who support some new measures,\nmyself included, must concede that the kinds of policies that would do the\nmost to reduce firearm fatalities may have little or no effect on terrorist\nplots or determined mass shooters. After all, French gun-control laws did not\nstop the Bataclan theater massacre. (And the use of explosive devices and\nGoPro cameras is an indication that the San Bernardino killers were more like\nthe Paris attackers than, say, Dylann Roof or James Holmes.)In the first hours\nafter the shooting, I felt far more comfortable presuming that God is merciful\nand answers prayers than that my own views on gun control, or anyone else’s,\nwould turn out to be directly relevant. I can open the Scriptures to find an\naccount of God’s mercy in the face of man’s capacity for wickedness. I cannot,\nhowever, explain the dramatic decline of violent crime and gun homicide in an\nAmerica over the last two decades. Not when the country is constantly\nloosening its gun laws, and the national stockpile of privately held weapons\nkeeps growing.Without evidence, why should I assume that closing private-sales\nloopholes, imposing magazine limits or instituting more invasive background\nchecks would have prevented the violence in San Bernardino? If only the Daily\nNews’ skepticism about the sincerity and efficacy of prayer extended just a\nlittle further.The prayer-skeptics will work out their policy response in fear\nand trembling as we learn more about the latest atrocity. I wish them luck. As\na citizen, I’ll dutifully consider them. As a pundit I’ll offer criticism,\nhopefully constructive. Until then my thoughts return again and again to the\nvictims. And even without intending, I start to pray._Michael Brendan\nDougherty writes about politics for the Week.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56dc7c62955d142bd0af68f9" }, "content" : "White House officials are seeking a way to use executive authority to close\nthe so-called gun show loophole that allows thousands of people to buy\nfirearms each year without a background check, but complicated legal issues\nhave slowed the process.Almost three years ago, after the killing of 20\nchildren and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn.,\nPresident Obama asked Congress to change the law to require background checks\nfor weapons sold outside the network of licensed gun dealers, including sales\nat gun shows or through the Internet. A bill to tighten the background system\ndied in the Senate a few months later — dashing the administration’s hopes for\nlegislative action.The deadlock in the Senate continued Thursday as\nRepublicans blocked several efforts by Democrats to add gun control provisions\nto a budget measure.On the presidential campaign trail, in the White House and\non Twitter, it was as if politicians were responding to completely different\nevents.Following the shooting rampage in San Bernardino, Democrats forcefully\ndemanded a tightening of the country’s gun laws, laying blame on a culture\nthat...On the presidential campaign trail, in the White House and on Twitter,\nit was as if politicians were responding to completely different\nevents.Following the shooting rampage in San Bernardino, Democrats forcefully\ndemanded a tightening of the country’s gun laws, laying blame on a culture\nthat...In one of a series of near-party-line procedural votes, the Senate by\n54 to 45 blocked a proposal by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) that would\nhave stopped people on the government’s anti-terrorist “no fly” list from\nbuying guns. Republican opponents said that the no-fly list includes too many\nerrors to be used for preventing gun sales.By a 50 to 48 vote the chamber also\nblocked a measure by Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Patrick J. Toomey\n(R-Pa.) to tighten the background-check system.All Republicans voted to block\nthe Feinstein measure except Sen. Mark Steven Kirk of Illinois, who faces a\ndifficult reelection campaign next year in a heavily Democratic state. On the\nbackground-check measure, Kirk, Toomey and fellow Republican Sens. John McCain\nof Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine voted with the Democrats.**Follow live\ncoverage of the San Bernardino shooting &gt;&gt;**On both measures, all\nDemocrats were in favor except Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, who voted\nno, and Sen. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, who did not vote. A spokesman for\nWarner said he was unable to vote because of a prior commitment but would have\nsupported both measures.This fall, after a shooter at a community college in\nOregon killed nine people and then shot himself, Obama directed his aides to\nstep up efforts to get around that congressional stalemate by using his\nexecutive powers.Since then, White House officials have been trying to draft\nan executive order that would reinterpret existing law to require all or most\ngun sales to go through the background check system.But despite Obama’s\nvisible frustration with the lack of action, a solution has proved\ncomplicated. Many had expected the White House to announce plans for an\nexecutive order by Dec..14, the anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting. That\nnow seems less likely.Requiring background checks for all weapons sales might\nnot have had any effect on Wednesday’s shootings in San Bernardino in which at\nleast 14 people were killed. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and\nExplosives has determined that Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the two shooters,\nlegally purchased two of the weapons at a gun shop in Corona. Two others were\nlegally purchased and given to him by a friend, federal officials said\nThursday.In most other mass shootings in recent years, the perpetrators also\npurchased their weapons legally through licensed firearms dealers.Federal law\nrequires those dealers to get federal licenses and conduct background checks\non their customers. But the law offers an exemption to hobbyists, collectors\nand others who make “occasional sales” and are not considered to be “engaged\nin the business” of gun dealing.How often such private sales take place\nremains unclear. One oft-cited figure suggests 40% of guns that change hands\nin the U.S. each year are transferred without background checks. Some of those\ntransfers, however, are not sales, and the figure comes from a survey that is\ntwo decades old.That lack of statistical evidence troubles those who worry\nabout government interference with the 2nd Amendment right to bear arms.But\nWhite House officials and their allies continue to see expanding background\nchecks as the most promising way to prevent at least some gun deaths. While\nperpetrators of mass shootings have typically passed background checks, a\nlarge percentage of shooters who kill people in street violence in U.S. cities\nbuy guns through a black market that is fueled by private sales, they say.One\noption for Obama is to set a threshold for the number of guns a person would\nbe allowed to sell without obtaining a license. Anyone selling more would\nautomatically be deemed to be “in the business” of dealing guns and would be\nrequired to have a license and conduct background checks.Another option would\nbe to describe the type of sales activity that would require a seller to get a\nlicense, based on its business methods, such as record keeping, advertising\nand payment to employees.“The law is very clear that those engaged in the\nbusiness of dealing in guns must become licensed, but the exemption for\noccasional sales is confusing,” said Chelsea Parsons, vice president of guns\nand crime policy at the Center for American Progress, which has close ties to\nthe administration. Current regulations do not “provide sufficient guidance to\nindividuals seeking to sell guns in compliance with the law or to law\nenforcement attempting to identify those who are brazenly violating it,” she\nsaid.Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton released a gun\ncontrol plan in October in which she pledged to take executive action if\nCongress “refuses to act” to tighten the background check system.Clinton also\npromised to close another gap in the system that allows a gun sale to proceed\nif law enforcement officials are unable to complete a background check within\nthree days.Supporters of that idea refer to the three-day rule as the\n“Charleston loophole” because it allowed a gun sale to Dylann Roof, the man\naccused of killing nine worshipers at a church in Charleston, S.C., in June.\nThe same provision has been involved in other mass shootings in recent\nyears.Over the last couple of months, administration officials have been\nreviewing state and local efforts, looking for successful programs that have\nreduced gun violence and searching for ways to confront what they see as a\nscourge.In a somber statement in the Oval Office on Thursday morning, Obama\nonce again called on lawmakers to change the law.“We all have a part to play,”\nObama said, including “legislators” in the list of those who must work to make\nit more difficult for violent people to get access to weapons.“Right now, it’s\njust too easy.”_christi.parsons@latimes.com__michael.memoli@latimes.com__Times\nstaff writer Lisa Mascaro contributed to this report._**ALSO****California\nlawmakers revive gun control ideas after attacks****We cannot accept mass\nshootings as the new normal****That period of nonpolitical mourning after a\nshooting?

But the poll\nnumbers have. And I recognize, I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his\npoll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law here are really\nquite clear here. Under longstanding U.S. law the child of a U.S. citizen born\nabroad is a natural born citizen,\" he said.Cruz went on to note that some of\nthe more \"extreme\" birther theorists say that a natural born citizen must have\ntwo parents born in the United States, which would also disqualify Trump from\nthe presidency.\"I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you. You are\nan American as is everybody else on this stage and I would suggest we focus on\nwho is best prepared to be commander in chief because that's the most\nimportant question facing the country,\" Cruz said.Trump once again told Cruz\nhe should seek a declaratory judgment that he is eligible to run, because if\nCruz was his vice presidential nominee -- or the nominee himself -- Democrats\nwould challenge his citizenship.He also admitted he's raised the issue,\n\"because now he's doing a little bit better.\"\"I didn't care before,\" Trump\nsaid. But now, \"He's got probably a 4 or 5 percent chance.\"Cruz's response to\nTrump: \"I'm happy to consider naming you as VP so if you happen to be right\nyou can get the top job at the end of the day.\"\"I think I'll go back to\nbuilding buildings,\" Trump responded.**9:22 p.m.** When about the New York\nTimes that he failed to disclose a low-interest loan from his wife's employer,\nGoldman Sachs, Cruz begins by railing about the what he viewed as a \"hit\npiece.\" Then he talked about his struggle as the underdog in the 2012 Texas\nSenate campaign.\"Yes I made a paperwork error...but if that's the best hit the\nNew York Times has got they've better go back to the well,\" Cruz said.**9:20\np.m.** In his first answer of the night, Trump warns that migrants could be\nthe \"great Trojan horse\" of attacks on the U.S. and said he is skeptical there\nare few women coming to the U.S.**9:16 p.m. **Guantanamo Bay would definitely\nremain open under a President Rubio.

Both also warn that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would\nbe a disaster as president because she would continue the president's foreign\npolicies.Rubio also chimes in.\"Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being\ncommander in chief of the United States.

If, heaven forbid, that next\npresident is a Repbulican I think its pretty clear we know what will happen. A\nlot of the rights that have been won over the years from women's rights to\nvoter rights to gay rights to worker rights will be at risk...This is a\nwatershed election. I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed\nPresident Obama in the White House and I will do all that I can in this\ncampaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as\npresident.\"She closed by saying, \"Thank you, good night, and may the Force be\nwith you.\"**10:37 p.m. **O'Malley gets a question about whether his wife,\nKatie, would have to give up her work as a district judge if he were\nelected.\"That would be totally up to her. Katie has never been a person who\nlet her husband's professional choices get in the way of her dreams,\" he said.\n\"Katie O'Malley will do whatever Katie O'Malley wants to do regardless of\nwhether her husband gets elected.\"**10:34 p.m. **A question for Clinton, who\nheld this role: Is it time to change the role of a president's spouse?\" The\nrole has been defined by each person who has held it and I am very grateful\nfor all my predecessors and my successors because of them did what she could\nto support her husband and her country but also chose to work on issues that\nwere of particular concern,\" Clinton said. \"With respect to my own husband, I\nam probably still going to pick the flowers and the China for state dinners\nand stuff like that, but I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have\nfor special missions, for advice, and in particular how we're going to get the\neconomy working again for everybody.\"As Sanders is asked about his own wife,\nhe took a second to praise Clinton's tenure as first lady. She \"redefined what\nthat role could be.\"**10:28 p.m.** A follow up question goes to Clinton about\nwhether she bears responsibility for the chaos in Libya after the 2011\nmilitary intervention. She blamed the Arab Spring and ISIS propaganda for\ndestabilizing the country.\"What we're seeing happening in Libya right now is\nthat there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that\nexist between Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS...and to try to\ncreate a national government,\" she said. \"This is not easy work.

Plus, he said, addiction should be\ntreated like a disease and not a criminal problem.Clinton says the federal\ngovernment should offer $10 billion over 10 years to work with states to come\nup with a plan to fight the heroin epidemic.\"There are too many opioids being\nprescribed...that leads directly to heroin addiction,\" Clinton said.**10:19\np.m. **Sanders focused his comments on reforming the criminal justice\nsystem.\"We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice\nsystem,\" he said, and called for an effort to end institutional racism.\"Police\nofficers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African\nAmericans,\" he said.

He also called for\nhigher taxes on top earners.One entitlement the U.S. cannot afford, he said,\nis \"the entitlement that the super wealthy among us -- those earning more than\na million dollars -- feel they are entitled to pay lower income tax rates and\na far lower preferred tax rate when it comes to capital gains.\"**10:05 p.m.\n**Clinton reaffirms her pledge not to raise taxes on middle class families.\"I\ndon't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise\nmiddle class families' taxes...we've got to get back to where people can save\nmoney again,\" she said.Sanders said Clinton is going against President\nRoosevelt on Social Security and President Johnson on Medicare -- as well as\nprogressive Democrats, who argue for small tax increases to pay for things\nlike paid medical and family leave.**10:04 p.m. **The debate turns to taxes.\n\"Now this is getting fun!\" Sanders exclaims.**10:01 p.m.** As O'Malley talks\nabout his plan to give students access to a debt-free college education at any\nin-state university, he thanks Clinton for \"borrowing\" many of his ideas in\nher own plan.Clinton calls for debt-free public tuition and said the U.S.\nshould focus on poorer families, not eliminating tuition for everyone.**9:59\np.m. **Sanders is talking about his education plan, which would put a\nspeculation tax on Wall Street to eliminate tuition at public colleges and\nuniversities altogether.\"If we are going ot be competitive in the global\neconomy we need the best educated workforce,\" he said, calling it \"insane\"\nthat some people cannot afford to go to college.Read more about where the\ncandidates stand on college affordability here.**9:53 p.m. **Asked about\nrising premiums for health insurance, Clinton said, \"I would certainly build\non the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the\nglitches.\"She said she has proposed a $4,000 tax credit to help people who\nhave very large out of pocket costs and wants Medicare to be able to negotiate\nfor lower drug prices. Additionally, Clinton said, the health care exchanges\nneed to be \"properly regulated so we are not being gamed.\"**9:48\np.m.**O'Malley argues that he has a better plan than both of his rivals,\nsaying, \"We're not going to fix what ails our economy...by either trying to\nreplace American capitalism with socialism...nor will we fix it by submitting\nto Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.\"\"I had the backbone to take on Wall\nStreet in the ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has,\" he said, and\nrecalled what he termed \"shameful\" comments Clinton made in the last debate\nlinking Wall Street, campaign finance and the terrorist attacks on\n9/11.\"Clinton fired back, saying O'Malley had \"no problem\" going to Wall\nStreet bankers to raise money when he was the head of the Democratic\nGovernor's Association.**9:44 p.m. **Sanders gets the same question -- and the\nanswer is no.\"Hillary and I have a difference. CEOs of large multinationals,\nthey like Hillary, they aren't going to like me. And Wall Street, they're\ngoing to like me even less.**9:42 p.m.**\"Should corporate America love Hillary\nClinton?\" Muir asks. \"Everyone should!\" Clinton responds.She went on to talk\nabout leveling the playing field but also describing herself as someone\ninterested in creating jobs.\"If people who are in the private sector know what\nI stand for...and they want to be part of once again building our economy so\nit works for everybody, more power to them.\"**9:40 p.m. **Candidates are\noutlining the broad strokes of their economic policies as the debate shifts to\nthe economy, taxes and healthcare.**9:26 p.m.** Clinton and Sanders continued\nto spar over whether the U.S. should focus on removing Assad and destroying\nISIS at the same time. The former secretary of state argued that the fighters\non the ground who oppose Assad need to know there is a diplomatic channel in\nplace to change the leadership. Sanders stuck to his position.\"Yes, of course,\nAssad is a terrible dictator. But I think we have got to get our foreign\npolicies and our priorities right. It is not Assad who is attacking the United\nStates. It is ISIS,\" he said. The major priority, he affirmed, \"should be the\ndestruction of ISIS.\"O'Malley argued that the U.S. should not be determining\nwhich dictators around the world must stay and go.\"We have a role to play in\nthis world but it is not the role of traveling the world to look for new\nmonsters to destroy,\" he said.**9:22 p.m.** Sanders calls for focusing on\ndestroying ISIS in Syria first, and removing Syrian dictator Bashar Assad\nsecond, repeating a frequent argument against regime change.In response.\nClinton hits Sanders over voting in favor of the U.S.-led campaign of\nairstrikes that helped depose former Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.If the\nU.S. had not done that, Clinton said, \"you would be looking at Syria.**9:21\np.m.** Clinton dismisses a question on whether she would be willing to shoot\ndown a Russian plane in a no-fly zone over Syria.\"It wouldn't come to that,\"\nshe said, arguing that the U.S. would be able to work with Russia on the no-\nfly zone.**9:18 p.m.** Clinton says a question about whether she is willing to\nrisk having to send more and more forces into the Middle East to defeat ISIS\nis a \"false choice.\" She listed a number of things she said the U.S. must do\nin combination to defeat the group: Lead an air coalition, build back up the\nIraqi Army, talk to sheiks in the Anbar province, get the Turks to pay more\nattention to ISIS than the Kurds and build a coalition of Muslim nations on\nthe ground.**9:13 p.m.** Raddatz pushes Sanders over how he will convince\nMuslim nations to put troops on the ground to fight ISIS, since he does not\nwant U.S. combat troops in the region.\"My plan is to make it work, to tell\nSaudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they...are going to have\nto go to war against ISIS. To tell Qatar that instead of spending $200 billion\non the World Cup, maybe instead they should pay attention to ISIS which is at\nhis doorstep,\" he said.**9:08 p.m.** The moderators point out that the\ngovernor of the state hosting the debate, New Hampshire's Maggie Hassan, has\ncalled for a halt in accepting refugees from Syria.I don't think a halt is\nnecessary,\" Clinton said, calling for \"increased vetting and screening.\"\"The\nprocess should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS,\" she\nsaid.O'Malley said there are far greater vulnerabilities than those posed by\nrefugees, and that the U.S. should take in more than the 65,000 refugees he\nhas called for if necessary.**9:05 p.m.** Fielding a question about whether\nthe government should force tech companies to give them a back door into\nencrypted communications, Clinton calls for a \"Manhattan-like project\" to\nfigure out a way to bring the government and tech community together to find\nmiddle ground.She said she would \"not want to go to that point\" of forcing\ntech companies to preserve a back door for government, which they argue would\nalso make their products vulnerable to hackers. \"I would hope that given the\nextraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs\nand questions...that there could be a Manhattan-like project...they've got to\nbe partners,\" she added.O'Malley also weighed in: \"I believe we should never\ngive up our privacy,\" he said. He then talked about the importance of\npreserving the freedom of religion.**9:02 p.m.** As the conversation turns to\nTrump, Sanders has a message for his supporters:\"What I say to those people\nwho go to Donald Trump's rallies: He thinks a lot minimum wage in America is a\ngood idea...I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this\ncountry,\" he said.**9:00 p.m. **\"He is becoming ISIS' best recruiter,\" Clinton\nsays of Republican candidate Donald Trump, talking about his rhetoric on\nMuslims and call to ban them from coming to the U.S.**8:59 p.m. **Sanders grew\npassionate when talking about his history with gun control in a state like\nVermont.\"Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the\ngun people,\" he told O'Malley.Clinton also said, \"I applaud his record in\nMaryland, I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.\"Read more about where the\n2016 candidates stand on gun control here.**8:53 p.m. **Sanders argued, \"I'm\nnot going to say that everybody is in agreement...but there is a broad\nagreement on sensible gun safety regulations.\" He cited expanding background\nchecks and banning assault weapons as a place where there is broad agreement,\nand said he would push for those regulations even though he comes from a state\nwith virtually no gun control.Meanwhile, O'Malley went after Clinton and\nSanders for a \"flip-flopping culture of Washington\" on gun control.\"Let's calm\ndown a little Martin,\" Sanders said. \"Let's tell the truth here Martin,\"\nClinton chimed in.**8:51 p.m. **Clinton is asked about an ABC News poll that\nshows Americans believe arming more people, not stricter gun laws, is the best\ndefense. \"Guns in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans\nsafer...arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response\nto terrorism. I think what is is creating much deeper, closer relations and\nyes coalitions within our own country. The first line of defense against\nradicalization is in the Muslim-American community, people who we should be\nwelcoming and working with,\" she said. **8:45 p.m. **The moderators ask\nClinton how confident the American people should be that there aren't people\nlike the ones who committed the San Bernardino shooting who have been\nradicalized under the radar of authorities. She pivots to her strategy to\ndefeat ISIS. At the end of hear answer, Clinton called for better sharing of\nintelligence and information, and said the government must work with Muslim\nAmerican communities. \"They will be our early warning signal...that's why we\nneed to work with them and not demonize them like the Republicans have been\ndoing,\" Clinton said. O'Malley jumps in and says the problem in the fight\nagainst ISIS is a \"lack of battle tempo.\" **8:40 p.m. **Sanders gets the first\nquestion over the voter data breaches, and says again that his staffer \"did\nthe wrong thing\" and calling for an independent investigation of breaches of\nvoter data. He is still critical of the Democratic National Committee (DNC)\nfor shutting off his access to his data, calling it a \"real problem.\" Asked by\nthe moderators, Sanders apologized to both Clinton and his supporters. Clinton\nresponded, \"I very much appreciate that comment,\" but added, \"I don't think\nthe American people are all that interested in this.\" **8:38 p.m. **Excerpts\nfrom the opening statements: Clinton: \"The American president has to both keep\nour families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not\njust those at the top. That's the job. I have a strategy to combat and defeat\nISIS without getting us involved in another ground war and I have a plan to\nraise in comes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at\nnight....we have a distinct difference between those of us up on stage and our\nRepublican counterparts.\" O'Malley: \"I visited with a number of our neighbors\nin northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday. And as I looked out there at the\neyes of our neighbors, I looked into the eyes of veterans, I looked into the\neyes of boy scouts...what our nation needs right now is to realize that while\nwe face a terror danger we also face another sort of political danger and that\nis the danger that democracies are susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders\ntry to turn us against each other.\" Sanders: \"I am running for president of\nthe United States because it is too late for establishment politics and\nestablishment economics. I'm running for president because our economy is\nrigged, because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and\nalmost all of the new wealth and income being created is going to the top 1\npercent...I'm going to create an economy that works for working families, not\njust billionaires. I'm running for president because we have a campaign\nfinance system that is corrupt...I'm running because we need to address the\nplanetary crisis of climate change...I want a new foreign policy, one that\ntakes on ISIS, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved\nin perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works\naround a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim\ntroops on the ground.\" **7:50 p.m.**Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,\nVermont Sen.

Bernie Sanders\nhad to answer for his opposition to the 1993 legislation. Clinton later\npounced on Sanders' waffling defense and noted, at the end of the debate, that\nshe counted the National Rifle Association (NRA) as an enemy she was proud\nof.In 2000, Clinton also proposed a national gun registry \\-- a policy she\nbacked away from during her 2008 presidential bid against Barack Obama, when\nshe positioned herself to the right of the progressive candidate on gun\nsafety.Since launching her second presidential campaign, Clinton has rolled\nout new proposals for gun safety, which include closing regulatory loopholes\nfor gun shows and Internet vendors and holding gun manufacturers liable for\ncrimes committed with their products.The Brady Center's \"Bear Awards\" are\nnamed after James \"Bear\" Brady, a former White House press secretary under\nRonald Reagan. Brady sustained a gunshot wound to the head during an attempted\nassassination attempt on Reagan in 1981. He became a fierce gun control\nadvocate after the shooting, which left him partially paralyzed and caused him\nhealth problems throughout his life. Brady's death in 2014 was later ruled a\nhomicide, caused by the gunshot wound inflicted 33 years earlier.

And we have to work on our mental health\nsystem in this country to give doctors and caregivers greater latitude to\ninvoluntarily commit folks who have mental health issues and who don't want to\ntake their medication and help themselves.\"In the editorial, published in\nSaturday's edition, the Times editorial board condemned elected officials\n\"whose job is to keep us safe but who place a higher premium on the money and\npolitical power of an industry dedicated to profiting from the unfettered\nspread of ever more powerful firearms.\"\"It is a moral outrage and a national\ndisgrace that civilians can legally purchase weapons designed specifically to\nkill people with brutal speed and efficiency,\" the editorial board wrote.\n\"Certain kinds of weapons, like the slightly modified combat rifles used in\nCalifornia, and certain kinds of ammunition, must be outlawed for civilian\nownership.\"The op-ed came just days after two shooters, armed with\nsemiautomatic assault weapons, killed 14 people and injured 21 others during a\nmassacre at a social services center in San Bernardino, California. The FBI is\ninvestigating the shooting as an act of terrorism, in part because officials\nbelieve the shooters, Syed Farook and Tashfeen Malik, may have been\nradicalized by terrorist elements in the U.S. and abroad, including the\nIslamic State of Iraq and Syria.Christie also criticized President Obama and\nformer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential\nfrontrunner in the 2016 election, for what he saw as a premature pivot to gun\ncontrol in the wake of the deadly rampage. \"Remember, the president and the\nsecretary, before they even knew what was going on here, ran out on the first\nmoments after this attack and said this was a gun control issue,\" Christie\nsaid. \"I don't know what gun control laws, john, are going to stop terrorists\nfrom attacking us. But this is the typical liberal approach to things...They\nwanted to try to turn this awful tragedy into an excuse to have greater gun\ncontrol.\"Christie argued that enhanced government surveillance tools will do\nmore to secure the U.S. than stricter gun control, and he snuck in a dig at\ntwo GOP primary rivals, Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, for supporting a bill\nthat limited some of the government surveillance tools enacted after\n9/11.\"What we really need is greater intelligence, which the president has\ntaken away from this country with the complicity of [Senator] Cruz and Senator\nPaul, and we need to make sure that we back our law enforcement so they can\ntake these criminals off the streets,\" Christie explained.Tune in Sunday to\nsee more of our interview with Christie!

He also hit Clinton over her 2002 Iraq War vote, saying he heard the\nsame evidence and came to a different conclusion -- and accurately predicted\nthe chaos that followed.Asked in what circumstances he would use military\nforce, Sanders cited his support to stop ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and his\nvote in favor of the war in Afghanistan.\"I do not support the United States\ngetting involved in unilateral action,\" he said.O'Malley also weighed in,\nsaying, \"No commander-in-chief should take the military option off the\ntable.\"**9:23 p.m. **Asked whether the Russian reset was a mistake, Clinton\nsaid, \"We got a lot of business done with the Russians when Medvedev was\npresident,\" referring to former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. \"When putin\ncame back in and said he was going to be president that did change the\nrelationship,\" she said.Regarding Russian involvement in Syria, Clinton said,\n\"I think it's important too that the United States make it very clear to Putin\nthat it's not acceptable for him to be in Syria creating more chaos, bombing\npeople on behalf of Assad and we can't do that if we don't take more of a\nleadership position,\" she said.**9:21 p.m. **Chafee said there needs to be\nmore dialogue with the NRA to get them to stop telling people Congress is\ntrying to take away their guns.\"I would bring the gun lobby in and say, 'We've\ngot to change this,'\" he said.**9:19 p.m. **Sanders argues that part of his\nposition stems from representing a rural state that has different views on\nguns.****\"It is not about rural and urban,\" O'Malley argued, citing the\nEastern Shore and western Maryland, two rural parts of the state. \"We were\nable to pass this and still respect the hunting traditions of people who lived\nin our rural areas.\"Sanders responded, \"You have not been in the United States\nCongress...check it out and if you think that we can simply go forward and\npass something tomorrow without bringing people together you are surely\nmistaken.\"**9:16 p.m. **Clinton and Sanders tangle over the issue of gun\ncontrol when Sanders is asked about his opposition to the Brady Bill. He says\nit was a complicated bill.Clinton was asked if he's tough enough on gun\nmanufacturers.\"No, not at all,\" Clinton said, urging the entire country to\nstand up against the National Rifle Association.\"He was going to give\nimmunity...Everybody else has to be accountable, but not the gun\nmanufacturers,\" she said.**9:13: **Webb reaffirms his support for affirmative\naction for African Americans, but says it doesn't make sense for all people of\ncolor.\"The idea that when we create diversity programs that include everyone,\nquote, of color other than struggling whites like the families in the\nAppalachian mountains, we're not being true to the Democratic party principle\nof elevating the level of consciousness in our people\" about the hardships\nthat some, including whites, face.**9:10 p.m.** O'Malley gets question about\nthe high arrest rate when he was mayor of Baltimore. He defended his work\nthere, saying they saved a lot of lives.\"The vast majority of them were young\nand poor and black. It wasn't easy on any given day,\" he said.**9:08 p.m.\n**Chafee, explaining his switch from being a Republican to a Democrat, said,\n\"The party left me, there's no doubt about that.\"**9:06 p.m. **Debate\nmoderator Anderson Cooper asks if anyone on the stage in addition to Sanders\nwouldn't consider themselves a capitalist.Clinton jumped in. \"I don't think we\nshould confuse what we have to do every so often in America which is save\ncapitalism from itself,\" she said.**9:04 p.m.** Sanders is asked about the\nlarge percentage of Americans who say they won't elect a socialist.\"We're\ngoing to explain what democratic socialism is,\" Sanders said. He proceeded to\nrail against rising income inequality and the fact that the U.S. stands alone\nin not guaranteeing healthcare as a right to its people.\"Democrats...will when\nwhen there's a large voter turnout,\" Sanders said, arguing that people would\nturn out to vote for him.**9:01 p.m. **First question is about some concerns\nfrom voters. Clinton is asked about flipping on issues such as same-sex\nmarriage and the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\"I have been very consistent over\nthe course of my entire life, I have always fought for the same values and\nprinciples but like most human beings...I do absorb new information, I do look\nat what's happening in the world,\" she said.Pressed on whether she changes her\nposition for political expediency, she said, \"No, I think like most people\nthat I know I have a range of views but they are rooted in my values and my\nexperience and I don't take a backseat to anyone when it comes to progressive\nexperience and progressive commitment.\"**8:58 p.m.** Clinton introduces\nherself as the granddaughter of a factory worker and the grandmother of a\nwonderful one-year-old child, her granddaughter, Charlotte.\"I have spent a\nvery long time, my entire adult life, looking for ways to even the odds, to\nhelp people have the chance to get ahead and in particular to find the ways\nfor each child to live up to his or her god-given potential,\" she said. \"At\nthe center of my campaign is how we're going to raise wages.\"**8:54 p.m.**\nO'Malley said, \"After 15 years of executive experience I have learned how to\nbe an effective leader,\" and ticked off several of his progressive\naccomplishments as Maryland governor, including a DREAM Act and comprehensive\ngun safety legislation.Sanders started off by railing against the campaign\nfinance system.\"Our campaign finance system is corrupt and is undermining\nAmerican democracy,\" he said. He also talked about the need for clean energy\nand the high incarceration rates.**8:50 p.m.**Chafee seemed to take a shot at\nClinton with this line in his opening statement: \"I have had no scandals. I've\nalways been honest, had the courage to take the long-term view and I've shown\ngood judgment. I have high ethical standards.\"Webb touted his record in\ngovernment and work on issues like veterans' affairs.**8:30 p.m.**Five people\ntake the stage in Las Vegas Tuesday night for the first of six debates\narranged by the Democratic National Committee: Former Secretary of State\nHillary Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, former Maryland Gov. Martin\nO'Malley, former Sen. Jim Webb and former Rhode Island Gov. and Sen. Lincoln\nChafee.Vice President Joe Biden, who is considering whether to jump into the\nDemocratic primary race, will not take place in the debate. He's hosting a\nhigh school reunion and then watching the debate from his home in the Naval\nObservatory. The sixth Democratic presidential candidate, Harvard Professor\nLarry Lessig, won't be on the debate stage because he failed to meet CNN's\npolling requirements. The national party has faced increasing pressure from\ncontenders like former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley to increase the number of\ndebates. But last month, DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, R-Florida, said\nthe party is \"not changing the process.\"Among the questions that will be\nanswered Tuesday evening: Will Clinton go after her Democratic rivals the way\nshe has attacked potential Republican opponents? Will Sanders disavow his\npromise not to attack Clinton? And can O'Malley, Webb or Chafee finally break\nthrough pull in enough support to get them past the low single digits?The\nlatest CBS News national poll has Clinton leading Sanders by 19 points. If\nBiden decides not to enter the race, her lead would grow and she would have 56\npercent support compared to 32 percent for Sanders. Nearly six in 10\nDemocratic primary voters see her as the most electable.\n\n", "title" : "In Democratic debate, candidates tangle on gun control, Wall Street reform - CBS News", "twitter" : { "body" : "In #DemDebate , candidates tangle on gun control , Wall Street reform and more: http://cbsn.ws/1K7TEli pic.twitter.com/sWemoK0ugb", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/654157203755171840", "retweets" : 27, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-10-13T14:50:05.000-0700" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 29, "hashtags" : "#DemDebate", "id" : "654157203755171840" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "CBSNews", "link" : "http://cbsn.ws/1K7TEli" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56dc7c62955d142bd0af6903" }, "content" : "New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has staked out a role in the 2016 Republican\nprimary as the candidate who can get things done - even with\nDemocrats.\"Compromise isn't capitulation,\" the governor recently said on\nComedy Central's The Daily Show. \"It's an option not to talk to the other\nside. That should not be an option. You get sent [to Washington] to work, to\ngovern. That's what I've done in New Jersey. Doesn't mean we always agree, but\nwe find compromise.\"Christie has indeed worked with his state's Democratic\nlegislature and its backers on a range of issues -- including gun laws. Yet on\nmatters relating to firearms, the governor has since launching his\npresidential campaign disavowed the notion that he's anything other than a\nfirm Second Amendment supporter. \"Does New Jersey have a lot of difficult gun\nlaws? Yeah, and they were all signed before I became governor,\" the governor\ndeclared defensively at a town hall in Ankeny, Iowa in July. In fact, the\ngovernor has signed several laws to regulate the possession of firearms. The\nNew Jersey Star-Ledger points to more than a dozen gun control bills Christie\nhas signed in his nearly six years as governor of the blue state. \"These\ncommonsense measures will... strengthen New Jersey's already tough gun laws,\"\nthe governor said in an August 2013 statement after signing into law 10 pieces\nof gun violence and firearm-related bills.\"His record in New Jersey on gun\ncontrol is decidedly mixed,\" Ben Dworkin, director of the Rebovich Institute\nfor New Jersey Politics at Rider University, told CBS News. \"He's vetoed some\ngun control legislation, he's signed some legislation -- as he talks to\naudiences that have a much more expansive view of the Second Amendment than\nmany in New Jersey, I think he is shifting his emphasis as he talks about\nthis.\"The sort of bills that Christie has backed aren't exactly controversial\nin New Jersey. For instance, a 2013 bill that increased the penalty for\ntransferring a firearm to a minor passed in the legislature without any\nopposition.Even so, Dworkin noted, \"There are issues within both parties in\nwhich it's hard to talk about how you compromise -- within the Republican\npresidential primary electorate, the Second Amendment can be one of those\nissues.\"Iowa Republican strategist John Stineman agreed that gun control is a\nparticularly tough issue for a candidate like Christie. Generally speaking,\nIowans can appreciate Christie's executive experience and no-nonsense\nattitude, Stineman told CBS. \"Even among the Republican caucus goers there's a\nlot of appetite for the 'get-it-done' governor,\" he said. That said, Stineman\nadded, \"there's a very pro-Second Amendment element\" in the Republican\nelectorate, and \"anything less than purity [on the issue] is a non-starter\"\nfor those voters. Consequently, Christie has responded to mass shootings --\nsuch as last week's tragic shooting in Roseburg, Oregon \\-- the same way his\nGOP opponents largely have: by focusing on shortcomings with the nation's\nmental health system rather than its gun laws. \"It's a really complex problem,\nbut I think it's about the mental health issues,\" Christie said Sunday on\nABC's This Week, when asked about what causes mass shootings.Christie's shift\ntoward a more pro-Second Amendment stance can at times seem tough to swallow.\nFor instance, he raised some eyebrows after vetoing a ban on .50-caliber\nrifles in New Jersey -- a ban he originally supported. Still, Stineman\nsuggested there's a way for Christie to put more emphasis on gun rights\nwithout losing his reputation as the \"get-it-done\" governor. For instance,\nChristie recently vetoed a unanimously-passed bill that would have alerted law\nenforcement whenever someone who had been committed to a psychiatric facility\nasked for that history to be expunged from their record in order to buy a\nfirearm. While Christie's veto outraged Democrats, he convinced New Jersey's\nRepublican legislators to go along with the move by proposing alternative\nlegislation that would make changes to the state's mental health laws. \"If\nGovernor Christie issued a veto but he had a viable alternative that's\nmeaningful, then that can be seen as credible,\" Stineman said.\n\n", "title" : "Election 2016: For Chris Christie, gun control creates a snag in his 2016 pitch - CBS News", "twitter" : { "body" : "For Chris Christie, gun control creates a snag in his 2016 pitch http://cbsn.ws/1VARmr4 pic.twitter.com/bD1EO7wYfV", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/651348694915260416", "retweets" : 18, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-10-05T20:50:04.000-0700" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 14, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "651348694915260416" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "CBSNews", "link" : "http://cbsn.ws/1VARmr4" }

We don’t even know who they\nbelong to.”Ms. Barragan, the auction administrator, said she did not think\nmore background checks would have much effect. At least as afraid of the day-\nto-day violence in this city as of another mass shooting, she said she wanted\nto find a way to get rid of more guns.“If everybody carries a gun, people are\nstill fighting in the street,” Ms. Barragan said. “It’s too easy for the wrong\nperson to get one.”\n\n", "title" : "To San Bernardino, Obama’s Gun Plan Goes Too Far or Falls Short - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Gun Control Measures Meet With Skepticism in San Bernardino http://nyti.ms/1Rh0iPJ", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/684646316618690560", "retweets" : 53, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-05T16:02:56.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 71, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "684646316618690560" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1Rh0iPJ" }

It is offensive, and the person who requested it\nshould be ashamed. That prejudice has no place in Minnesota.”Dayton also\ncalled for a closer look at department policies, saying: “I have instructed\nthe Commissioner of Public Safety to retrieve this plate as soon as possible\nand re-review agency procedures to ensure it does not occur again.”The\napplication for the personalized plate went through a deputy registrar’s\noffice in Foley, a city about 15 miles from St. Cloud; the plate was issued in\nJune.The Minneapolis Star Tribune reports that the decision to revoke the\nplate came after it was spotted in St. Cloud and pictures spread online. (You\ncan find a photo of it here.)The newspaper reports:Some young St. Cloud\nSomali-Americans sent cellphone photos of the plate to Haji Yusuf, a community\nactivist for #UniteCloud, a group trying to ease racial tension in the city.\nYusuf posted the photo to social media, after which residents began demanding\nthat the Department of Public Safety revoke the license plate, said Natalie\nRingsmuth, founder and executive director of #UniteCloud.When applying for\npersonalized plates in the state of Minnesota, drivers complete an application\nthat includes a section in which they are asked to explain their plate\nchoices. “This MUST be completed or plates will not be issued,” the form\nreads.According to CBS affiliate WCCO, the public safety agency released the\noriginal application for the controversial plate on Tuesday, and it indicated\nthat “FMUSLMS” was a band name. No band by that name showed up in a series of\nGoogle searches that included various spellings.Likewise “PETALOL” — a\npossible reference to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.The state’s\napplication notes that a personalized plate that “offends public morals or\ndecency may not be issued.”**Want more stories about faith?
