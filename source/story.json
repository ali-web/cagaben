They hate freedom, they hate good over evil, they would deny us\nthe basic human right to self defense &amp; to KEEP &amp; BEAR ARMS while many\nof them have tax paid hired ARMED security!

It also\nwould establish a mandatory five-year prison sentence for anyone found with a\ngun after being convicted of domestic violence.Democrats hailed the measures\nas life-saving and as building on the 2013 Firearms Safety Act, which banned\ncertain military-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, among other\nthings. That provision of the law was deemed potentially unconstitutional by a\nthree-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in\nRichmond, and send back to a district court in Baltimore for\nreconsideration.Maryland Attorney General Brian E. Frosh said he is not\nconcerned about the challenge to the Firearms Safety Act, adding that the\nbills introduced Wednesday will “withstand legal challenges.”“Three other\ncircuits … have held the same types of laws to be constitutional. The Fourth\nCircuit is out of step with the country,” Mr. Frosh said.He said the state\nwould either appeal to the entire Fourth Circuit court or take the case to the\nU.S. Supreme Court.“Either way, we think we’ll be successful,” he said.Sen.\nJames C. Rosapepe, Prince George’s County Democrat, said Republicans had\nlabeled unconstitutional the idea of preventing anyone on the terrorist watch\nlist from owning a gun, but no list is perfect.“You’ve got to balance the\nsafety and security of the people of the United States, and the reality is,\nterrorism is real, it’s here and if you’re too dangerous to get on an\nairplane, you’re too dangerous to buy a gun. It’s not more complicated than\nthat,” Mr. Rosapepe said.Republican leaders said they had not yet read the\nbills, but if constitutional issues are sorted out, they would be open to talk\nabout them.“The devil’s in the details,” Senate Minority Leader J.B. Jennings\nsaid. “On the domestic violence side, without a doubt, that’s one of the most\nhorrible things that you hear a domestic violence case that has gone to that\npoint where somebody has actually murdered an individual with a firearm. So\nthat one, I have no problem looking at, let’s talk about it.”The Baltimore\nCounty Republican also said he could support the no-fly list gun ban as long\nas the state ensures it isn’t easy to get someone on the list just because\n“they don’t like somebody.”Democratic leaders said these are “common sense\nmeasures” that are widely supported by Marylanders.House Speaker Michael E.\nBusch said that whether lawmakers are Republican or Democrat, they would\nlisten to their constituencies and Marylanders are asking for increased gun\ncontrol._Story Continues →_\n\n", "title" : "Maryland Democrats offer 3 gun control bills as legislative priorities - Washington Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Maryland Democrats offer 3 gun control bills as legislative priorities http://goo.gl/gr7n9R", "link" : "https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/697478834770354176", "retweets" : 7, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-10T01:54:47.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 3, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "697478834770354176" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "washtimes", "link" : "http://goo.gl/gr7n9R" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e7183e955d14d6600b0362" }, "content" : "ANNAPOLIS, Md. — Democrats in the General Assembly said Wednesday that they\nwill try to expand gun controls this year, hoping to build on some of the\nnation’s toughest laws by banning firearms on college campuses and requiring a\nprocess for those convicted of domestic violence to turn in their\nguns.Lawmakers announced the push even as the state’s strict ban on military-\nstyle rifles and large-capacity magazines, enacted in the months after the\n2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, have run into trouble in federal\ncourts.“Guns don’t need to be on college campuses,” Attorney General Brian E.\nFrosh said. “They don’t need to be in the hands of domestic abusers. These\nbills provide real measures of safety for real people.”Democrats are seeking a\npackage of three bills: one to ban firearms on college campuses, one to\nrequire courts to inform those convicted of domestic violence they have 48\nhours to relinquish their guns and one that would prevent police from issuing\nfirearms permits to anyone listed on the FBI’s terrorist watch list.On\nTuesday, Sen. Jamie Raskin, Montgomery County Democrat, announced an\nadditional two bills that would mandate background checks before the purchase\nof a rifle or shotgun, and one that would alert law enforcement if a\nprohibited purchaser attempts to buy a gun.The bills could cause friction with\nGov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who received the National Rifle Association’s\nsupport in his 2014 campaign. His spokesperson said Wednesday that the\ngovernor had no comment on the bills and was not aware that they would be\nintroduced.Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller Jr., Prince George’s\nDemocrat, said he couldn’t imagine Mr. Hogan opposing them.“The person he’s\njoined at the hip with is [Gov.] Chris Christie in New Jersey, and Chris\nChristie signed the same bill into law, the no-fly zone [in 2013], and no guns\non campus is common sense,” Mr. Miller said. “And the domestic violence,\nthat’s already the law. We just want judges to enforce it, so hopefully he’ll\nsign all three.”Democrats said the bills build on the 2013 Firearms Safety\nAct, a sweeping law that banned the sale of nearly all semi-automatic rifles\nand high-capacity ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 bullets. It also\nrequired mandatory extensive background checks, that all new gun buyers submit\ndigital fingerprints to state police, and licensing for guns other than\nhunting rifles or shotguns.A federal appeals court last week said the law\ninfringes on Second Amendment rights and sent it back to a lower court for\nstricter review.Mr. Frosh said he will appeal the appeals court’s ruling and\nexpressed confidence that the 2013 law and the proposed bills will withstand\ncourt scrutiny.Republican leaders said they had not yet read the bills but\nwould be open to talking about them.“The devil’s in the details,” said Senate\nMinority Leader J.B. Jennings, Baltimore County Republican. “On the domestic\nviolence side, without a doubt, that’s one of the most horrible things that\nyou hear: a domestic violence case that has gone to that point where somebody\nhas actually murdered an individual with a firearm. So that one, I have no\nproblem looking at. Let’s talk about it.”Mr. Jennings said he would consider\nthe terrorist watch list proposal as well but wanted to know how easy it would\nbe for a person to end up on the list.Maryland gun rights groups said the\nbills would do little to curtail rising crime rates._Story Continues →_\n\n", "title" : "Maryland gun control expansion fills Democrats' package of 3 bills - Washington Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Maryland Democrats are trying to expand on some of the nation's toughest gun control laws: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/10/maryland-gun-control-expansion-fills-democrats-pac/ pic.twitter.com/4XVmK1r4g8", "link" : "https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/697584985155436544", "retweets" : 8, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-10T08:56:35.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 4, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "697584985155436544" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "washtimes", "link" : "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/10/maryland-gun-control-expansion-fills-democrats-pac/" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e7183e955d14d6600b0363" }, "content" : "There is nothing so comforting as a closely held prejudice, even when it\nrepeatedly harms you. The white-hot passion of Democratic politicians to\nrestrict and even strip Americans of their constitutionally guaranteed right\nto buy, own, keep, shoot and carry firearms continues as a monument to self-\nabuse.Simply put, the gun control issue is a loser. It doesn’t matter that the\npaid consultants, the lobbyists from the gun-prohibition industry, or the East\nCoast media all assure candidates that it’s now safe to come out of hiding and\nproclaim their open hatred of the very concept of self-defense and protecting\nyour family. The history of Democrats who push to rip away the rights of\nmillions of Americans constitutes a list of “whatever happened to” candidates.\nFrom dozens of Democrats who lost their seats in Congress because of their\ngun-ban vote in 1994 to Al Gore’s anti-rights position, which has been\ncredited with costing him the presidency, the party of “trust the government\nfor your personal safety” keeps having to relearn the lesson. In point of\nfact, their own party put out a paper some years ago warning candidates to not\ntalk about gun control, calling it a loser issue.How quickly they forget.Now\nHillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders fight to establish who is the strongest\nanti-Constitution candidate. It’s a clear indication neither they nor their\nadvisers actually talk to real people outside the Washington cocktail\ncircuit.For more than 20 years I’ve hosted a national radio talk show about\nguns, and through that I’ve talked with thousands of people across the country\n— people who have owned guns all their lives, people who only recently bought\na gun, and people who have never owned a gun but now want to. Typically, I’ll\nask why they are thinking of buying their first gun, and the answer always is\nthat they want to protect themselves and their families. They have looked at\nthe news, studied the events, watched the videos of attacks on the streets,\nand they have concluded that no one else will be on the scene to protect them.\nOh, and fully a third of first-time handgun buyers these days are women, so\nput aside that mental image of a demographic which can be ignored.Perhaps it’s\nnatural for a U.S. senator who has Secret Service protection or who works\nbehind the security veil of the Capitol Police to not understand the desire\nfor safety. For someone who sees more government as the solution to\neverything, it must seem strange that a mother would opt to protect her\nchildren rather than trust that the call to the 911 operator will instantly\nsave her.Callers to “Tom Gresham’s Gun Talk” say they look at the well-known\nattacks, do the math and understand that the police will show up when they\ncan, but in most cases it’s too late to actually stop the attack. They\ncategorize assurances of “just call the police — it’s their job” as callous\nputdowns from those who never worry about their own safety.It may overstate it\nto call gun control the third rail of politics, but it’s certainly a hot stove\nthat Democrats should have learned to avoid. That’s even more so now than\neight years ago when Hillary Clinton soft-peddled her gun-ban leanings. During\nthe intervening years, millions of Americans have purchased their first gun,\nmoving from the undecided to committed. With their dollars they have voted for\ntheir own safety, and they simply don’t trust anyone who says they are\nwrong.In 2013, the rush to purchase guns and ammunition emptied shelves at gun\nstores for nearly a year. That push may have lessened a bit, but gun makers\nstill operate at maximum capacity. The millions of Americans buying guns do\nnot think, as Mrs. Clinton has suggested, that we should consider Australian-\nstyle gun confiscation here.The candidates have not been helped by others in\ntheir party who introduce bills in Congress and in the states calling for the\nconfiscation of the most popular rifles and handguns in the United States.\nFaced with clear evidence of the intent to ban guns, the public smirks at\nreassurances from candidates and President Obama when they proclaim, “No one\nwants to take away your guns.” It’s a lie, and everyone knows it.As for the\nclaim that “90 percent of the public wants background checks,” it doesn’t hold\nup when you look past the misleading polls. If you explain that there\ncurrently is a national background check requirement, and that every gun\npurchase from a licensed dealer includes a background check by the FBI, you\ntypically get, “Oh, I didn’t know that.” Likewise, if you explain that gun\nshows are governed by the same laws as all other gun sales, and that there is\nno exception for these community gatherings, the result tends to be a puzzled\nlook, then an angry response, as the duplicity of politicians and the media in\nmisleading the public on the mythical “gun show loophole” crystallizes.One is\nleft wondering why Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders have opted to not only reveal,\nbut to loudly proclaim their enthusiasm for trampling the rights of 100\nmillion Americans. Have they not looked at the number of people scrambling to\nget permits for concealed carry in the swing states? Have they not looked at\nthe actions in the legislatures in swing states — actions opening concealed\ncarry to more areas, laws which allow teachers to carry guns in schools, and\neven calls to eliminate completely any requirement for a permit to carry a gun\nfor protection? The sea change in public opinion (for the first time, more\nthan half the people polled oppose a ban on so-called “assault weapons”)\nappears to have been missed by Democratic insiders. When it comes to guns, the\nswing states in the general election do not have the same take on guns as\neight years ago — back when Democrats knew better than to out themselves as\ngun banners.As the Democratic candidates move ever farther from public opinion\non the rights of gun owners, many observers scratch their heads, wondering how\nthe party can continue to allow its prejudice to outweigh its self-\ninterests.**• **_Tom Gresham hosts the nationally syndicated radio talk show\n“Tom Gresham’s Gun Talk” (guntalkmedia.com)._\n\n", "title" : "TOM GRESHAM: Why gun control is a loser for the Democrats - Washington Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Tom Gresham on why #guncontrol is a loser for the #Democrats http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/10/tom-gresham-why-gun-control-is-a-loser-for-the-dem/#.Vrvlb1uNkPQ.twitter  #Election2016 pic.twitter.com/vn1CGb7nHc", "link" : "https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/697596248744988672", "retweets" : 14, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-10T09:41:21.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 10, "hashtags" : "#guncontrol #Democrats # #Election2016", "id" : "697596248744988672" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "washtimes", "link" : "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/10/tom-gresham-why-gun-control-is-a-loser-for-the-dem/" }

He added that the\ndepartment hopes to get pre-clearance screening capabilities up and running at\nanother 10 international airports in nine countries.As a result of new\nsecurity protocols, the wait times for security screening at airports have\nincreased, but Mr. Johnson said “we believe this is necessary for the public’s\nown safety.”Efforts focused on counterterrorism also denied an additional\n3,000 people entry into the United States in fiscal 2015 based on the\ntightening of entry restrictions, he said.Mr. Johnson also highlighted efforts\nthe U.S. has taken to more narrowly tailor its immigration policies to address\nthreats to public safety and border security. He said since the administration\nchanged policy, replacing the Secure Communities program with the Priority\nEnforcement Program in July, that 16 counties that were not cooperating with\nthe federal government on illegal immigration issues have now come on board\n.Stepped-up efforts are also having an impact on the recent surge of illegal\nborder crossers from Central America that began late last year.According to\nDHS data, 3,133 unaccompanied minors were caught at the border in January,\nwhich was down from 6,786 the month before. And the number of family members\ntraveling together fell from nearly 9,000 in December to just 3,145 last\nmonth.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e7183e955d14d6600b0365" }, "content" : "  Fresh off a series of weekend victories in state caucuses, Bernie Sanders\nturned up the heat on Hillary Clinton at Sunday’s debate in Flint, Mich.,\nsharply challenging her economic credentials and suggesting her gun control\nstand would ban guns in America. But the Democratic front-runner fought back,\nblasting him for voting against the auto bailout, dismissing him as a “one-\nissue candidate” and hitting him once again for his stance on guns.  The\nVermont senator reached back to the 1990s as he went after Clinton’s support\nfor “disastrous trade agreements” like NAFTA. His rhetoric was notably more\npointed and, reflecting the tension in the race, Sanders even cut her off at\ntimes as she tried to speak over him. “Excuse me, I’m talking,” Sanders\nsnapped, during one feisty exchange on the economy. But Clinton pushed back,\nand defended the country’s economic progress during her husband’s\nadministration. “If we’re going to argue about the ‘90s, let’s try to get the\nfacts straight,” she said, touting the jobs and income growth that came with\nthe era. Sanders also tried to cast Clinton as soft on climate change, while\ndeclaring he unequivocally does not support fracking. Clinton maintained she\nhas the “most comprehensive plan to combat climate change.” The clashes came\nafter Sanders won the Maine Democratic caucuses, adding to wins the night\nbefore in Nebraska and Kansas — by far the most successful two days of his\ncampaign.But Sanders remains significantly behind in the race for delegates,\nwith Clinton having won more – and more valuable – state contests, as well as\nenjoying the overwhelming support of so-called “superdelegates.” Sanders is\nlooking for a game-changer as the race heads next to states like Michigan this\ncoming Tuesday, and Ohio and Florida the week after that.Sanders cited his\nmost recent wins at the end of Sunday’s debate, in arguing he would be the\nbetter candidate to go up against Republican front-runner Donald Trump.He\nbegan to joke he’d give his “right arm” to run against the billionaire\nbusinessman and then cited polls saying, “Sanders versus Trump does a lot\nbetter than Clinton versus Trump.”But while Sanders said he’s “exciting”\nworking-class and young voters, Clinton pointed to the raw numbers.“There’s\nonly one candidate [in either primary campaign] who has more votes than\n[Trump], and that’s me,” Clinton said. “I will look forward to engaging\nhim.”With the CNN-hosted debate held in Michigan, the state’s economic and\ncrime problems were front and center.On gun control, the two candidates\nsparred sharply, with Clinton using the Sandy Hook massacre to make a point\nabout holding gun makers responsible for crimes – and Sanders arguing that\nposition would effectively mean an America without guns.The dispute started\nwhen Sanders defended his past support for a bill to help protect gun\nmanufacturers and sellers from lawsuits. He said if gun sellers and makers are\nheld liable in many of these cases, “What you’re really talking about is\nending gun manufacturing in America.”Clinton countered that no other industry\nin America has “absolute immunity,” and invoked the Sandy Hook mass\nshooting.The Democratic rivals were most heated when talking about their\nrespective records on the economy. Sanders went after Clinton over what he\ncalled “disastrous trade agreements” like NAFTA.She countered by pointing out\nhe opposed the auto industry bailout. He tried to describe it as the Wall\nStreet bailout, and got a little feisty when she started to speak over\nhim.“Excuse me, I’m talking,” he said. “Your story is for voting for every\ndisastrous trade agreement.”Clinton then called him a “one-issue candidate.”\nAnd on the auto bailout, she said, “If everybody had voted the way he did, I\nbelieve the auto industry would have collapsed, taking 4 million jobs with\nit.”“My one issue is trying to rebuild a disappearing middle class. That’s my\none issue,” Sanders said.Meanwhile, at the top of the debate, Clinton and\nSanders momentarily set aside their differences, to lament the plight of the\npeople in the host city of Flint, and call for the governor’s resignation over\nthe toxic water crisis.Sanders said there’s “blame to go around” but\nRepublican Gov. Rick Snyder should resign.Clinton echoed the remarks, saying,\n“Amen to that.”“The governor should resign or be recalled,” she said, while\nalso calling on the federal and state governments to send more money to the\ncity.The city’s water crisis started when the city switched to the Flint River\nin 2014 while under a state-appointed emergency manager. While the state has\ntaken much of the blame, officials with the city and federal government – as\nwell as the state – have also resigned.Clinton faced Sanders on the debate\nstage as she fights to shake her lone primary rival, who keeps notching just\nenough primary and caucus wins to keep his campaign alive, and a threat to her\nbid.  Sanders rode to victory in Maine in part on a huge turnout — Sanders\nbeat Clinton by a ratio of nearly 2-to-1. The turnout was so big Sunday that\nsome voters had to wait in line for more than four hours in Portland.The\nvictory gives Sanders a total of three victories over the weekend to Clinton’s\none, in the Louisiana primary. The results from Maine Sunday aren't binding,\nbut will be used to select a slate of delegates to the state convention, where\nnational delegates will be elected. Maine will send 25 delegates and 30\nsuperdelegates.On Super Tuesday last week, Clinton won seven states to\nSanders’ four. She maintains a sizeable delegate lead – which before the Maine\ncontest stood at 1,121 to 481. It takes 2,383 delegates to win the\nnomination.But Sanders, even by winning lower-profile contests, has managed to\nat least demonstrate lingering weaknesses in the front-runner’s campaign as he\ndraws an enthusiastic response in the grassroots-driven caucus states.

Obama criticized the NRA’s decision\nnot to attend the event, and took aim at their fiery language in response to\nhis actions.\"If you listen to the rhetoric, it is so over the top, and so\noverheated,\" Obama said.At the town hall, which was hosted and televised by\nCNN, Obama took questions from Taya Kyle, whose late husband Chris Kyle was\ndepicted in the film \"American Sniper.\" Kyle told Obama that gun ownership was\nat an all-time high while murder rates are at an historic low, and defended\nher right to own a gun.“I want the hope -- and the hope that I have the right\nto protect myself; that I don't end up to be one of these families; that I\nhave the freedom to carry whatever weapon I feel I need,” Kyle said.“There is\na way for us to set up a system where you (as) a gun owner ... can have a\nfirearm to protect yourself but where it is much harder for somebody to fill\nup a car with guns and sell them to 13-year-old kids on the streets,” Obama\nreplied.Obama also took questions from Cleo Pendleton, whose daughter was shot\nand killed near Obama's Chicago home, and from Sheriff Paul Babeu, an Arizona\nlawman and congressional candidate who has accused Obama of unconstitutional\npower grabs on guns.He also took questions from controversial Chicago Catholic\npriest Rev. Michael Pfleger.“The reality is that I don't understand why we\ncan't title guns just like cars,” Pfleger said. “If I have a car and I give it\nto you, Mr. President, and I don't transfer a title, and you're in an\naccident, it's on me.”“Issues like licensing, registration, that's an area\nwhere there's just not enough national consensus at this stage to even\nconsider it. And part of it is, is people's concern that that becomes a\nprelude to taking people's guns away,” Obama replied.Also in the audience was\nformer Rep. Gabby Giffords and her husband Mark Kelly. Kelly and Giffords\nbecame prominent gun control advocates after Giffords was shot in 2011.Obama\nhas come under heavy fire from Republicans and Second Amendment advocates for\nhis actions, which they say infringe on Americans’ right to bear arms.The NRA\nfired back at Obama while the town hall was still going on. NRA Director Chris\nCox told Fox News’ Megyn Kelly: “This is an attempt to distract the American\npeople away from his failed policies.”“The NRA does more to teach safe and\nresponsible gun ownership than this president ever has or ever will,” Cox\nsaid.The president also published an opinion piece in Thursday's New York\nTimes in which he pledged not to support any candidate who is opposed to gun\ncontrol.“I will not campaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in\nmy own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform,” Obama said, a\nmove that could make Democratic candidates in Republican states feel unable to\nrequest the political support of the two-term president.White House spokesman\nJosh Earnest said before the event that Obama hoped the forum will spur a\n\"serious conversation\" about the Second Amendment as well as the\nadministration's new push to tighten gun control rules._The Associated Press\ncontributed to this report.___\n\n", "title" : "Obama defends gun control push at town hall, blames NRA for rising gun sales | Fox News", "twitter" : { "body" : "Obama defends gun control push at town hall, blames NRA for rising gun sales http://fxn.ws/1ZdMWbw pic.twitter.com/5djyyRXMDD", "link" : "https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/685321299854372864", "retweets" : 75, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-07T12:45:05.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 126, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "685321299854372864" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "FoxNews", "link" : "http://fxn.ws/1ZdMWbw" }

The gunman killed nine before killing himself. \"I've\ngot some very strong feelings about this, because when you talk to these\nfamilies, you are reminded that this could be happening to your child, or your\nmom, or your dad, or your relative, or your friend,\" Obama said at the end of\nhis visit.\"And so, we're going to have to come together as a country to see\nhow we can prevent these issues from taking place,\" he said.The Washington\nPost reported that the White House is considering executive action that would\ncompel background checks for \"individuals who buy from dealers who sell a\nsignificant number of guns each year.\" Dealers who exceed a certain number of\nsales each year would be required to obtain a license and perform background\nchecks, the Post reported.Current law says only those “engaged in the\nbusiness” of selling guns need to obtain a license and perform a background\ncheck. Exempted are those who make occasional sales, or who buy or sell guns\nas part of a personal collection or for a hobby.Obama himself had not ruled\nout the possibility of acting unilaterally on the issue, saying in his news\nconference after the shooting that he had asked his team to see what he could\ndo on his own to address gun violence. “In terms of what I can do, I've asked\nmy team, as I have in the past, to scrub what kinds of authorities do we have\nto enforce the laws that we have in place more effectively to keep guns out of\nthe hands of criminals.  Are there additional actions that we can take that\nmight prevent even a handful of these tragic deaths from taking place?” Obama\nsaid at the Oct. 1 news conference.The proposal to expand background checks\noriginally was part of a package of considerations mulled after the 2012\nshooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., but was rejected\nafter federal lawyers expressed concern that setting a numerical threshold\ncould be legally challenged, and ATF officials voiced objections that it would\nbe hard to enforce, the Post reported.On Monday, White House Press Secretary\nJosh Earnest refused to rule out executive action from the Oval Office on the\nissue – saying it was an “ongoing” effort on the part of the president’s\nteam.“And the fact is there are a lot of things that can be done that don't\nundermine the basic constitutional rights of law-abiding Americans,” Earnest\nsaid.Obama risks being outflanked on the issue by former secretary of state\nand 2016 Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton who this week\nannounced a number of gun control proposals, including overturning a law that\nprevents families of shooting victims from suing gun makers and using\nexecutive action to change the definition of who qualifies as a firearms\ndealer.**RELATED VIDEO: The truth about gun crime in America**Obama’s attempts\nto pass gun control measures through Congress previously have been\nunsuccessful, and in 2013 he announced 23 executive actions in the wake of the\nNewtown massacre. In his remarks after the Roseburg shooting, he called on the\nU.S. to turn gun control into a political issue.“And, of course, what’s also\nroutine is that somebody, somewhere, will comment and say, Obama politicized\nthis issue. Well, this is something we should politicize. It is relevant to\nour common life together, to the body politic,” Obama said.However, any gun\nproposals would likely see unified opposition among Republicans in Congress\nand GOP 2016 hopefuls. Republicans argue that mental health, not guns, are to\nblame for mass shootings and that White House proposals on the issue would\nviolate the Second Amendment and wouldn’t do much, if anything, to prevent\nmass shootings.\"Talk of gun control makes the liberals feel warm and fuzzy.\nHowever, the cold reality is that when you disarm the good guys you put them\nat the mercy of the bad guys. That’s what gun control does,\" Former Arkansas\nGov. Mike Huckabee said Friday in an opinion piece for FoxNews.com. The\npresident may face opposition to his gun control proposals even in the town of\nRoseburg when he visits Friday, although the White House has said that the\nvisit will be about comforting the victims, not about proposing new gun\nlaws.Staunchly conservative Douglas County is filled with gun owners who use\ntheir firearms for hunting, target shooting and self-protection. A commonly\nheld opinion in the area is that the solution to mass killings is more people\ncarrying guns, not fewer.\"The fact that the college didn't permit guards to\ncarry guns, there was no one there to stop this man,\" Craig Schlesinger,\npastor at the Garden Valley Church, told The Associated Press._The Associated\nPress contributed to this report.___\n\n", "title" : "Obama reportedly considering executive action on gun control | Fox News", "twitter" : { "body" : "Obama reportedly considering executive action on gun control http://fxn.ws/1Zlv5wG via @foxnewspolitics", "link" : "https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/652695319482798083", "retweets" : 156, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-10-09T14:01:05.000-0700" }, "mentions" : "@foxnewspolitics", "favs" : 108, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "652695319482798083" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "FoxNews", "link" : "http://fxn.ws/1Zlv5wG" }

Obama is traveling to Roseburg,\nOre., to meet with families of the victims of the Oct. 1, shooting at Umpqua\nCommunity College, as part of a four-day West Coast tour. President Obama’s\nunwelcome visit to Roseburg, Oregon Friday makes one thing clear: he is\nclearly more interested in politicizing the nine dead victims at Umpqua\nCommunity College than reducing violence in America. If the president truly\nwanted to solve the issue, he wouldn’t call for new gun restrictions, he’d\ninstead address the root cause of violence in America – sin and evil and the\nfamilies broken and torn apart because of it.President Obama’s hometown of\nChicago would actually be a perfect place to start. Despite restrictions on\nguns in Chicago, bullets spray like summertime sprinklers in Obama’s\nhometown.This year alone, there have been 2,300 shooting victims.  Obama’s\nfellow community organizers on the South Side live in a war zone, and the dots\nmarking crime spots on these neighborhood maps look like a decade-old\ndartboard. Local gang territories mirror school district maps, so teachers and\nparents protest redrawn school districts because it inevitably means open\nwarfare. On Sunday a man was shot to death and four others were wounded,\nincluding two 14-year-old teens, just a few miles from the President's Chicago\nhome. When it comes to advancing his liberal agenda, President Obama will\nexploit anything, even death and suffering.On weekend nights throughout the\nsummer, ambulances and emergency rooms staff-up to treat the inevitable\ncasualties. In the past two years, there have been 500 murders and more than\n5,000 shooting victims.  The South Side of Chicago would be a perfect place\nfor the president to condemn the root causes of this senseless violence – the\nevil and sin. That evil and sin has broken homes leaving children with no good\nrole models, devalued life and made people believe the lie that one life is\nmore important than another. President Obama should use the White House pulpit\nto confront this issue head on and crush our culture of violence that\nglorifies death and destruction. Lack of respect for life and the ever\nincreasing coarseness and crudeness in our culture contribute to a community\nof indifference, self-centeredness, and mayhem.  This evil infects\nneighborhoods, parks, and bus stops every day. Most of the victims are\nteenagers and young adults, but in the past decade, more than 90 children\nunder five have been killed in the crossfire.But instead of going to Chicago\nto address the real issue, Obama travels to Oregon to politicize last week’s\ncommunity college shooting and demand ineffective backwards gun-control\npolicies that empower criminals and terrorists at the expense of law-abiding\ncitizens.When it comes to advancing his liberal agenda, President Obama will\nexploit anything, even death and suffering.The Oregon shooting occurred in a\n“gun-free zone.”  It’s time we realize that “gun-free zones” are “sitting duck\nzones.” If existing gun laws did not prevent this massacre, there’s no reason\nto believe more restrictive laws will.  In fact, I keep asking liberals: ‘What\nlaw could we pass that would’ve prevented this?”  Liberals never have an\nanswer because there isn’t one and they know it.   Obama’s hometown has some\nof the toughest, strictest gun laws in America.  Prohibitions, bans,\nregistrations, confiscations, and mandates—Chicago has it all. And what has it\naccomplished to make the streets safer? Absolutely nothing. Chicago remains\none of the most dangerous and violence cities in America.  This real issue, at\nits core, demonstrates how conservatives differ from liberals whenever any\n“new” law is being discussed:  Liberals ask, “How does this law make me feel?”\nConservatives ask, “What does this law do?\" Talk of gun control makes the\nliberals feel warm and fuzzy.  However, the cold reality is that when you\ndisarm the good guys you put them at the mercy of the bad guys. That’s what\ngun control does.  The Second Amendment is the last line of defense against\nevil and tyranny and it must be protected.__Former Arkansas Governor Mike\nHuckabee is a 2016 Republican candidate for president of the United States.__  \n\\+ Follow**FoxNewsOpinion** on Facebook\n\n", "title" : "Why is Obama more eager to politicize victims in Oregon than reduce violence in America? | Fox News", "twitter" : { "body" : ". @GovMikeHuckabee shares his take on gun control and the liberal agenda. http://fxn.ws/1LFu8vg pic.twitter.com/OZ1oltvUqH", "link" : "https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/652853021525868544", "retweets" : 376, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-10-10T00:27:44.000-0700" }, "mentions" : "@GovMikeHuckabee", "favs" : 541, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "652853021525868544" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "FoxNews", "link" : "http://fxn.ws/1LFu8vg" }

Second Amendment groups are\naccusing the gun control lobby of putting law-abiding owners of firearms in\ndanger by urging people to call the police on anyone carrying a gun in\npublic.As more states relax rules about open-carrying of guns, the Coalition\nto Stop Gun Violence has taken to social media to urge the public to assume\ngun-toters are trouble, and to call the cops on anyone they feel may be a\nthreat.“If you see someone carrying a firearm in public—openly or\nconcealed—and have ANY doubts about their intent, call 911 immediately and ask\npolice to come to the scene,” the group wrote on its widely followed Facebook\npage. “Never put your safety, or the safety of your loved ones, at the mercy\nof weak gun laws that arm individuals in public with little or no criminal\nand/or mental health screening.”That approach, according to a blog post by\nOhio-based Buckeye Firearms Association, could give rise to needless, tense\nconfrontations between police and gun owners. The association and other\nsimilar groups liken the tactic to “swatting,” or the act of tricking an\nemergency service into dispatching responders based on a false report. Many\nonline harassment campaigns have been known to participate in the\npractice.“This practice is exactly what they [Coalition to Stop Gun Violence]\nare doing,” said Erich Pratt, spokesman for Virginia-based Gun Owners of\nAmerica. “It’s one thing if someone is using a gun in an illegal or unlawful\nmanner. No one is questioning that. But this clearly sounds like\nswatting.”“They are inciting their radical base to turn their own neighbors\nin.”- Erich Pratt, Gun Owners of America Pratt adds that it may be a move of\ndesperation by those looking to get guns off the streets.“Anti-gun advocates\nare clearly frustrated. They want guns banned,” he said. “But they have been\nthwarted in the past, so they are looking for alternative means.“They are\ninciting their radical base to turn their own neighbors in.”It is not the\nfirst time supporters of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence and other gun\ncontrol advocates have pressed for the public to call cops on legal gun\nowners. An October 2014 National Review article found that the Facebook pages\nand websites of groups including the coalition, Moms Demand Action and\nGunFreeZone.net included numerous comments from the public advocating that\npeople call the police and intentionally exaggerate what they see in the hopes\nof getting cops to stop those open-carrying guns.Open carry rules, in one form\nor another, are legal in every state except for five—California, Florida,\nIllinois, New York, and South Carolina, as well as the District of Columbia.\nHowever, many states that do permit open carry have put in place stringent\nlaws that require some sort of permit or license.In this august posting on\ntheir Facebook page, the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence urges the public to\ncall the cops on any legal open carry gun owner that they feel may be a\nthreat. (Buckeye Firearms Association) The main issue that gun advocates have\nwith the Coalition’s tactics is the potential of putting law-abiding citizens\nin real danger. Officials for the anti-gun group say that this is not the\ncase.“In an era in which individuals are being allowed to carry loaded guns on\nour streets with no permit, background check or required training, it is\ncommon sense for concerned citizens to call 911 when they see an armed\nindividual whose intentions are unclear,” Ladd Everitt, director of\ncommunications for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence said in a statement to\nFoxNews.com. “These [open carry] laws guarantee that we—and law\nenforcement—will have no idea about the criminal and/or mental health\nbackground of these individuals until they actually commit a crime; and by\nthen it could be far too late.  We have full confidence in our men and women\nin blue to assess these situations. “Gun-toters who are truly law-abiding and\nmentally competent have nothing whatsoever to worry about. Their conversations\nwith law enforcement will be brief and professional,” he added. “As for those\nwho are dangerous and have something to hide which would not withstand the\nscrutiny of a background check or permitting process, they should expect to\nface some tough questions as a result of these 911 calls. And that makes us\nall safer.”But the Buckeye Firearms Association believes the effort amounts to\n\"conspiring to obstruct legal justice.”Pratt agreed, and said people who call\nthe police without legitimate reason should be charged.“They would likely be\nthe ones arrested for filing a false report,” he said. “And we are certainly\nhoping that would be the case.”__Perry Chiaramonte is a reporter for\nFoxNews.com.

And his campaign does\nnot list fighting gun violence on his more than 20-position-long issue page on\nhis website.Sanders' aides did not respond to multiple requests about why his\ncampaign has not announced a \"comprehensive\" gun plan as promised.Gun control\nhas been a nagging issue for Sanders since he launched his campaign last year.\nWhile Sanders has appealed to the left of the party on campaign finance,\neducation and health care, guns are one issue that Hillary Clinton has\nsuccessfully used to hurt Sanders' liberal bona fides. That matters in a state\nlike South Carolina, where the Vermont senator still needs to grow his base of\nsupport.Clinton's campaign has hammered Sanders on gun control, telling voters\nthat while the Vermont senator talks about standing up to powerful interests,\nhe has failed to do that with the National Rifle Association and the gun\nlobby.Most notably, Sanders voted against barring the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention from studying gun violence in 1996 and voted against\nversions of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act five times from 1991 to\n1993. Sanders has called the Clinton attacks on guns \"very disingenuous.\"\"I\nhave a D-minus voting record from the NRA,\" Sanders said during a January\ndebate in South Carolina. \"I support what President Obama is doing in terms of\ntrying to close the gun show loopholes.\" Clinton has focused on the issue for\nmuch of her campaign, pledging to close a series of gun control loopholes and\nrevoke licenses from bad actor gun sellers.Sanders' most comprehensive\nstatement on guns came shortly before the January debate, when the senator\nreversed his position on a 2005 Senate vote that gave gun manufacturers\nimmunity from prosecution. As a member of the House of Representatives at the\ntime, Sanders voted in favor of that bill.\"I'm pleased that this legislation\nis being introduced,\" Sanders said of Sen. Richard Blumenthal and Rep. Adam\nSchiff's proposal to take away immunity from gun manufacturers when their\nproducts are used in crimes. \"As I have said for many months now, we need to\nlook at the underlying law and tighten it up.\" Sanders has declined to call\nthe 2005 vote a mistake a number of times, citing the fact that he worries\nabout the impact rescinding immunity would have on small, family-owned gun\nshops.In supporting the legislation, Sanders also said he would propose an\namendment to the bill that \"would require the Commerce Department to monitor\nand report on the law's impact in rural areas on the availability of hunting\nsupplies, including firearms, sold by non-negligent local gun stores.\"In the\nface of public pressure after mass shootings, Sanders said last year that \"the\nstatus quo clearly is not working and people on both sides of this issue\ncannot simply continue shouting at each other.\"But the Vermont senator has\ntempered his usual fire and bluntness when it comes to guns, stressing a more\ncautious approach to addressing mass shootings.\"If somebody has a gun and it\nfalls into the hands of a murderer and that murderer kills somebody with the\ngun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible?\" he asked at the Democratic\ndebate in Las Vegas in October. \"Not any more than you would hold a hammer\ncompany responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer.\nThat is not what a lawsuit should be about.\"\n\n", "title" : "Where is Bernie Sanders' gun control plan? - CNNPolitics.com", "twitter" : { "body" : "Where is @BernieSanders ' gun control plan? http://cnn.it/1SV6yxm pic.twitter.com/kJKVStTPpD", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CNN/status/700445546335621120", "retweets" : 131, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-18T06:23:26.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "@BernieSanders", "favs" : 174, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "700445546335621120" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "cnn", "link" : "http://cnn.it/1SV6yxm" }

Police said Friday that the three male suspects believed to be\nresponsible for the shooting had gang ties, and had fired upon on a group of\nschool kids celebrating the holidays. Zaevion was not only a football player,\nbut a mentor to his peers, Mayor Madeline Rogero told CNN affiliate WATE. The\nteen's coach, Rob Black, said that the sophomore was liked by teachers and\nstudents at Fulton High School. \"This is a fine, fine young man who is a\nsuccess story,\" he said. \"And I want to try to continue to celebrate the life\nthat he had here and the impact that he made on his peers,\" Black said. A\ncandlelight vigil was held Friday evening. Dozens came out to celebrate the\nteenager's life, some placing candles in the shape of the number 24, his\njersey number. Dobson's brother Zach shared the last moments he had with his\nbrother after the shooting. \"I found him on the porch and I picked him up and\nhe was laying in my hands dead,\" he told WATE.Friend Jaylin Posey said\nDobson's actions were heroic. \"It was good to know he was willing to protect\nothers, but then it was sad he had to give up his own life for it,\" he\nsaid.The girls were not injured, according to Knoxville police. One of the\nsuspects died from a gunshot wound late that evening, although not all the\ndetails are clear. Two others were arrested; the investigation is still\nongoing. There were three overnight shootings in Knoxville the evening of\nDobson's death. They may have been connected, according to police.Two girls\nspoke to CNN affiliate WVLT about the shooting. \"If it wasn't for Zaevion, if\nhe would have just ran off the porch, we would have probably been shot,\" Kiara\nRucker said.Faith Gordon said by the time the shooting was over she told the\nteen he could get up, but he didn't. \"So I just went upstairs, and by the time\nI came back to make sure everything was real, (I saw) he was shot in the\nhead,\" Gordon said.On Sunday, President Barack Obama focused on Dobson's\ndeath, tweeting from his @POTUS account: \"Zaevion Dobson died saving three\nfriends from getting shot. He was a hero at 15. What's our excuse for not\nacting?\" Dobson's brother said it was the teenager's dream to be a football\nplayer or a coach.

Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\nwas perhaps Obama's harshest critic, accusing the President of attempting to\ntake away Americans' guns. On Twitter, Cruz called Obama's actions -- which\ninclude expanding background checks on gun purchases and increasing funding\nfor mental health and law enforcement agencies that perform those background\nchecks -- \"unconstitutional.\"In an image included in the tweet, Obama was\nportrayed wearing a crown, alongside the message: \"Gun control is government\ncontrol.\"It linked to a Cruz campaign website featuring Obama dressed in\nmilitary-style garb, next to the headline, \"Obama wants your guns.\"Donald\nTrump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"The\nLead\" that Obama is \"making an end-run around the Constitution, trying to go\ndirectly to executive order and restrict one of the basic, fundamental\nprinciples of our country.\" And Trump himself responded during a rally Tuesday\nevening, \"Look the Second Amendment is so important. It's so\nimportant.\"\"They're not going to take your guns away, folks. They're trying,\"\nhe said.Florida Sen. Marco Rubio tweeted a link to an appearance on Fox News\nin which he characterized Obama's moves as \"just one more way to make it\nharder for law-abiding people to buy weapons or to be able to protect their\nfamilies. It's going to do nothing to prevent violence or crimes.\" Former\nFlorida Gov. Jeb Bush, meanwhile, tweeted a link to his op-ed in an Iowa\nnewspaper in which he said Obama's actions trample on the Second Amendment.\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson tweeted: \"The President's actions have\neverything to do with advancing his political agenda &amp; little to do with\nactually protecting American citizens.\" And former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee\nused Obama's speech to push for restrictions on abortion -- saying that\nObama's case for saving lives should apply to that issue as well. Democratic\npresidential front-runner Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, vowed in New Hampshire\non Tuesday that she will \"take on that fight\" and continue Obama's gun control\npush if she's elected.On Twitter, in a tweet signed \"-H\" to indicate it was\nwritten by Clinton, rather than her staff, the former secretary of state\nthanked Obama \"for taking a crucial step forward on gun violence. Our next\nPresident has to build on that progress—not rip it away.\" And her campaign\nhighlighted Republican candidates' criticism of Obama's comments on its\nwebsite, warning that a GOP president would undo Obama's actions.Vermont Sen.\nBernie Sanders said in a statement that he, too, would keep Obama's actions in\nplace if he's elected. \"It's become clear that no mass shooting, no matter how\nbig or bloody, will inspire Republicans to put children and innocent Americans\nover the interests of the NRA. They are simply more loyal to gun lobbyists\nthan our children. That's why I support President Obama's executive actions to\nmake our communities safer,\" Sanders said. And former Maryland Gov. Martin\nO'Malley vowed to build on Obama's actions. \"As President, I will build on\nPresident Obama's progress by taking further executive actions to reform our\ngun laws. These include using the purchasing power of our federal government\n-- the biggest customer gun companies have -- to advance gun safety, banning\n'cop killer' ammunition, declaring blanket immunity for gun dealers and\nmanufacturers unconstitutional, and ceasing to defend the federal immunity\nlaw,\" he said in a statement.\n\n", "title" : "GOP 2016 candidates bash Obama's gun control push - CNNPolitics.com", "twitter" : { "body" : "GOP 2016 candidates bash @POTUS 's gun control push http://cnn.it/1ZMJMIA pic.twitter.com/Kiafad2QX1", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CNN/status/684510188804673537", "retweets" : 147, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-05T07:02:01.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "@POTUS", "favs" : 232, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "684510188804673537" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "cnn", "link" : "http://cnn.it/1ZMJMIA" }

The opinions expressed in this\ncommentary are hers. (CNN)Many of us taking part in the CNN town hall on guns\nhave been touched by someone who chose to do evil. I am sharing my thoughts\nwith you because I feel I can relate to people on both sides of the issue of\ngun control. I have been afraid of guns, I have sworn I would never use a gun\non another person and so did not need one, and I have wanted to deny the\nexistence of evil. I have also become a gun owner, am prepared to defend\nmyself with a firearm, and understand the fear of my freedoms being taken\naway. I have been touched by extreme violence and I have been robbed of the\nlife I always wanted by someone who chose to do evil. Because I have felt, and\nlived, all of these things, I have spent much time thinking about evil,\nfreedom and not only the world we live in, but the country too. There are many\nfacts and statistics people will use to argue both sides of the gun control\nissue. We can use other countries as examples and we can use crime rates of\ncities, states and countries. And no matter how thoroughly researched the\nstatistics are, people have an emotional reaction to this issue that almost\nalways overrides the statistics presented, other than this one: The violent\ncrime rate in the United States has gone down substantially in the last 20\nyears. Our fears, though, have gone up, because of the high-profile incidents\nof mass killings of people caught unaware. Killers have taken lives in\nchurches, schools, hospitals, government buildings, the site of a marathon,\nthe Twin Towers and even a part of a military base where soldiers were known\nto be unarmed. These killings highlight the fact that any of us, and any of\nour loved ones, are vulnerable when caught with our guard down against another\nperson who desires to do harm.Does it matter what weapon they used? If it was\na rifle, a pipe bomb, a truck of fertilizer, a pressure cooker or a plane --\nthe end result is the same. Yet millions of other people have the freedom to\nhave those very same things and will never use them to kill. These horrific\nmass killings were committed by a _very_ small number of people who wish to\nharm and kill others. When they do it, we flock to the scene and ask \"Why?\"\nWho are these people who choose to do harm? What is their story? What went\nwrong? What are they trying to tell us? Ultimately, in our horror, we give\nthem a voice they would never have had otherwise. Is our insatiable need to\nknow and find out how their lives might have gone wrong part of the result\nthey are looking for? Is that part of the reason there is an incentive to do\nsuch harm to innocent people? We know it isn't the availability of the weapon,\nbecause they used different methods, different weapons. We can't legislate\nhuman nature. If we add up the number of these mass killers over the last\ndecade, how many people are we talking about? Fewer than 40 over the last\ndecade? Do we want to make laws for millions based on the choices of fewer\nthan 40 evildoers? Can we fix these people? Can we legislate out of them the\ndesire to kill? Those in the business of fighting crime and analyzing mental\nillness can look into the lives of each of these killers and tell you the red\nflags that popped up before the massacre. Why don't we deal with that instead\nof banning the tools very few use? By the very nature of these crimes, we know\nthat evildoers don't care about the laws. After all, murder is against the\nlaw, and they are choosing to ignore the law from the moment they plan to harm\npeople. Beyond that, who among us has the right to tell me I will murder\nsomeone because I have a gun? And who can tell me that I can only defend and\nprotect myself in a way they feel comfortable with? Just having access to a\ndeadly weapon doesn't turn someone into a killer. Have you ever felt road\nrage? Many of us who have cars have felt some form of extreme anger at other\ndrivers because we feel they have put us in harm's way. We might even envision\nramming their cars or cutting them off in return, but do we actually do it?\nNo, because the overwhelming majority of us never want to take another human\nlife. Even special ops guys, military and police who are trained to kill for\nlegitimate purposes, who are familiar with multiple weapons and have access to\nthe weapons and ammunition -- even these people, who are experienced, will\ntell you they never know if they can pull the trigger until placed in a\nposition to use deadly force to protect another person. My government has\nproven that it's not able to protect me against people who want to kill. And I\ndon't blame the government, because there is only one person to blame here:\nThe man or woman who decided to kill. If you put an assault rifle in my hands\nor yours, I am not going to murder anyone, and I am guessing you won't either.\nBut what makes gun control advocates think that someone who decides to kill\nwill not use any means necessary to do so?The person who killed my husband,\nChris, worked in an armory with daily access to every caliber of high powered\nweapon for years. He chose to kill when he got out of an environment of\naccountability and drug testing. Simply having a weapon did not make him a\nmurderer. His life choices did. What red flags did he display? Well, the\nprominence he got after he took the lives of Chris and Chad Littlefield\nresulted in many people hearing his claim of post-traumatic stress disorder.\nAnd yet, psychiatrists on both the prosecution and defense testified he did\nnot have PTSD. He was however a known drug user. Based on testimony at his\ntrial, people around him not only tolerated but sometimes participated in the\ndrug use and enabled him by seeing him as the \"victim.\" He repeatedly got out\nof trouble by claiming PTSD. The officers would take him at his word, deliver\nhim to a mental health facility where the facility would write a diagnosis\nwhich is known in that community as a label for likely drug use, and they\nwould release him. Because of the HIPAA law and our desire to protect\neveryone's privacy, we allow bad behavior to slip through the cracks. Imagine\nhow different things would be if a mental health facility could tell police,\n\"This is a drug user,\" and the police could go track him for drugs and put him\nin jail for breaking those laws instead of waiting for worse crimes in the\nfuture. In the state of Texas, there is a fairly new certification process for\nour police where officers are trained to notice and recognize mental health\nissues and have knowledge of the drugs people take and the effects of them. So\nhow they intervene is different based on whether they believe there is a\nmental health issue vs. a drug issue. Wouldn't it be a better use of our time\nto work through this issue? It gives police a different crisis intervention\nmethod. Some advocates want to restrict certain kinds of guns -- perhaps\nallowing a pistol but not an assault rifle. To those who don't know guns well,\nthe term \"assault rifle\" brings to mind either a sniper's gun or a fully\nautomatic weapon we have seen in the movies, meant to mow down large numbers\nof people. In actuality, fully automatic weapons are already highly restricted\nand require an additional license most gun owners will never have. The lack of\nunderstanding makes it easy to develop rhetoric and legislation that will calm\nthe fears of people who don't understand a given subject, but that doesn't\nreally change any end result because we cannot legislate the evil side of\nhumanity.Cars are tools that is involved in about as many deaths as guns. If\nyou are a driver prone to drinking and driving, should we only allow you to\ndrive an ultracompact car? Not an SUV which could kill more people? No, we\ntake away the drunk driver's access to legally drive any car. This is about\nfreedom to do as you like until you prove incapable of showing good moral\njudgment. In this country, we give freedom and take it away once you prove to\nbe unworthy of the freedom we have given you. Nobody suggests taking away cars\nor going through a battery of tests to determine whether or not you might be a\ndrunk driver one day.Does every man commit rape? There is a human element here\nthat is real and we cannot legislate. Would we take away the freedom of all\nmen by castration because some cannot handle what they have? No, we allow\nfreedom until an individual chooses to take something that others use for good\nand use it to do harm to another. Are our current laws being enforced? Are\nfelons and known drug users really put in jail when arrested for a lesser\ncrime and known to have a gun? In most situations, no, because police have\nmore pressing issues than to incarcerate a felon for having a gun that he or\nshe hasn't used in a crime. We have plenty of laws on the books that we cannot\nor do not enforce. Let's start enforcing what we have before creating new\nlaws.Understandably, we want a solution to ensure that we and our loved ones\nwill never be in the situation of being caught unaware by someone who chose to\ndo evil. Mass killers have targeted churches, businesses, movie theaters,\nschools and hospitals, but they could as easily take their violence to a place\nwhere people are armed. Yet they do not. Even at Fort Hood, the killer chose a\nplace on the base where he knew soldiers would be unarmed. What does that tell\nus? That evil targets those who are unprepared for the evil to strike. When\nChris and I were looking into our personal security after the book \"American\nSniper\" came out, we took measures and thought of different scenarios, and\nChris told me that still, based on his experience, \"Babe, if someone wants to\nkill me, they will.\" Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan were\narguably some of the best-protected men in our country. Did it stop someone\nfrom shooting them? As Reagan once said, \"You won't get gun control by\ndisarming law-abiding citizens. There is only one way to get real gun control:\nDisarm the thugs and criminals, lock them up and if you don't actually throw\naway the key, lose it for a long time.\"And what we need to do is find the\ncourage to accept that from the dawn of time until the day man no longer walks\nthe earth, evil will find a way. Murder is nothing new, it is not going away\nand it is not dependent on one method of killing or another. We can forge\nahead knowing that while evil is among us, it involves the few. The good,\nresponsible people are the vast majority. We can trust each other with basic\nfreedoms until one of us proves to be untrustworthy by maliciously,\nintentionally harming another of us. If you have never owned a weapon, or have\nnever known the masses of peaceful gun owners who love their families and are\nin nurturing professions such as counseling, nursing, social work and pastoral\njobs, may I suggest you talk to them about why they cherish their freedom to\nhave these weapons? We have slipped into a land of government that has\npromised the moon, seldom delivered and driven us into a world of more laws,\nmore government, and less freedom -- and none of that has stopped murder, pain\nand suffering. No government can provide the utopia many seek. My hope for\nthis country is that we remain a people who value freedom, who have the\ncourage to face the realities with faithful hearts instead of anxious ones. I\nhope our people hold tight to the notion that we do not have to be a fear-\nridden country focused on restrictions, but rather that we remain the land of\nthe free and home of the brave.God bless you and thank you for giving me some\nof your time._Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.__  \nRead CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine._\n\n", "title" : "'American Sniper' widow: Gun control won't protect us - CNN.com", "twitter" : { "body" : "'American Sniper' widow, Taya Kyle, says gun control won't protect us http://cnn.it/1PQhcTE pic.twitter.com/O5fNERP9aF", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CNN/status/685131747151986689", "retweets" : 317, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-07T00:11:52.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 572, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "685131747151986689" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "cnn", "link" : "http://cnn.it/1PQhcTE" }

Bernie Sanders as she suddenly faces the\nthreat of losing the first two early-voting states next month.Two polls\nreleased Tuesday find Sanders with leads in both Iowa and New Hampshire, a\nsurge that has Clinton aides worried.Clinton compared her stance with Sanders\non guns, health care and Wall Street. Since the first Democratic debate in\nOctober, Clinton has used different issues to knock Sanders. But on Tuesday,\nher speech was different, with more sustained and focused knocks on the\nunlikely front-runner in Iowa and New Hampshire.Clinton hit Sanders for\nbragging about standing up to special interests, but siding with the National\nRifle Association on certain legislation. If Sanders is to tout his\nwillingness to stand up to special interests, Clinton said at her events that\nSanders should \"stand up to the most powerful special interest, stand up to\nthat gun lobby.\"Clinton then turned to Wall Street, an issue Sanders has tried\nto use against Clinton by casting her as too close with the nation's biggest\nbanks. \"Don't talk to me about standing up to corporate interests and big\npowers,\" Clinton said to Sanders. \"I've got the scars to show for it and I am\nproud of every single one of them.\" Clinton is in a strong position in many of\nthe states that hold primaries later in the nominating contest. But a loss in\nthe Iowa caucuses on February 1 will revive memories of Clinton's third-place\nfinish there in 2008, which ultimately doomed her first presidential bid. New\nHampshire, which rewarded Clinton in 2008 and her husband, Bill, in 1992, is\neven tougher for her this year since she's up against a popular senator from\nneighboring Vermont.Adding to Clinton's troubles is an interview Vice\nPresident Joe Biden gave CNN on Monday in which he praised Sanders and\nsuggested the former secretary of state was new to addressing income\ninequality.\"It's relatively new for Hillary to talk about that,\" Biden told\nCNN's Gloria Borger, saying that Clinton has \"come forward with some really\nthoughtful approaches to deal with the issue\" of income inequality.In response\nto the tightening race, Clinton is dispatching two of her best-known\nsurrogates -- husband Bill and daughter Chelsea Clinton -- onto the campaign\ntrail. Bill Clinton has already visited New Hampshire and Iowa and will return\nto the Granite State on Wednesday; Chelsea Clinton was there Tuesday. The\nformer first daughter even went after Sanders in the Granite State, charging\nthat his healthcare plan would give too much power to Republican governors.\"I\ndon't want to live in a country with unequal health insurance,\" Chelsea\nClinton said. \"I don't want to empower Republican governors. And I think that\nis what Senator Sanders wants to do.\"At her event here on Tuesday, Hillary\nClinton zeroed in on Sanders' proposal to pass a single-payer health care plan\nwithout raising taxes on the middle class.\"There is no way that can be paid\nfor without raising taxes on the middle class, the arithmetic just doesn't add\nup,\" she said.All of this culminated in Clinton using Sanders' oft used line\n-- that he is taking launching a political revolution - against him.\"If that\nis the kind of revolution he is talking about, I am worried folks,\" she said\nto applause.The reason behind the focus on Sanders is two-fold: The Iowa\ncaucuses are less than a month a way and many voters in the audience said they\nwere attending the event to make up their mind, a fact Clinton acknowledged\nfrom the stage.But they are also because Clinton and he aides see the race\ntightening.A new Quinnipiac University poll released Tuesday shows that\nSanders is now the front-runner in Iowa -- with 49% support to Clinton's 44%\nand former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley's 4%. Clinton aides have long said\nthey expected the race to tighten but there is concern inside Clinton's\ncampaign that Sanders is catching fire in the important weeks leading up to\nthe caucuses.The near total focus on Sanders is new for Clinton, a candidate\nwho spent the early months of the campaign avoiding even mentioning Sanders'\nname.Tuesday's event, where Clinton also accepted the endorsement of the Brady\nCampaign to Prevent Gun Violence, amplified a trend of Clinton attacks that\nSanders said at the Iowa Brown and Black Forum on Monday night that he's\nnoticed. \"It could be that the inevitable candidate for the Democratic\nnomination may not be so inevitable today,\" he said. That Sanders now has a\nshot at winning the first two states in the Democratic nominating process is\nin part a reflection of their makeup: Iowa and New Hampshire are whiter and\nmore liberal than the broader party electorate. The bigger test would come as\nthe campaign shifts to Nevada and South Carolina -- where Democrats will have\ntheir last debate Sunday night in Charleston before the voting begins in Iowa\non February 1. She is also campaigning with high-profile surrogates --\nincluding the heads of Planned Parenthood and the Brady Campaign, highlighting\nher support on women's health issues and gun control, as well as\nTransportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, who underscores Clinton's ties to\nPresident Barack Obama's administration. Sanders aides attribute some of their\nlead in Iowa to the fact that although the Vermont senator went on air with\nhis first ad last in 2015, he is currently airing more ads in the state than\nClinton, according to CMAG/Kantar Media. Clinton aides believe that count is\nslightly misleading, largely because it does not include cable ads, which\nClinton has invested heavily on. What's more, Clinton aides are confident that\ntheir concentrated ads in Cedar Rapids and the Quad Cities area of Iowa will\npay off more than Sanders' ads in areas Sioux City and Omaha, more\nconservative areas of the state.\n\n", "title" : "Clinton attacks as polls show Sanders winning in Iowa - CNNPolitics.com", "twitter" : { "body" : ". @HillaryClinton slams @BernieSanders for his stance on gun control http://cnn.it/1TTybE0 #HillaryOnCNN http://cnn.it/1Q3CVb1", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CNN/status/687069965753671680", "retweets" : 74, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-12T08:33:39.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "@HillaryClinton @BernieSanders", "favs" : 135, "hashtags" : "#HillaryOnCNN", "id" : "687069965753671680" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "cnn", "link" : "http://cnn.it/1TTybE0" }

Many of those sellers, Obama said, are\nrunning a business by selling guns at gun shows and online.\"The problem is\nthat some gun sellers have been operating by a different set of rules,\" he\nsaid. \"That doesn't make sense.\"Obama said the administration is also beefing\nup enforcement, streamlining the background check system, investing $500\nmillion in mental health care and researching \"smart gun\" technology.\"If a\nchild can't open a bottle of aspirin, we should make sure they can’t pull a\ntrigger on a gun,\" he said.Obama said the actions he's taking are consistent\nwith gun rights.\"I believe in the Second Amendment. It’s there written on\npaper. It guarantees the right to bear arms. No matter how much people try to\ntwist my words around, I taught constitutional law. I know a little bit about\nthis. I get it,\" he said. \"This is not a plot to take away everybody's\nguns.\"But Obama argued that just like the First Amendment doesn't allow\nsomeone to yell \"fire\" in a crowded theater, there are common-sense measures\nthat could keep guns out out of the hands of people who shouldn't have them.\nAnd he argued that Second Amendment rights shouldn't infringe on the rights of\npeople to safely worship in Christian churches, Jewish synagogues, Sikh\ntemples and Muslim mosques — all of which have been targets of gun violence in\nrecent years. \"They had rights, too,\" he said.Congressional Republicans had a\nmixed reaction to Obama's announcemen**t**. “The president’s actions are out\nof bounds and vastly exceed his executive authority,\" said House Oversight\nCommittee Chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, who promised vigorous oversight\nhearings. But House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called the\nadditional guidance on firearms licenses a \"weak gesture\" that falls short of\nwhat Obama really wanted to accomplish. Obama called on Americans to \"demand a\nCongress brave enough to stand up to the gun lobby's lies.\"\"Instead of\nfocusing on how to solve the problem, this has become one of out most\npolarized, partisan debates,\" Obama said a tone that moved from exasperation\nto incredulity. \"How did we get here?

The organization's\nInstitute for Legislative Action (ILA) says studies show that people sent to\nstate prison because of crimes involving firearms typically get the weapons\nthrough theft, the black market or family and friends.\"Facts tell us that\ncriminalizing private transfers of firearms among family members and friends\nunder a universal background check system would do nothing to prevent 'gun\nviolence,' and importantly, would not have prevented the profound tragedies\nthat gun banners use to promote such a system,\" the ILA said. \"Perpetrators of\nthose acts either successfully passed background checks to get the guns or\nthey stole the guns.\"The group adds that many purchases of firearms by\ncriminals are carried out by straw purchasers who pass background checks. \"No\namount of background checks can stop these criminals,\" says the group's\nwebsite.Obama has often spoken out about gun violence, particularly after such\nmass killings at the Sandy Hook school shootings in Newtown, Conn., in 2012\nthat left 26 people dead, and the fatal shooting of nine people at a black\nchurch in Charleston last summer.\"Last month, we remembered the third\nanniversary of Newtown,” Obama said in his radio address, referencing the\nmassacre that he has called the worst day of his presidency. \"This Friday,\nI’ll be thinking about my friend Gabby Giffords, five years into her recovery\nfrom the shooting in Tucson. And all across America, survivors of gun violence\nand those who lost a child, a parent, a spouse to gun violence are forced to\nmark such awful anniversaries every single day.”He notes that a bipartisan\nbill from three years ago requiring background checks for virtually everyone\nhad huge support, including among a majority of NRA households. But the Senate\nblocked it. Since then, he said, tens of thousands of Americans have died as a\nresult of gun violence.\"Each time, we're told that commonsense reforms like\nbackground checks might not have stopped the last massacre, or the one before\nthat, so we shouldn't do anything,\" he said. \"We know that we can't stop every\nact of violence.

That's stoking demand for guns\nby anyone who might want one and now fears they will get harder to\nobtain.Shares of three publicly traded stocks with the heaviest concentration\non firearms --  Sturm, Ruger (RGR), Smith &amp; Wesson (SWHC) and ammo maker\nVista Outdoor (VSTO) --  have jumped 70% on average this year as investors\nthink already-strong demand for guns could continue to increase as buyers rush\nto buy more.The gun companies' share growth has surpassed the 0.9% gain by the\nStandard &amp; Poor's 500 this year.Just Monday, their shares rose an average\nof of 5.2% as the broad market fell.That comes one day after New York City\nMayor Bill de Blasio put out a statement that advocated for the stop of \"the\nflow of both public pension funds and private U.S. dollars into the hands of\ngun manufacturers who make and market the assault weapons used by terrorists,\ncriminals and the mentally ill.\"Investors are betting consumers afraid of new\ngun rules will load up now for fear that new, more restrictive rules will be\npassed.\"The increased call for firearms laws, restrictions and regulations\nleads to the increased demand,\" for firearms, says  Brian Ruttenbur, analyst\nat BB&amp;T.Firearms sales are up 4.7% this year compared with the same period\nin 2014, Ruttenbur says, citing data from National Instant Criminal Background\nCheck System for consumer background gun checks.More Americans had their\nbackgrounds checked purchasing guns on Black Friday than any day on record,\naccording to data released by the FBI. The criminal background system\nprocessed 185,345 requests on Nov. 27, one of the largest retail sales days in\nthe country.Background checks for handguns are up 12.3% this year compared\nwith the same period last year, Ruttenbur says. The majority of both Smith\n&amp; Wesson and Sturm, Ruger's business come from handguns, he says.The surge\nin demand this year is largely the result of 2014 being a soft year for gun\nsales. Gun sales weakened in 2014 following a massive jump in demand in 2013.\nThe Dec. 2012 mass shooting at the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown,\nConn. sparked a rush to arm up ahead of new gun control rules, which never\nmaterialized.\"Surges in firearms sales are driven by the perceived threat of\ngovernmental restrictions and regulations on firearms,\" Ruttenbur says.Smith\n&amp; Wesson and Sturm, Ruger are up 116% and 66% this year, respectively.\nThese companies have been direct beneficiaries from exceptionally strong\nhandgun demand.Analysts are especially bullish on demand for Smith &amp;\nWesson firearms. The company's revenue is expected to hit $613.7 million this\ncalendar year, up 13% from last year, says S&amp;P Capital IQ. Analysts are\ncalling for revenue at Sturm, Ruger to drop 2.1% this calendar year, but\nbounce back 5.8% in calendar year 2016 to $563.7 million.That's not to say\nmaking money on gun-related stocks is a certainty. Shares of Olin (OLN), which\nhas a number of chemicals businesses in addition to its Winchester gun unit,\nare down 16% this year. Cabela's (CAB), a retailer of a variety of outdoor\ngear, including guns, has seen its shares slide nearly 14%.Additionally, much\nof the money for gun-stock investors has already been made by investors who\njumped in before events in California. For instance, Sturm, Ruger shares have\nbeen so strong that at $57.50 they've already blasted past the $53 price\ntarget investors have for the stock in 18 months.But no matter what, news\nrelated to the shootings only stokes a recovery in demand that was already\noccurring. \"We continue to believe that the firearms industry is in the\ninitial stages of a recovery in demand,\" Ruttenbur says._Contributing: Nick\nPenzenstadler_\n\n", "title" : "Firearm stocks jump amid gun control talk", "twitter" : { "body" : "Once again, firearm stocks jump amid gun control talk. http://usat.ly/1IRdPFa", "link" : "https://twitter.com/USATODAY/status/674160263260676096", "retweets" : 21, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-12-07T17:35:06.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 33, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "674160263260676096" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "usatoday", "link" : "http://usat.ly/1IRdPFa" }

Jerry Brown dusted off his rarely used campaign email account to send\nsupporters a copy of his State of the State address not long after delivering\nthe speech. The email had the subject line \"California: The Great Exception\"\nand included a prominent link to a video promoting the Sacramento-San Joaquin\nDelta tunnels project, which would replumb the state's water hub.\"One of the\nkey points is the need for a reliable system for moving water in California,\"\nreads the email's introduction, before directing viewers to a \"cool video\" on\nthe plan. The twin tunnels — a legacy project for the governor — were notably\nnot mentioned in his address.  \nSpecial interest groups will have to disclose many more details of how they\nare spending money to influence California officials under new rules approved\nThursday by the state’s ethics panel.Currently, corporations, labor unions and\nother groups must report the money they pay directly to lobbyists, along with\nthe identity of the advocate.But the rest of the cash they spend on\nconsultants, television and radio campaigns, public affairs and mail is\nreported as a lump sum in a category called \"other payments to influence,\"\nwithout any explanation.“The amount of money that is being spent in the dark\nis extremely compelling,” said state Fair Political Practices Commission\nmember Eric Casher.The panel on Thursday voted to require, starting in July,\nthat lobbying firms report details of any payment to influence of $2,500 per\ncalendar quarter, including money spent on mailers, TV ads and polls.“In order\nto make sure people are playing by the rules, we need this type of\ninformation,” said Jodi Remke, chairwoman of the panel. “It puts a light on\nwhat is going on.”The newly disclosed information will include the name and\nbusiness address of the payee, the amount paid and the primary purpose of the\npayment. Purposes will be disclosed by codes broadly designating activities\nthat include:--Payments for public affairs, which includes coalition building,\ngrass-roots campaigns,, news releases, media campaigns, literature and\nmailings.--Polling and public opinion research:--Lobbying events, including\nrallies or hearings to influence legislative or administrative action.--\nAdvertising spending, including billboards, print, radio, television, text,\nemail and other electronic communication.--Money paid to lobbyists and\nconsultants for researching, analyzing or drafting legislation, and\nrecommending strategy on pending bills and administrative proposals.Remke said\nthe new rules may reveal which former legislators are working behind the\nscenes to help clients without registering as lobbyists because they don’t\nmeet thresholds for payments received to directly communicate with elected\nofficials.Remke made reference, without using names, to former state Sen.\nMichael Rubio (D-Bakersfield) and former state Assemblyman Henry Perea\n(D-Fresno), who resigned from the Legislature to go to work in the government\naffairs offices of Chevron and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers\nof America, respectively. “I think we are going to get [disclosure of] the\npeople like the former members who leave the Legislature early, join Chevron,\njoin the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers, but call themselves\ngovernment relations advocates,” Remke said. “But we know what they are doing.\nThey are exposing their clients to the [legislative] members and doing other\nthings short of direct communication.”\"Water goes to the heart of what\nCalifornia is and what it has been over centuries,\" Gov.

It's Sunday, Jan. 10, and here's what we're talking about:I've seen\nthings and I've watched things.  \nRead moreHillary Clinton's new television ad does not mention any of her\nchallengers for the Democratic presidential nomination. Instead, the focus of\nthe 30-second spot, titled \"Incredible,\" is on Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and\nother Republican presidential hopefuls. From GOP calls to repeal the\nAffordable Care Act to defunding Planned Parenthood, the ad touts Clinton as\nthe best candidate to take on Republicans. Despite Clinton's strong lead\nnationally for the Democratic presidential nomination, she does trail Vermont\nSen. Bernie Sanders in the early nominating state of New Hampshire. In recent\nweeks, she has hammered Sanders on gun-control, but on the campaign trail her\nfocus has mostly centered on Republicans.  The three candidates for the\nDemocratic presidential nomination don't disagree on much - except, perhaps,\non gun control.Hillary Clinton, the front runner, has sought to showcase a\nclear difference with Bernie Sanders, her chief rival in the party’s 2016\nprimary. In debates and at town hall-style events, the former secretary of\nState has assailed the senator from Vermont for his vote in favor of a 2005\nlaw giving gun manufacturers and dealers immunity from product liability\nlawsuits. It’s a proposal that then-Sen. Clinton did not support.“I think he\nhas been consistently confusing to say that he would vote to repeal this\nabsolute immunity from any kind of responsibility or liability,” she said\nSunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation.”The Dec. 2 massacre in San Bernardino and\nother recent mass shootings have brought gun violence back into the public\nspotlight, and renewed the debate over whether federal gun laws should be\nstrengthened.In a tearful speech at the White House last week, President Obama\nannounced an executive action that calls for law enforcement officials to\nessentially warn private gun sellers that they may be vulnerable to\nprosecution if they don’t conduct background checks on gun buyers.National\npolls have repeatedly shown that Americans support background checks on gun\nsales to help weed out felons and the mentally ill.Sanders has said his vote\non the 2005 measure was “complicated” and has said he’s open to revisiting the\nissue.“If you have a small gun shop owner in northern Vermont who sells a gun\nlegally to somebody and then, you know, something happens to that guy, he goes\nnuts or something, and he kills somebody, should the gun shop owner be held\nliable? I think not,” he said on ABC’s “This Week.”But if a manufacturer is\nsending guns “into an area and really knows that those guns are not being used\nor bought by the people in that area … should we hold that manufacturer\nliable? Absolutely,” he added. On Sunday, seeking to bolster her standing\namong gun-control supporters, Clinton announced the endorsement of former Rep.\nGabby Giffords of Arizona. Giffords was injured in a 2011 shooting outside a\nTucson grocery store and ever since the incident she has been a staunch\nadvocate of stricter gun-control reforms. \"Most of the people running for\npresident talk a lot about how tough they are,\" Giffords wrote in her\nendorsement of Clinton. \"But most of them have shown they aren’t tough enough\nto stand up to the gun lobbyists.\"  \n_**UPDATE: 4:05 p.m. **This post was updated with information about Gabby\nGiffords' endorsement of Clinton. _The 2016 presidential contest kicks off on\nFeb.1 with Iowa caucuses and polls seem to be released almost daily in the\nrace for the White House.On Sunday, a new NBC News/Marist poll was released of\nIowa and New Hampshire voters. Here are some highlights from the polls.\n**Republican side - Iowa: **Ted Cruz - **28%**Donald Trump - **24%**Marco\nRubio - **13%**The Iowa poll of likely Republican caucus-goers has a margin of\nerror of plus or minus 4.6 percentage points. **Democratic side - New\nHampshire: **Bernie Sanders - **50%**Hillary Clinton - **46%**The New\nHampshire poll of likely Democratic primary voters has a margin of error of\nplus or minus 4.8 percentage points.  \nRead more Donald Trump is trailing in Iowa with about three weeks until GOP\ncaucus-goers cast the first ballots of 2016, but should he falter in the state\nthe billionaire businessman has no plans to exit the race for the Republican\npresidential nomination. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz recently surpassed Trump in\nseveral Hawkeye State polls after making significant inroads with evangelical\nvoters – a large and influential voting bloc in the state’s GOP caucuses. When\nasked Sunday if he would quit the race should he lose on Feb. 1 in Iowa, Trump\nwas direct. “I'm not leaving. No, I'm not leaving,\" Trump said on NBC’s “Meet\nthe Press.” \"...There's no maybes. I'm not leaving.”  \nIn an interview that touched on President Obama's recent actions on\nenforcement of gun laws, and North Korea's unconfirmed claim to have tested a\nhydrogen bomb, Trump again questioned if Cruz is eligible to become president\nbecause he was born in CanadaThe Constitution requires presidents to be\n“natural-born citizens.” Cruz and most legal scholars argue that he is not\ndisqualified for the presidency because his mother was an American citizen,\nand children of U.S. citizens born abroad are automatically granted\ncitizenship. Trump didn't back down, however. “From Ted's standpoint and from\nthe party's standpoint, he has to solve this problem,\" Trump said. \"Because\nthe Democrats will sue him if he's the nominee.\"Appearing on CNN, Cruz argued\nthat Trump is only pushing the issue because Trump is in danger of losing.\n“Three weeks ago, almost every Republican candidate was attacking Donald\nTrump,\" he said. \"Today, almost every Republican candidate is attacking me.\nAnd that kind of suggests maybe something has changed in the race.\" They can\nsay whatever they want. More power to them. I think it's a deadend, blind\nalley for them, but let them go.  Donald Trump launched his TV advertising\njust after New Year's with his familiar swagger: He was so far ahead in the\npolls that it might be a waste, he said, but he felt guilty for not spending\nhis money.The reality was more sobering.After six months of branding opponents\nand critics as losers, Trump faces the threat of becoming one himself in Iowa,\nthe first state to hold a Republican presidential nominating contest. The ads\nare a crucial part of Trump's strategy to keep Ted Cruz from beating him in\nthe Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1.Cruz's appeals to evangelicals, tea party\nfollowers and other conservatives have made the Texas senator the current\nfavorite in Iowa, though the New York billionaire remains a solid front-runner\nin the rest of the country.Cruz's surge in Iowa is jeopardizing Trump's quest\nto \"run the table\" by winning every GOP primary and caucus nationwide.Read\nmore\n\n", "title" : "If Donald Trump loses Iowa, he's not backing down - LA Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Hillary Clinton continues to assail Bernie Sanders on gun control http://lat.ms/22UiQJm", "link" : "https://twitter.com/latimes/status/686428620147953664", "retweets" : 23, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-10T14:05:10.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 25, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "686428620147953664" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "latimes", "link" : "http://lat.ms/22UiQJm" }

The law enforcement news conferences have become a\nfamiliar and dispiriting tableau.Has the proliferation of incidents and the\nrelentless televised coverage had any affect on public opinion?Analysts say\nthe parade of violence has only served to harden feelings on both sides in the\nbattle over the gun control issue. Gun control advocates say the shootings\nunderline the need to get guns off the streets; gun rights advocates say they\nshow the need for Americans to be armed to protect themselves.\"It certainly\nriles people up,\" said John Donohue, a law professor at Stanford Law School.\n\"The question is, does it push views in either direction, or does it entrench\npeople more in their current views?\"Public opinion polls have reflected the\ndeep divide on the gun control issue. Following the Umpqua shooting, a Gallup\npoll showed that 55% felt that laws covering the sale of firearms should be\nmore strict, while 11% thought they should be less strict and 33% believed\nthey should be kept as they are. In contrast, shortly after the Columbine High\nSchool massacre in Colorado in 1999, 66% were in favor of stricter laws.\"The\ncall for tougher gun control is actually short-lived,\" James Alan Fox, Lipman\nprofessor of criminology, law and public policy at Northeastern University.\n\"You can see on Gallup polls asking [about] tougher gun control that it spikes\nafter certain cases, but it goes back down. And there are some people think we\nhave the right gun laws, but we just need to enforce them.\"Franklin E.\nZimring, a law professor at UC Berkeley, noted that mass shootings haven't\nchanged the intensity of support versus opposition at the national level in a\nway that translates into legislation. President Obama has called for tighter\ngun control measures, but Congress remains deeply divided over the issue.\"The\nreason that gun control laws do or don't pass is not so much the number of\npeople for or against it, but how deeply they feel,\" Zimring said. \"And for\npro-gun, anti-more-control folks, it's much more important to them — they care\nmore deeply about their cause — than the average citizen.\"In an earlier era of\ntelevision, the constant barrage of news footage from the Vietnam War helped\nturn public opinion against U.S. military involvement. But the division over\ngun laws is so intense that any television commentators looking to make the\nissue a crusade do so at their own risk.On Friday morning, up to 100\njournalists began rummaging around the house formerly occupied by the married\ncouple who carried out a mass shooting on Wednesday in San Bernardino.And as\nthat bizarre scene was playing out live on TV, critics — on Twitter and\nelsewhere — let out a collective yowl.On Friday morning, up to 100 journalists\nbegan rummaging around the house formerly occupied by the married couple who\ncarried out a mass shooting on Wednesday in San Bernardino.And as that bizarre\nscene was playing out live on TV, critics — on Twitter and elsewhere — let out\na collective yowl.When British journalist Piers Morgan had a nightly CNN\nprogram, he called for an assault weapons ban after the 2012 slaughter of 20\nelementary school children in Newtown, Conn. He covered the story for seven\nconsecutive nights, often stiff-arming the gun control opponents who appeared\nas guests. It prompted a petition to the White House with 80,000 signatures\ngathered by pro-gun activists that called for Morgan's deportation.\"If the\nkillings of elementary schoolchildren at Newtown did not galvanize the public\naround the issue, it's not quite clear what it's going to take,\" said Andrew\nHeyward, former president of CBS News and currently a research affiliate for\nthe Laboratory for Social Machines at MIT. \"Even if the issue takes great\nprominence, which I think it will, there are diametrically different points of\nview on how to deal with gun violence, including arming citizens so they can\nshoot the shooters before cops get there.\"A fragmented media environment makes\nit less likely for any single individual media outlet or commentator to\ninfluence the debate on gun control measures. \"No one owns the airwaves like\nWalter Cronkite did when he spoke to 30 million people,\" said Joe Peyronnin, a\nHofstra University journalism professor who worked with the legendary anchor\nat CBS. \"There is no single voice that can stand up and make a call to action\nas a journalist. There is a lot of division around this and it's not an issue\nof government distrust.\"Donna Dees Thomases, a former television publicity\nexecutive and longtime gun control activist, said the reflex of TV news is to\npresent the causes of gun violence as a polarizing issue that requires\ndiscussion rather than a problem that needs resolution.\"I think by always\nframing it as a debate might be good for ratings or make you feel like you're\ndoing fair and balanced coverage,\" she said. \"But I don't think it's creating\na public service. This is a story that needs to be told constantly, over and\nover again, without a mass shooting and having a bogus debate.\"The New York\nDaily News took such an approach with its blaring front page last week that\ncalled out political leaders — all of them Republican — for offering prayers\nfor the San Bernardino victims but no call for action on gun control. \"God\nIsn't Fixing This\" read the headline that became a talking point throughout\ncable news coverage of the massacre's aftermath.Daily News editor-in-chief Jim\nRich did not see his tabloid's front page as advocacy.\"When one side of an\nissue is so consistently lacking or predictable or in many cases duplicitous,\nit's difficult to adhere to a traditional line in the sand as far as what's\nbeing objective and what's being subjective,\" he said. \"Right now we're\ncalling it exactly the way it is.\" The New York Times may have taken its cue\nfrom the Daily News on Saturday with a call for stricter gun laws in its first\nfront-page editorial since 1920.Heyward believes any shift in opinion will\nprobably be driven by social media platforms rather than traditional TV news.\nCoverage of San Bernardino turned to the terrorist links of the husband-and-\nwife shooting team Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik by Friday afternoon,\nas viewers were transfixed by a media tour of their apartment.\"As TV networks\nmove on to the next story, which will they inevitably do, it will be\ninteresting to see if social media interest in guns moves up,\" Heyward said.\n\"That would be a better measure.\"**MORE ON SAN BERNARDINO SHOOTING****San\nBernardino residents are weary and on edge after a traumatic week****Islamic\nState calls San Bernardino shooters 'supporters' as terrorism probe\ncontinues****Tashfeen Malik: A onetime 'modern girl' who managed to avoid\ndetection before mass shooting**\n\n", "title" : "San Bernardino shooting: Does blanket TV coverage change minds? - LA Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Does intense TV coverage of mass shootings help or hurt the gun control debate? http://lat.ms/1LVsD5z pic.twitter.com/ozoa4GTbJk", "link" : "https://twitter.com/latimes/status/673373908414955522", "retweets" : 46, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-12-05T13:30:25.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 36, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "673373908414955522" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "latimes", "link" : "http://lat.ms/1LVsD5z" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e7183e955d14d6600b0377" }, "content" : "President Obama addressed the nation from the Oval Office on Sunday night\nhoping to reassure anxious Americans that his administration has a strategy to\ndefeat Islamic State overseas, and to protect Americans from the threat of\nhomegrown terrorism.But the 13-minute speech underscored the magnitude of the\nchallenge and the dearth of options for the White House.Obama revealed no new\nideas or plans for dismantling Islamic State, and he again ruled out sending a\nlarge force of U.S. ground troops to fight in the Middle East.President Obama\nspeaks from the Oval Office on Sunday. (Address begins at about\n28:50.)President Obama speaks from the Oval Office on Sunday. (Address begins\nat about 28:50.)The strategy he did present — more drone strikes, more special\nforces, more FBI investigations — pointed to a long-term struggle rather than\na decisive victory any time soon.Standing before the oaken Resolute desk, the\nultimate bully pulpit, Obama insisted that the U.S.-led military coalition is\nmaking progress at whittling away the vast territory Islamic State controls in\nIraq and Syria, and at choking off the group's illicit revenue sources.But he\nalso acknowledged the group had dramatically expanded its reach in recent\nweeks by sponsoring or inspiring attacks around the globe, including killing\n130 people in Paris, downing a Russian plane over Egypt, shooting up a hotel\nin Mali, and using suicide bombs in Lebanon, Libya and Yemen.Obama paid\nspecial tribute to the 14 people killed in San Bernardino on Wednesday, noting\nthat the two killers were lured “down the dark path of radicalization.”“This\nwas an act of terrorism designed to kill innocent people,” he said.He argued\nthat Islamic State is like no terrorist group in the past. It has drawn about\n30,000 foreign fighters, uses encrypted apps and software to avoid detection,\nand uses social media and the Internet to exhort followers to launch attacks\nin their home countries.He described the group as “thugs and killers, part of\na cult of death.” He urged Muslims “to decisively and unequivocally reject the\nhateful ideology.”But he didn't assign new resources to address that\nchallenge. He instead offered a defense of his current strategy, suggested\nmodest adjustments to existing programs and called on Congress to pass laws it\nis unlikely to approve.Obama said, for example, that he's ordered the State\nDepartment and Homeland Security to review the K-1 visa program, known as the\nfiance visa, that allowed Pakistani-born Tashfeen Malik — one of the two\nshooters in San Bernardino — to enter the country in 2014.He repeated his\ncalls for new gun-control laws since, he said, history has shown that law\nenforcement “cannot identify every would-be shooter.” But he has urged\nCongress to pass stiffer gun laws to no avail after every mass killing.He also\nurged Congress to draft a new authorization for the use of military force\nspecifically targeting Islamic State. The Pentagon told Congress as recently\nas Wednesday that it doesn't need new authorization to go after the\ngroup.Obama also said he would urge tech companies to cooperate more with law\nenforcement to “make it harder for terrorists to use technology to escape from\njustice.” Silicon Valley has largely resisted efforts to give the government\nbackdoor access to encryption.He argued that the success of U.S. efforts to\ndetect or disrupt complicated plots since Sept. 11, 2001, has given rise to\nthe current crop of “less complicated acts of violence,” like the attack in\nSan Bernardino.“The terrorist threat has evolved into a new phase,” Obama\nsaid. White House aides say that the FBI has arrested so many people — at\nleast 56 this year — that the group's followers have grown more secretive and\nthus more dangerous.Obama insisted he is using “every aspect of American\npower” to battle and ultimately eliminate the group.“The threat from terrorism\nis real, but we will overcome it. We will destroy ISIL and any other\norganization that tries to harm us,” he said, using an acronym for Islamic\nState.He added a swipe at his critics: “Our success won't depend on tough\ntalk, or abandoning our values, or giving in to fear.”Earlier Sunday, Donald\nTrump, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, reiterated\nhis call to profile American Muslims.“I want real vigilance,” he said on CBS'\n“Face the Nation,” “whether it's mosques or whatever it has to be.”Other\nRepublicans said the president missed an important opportunity to clearly\ndefine the threat and retool his strategy.“We are not winning the war against\nISIL, and the threat of terrorism against our homeland is real and growing,”\nSen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said in\na statement. “As the president said, America should never give in to fear. But\nneither should we fear to acknowledge the nature and severity of the threats\nwe face and do everything within our power to confront them.”Obama hasn't\nlacked for opportunities recently to try to convince Americans that he has a\nstrategy for beating Islamic State.Since the Nov. 13 attacks in Paris, the\npresident has spoken with reporters no fewer than 30 times, including at four\nnews conferences where counter-terrorism was a dominant theme.The president's\ndecision to speak Sunday night was an acknowledgment that his message was not\ngetting through. He last addressed the nation from the Oval Office five years\nago, when he announced his plan to withdraw all U.S. combat troops from\nIraq.In the view of his aides, Obama's message on terrorism has been drowned\nout by the heated rhetoric of Republicans vying to replace him next year, and\nby the president's own insistence on pressing ahead with other priorities,\nincluding global warming and the so-called pivot to Asia.The calculus changed\nafter the San Bernardino attack, the deadliest terrorist incident on U.S. soil\nsince Sept. 11, 2001.The president decided late Friday to deliver a major\naddress to “provide the American people with a clear sense of how we need to\ndeal with this threat as a country,” a senior administration official said\nSunday.**Follow @mikememoli for more White House coverage.****Times staff\nwriters Lisa Mascaro and W.J.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e7183e955d14d6600b0378" }, "content" : "The day of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, my son's high school was\nplaced on a short lockdown. He was remarkably nonchalant when I picked him up.\n“It was just a Level One,” he said, brushing off my concerns. “Everything's\nfine now.”It wasn't, in fact; the horror was still unfolding and would come\neven closer to home that afternoon, when law enforcement found a veritable\narsenal in the assailants' Redlands townhouse. But I recognized my son's need\nto normalize what had happened.I listened attentively as he explained the\ndifference in lockdown levels: A Level One is when an active shooter is in the\ntown or city; a Level Two is when the shooter is in the neighborhood; and a\nLevel Three is when the shooter is actually on campus.During a Level One, my\nson explained, teachers lock their classroom doors and lower the blinds. Some\ncontinue with the day's lesson plans. Others choose to take the more extreme\nmeasures required during a Level Two or Three. They turn off the lights and\ninstruct the kids to turn off their cellphones. They ask everyone to gather\nsilently in the corner of the room farthest from the door and windows.Once\nthey're given the all-clear signal, teachers may take additional time away\nfrom instruction to discuss what just happened, knowing that it's hard for\nkids to snap right back to Latin or biology when they've just been\ncontemplating a shooter on the loose.I may be 33 years my son's senior, but in\nmany ways he's more worldly. When I was in high school in the San Fernando\nValley in the 1980s, the terms “active shooter,” “lockdown” and “shelter in\nplace” weren't buzzwords. “Active shooter” entered the lexicon not long after\nthe Columbine massacre in 1999. “Lockdown” has been around longer, but until\nrecently was most commonly used in prisons.It now appears, as some had\npredicted from the start, that the husband and wife who carried out the brutal\nmassacre in San Bernardino were motivated at least in part by Islamic\nextremism. According to the FBI, Tashfeen Malik — who, with her husband, Syed\nRizwan Farook, killed 14 people and injured...It now appears, as some had\npredicted from the start, that the husband and wife who carried out the brutal\nmassacre in San Bernardino were motivated at least in part by Islamic\nextremism. According to the FBI, Tashfeen Malik — who, with her husband, Syed\nRizwan Farook, killed 14 people and injured...In the wake of the Sandy Hook\nattack, the Department of Education released guidelines for school emergency\nplans. Specific requirements vary by state. California's Education Code\ndoesn't mandate “active shooter” exercises but does expect school districts to\ndevelop comprehensive safety procedures for each campus. Some schools around\nthe country, eager to stay ahead of the curve, have taken it upon themselves\nto stage simulations complete with uniformed officers, fake blood and student\nactors. Sometimes schools announce drills in advance; sometimes not. The goal\nis to minimize the “freeze” response, which can prove fatal. Instead,\nparticipants learn to “Run, Hide, Fight.”I get it: Preparedness is key. But\nthere are possible downsides to these morbid war games. For starters, we don't\nknow how kids may respond to them in the long term. (There's little research\non the subject.) And they scare the hell out of the community. An “active\nshooter” drill at an Irvine elementary school in August was realistic enough\nthat surprised neighbors called the police. Responding officers were unaware\nof the drill.Our schools are confronting the new normal through preparations\nthat would once have seemed ridiculous. At my daughter's elementary school,\nthe Parent Teacher Assn. voted to buy portable toilets and privacy curtains\nfor kids to use during lockdowns. It was a prudent decision. After the\nschool's last lockdown, my daughter told me that a fellow second-grader had to\npee in a trash can, shielded by a flip chart the teacher set up to provide\nprivacy.Somehow, we've gotten to the point in California where, like\nearthquakes, school shootings are an acknowledged part of our kids' lives.Each\nOctober, the state goes all out publicizing the Great California ShakeOut. The\nchirpy online “ShakeOut Shop” offers T-shirts, coffee mugs and buttons\nreminding Californians to “Drop, Cover and Hold On” in the event of an\nearthquake. Can a similarly upbeat “Bullet-Wise” preparedness day be far\nbehind?Teaching kids to “Run, Hide, Fight” reinforces the nihilistic view that\nmass shootings are inevitable, diverting energy from the struggle to stop\nthem. Instead of crafting catchy phrases to help kids stay safe in the event\nof an atrocity, we should work toward stronger gun ownership background checks\nand assault-weapon restrictions. We need more than preparedness; we need\nprevention._Lisa Lewis is a writer based in Redlands.

Nikki Haley, who delivered the\nofficial Republican response to President Obama's State of the Union address,\nurged members of her own party to resist the temptation to follow the \"siren\ncall of the angriest voices.\"\"I will gladly accept the mantle of anger,\" Trump\nsaid, because the people running the country are \"incompetent.\"**9:31 p.m.**\nCruz finally gets the question about Trump's attacks on his citizenship, and\naccuses Trump of attacking him because his poll numbers have risen in\nIowa.\"Back in september my friend Donald said he had had his lawyers look at\nit from every which way and there was nothing there, there was nothing to this\nbirther issue..since September the Constitution hasn't changed. But the poll\nnumbers have. And I recognize, I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his\npoll numbers are falling in Iowa. But the facts and the law here are really\nquite clear here. Under longstanding U.S. law the child of a U.S. citizen born\nabroad is a natural born citizen,\" he said.Cruz went on to note that some of\nthe more \"extreme\" birther theorists say that a natural born citizen must have\ntwo parents born in the United States, which would also disqualify Trump from\nthe presidency.\"I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you. You are\nan American as is everybody else on this stage and I would suggest we focus on\nwho is best prepared to be commander in chief because that's the most\nimportant question facing the country,\" Cruz said.Trump once again told Cruz\nhe should seek a declaratory judgment that he is eligible to run, because if\nCruz was his vice presidential nominee -- or the nominee himself -- Democrats\nwould challenge his citizenship.He also admitted he's raised the issue,\n\"because now he's doing a little bit better.\"\"I didn't care before,\" Trump\nsaid. But now, \"He's got probably a 4 or 5 percent chance.\"Cruz's response to\nTrump: \"I'm happy to consider naming you as VP so if you happen to be right\nyou can get the top job at the end of the day.\"\"I think I'll go back to\nbuilding buildings,\" Trump responded.**9:22 p.m.** When about the New York\nTimes that he failed to disclose a low-interest loan from his wife's employer,\nGoldman Sachs, Cruz begins by railing about the what he viewed as a \"hit\npiece.\" Then he talked about his struggle as the underdog in the 2012 Texas\nSenate campaign.\"Yes I made a paperwork error...but if that's the best hit the\nNew York Times has got they've better go back to the well,\" Cruz said.**9:20\np.m.** In his first answer of the night, Trump warns that migrants could be\nthe \"great Trojan horse\" of attacks on the U.S. and said he is skeptical there\nare few women coming to the U.S.**9:16 p.m. **Guantanamo Bay would definitely\nremain open under a President Rubio. He promised that any terror suspects\ncaptured abroad would get a \"one-way ticket\" to the Cuban prison\nfacility.**9:14 p.m.** As the debate turns to foreign policy, both Christie\nand Bush say the military has become weak under Mr. Obama and needs to be\nstrengthened. Both also warn that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would\nbe a disaster as president because she would continue the president's foreign\npolicies.Rubio also chimes in.\"Hillary Clinton is disqualified from being\ncommander in chief of the United States. Someone who cannot handle\nintelligence information appropriately cannot be president of the United\nStates,\" he said, in a reference to Clinton's email use as secretary of\nstate.**9:06 p.m.** ****The first question goes to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who is\nasked about President Obama's assessment of the economy in his State of the\nUnion address. Instead, he opted to first talk about the sailors who were\ncaptured by Iran and then released earlier this week.\"In that State of the\nUnion President Obama didn't so much as mention the 10 sailors that had been\ncaptured by Iran. President Obama is preparing to send $100 billion or more to\nthe Ayatollah Khomeini,\" Cruz said. \"The next commander in chief is standing\non this stage....no serviceman or servicewomen will be forced to be on their\nknees. **8:57 p.m.**: Just seven candidates are taking the stage for the sixth\nRepublican debate in North Charleston, South Carolina: businessman Donald\nTrump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, neurosurgeon Ben Carson,\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Ohio Gov.\nJohn Kasich. Fox Business Network, which is hosting the debate, raised the bar\nfor entry in the main debate. Canddiates had to place among the top six\ncandidates nationally in an average of the five most recent national polls\nrecognized by Fox News, or in the top five in either Iowa or New Hampshire,\nbased on recognized polls in those states.  Earlier in the evening, former\nHewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, former Pennsylvanian Sen. Rick Santorum and\nformer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee participated in the undercard debate.

If, heaven forbid, that next\npresident is a Repbulican I think its pretty clear we know what will happen. A\nlot of the rights that have been won over the years from women's rights to\nvoter rights to gay rights to worker rights will be at risk...This is a\nwatershed election. I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed\nPresident Obama in the White House and I will do all that I can in this\ncampaign to reach out and explain what I stand for and what I will do as\npresident.\"She closed by saying, \"Thank you, good night, and may the Force be\nwith you.\"**10:37 p.m. **O'Malley gets a question about whether his wife,\nKatie, would have to give up her work as a district judge if he were\nelected.\"That would be totally up to her. Katie has never been a person who\nlet her husband's professional choices get in the way of her dreams,\" he said.\n\"Katie O'Malley will do whatever Katie O'Malley wants to do regardless of\nwhether her husband gets elected.\"**10:34 p.m. **A question for Clinton, who\nheld this role: Is it time to change the role of a president's spouse?\" The\nrole has been defined by each person who has held it and I am very grateful\nfor all my predecessors and my successors because of them did what she could\nto support her husband and her country but also chose to work on issues that\nwere of particular concern,\" Clinton said. \"With respect to my own husband, I\nam probably still going to pick the flowers and the China for state dinners\nand stuff like that, but I will certainly turn to him as prior presidents have\nfor special missions, for advice, and in particular how we're going to get the\neconomy working again for everybody.\"As Sanders is asked about his own wife,\nhe took a second to praise Clinton's tenure as first lady. She \"redefined what\nthat role could be.\"**10:28 p.m.** A follow up question goes to Clinton about\nwhether she bears responsibility for the chaos in Libya after the 2011\nmilitary intervention. She blamed the Arab Spring and ISIS propaganda for\ndestabilizing the country.\"What we're seeing happening in Libya right now is\nthat there has been a fragile agreement to put aside the differences that\nexist between Libyans themselves to try to dislodge ISIS...and to try to\ncreate a national government,\" she said. \"This is not easy work. We did a lot\nto help.\"Raddatz pressed her over whether mistakes were made, and Clinton\nsaid, \"There's always a retrospective to say what mistakes are made...we\noffered a lot of help and it was difficult for the Libyans to accept\nhelp.\"**10:25 p.m.**\"I agree, we need to reign in the overprescribing,\"\nO'Malley said, but he also called for a $12 billion federal investment for\nlocal partnerships and said there needs to be more intervention at\nhospitals.**10:22 p.m.** The debate shifts to heroin abuse, as Muir talks\nabout a poll that showed 48 percent in new Hampshire say they have known\nsomeone who has abused heroin.Sanders said that part of the solution is\ntelling doctors prescribing opiates and pharmaceutical companies to \"get their\nact together\" to help fix the problem. Plus, he said, addiction should be\ntreated like a disease and not a criminal problem.Clinton says the federal\ngovernment should offer $10 billion over 10 years to work with states to come\nup with a plan to fight the heroin epidemic.\"There are too many opioids being\nprescribed...that leads directly to heroin addiction,\" Clinton said.**10:19\np.m. **Sanders focused his comments on reforming the criminal justice\nsystem.\"We need major, major reforms of a very broken criminal justice\nsystem,\" he said, and called for an effort to end institutional racism.\"Police\nofficers should not be shooting unarmed people, predominantly African\nAmericans,\" he said.

He also called for\nhigher taxes on top earners.One entitlement the U.S. cannot afford, he said,\nis \"the entitlement that the super wealthy among us -- those earning more than\na million dollars -- feel they are entitled to pay lower income tax rates and\na far lower preferred tax rate when it comes to capital gains.\"**10:05 p.m.\n**Clinton reaffirms her pledge not to raise taxes on middle class families.\"I\ndon't think we should be imposing new big programs that are going to raise\nmiddle class families' taxes...we've got to get back to where people can save\nmoney again,\" she said.Sanders said Clinton is going against President\nRoosevelt on Social Security and President Johnson on Medicare -- as well as\nprogressive Democrats, who argue for small tax increases to pay for things\nlike paid medical and family leave.**10:04 p.m. **The debate turns to taxes.\n\"Now this is getting fun!\" Sanders exclaims.**10:01 p.m.** As O'Malley talks\nabout his plan to give students access to a debt-free college education at any\nin-state university, he thanks Clinton for \"borrowing\" many of his ideas in\nher own plan.Clinton calls for debt-free public tuition and said the U.S.\nshould focus on poorer families, not eliminating tuition for everyone.**9:59\np.m. **Sanders is talking about his education plan, which would put a\nspeculation tax on Wall Street to eliminate tuition at public colleges and\nuniversities altogether.\"If we are going ot be competitive in the global\neconomy we need the best educated workforce,\" he said, calling it \"insane\"\nthat some people cannot afford to go to college.Read more about where the\ncandidates stand on college affordability here.**9:53 p.m. **Asked about\nrising premiums for health insurance, Clinton said, \"I would certainly build\non the successes of the Affordable Care Act and work to fix some of the\nglitches.\"She said she has proposed a $4,000 tax credit to help people who\nhave very large out of pocket costs and wants Medicare to be able to negotiate\nfor lower drug prices. Additionally, Clinton said, the health care exchanges\nneed to be \"properly regulated so we are not being gamed.\"**9:48\np.m.**O'Malley argues that he has a better plan than both of his rivals,\nsaying, \"We're not going to fix what ails our economy...by either trying to\nreplace American capitalism with socialism...nor will we fix it by submitting\nto Wall Street-directed crony capitalism.\"\"I had the backbone to take on Wall\nStreet in the ways that Secretary Clinton never, ever has,\" he said, and\nrecalled what he termed \"shameful\" comments Clinton made in the last debate\nlinking Wall Street, campaign finance and the terrorist attacks on\n9/11.\"Clinton fired back, saying O'Malley had \"no problem\" going to Wall\nStreet bankers to raise money when he was the head of the Democratic\nGovernor's Association.**9:44 p.m. **Sanders gets the same question -- and the\nanswer is no.\"Hillary and I have a difference. CEOs of large multinationals,\nthey like Hillary, they aren't going to like me. And Wall Street, they're\ngoing to like me even less.**9:42 p.m.**\"Should corporate America love Hillary\nClinton?\" Muir asks. \"Everyone should!\" Clinton responds.She went on to talk\nabout leveling the playing field but also describing herself as someone\ninterested in creating jobs.\"If people who are in the private sector know what\nI stand for...and they want to be part of once again building our economy so\nit works for everybody, more power to them.\"**9:40 p.m. **Candidates are\noutlining the broad strokes of their economic policies as the debate shifts to\nthe economy, taxes and healthcare.**9:26 p.m.** Clinton and Sanders continued\nto spar over whether the U.S. should focus on removing Assad and destroying\nISIS at the same time. The former secretary of state argued that the fighters\non the ground who oppose Assad need to know there is a diplomatic channel in\nplace to change the leadership. Sanders stuck to his position.\"Yes, of course,\nAssad is a terrible dictator. But I think we have got to get our foreign\npolicies and our priorities right. It is not Assad who is attacking the United\nStates. It is ISIS,\" he said. The major priority, he affirmed, \"should be the\ndestruction of ISIS.\"O'Malley argued that the U.S. should not be determining\nwhich dictators around the world must stay and go.\"We have a role to play in\nthis world but it is not the role of traveling the world to look for new\nmonsters to destroy,\" he said.**9:22 p.m.** Sanders calls for focusing on\ndestroying ISIS in Syria first, and removing Syrian dictator Bashar Assad\nsecond, repeating a frequent argument against regime change.In response.\nClinton hits Sanders over voting in favor of the U.S.-led campaign of\nairstrikes that helped depose former Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi.If the\nU.S. had not done that, Clinton said, \"you would be looking at Syria.**9:21\np.m.** Clinton dismisses a question on whether she would be willing to shoot\ndown a Russian plane in a no-fly zone over Syria.\"It wouldn't come to that,\"\nshe said, arguing that the U.S. would be able to work with Russia on the no-\nfly zone.**9:18 p.m.** Clinton says a question about whether she is willing to\nrisk having to send more and more forces into the Middle East to defeat ISIS\nis a \"false choice.\" She listed a number of things she said the U.S. must do\nin combination to defeat the group: Lead an air coalition, build back up the\nIraqi Army, talk to sheiks in the Anbar province, get the Turks to pay more\nattention to ISIS than the Kurds and build a coalition of Muslim nations on\nthe ground.**9:13 p.m.** Raddatz pushes Sanders over how he will convince\nMuslim nations to put troops on the ground to fight ISIS, since he does not\nwant U.S. combat troops in the region.\"My plan is to make it work, to tell\nSaudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they...are going to have\nto go to war against ISIS. To tell Qatar that instead of spending $200 billion\non the World Cup, maybe instead they should pay attention to ISIS which is at\nhis doorstep,\" he said.**9:08 p.m.** The moderators point out that the\ngovernor of the state hosting the debate, New Hampshire's Maggie Hassan, has\ncalled for a halt in accepting refugees from Syria.I don't think a halt is\nnecessary,\" Clinton said, calling for \"increased vetting and screening.\"\"The\nprocess should move forward while we are also taking on ISIS,\" she\nsaid.O'Malley said there are far greater vulnerabilities than those posed by\nrefugees, and that the U.S. should take in more than the 65,000 refugees he\nhas called for if necessary.**9:05 p.m.** Fielding a question about whether\nthe government should force tech companies to give them a back door into\nencrypted communications, Clinton calls for a \"Manhattan-like project\" to\nfigure out a way to bring the government and tech community together to find\nmiddle ground.She said she would \"not want to go to that point\" of forcing\ntech companies to preserve a back door for government, which they argue would\nalso make their products vulnerable to hackers. \"I would hope that given the\nextraordinary capacities that the tech community has and the legitimate needs\nand questions...that there could be a Manhattan-like project...they've got to\nbe partners,\" she added.O'Malley also weighed in: \"I believe we should never\ngive up our privacy,\" he said. He then talked about the importance of\npreserving the freedom of religion.**9:02 p.m.** As the conversation turns to\nTrump, Sanders has a message for his supporters:\"What I say to those people\nwho go to Donald Trump's rallies: He thinks a lot minimum wage in America is a\ngood idea...I believe we stand together to address the real issues facing this\ncountry,\" he said.**9:00 p.m. **\"He is becoming ISIS' best recruiter,\" Clinton\nsays of Republican candidate Donald Trump, talking about his rhetoric on\nMuslims and call to ban them from coming to the U.S.**8:59 p.m. **Sanders grew\npassionate when talking about his history with gun control in a state like\nVermont.\"Do not tell me that I have not shown courage in standing up to the\ngun people,\" he told O'Malley.Clinton also said, \"I applaud his record in\nMaryland, I just wish he wouldn't misrepresent mine.\"Read more about where the\n2016 candidates stand on gun control here.**8:53 p.m. **Sanders argued, \"I'm\nnot going to say that everybody is in agreement...but there is a broad\nagreement on sensible gun safety regulations.\" He cited expanding background\nchecks and banning assault weapons as a place where there is broad agreement,\nand said he would push for those regulations even though he comes from a state\nwith virtually no gun control.Meanwhile, O'Malley went after Clinton and\nSanders for a \"flip-flopping culture of Washington\" on gun control.\"Let's calm\ndown a little Martin,\" Sanders said. \"Let's tell the truth here Martin,\"\nClinton chimed in.**8:51 p.m. **Clinton is asked about an ABC News poll that\nshows Americans believe arming more people, not stricter gun laws, is the best\ndefense. \"Guns in and of themselves, in my opinion, will not make Americans\nsafer...arming more people to do what I think is not the appropriate response\nto terrorism. I think what is is creating much deeper, closer relations and\nyes coalitions within our own country. The first line of defense against\nradicalization is in the Muslim-American community, people who we should be\nwelcoming and working with,\" she said. **8:45 p.m. **The moderators ask\nClinton how confident the American people should be that there aren't people\nlike the ones who committed the San Bernardino shooting who have been\nradicalized under the radar of authorities. She pivots to her strategy to\ndefeat ISIS. At the end of hear answer, Clinton called for better sharing of\nintelligence and information, and said the government must work with Muslim\nAmerican communities. \"They will be our early warning signal...that's why we\nneed to work with them and not demonize them like the Republicans have been\ndoing,\" Clinton said. O'Malley jumps in and says the problem in the fight\nagainst ISIS is a \"lack of battle tempo.\" **8:40 p.m. **Sanders gets the first\nquestion over the voter data breaches, and says again that his staffer \"did\nthe wrong thing\" and calling for an independent investigation of breaches of\nvoter data. He is still critical of the Democratic National Committee (DNC)\nfor shutting off his access to his data, calling it a \"real problem.\" Asked by\nthe moderators, Sanders apologized to both Clinton and his supporters. Clinton\nresponded, \"I very much appreciate that comment,\" but added, \"I don't think\nthe American people are all that interested in this.\" **8:38 p.m. **Excerpts\nfrom the opening statements: Clinton: \"The American president has to both keep\nour families safe and make the economy grow in a way that helps everyone, not\njust those at the top. That's the job. I have a strategy to combat and defeat\nISIS without getting us involved in another ground war and I have a plan to\nraise in comes and deal with a lot of the problems that keep families up at\nnight....we have a distinct difference between those of us up on stage and our\nRepublican counterparts.\" O'Malley: \"I visited with a number of our neighbors\nin northern Virginia at a mosque last Friday. And as I looked out there at the\neyes of our neighbors, I looked into the eyes of veterans, I looked into the\neyes of boy scouts...what our nation needs right now is to realize that while\nwe face a terror danger we also face another sort of political danger and that\nis the danger that democracies are susceptible to when unscrupulous leaders\ntry to turn us against each other.\" Sanders: \"I am running for president of\nthe United States because it is too late for establishment politics and\nestablishment economics. I'm running for president because our economy is\nrigged, because working people are working longer hours for lower wages and\nalmost all of the new wealth and income being created is going to the top 1\npercent...I'm going to create an economy that works for working families, not\njust billionaires. I'm running for president because we have a campaign\nfinance system that is corrupt...I'm running because we need to address the\nplanetary crisis of climate change...I want a new foreign policy, one that\ntakes on ISIS, one that destroys ISIS, but one that does not get us involved\nin perpetual warfare in the quagmire of the Middle East but rather works\naround a major coalition of wealthy and powerful nations supporting Muslim\ntroops on the ground.\" **7:50 p.m.**Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,\nVermont Sen.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e7183e955d14d6600b037e" }, "content" : "WASHINGTON — President Obama will meet with Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch\non Monday to discuss what he can do to curb gun violence, sidestepping an\nentrenched Congress.In his first weekly radio address of the new year on\nFriday, Mr. Obama said he would talk to Ms. Lynch after a monthslong\nexamination of the measures he can take on his own to halt what he called “our\nepidemic of gun violence.”Recalling the 2012 school shooting in Newtown,\nConn., that killed 26 people — 20 of them children — and left many grimly\nhopeful it would lead to an overhaul of the nation’s gun laws, the president\naccused lawmakers of bowing to the gun lobby and blocking necessary\nchanges.“All across America, survivors of gun violence and those who lost a\nchild, a parent, a spouse to gun violence are forced to mark such awful\nanniversaries every single day,” Mr. Obama said. “And yet Congress still\nhasn’t done anything to prevent what happened to them from happening to other\nfamilies.”The speech was an explicit return to a theme that Mr. Obama has\nplayed down in the wake of terrorist attacks that killed 130 people on Nov. 13\nin Paris and 14 more on Dec. 2 in San Bernardino, Calif., both of which were\ninspired by Islamic extremism. While Mr. Obama’s initial response to the San\nBernardino attack emphasized its commonality with other mass shootings and the\nneed for gun restrictions, the administration soon realized that this message\nwas failing to reassure Americans that he was taking seriously enough the\nthreat from Islamic extremism and the Islamic State.So through much of\nDecember, Mr. Obama engaged in public events to convince Americans that his\nadministration was doing everything it could to battle the Islamic State. For\nsome Americans, being vigilant against Islamic extremism involves having more\nguns, not fewer, and sales of guns surged in the wake of the San Bernardino\nattack.The administration sees such a response as counterproductive not only\nbecause the number of deaths from gun suicides and routine shootings is far\ngreater than those from terrorist attacks, but also because the availability\nof weapons here makes such attacks far easier to conduct. Rather than fight\nboth the anxiety about Islamic extremism and the need for more gun\nrestrictions at the same time, Mr. Obama focused on calming the nation.Now, a\nmonth after the San Bernardino attacks, Mr. Obama has decided that he can\nreturn to his focus on gun measures. “Because I get too many letters from\nparents, and teachers, and kids, to sit around and do nothing,” Mr. Obama said\nin his speech Friday.A bipartisan effort in 2013 to bolster gun control\nmeasures after the Newtown shootings was halted in the Senate, failing to\ngarner the 60 votes needed to expand background checks and to ban assault\nweapons and high-capacity magazines.Facing the reality that lawmakers are\nunlikely to strengthen the country’s gun laws anytime soon, the administration\nhas been looking at ways Mr. Obama can tighten gun sales unilaterally,\nfocusing in particular on who could be considered a high-volume dealer for an\nexecutive action that could expand background checks.But White House officials\nhave said there are many political and legal challenges to doing so,\npotentially opening up Mr. Obama to renewed criticism that he is abusing his\nauthority.The president’s announcement comes less than two weeks before his\nfinal State of the Union speech on Jan. 12, addressing “one piece of\nunfinished business,” as he called it on Friday.\n\n", "title" : "Obama to Consider Executive Actions on Gun Violence - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Obama to consider executive action on gun control , sidestepping Congress http://nyti.ms/1MLctfv", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/683009813899546624", "retweets" : 462, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-01T03:40:03.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 668, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "683009813899546624" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1MLctfv" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e7183e955d14d6600b037f" }, "content" : "ALEXANDRIA, Va. — With President Obama poised to act on his own authority to\ntry to stem gun violence, his gun control allies are using big-money donors\nand shifting tactics to try to remake the political landscape in the national\ngun debate, challenging and sometimes even besting the powerful National Rifle\nAssociation in state-by-state battles.The newfound momentum reflects a\nstrategy to steer clear of a Republican-led Congress that has proved unwilling\nto touch existing federal gun laws after years of intense lobbying on both\nsides of the debate.With tens of millions of dollars to spend thanks to\nbackers like Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, gun control\ngroups have secured a number of surprising recent successes in Connecticut,\nDelaware and elsewhere. And they are now looking to state and local officials\nto win approval for tougher background checks and other measures from Nevada\nto Maine.The N.R.A. remains the dominant force in much of the country,\nspending more than $32.5 million last year on campaigns and lobbying. It has\nshown continued muscle in stopping new restrictions and loosening existing\nones in many localities. But the political landscape has become more hotly\ncontested as a result of the gun control groups’ shift in focus and infusion\nof cash, operatives on both sides say. The axiom that gun control is a losing\npolitical issue does not always hold true anymore.“The money was almost\nexclusively on the pro-gun side of the fence before, and we were always\naccused of spending our way to victory,” said Richard Feldman, a former N.R.A.\nexecutive who leads the Independent Firearms Owners Association. “Now the\nother side has these resources from Michael Bloomberg to get involved in these\nstate and local races, something they didn’t have before.”The organization\nEverytown for Gun Safety — which received $36 million in contributions last\nyear, with the biggest chunk coming from Mr. Bloomberg — has eclipsed a number\nof older gun control groups in publicity and influence. In its latest push,\nthe group is funding an ad campaign for players from the National Basketball\nAssociation to speak out against gun violence.The group, created in 2014 after\nthe slaughter in 2012 of 26 children and adults at an elementary school in\nNewtown, Conn., says its supporters have now grown to three million\nnationwide, including survivors of shootings, mayors, police officers,\ncelebrities, and rank-and-file supporters. It has chapters in all 50 states,\nwith registered lobbyists in 31 of them, adopting a structure used to great\neffectiveness by the N.R.A. itself. Mr. Bloomberg has pledged to spend at\nleast $50 million of his own money in the group’s push for tougher gun\nrestrictions — a level of spending that Jennifer Baker, an N.R.A. official,\ncalled “obscene.”In some races, gun control advocates are outspending the\ndeep-pocketed N.R.A. And after the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif.,\nand earlier rampages at a Planned Parenthood facility in Colorado, a community\ncollege in Oregon and a church in Charleston, S.C., gun control advocates said\nthey planned to expand their push for stiffer local restrictions still\nfurther. They believe their cause was buoyed last month when the Supreme Court\nlet stand an ordinance in a Chicago suburb that bans semiautomatic assault\nweapons.Mr. Obama is expected to move ahead as soon as this week with a series\nof executive actions modifying federal gun laws. On Tuesday, gun control\nactivists are expected to gather at the White House to discuss possible\naction, and on Thursday — a day before the fifth anniversary of the shooting\nof former Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Arizona — he will participate\nin a town-hall-style meeting on gun violence that will be shown on CNN. But\nthe measures he is considering would be a modest tweaking of the law compared\nwith the more sweeping changes that gun control groups are pushing for at the\nstate and local levels.The growing importance of state gun laws was made clear\nlast month when Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut announced that he would\nact on his own to bar anyone on the government’s terrorism watch lists from\nbuying a gun. Congress refused to take that step nationwide.Mr. Malloy, a\nDemocrat, said in a telephone interview that afterward, other governors\nlooking to follow his lead on the issue had contacted him.Changing gun\npolicies “is easier to do on a state-by-state basis than it is on a national\nlevel, because Congress is gerrymandered to such an extent,” Mr. Malloy\nsaid.Gun control supporters gained another big win in Virginia last month when\nthe state’s attorney general, Mark R. Herring, a Democrat, barred anyone who\nholds a concealed-handgun permit in 25 other states from using it to carry a\nfirearm in Virginia.Virginia, despite its reputation as a pro-gun state, also\nproduced a victory for gun control supporters last month when Jeremy McPike, a\nDemocrat from suburban Washington and a political novice running on a gun\ncontrol platform, was elected to the State Senate. Mr. McPike’s campaign was\nhelped by $1.5 million from Everytown. The group blanketed the area with ads\npromoting Mr. McPike’s record on gun control, and he was elected despite an F\ngrade from the N.R.A.“It takes muscle to counteract the muscle of the N.R.A.,”\nhe said in an interview.Mr. McPike grew up in a family of hunters, and as a\nvolunteer firefighter he said many of his colleagues were vocal gun-rights\nadvocates. But his views have been shaped by his own history: He said he\nremembered responding to an emergency call for a teenager who had accidentally\nshot himself in the groin, and he said his brother had committed suicide at\nthe age of 16 with a family gun.“At some point, you can’t sit on the sidelines\nanymore,” he said. “You’ve got to find a way to effect change.”In the closing\nweeks of his race and two other campaigns in Virginia that hinged on guns, the\nN.R.A. and gun control groups all sent people to the local districts to rally\nvoters. Candidates backed by the N.R.A. won both of the other races, helping\nRepublicans hold a majority in the State Senate. The N.R.A. saw the results as\na rebuke of Mr. Bloomberg’s organization.“They got their butts kicked in\nVirginia,” Ms. Baker said. “You spend all that money, and all you have to show\nfor it is one win? That’s complete and utter failure.”Gun control advocates\nhave not given up on Washington completely. They have met repeatedly with\nWhite House officials to urge Mr. Obama to issue an executive order to tighten\nsome gun measures, and the president will meet with Attorney General Loretta\nE. Lynch and the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, on Monday to discuss his\noptions. He is limited in what he can do, however, and the advocates see their\nbest chance for change at the state level — particularly in pushing ballot\ninitiatives that put gun control questions to voters.The shift away from\nWashington is rooted in Congress’s rejection in 2013 of expanded background\nchecks that were proposed in the wake of the shootings in Newtown.Mr. Obama\nsaid the failure to pass gun control legislation after the Connecticut tragedy\nwas one of the biggest disappointments of his presidency, and gun control\nadvocates said the jolt from that rejection made them realize that changes\nwere all but impossible in Congress.After that defeat, “we took a step back,\nand we realized we had to go state by state,” said John Feinblatt, the\npresident of the Everytown group.Everytown’s big footprint, however, worries\neven some fellow gun control advocates. They say some local officials in\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island and elsewhere have resented the perception of a\nhigh-profile, billionaire liberal like Mr. Bloomberg trying to change their\ngun laws.“I see them as a lightning rod,” said an official with another gun\ncontrol group, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of concerns\nabout alienating supporters. “They’re stirring up this opposition, and the\nN.R.A. as a result is putting more resources into its state strategy.”Mr.\nFeinblatt said Everytown was changing the nature of the debate. He likened the\nfocus on the states to the push for same-sex marriage, which began with a\nsmall number of states approving it before the Supreme Court struck down the\nDefense of Marriage Act in 2013 and it spread more quickly.The strategy\ncarries risks. The N.R.A. has five million members and boasts of a political\nbase that is willing to turn out at the polls for a single issue: gun\ncontrol.With policies varying from one jurisdiction to the next, each side has\na scorecard of victories to show why it believes it is winning the debate.The\nN.R.A. points to 95 bills passed last year nationwide that it considers\nfavorable to gun enthusiasts and hunters.Mr. Bloomberg’s group can point to\nlaws passed in nine states last year to keep guns out of the hands of domestic\nabusers, the defeat of numerous bills that would have facilitated concealed-\ncarry permits and, most critically, approval of a measure that expanded\nbackground checks in Oregon. It was the sixth state to pass a background check\nmeasure after the shootings in Newtown, and the 18th over all.In Delaware,\nGov. Jack Markell, a Democrat, signed a measure in October aimed at keeping\nguns out of the hands of domestic abusers; it was personally pushed by Ms.\nGiffords, who started a gun safety group after she was shot in the head in a\nmass shooting in 2011.In Michigan, Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, vowed in\nNovember to veto — for a second time — a hotly debated bill that would allow\npermit-holders to carry concealed weapons in schools.The next big battleground\nis Nevada, where a record number of signatures set up a vote this year on an\ninitiative to impose a statewide background check. After that on the list of\ntargets is Maine, where gun control advocates say they are confident they will\nsoon have enough signatures to get a background check initiative on the state\nballot.N.R.A. officials say they are not worried.“We’ll see what happens,” Ms.\nBaker said. “We know they’re going to spend a lot of money, but I don’t see\nany groundswell of support.”\n\n", "title" : "State Focus and Infusion of Funding Buoy Gun Control Advocates - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Gun control advocates are challenging and sometimes even besting the NRA in state-by-state battles http://nyti.ms/1RjD35J", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/683765400757252098", "retweets" : 222, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-03T05:42:29.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 347, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "683765400757252098" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1RjD35J" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e7183e955d14d6600b0380" }, "content" : "SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. — The fear comes up in discussions in line at the\nmovies, where a group of mothers say there are too many guns on the streets\nfor them to feel safe. For others, the mass shooting that killed 14 people\nhere last month has prompted a rush to buy a gun for the first time, suddenly\nconvincing them that only a firearm can protect them.But on one point, many\npeople here seem to be in agreement: President Obama’s latest plan to expand\nbackground checks and law enforcement for some gun sales would do little to\nstop mass shootings of the kind that shattered this city’s sense of\nsecurity.“I’m now considering getting a gun,” said Dondi Abarca, 43, a county\nemployee. “Times are changing, and there are these situations that are\nhappening.”In a city as diverse as this one, opinions on guns run the\ngamut.Like many other county employees, Trish Munoz was personally affected by\nthe murders here. She knew one of the victims of the massacre — and one of the\nattackers, Syed Rizwan Farook, who worked as a county health inspector.But\noutside a memorial service on Monday commemorating the shooting, Ms. Munoz,\n44, scowled at the mention of Mr. Obama’s plan, which includes a requirement\nthat anyone who makes a living selling firearms register as a licensed gun\ndealer and conduct background checks.“It violates our constitutional rights,”\nMs. Munoz said. “And it distracts from what the real problems are.” No gun\nlaws could have stopped the attack, she said, and certainly not the ones the\npresident is proposing.Across town, Catherine Barragan, 49, said gun control\nhad been a frequent topic of discussion with her friends over the last month.\nShe applauded the president’s efforts, adding that she would support getting\nall guns off the streets.“There are too many loopholes,” Ms. Barragan, an\nadministrator at a car auction, said.But she agreed that the latest measures\nwould not be enough to prevent another major attack. “It won’t prevent\nsomething like what happened,” she said.This week, the office where the Dec. 2\nshooting took place reopened, a milestone in San Bernardino’s efforts to\nresume life as normal. But as Mr. Obama spoke on Tuesday and listed the mass\nshootings during his tenure — suggesting his resolve to try to slow, if not\nstop, the barrage — reminders of the attack here remained hard to avoid.At the\ncorner outside the reopened office, a makeshift memorial of flags and flowers\ncommemorates the victims. And the area where the two attackers — Mr. Farook\nand his wife, Tashfeen Malik — were ultimately killed is scarred by bullet\nholes after a shootout with the police in which hundreds of rounds were\nfired.Jim Mulvihill, a city councilman, said many in the community were still\ntrying to figure out why the attack had happened here.Mr. Mulvihill said he\nbelieved the president’s gun control measures did not go far enough; an\noutright ban on assault weapons might have made a difference in the attack\nlast month, he said, but there would have been no way to keep legal weapons\nout of Mr. Farook’s and Ms. Malik’s hands.“It’s a young married couple with a\nbaby, a good job,” he said. “Where’s the tip-off?”But Mr. Mulvihill said this\narea had responded like much of the country, which has had a surge in firearm\nsales over the last month. “There has been a run on gun shops here,” he\nsaid.One of those considering buying a gun for the first time was Robert\nGonzalez. He denounced the president’s executive order as an encroachment on\nthe Second Amendment that would do little to prevent gun violence.“I want a\ngun,” Mr. Gonzalez, 34, said, adding that he now felt he needed one to keep\nhis family safe. “I’ll probably have to hurry up and try to get one fast\nnow.”Henry Nickel, another city councilman, said residents’ concerns about\nsecurity had a number of potential causes. But the surge in demand for guns,\nhe said, reflects a nationwide loss of confidence that the government will\nprotect people.“Our city has endured some very difficult times: We’re going\nthrough bankruptcy, escalating crime, dwindling police,” Mr. Nickel said.\n“People are doing what they can to make sure they are properly defending\nthemselves.”While Ms. Abarca, the county employee, was considering buying a\ngun, she said she supported the president’s executive order because she did\nnot see it as an infringement on her own right to own a firearm — a testament\nto just how modest many gun control opponents consider the move. “Those who\nsell them should definitely be regulated,” she said.She added, however, that\nmore access to guns, not more restrictions, might halt the run of mass\nshootings in recent years that the president talked about during his speech on\nTuesday.“It being a gun-free zone may not have been a smart choice,” she said\nof the Inland Regional Center, where the shooting took place.For advocates of\ngun control, the prospect of even greater access to guns was frightening.At\nthe city library Tuesday morning, Rose Rangel, 58, said tougher background\nchecks could stop some mass shootings, even if they might not have stopped the\none here.“Maybe it would be harder to just go out there and start shooting,”\nshe said. “There are so many guns out there. We don’t even know who they\nbelong to.”Ms. Barragan, the auction administrator, said she did not think\nmore background checks would have much effect.

For others, the mass shooting that killed 14 people\nhere last month has prompted a rush to buy a gun for the first time, suddenly\nconvincing them that only a firearm can protect them.But on one point, many\npeople here seem to be in agreement: President Obama’s latest plan to expand\nbackground checks and law enforcement for some gun sales would do little to\nstop mass shootings of the kind that shattered this city’s sense of\nsecurity.“I’m now considering getting a gun,” said Dondi Abarca, 43, a county\nemployee. “Times are changing, and there are these situations that are\nhappening.”In a city as diverse as this one, opinions on guns run the\ngamut.Like many other county employees, Trish Munoz was personally affected by\nthe murders here. She knew one of the victims of the massacre — and one of the\nattackers, Syed Rizwan Farook, who worked as a county health inspector.But\noutside a memorial service on Monday commemorating the shooting, Ms. Munoz,\n44, scowled at the mention of Mr. Obama’s plan, which includes a requirement\nthat anyone who makes a living selling firearms register as a licensed gun\ndealer and conduct background checks.“It violates our constitutional rights,”\nMs. Munoz said. “And it distracts from what the real problems are.” No gun\nlaws could have stopped the attack, she said, and certainly not the ones the\npresident is proposing.Across town, Catherine Barragan, 49, said gun control\nhad been a frequent topic of discussion with her friends over the last month.\nShe applauded the president’s efforts, adding that she would support getting\nall guns off the streets.“There are too many loopholes,” Ms. Barragan, an\nadministrator at a car auction, said.But she agreed that the latest measures\nwould not be enough to prevent another major attack. “It won’t prevent\nsomething like what happened,” she said.This week, the office where the Dec. 2\nshooting took place reopened, a milestone in San Bernardino’s efforts to\nresume life as normal. But as Mr. Obama spoke on Tuesday and listed the mass\nshootings during his tenure — suggesting his resolve to try to slow, if not\nstop, the barrage — reminders of the attack here remained hard to avoid.At the\ncorner outside the reopened office, a makeshift memorial of flags and flowers\ncommemorates the victims. And the area where the two attackers — Mr. Farook\nand his wife, Tashfeen Malik — were ultimately killed is scarred by bullet\nholes after a shootout with the police in which hundreds of rounds were\nfired.Jim Mulvihill, a city councilman, said many in the community were still\ntrying to figure out why the attack had happened here.Mr. Mulvihill said he\nbelieved the president’s gun control measures did not go far enough; an\noutright ban on assault weapons might have made a difference in the attack\nlast month, he said, but there would have been no way to keep legal weapons\nout of Mr. Farook’s and Ms. Malik’s hands.“It’s a young married couple with a\nbaby, a good job,” he said. “Where’s the tip-off?”But Mr. Mulvihill said this\narea had responded like much of the country, which has had a surge in firearm\nsales over the last month. “There has been a run on gun shops here,” he\nsaid.One of those considering buying a gun for the first time was Robert\nGonzalez. He denounced the president’s executive order as an encroachment on\nthe Second Amendment that would do little to prevent gun violence.“I want a\ngun,” Mr. Gonzalez, 34, said, adding that he now felt he needed one to keep\nhis family safe. “I’ll probably have to hurry up and try to get one fast\nnow.”Henry Nickel, another city councilman, said residents’ concerns about\nsecurity had a number of potential causes. But the surge in demand for guns,\nhe said, reflects a nationwide loss of confidence that the government will\nprotect people.“Our city has endured some very difficult times: We’re going\nthrough bankruptcy, escalating crime, dwindling police,” Mr. Nickel said.\n“People are doing what they can to make sure they are properly defending\nthemselves.”While Ms. Abarca, the county employee, was considering buying a\ngun, she said she supported the president’s executive order because she did\nnot see it as an infringement on her own right to own a firearm — a testament\nto just how modest many gun control opponents consider the move. “Those who\nsell them should definitely be regulated,” she said.She added, however, that\nmore access to guns, not more restrictions, might halt the run of mass\nshootings in recent years that the president talked about during his speech on\nTuesday.“It being a gun-free zone may not have been a smart choice,” she said\nof the Inland Regional Center, where the shooting took place.For advocates of\ngun control, the prospect of even greater access to guns was frightening.At\nthe city library Tuesday morning, Rose Rangel, 58, said tougher background\nchecks could stop some mass shootings, even if they might not have stopped the\none here.“Maybe it would be harder to just go out there and start shooting,”\nshe said. “There are so many guns out there. We don’t even know who they\nbelong to.”Ms. Barragan, the auction administrator, said she did not think\nmore background checks would have much effect. At least as afraid of the day-\nto-day violence in this city as of another mass shooting, she said she wanted\nto find a way to get rid of more guns.“If everybody carries a gun, people are\nstill fighting in the street,” Ms. Barragan said. “It’s too easy for the wrong\nperson to get one.”\n\n", "title" : "To San Bernardino, Obama’s Gun Plan Goes Too Far or Falls Short - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Gun Control Measures Meet With Skepticism in San Bernardino http://nyti.ms/1Rh0iPJ", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/684646316618690560", "retweets" : 53, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-05T16:02:56.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 71, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "684646316618690560" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1Rh0iPJ" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e7183e955d14d6600b0382" }, "content" : "In the continuing debate over how to stop mass killings in the United States,\nAustralia has become a familiar touchstone.President Obama has cited  the\ncountry’s gun laws as a model for the United States, calling Australia a\nnation “like ours.” On the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton has said the\nAustralian approach is “worth considering.” The National Rifle Association has\ndismissed the policies, contending that they “robbed Australians of their\nright to self-defense and empowered criminals” without reducing violent\ncrime.The oft-cited statistic in Australia is a simple one: There have been no\nmass killings — defined by experts there as a gunman killing five or more\npeople besides himself — since the nation significantly tightened its gun\ncontrol laws almost 20 years ago.Mass shootings in Australia were rare anyway.\nBut after a gunman massacred 35 people in the Tasmanian town of Port Arthur in\n1996, a public outcry spurred a national consensus to severely restrict\nfirearms. The tightened laws, which were standardized across Australia, are\nmore stringent than those of any state in the United States, including\nCalifornia.Pushed through by John Howard, the conservative prime minister at\nthe time, the National Firearms Agreement prohibited automatic and\nsemiautomatic assault rifles and pump shotguns in all but unusual cases. It\ntightened licensing rules, established a 28-day waiting period for gun\npurchases, created a national gun registry and instituted a temporary buyback\nprogram that removed more than 20 percent of firearms from public\ncirculation.Several of the measures, including waiting periods and background\nchecks, have been adopted piecemeal by different states in America. But the\nUnited States has never tried a national gun buyback program; in Australia,\nthat required raising taxes. And the United States has never been able to do\nwhat Mr. Howard did: forge a broad agreement on a sweeping set of gun control\nmeasures that applies to the entire nation.A test of those laws came in\nDecember 2014, when a gunman who had expressed sympathy for Islamic extremism\ntook hostages in a cafe in Sydney. The assailant, Man Haron Monis, brandished\na sawed-off pump action shotgun that he had obtained illegally.An inquest said\nthe gun may have been in circulation before pump action shotguns were\nessentially banned in 1996 and was never confiscated in the buyback. According\nto the inquest, his shells were 15 to 20 years old.During the 17-hour siege of\nthe cafe, Mr. Monis fired several times, once into a wall, before killing the\ncafe manager. At that point, the police stormed in, killing the gunman and\nanother hostage in the crossfire.It is impossible to say whether gun\nrestrictions saved lives in the siege, but some politicians say they believe\nso.“It is the ready availability of weapons, particularly those that are\nautomatic or semiautomatic, that increases the likelihood that people in a\nmoment of madness, or malice, or hatred, will kill a lot of people,” Mr.\nHoward said in October, after a man opened fire on a community college campus\nin Oregon, killing nine.Measuring the broad effectiveness of Australia’s gun\ncontrol laws is complicated. Australians themselves continue to debate their\nimpact, and some have sought to loosen restrictions on gun ownership.Critics\nhave argued that gun violence was falling in Australia before 1996 and would\nhave continued to fall even without the gun control measures. Others have\nsuggested that even as gun-related deaths fell, people in Australia may have\nresorted to using other weapons to kill.To assess these claims, scholars have\nexamined not just mass shootings, but also all intentional deaths caused by\nfirearms, adjusting for population growth.Total intentional gun deaths fell by\nhalf in the decade after the 1996 restrictions were put in place, even as\nAustralia’s population grew nearly 14 percent. The rate of gun suicides per\n100,000 people dropped 65 percent from 1995 to 2006, and the rate of gun\nhomicides fell 59 percent, according to a 2010 study by Andrew Leigh of\nAustralian National University and Christine Neill of Wilfrid Laurier\nUniversity.When the data in that study is updated to include the latest\nfigures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as well as the numbers going\nback to 1968, several facts emerge.First, the rates of intentional firearm\ndeaths were substantially higher in the 28 years before the gun control\nmeasures were adopted in 1996 than in the 17 years after. How much of that\ndecline can be attributed to the new policies can be debated, but the\ndifference is clear.Second, the initial drop in firearm deaths in the decade\nafter the 1996 restrictions were enacted appears to have leveled off. In 2013,\nthe most recent year for which figures are available, there were 200 gun-\nrelated homicides and suicides, for a rate of 0.87 deaths per 100,000\nresidents. That is up slightly from the low in 2005, when 0.82 deaths per\n100,000 residents were recorded, but still far below the 2.71 deaths per\n100,000 residents in 1996.The data confirms that gun deaths were already\nfalling before the National Firearms Agreement. The rate of intentional gun\ndeaths fell about 33 percent from 1986 to 1996. The decline accelerated,\nhowever, under the new gun control measures, with the rate dropping about 60\npercent from 1996 to 2006.The impact of the gun laws is difficult to assess\npartly because of the low rates of intentional firearms deaths in Australia.\nGun-related homicide rates are even lower, because suicides make up about 80\npercent of all gun deaths. Looking at gun-related suicides and homicides\nseparately shows similar trends — higher rates of both before 1996 than after,\ndeclines in the decade before 1996 but sharper declines in the decade after,\nand a leveling off in recent years.Mr. Leigh and Ms. Neill tried to measure\nthe effect of the 1996 measures across Australian states and territories to\nsee whether different levels of gun confiscation led to different results.\nThey found that the places where the most guns were removed from public\ncirculation also experienced the largest drops in intentional gun deaths.The\nimpact of the buyback appeared more pronounced on suicides.“Firearm suicides\nfell more in states that had more guns bought back than in states with fewer\nguns bought back,” Ms. Neill said in an email. “Firearm homicides also fell\nmore in states with more guns bought back, but the effect was smaller than for\nfirearm suicides.”The data also indicates that overall homicide and suicide\nrates fell in the decade after 1996, meaning Australians did not respond to\nthe gun control measures by killing one another or themselves using other\nweapons at higher rates.Over all, Mr. Leigh and Ms. Neill estimate that at\nleast 200 lives are saved annually because of Australia’s gun buyback\nprogram.The introduction to the Australian market this year of a shotgun that\nallows rapid fire using a lever action rekindled debate over the restrictions,\nwith some enthusiasts arguing that they felt cheated out of owning a gun. The\ngovernment banned a version of the shotgun that holds seven rounds but\napproved a five-round version. There are also efforts to lower the legal age\nof supervised shooters in Tasmania, to 15 from 16.Senator David Leyonhjelm,\nwho supports easing gun controls, said Australia resembled Britain, Canada and\nNew Zealand, where mass shootings are infrequent. “America is an outlier,” he\nsaid. “We are not like America.”In the 18 years before the Port Arthur\nmassacre, there were 12 mass shootings in Australia, according to a 2006 study\nin the journal Injury Prevention. The deadliest shooting since 1996 occurred\nlast year, when a farmer in New South Wales fatally shot his wife and three\nchildren before killing himself.Tasmania’s former premier, Tony Rundle, said\nreaching the 1996 agreement was difficult and warned against revising it. “I\ntold people all over the country, in town hall meetings, we don’t want to go\ndown the path that America has traveled,” said Mr. Rundle, who is now retired.\n“Eroding those laws now, chipping away at the edges, would be a folly.”Mr.\nHoward, the prime minister who pushed through the measures, agreed. “There\nshould be no relaxation, complacency or compromise,” he said in an interview.\n“That is the view of people all around Australia.”\n\n", "title" : "How a Conservative-Led Australia Ended Mass Killings - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "There have been no mass killings in Australia since the nation tightened its gun control laws almost 20 years ago http://nyti.ms/1TG8kPT", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/672977938988576769", "retweets" : 1421, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-12-04T11:16:58.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 1497, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "672977938988576769" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1TG8kPT" }

In total,\n130 people died across the city, and many more were injured.Performing at the\nOlympia Concert Hall on Boulevard des Capucines, the rough-and-tumble\nCalifornia rock band invited all of the survivors of the November attacks to\nattend; many were in the audience. “It’s the first concert of the rest of my\nlife,” one of them, Emilie, told Le Monde.Although not all of them could make\nit through the entire performance — some, visibly distressed, left midway\nthrough, carrying signs in honor of lost loved ones — it was an evening\nultimately devoted to the enduring strength of Paris itself.Jesse Hughes, the\nband’s frontman, held up a shirt at one point that read: “Live for Paris.” As\nhe told the audience: “You’re stuck with me: I’m Parisian now.”That would make\nHughes only the latest in a long line of Americans who have proclaimed —\nfollowing famous words of the expatriate writer Gertrude Stein — that “America\nis my country, and Paris is my home town.” But the rock musician’s outspoken\npolitical opinions, specifically on the question of gun control, run the risk\nof alienating him from fellow denizens of the City of Light.In an interview\nwith the French TV station iTélé, Hughes, a National Rifle Association\nsupporter and gun enthusiast, had the following to say on the subject: “I’ll\nask you: Did your French gun control stop a single [expletive] person from\ndying at the Bataclan? And if anyone can answer yes, I’d like to hear it,\nbecause I don’t think so.” As he continued: “It just seems like God made men\nand women, and, that night, guns made them equal. Maybe until nobody has guns,\neverybody has to have them.”In an interview with Le Parisien, his remarks were\nslightly more neutral: “I support the right of all to carry a weapon to defend\nthemselves,” he said. “Arms help people defend themselves, no?” As elsewhere\nin Europe, firearms are heavily regulated in France. But perhaps Hughes’s\nunwavering stance comes from an originalist interpretation of “La\nMarseillaise,” the national anthem of his newfound community, which explicitly\nexhorts citizens “aux armes.”He, at least, has answered that call. As he told\niTélé: “I can’t let the bad guys win.”**Read more: **22-year-old offers most\nvivid account yet of surviving Bataclan massacreHorrified survivors recount\nBataclan slaughter: ‘It looked like a battlefield’\n\n", "title" : " ‘Did your French gun control stop a single [expletive] person from dying at the Bataclan?’ - The Washington Post", "twitter" : { "body" : "\"Did your French gun control stop a single [expletive] person from dying at the Bataclan?\" http://wapo.st/1PQBokM", "link" : "https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/699979157791502336", "retweets" : 56, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-16T23:30:10.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 39, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "699979157791502336" }, "topic" : "gun control", "source" : "washingtonpost", "link" : "http://wapo.st/1PQBokM" }

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e7183e955d14d6600b0385" }, "content" : "FLINT, Mich. — Sunday night’s Democratic presidential debate here focused\nheavily on the lead crisis in this majority African American city, as well as\ndifferences between the candidates on issues of trade, jobs, guns and\nfracking.There were also points of agreement on policy – former secretary of\nstate Hillary Clinton joined Sen. Bernie Sanders in his previous call for\nMichigan’s Republican governor to resign in the midst of Flint’s water crisis\n— and few mentions of the emerging GOP field, including front-runner Donald\nTrump. “We have our differences and we get into vigorous debate about issue,\nbut compare the substance of this debate with what you saw on the Republican\nstage last week,” Clinton said to applause. Sanders chimed in: “When you watch\nthese Republican debates, you know why we need to address the mental\nhealth.”But throughout the night, Sanders remained unrelenting in attacking\nClinton for her connections to Wall Street and her positions on past trade\ndeals. Clinton criticized the Vermont senator for his position on gun\nmanufacturer liability and investing in exports.Much of Sunday night’s debate\nin Flint has been about points of contrast between the two Democratic\ncandidates, including intricacies of gun control approaches and trade\npolicies, while they also noted points of agreement, such as dismantling\ninstitutional racism.Clinton has a clearer path to the Democratic nomination\nthan Sanders and leads him by double-digit margins in Michigan polls.\nRegarding fracking, Clinton offered what she cast as a measured approach which\nultimately would result in few “places in America where fracking will be able\nto take place.”But when Sanders was asked whether he supported fracking, he\nresponded: “My answer is a lot shorter: No, I do not support fracking.” In a\nDemocratic primary contest in which African American voters will play a\ncrucial role, Clinton and Sanders were both also asked about their racial\nblind spots by CNN’s Don Lemon, and about their support for a two-decades-old\ncrime bill. Both candidates noted that they had indeed voted for the 1994\ncrime bill, which has been blamed for furthering racial disparities in the\ncriminal justice system, while emphasizing that they want to reform the\ncriminal justice system. The 1994 bill also included provisions for harsher\npenalties regarding violence against women.“I can’t pretend to have had the\nexperience you’ve had,” Clinton told Lemon, “and that others have had, but I\nwill do everything that I possibly can, to do the best I can, to not just\nunderstand and empathize but to tear down the barriers of systematic\nracism.”Sanders echoed Clinton regarding racial blind spots, talking about his\nhistory in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. “We must be firm in making\nit clear that we will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal\njustice system,” Sanders said.The debate also covered the issue of guns, after\nthe father of one of the victims of the Kalamazoo shooting rampage asked the\ncandidates about what they would do to curb the tide of gun violence in\nAmerica.Clinton called for ending the gun show loophole, and criticized\nSanders for his position against holding gun manufacturers legally liable\nfollowing mass shootings. “I voted against giving them immunity, but I think\nwe should very seriously move to repeal that,” she said.Sanders agreed on the\nneed to expand background checks, but disagreed with holding manufacturers\nliable, unless “they understand that they’re selling guns into an area that\nit’s getting into the hands of criminals.”Sanders also criticized Clinton for\nher past support of trade deals, and the former secretary of state opened a\nline of attack on Sanders for his opposition to the Export-Import Bank.“I\nthink we’re in a race for exports,” Clinton argued. “Here in Michigan, there’s\nbeen $11 billion in recent years used to support exports, primarily from small\nbusiness. I favor it, he opposes it.”Sanders, the lone member of the\nDemocratic caucus in the Senate to oppose the Export-Import Bank, fired back,\ndescribing the Export-Import Bank as “the Bank of Boeing” and a source of\nmoney for major corporations.“Democrats are not always right,” Sanders said.\n“Democrats have supported corporate welfare.” Earlier in the debate, Sanders\nand Clinton sparred over trade and jobs, after questions turned from the Flint\nlead water crisis. Sanders had hammered Clinton for her previous support of\ntrade deals. She responded by laying out a series of proposals to create\nincentives for companies to invest and stay in the United States, and\ncriticizing Sanders for voting against the auto bailout.Sanders, responding\nthat the vote was actually one against a Wall Street bailout, cut off Clinton:\n“Excuse me, I’m talking,” he said, prompting “oh’s” from the audience.Clinton\nresponded: “If you’re going to talk then tell the whole story.”The debate\nbegan with both candidates calling for Snyder’s resignation and describing\nFlint’s lead water crisis as an outrageous failure of governance.It’s a call\nthat Sanders has made previously and repeated Sunday night. Clinton joined him\nSunday, saying Snyder should be recalled or should resign.Clinton also said\nthe state should use its “rainy day” fund to help residents in the city. “It’s\nraining lead in Flint and the state is derelict for not coming forward to\nhelp,” Clinton said.News that Sanders won the Maine Democratic caucus Sunday\ncame as the two faced off in Flint. Sanders was expected to do well in Maine,\nand has already won other northeastern states, including his home state of\nVermont and New Hampshire, while Clinton won in Massachusetts. Sunday’s\nvictory in Maine means he will win at least 14 delegates of Maine’s 25 pledged\ndelegates, and Clinton will win at least six, according to the Associated\nPress.Not including Maine’s delegates, Clinton has at least 1,123 total\ndelegates, while Sanders has 484, including superdelegates. The race continues\nto 2,383, the number of delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.The\ndebate, which began at 8 p.m. Eastern time and is being televised on CNN, was\nadded to the Democrats’ schedule after Sanders emerged as a stronger-than-\nexpected challenger. Clinton and Sanders are facing off here in Flint, which\nwas chosen to highlight a two-year-old poisoned-water crisis that has\nparalyzed the majority-African American city.Both candidates have campaigned\nhard in Michigan, which they consider a bellwether for the fall election. The\nstate will serve as a test of Clinton’s institutional support from workers’\nunions and of Sanders’s appeal with the working class.Sanders drew a large\ncrowd for a rally in Warren, Mich., on Saturday, while Clinton held a small\nsession with African American ministers in Detroit before addressing state\nDemocrats at a dinner.Hours before Sunday’s debate began, Sanders called an\nimpromptu news conference where he announced the endorsement of Flint native\nand former U.S. senator Don Riegle. There, Sanders acknowledged that he trails\nClinton in Michigan, in part because he has continued to struggle to reach\nAfrican American voters, who represent about 14 percent of Michigan’s\npopulation.“We started off way, way down here, and I think that gap is\nclosing,” Sanders said at Sunday’s news conference. “The black vote in\nMichigan, the black vote all over the country, is enormously important,” he\nadded. But Sanders noted that he believes the divide has been greater along\ngenerational lines than along racial lines: “Our campaign is doing quite well\nwith younger whites, younger African Americans and younger Latinos.”Sunday\nnight is the first time the candidates have debated since the Super Tuesday\ncontests, when Clinton emerged with a lead of nearly 200 pledged delegates\nover Sanders. She slightly expanded her delegate lead after a crucial win in\nLouisiana on Saturday, while Sanders claimed victories in Nebraska and\nKansas.The Sanders campaign believes that the primary map becomes more\nfavorable to their candidate as the race shifts out of the South, but his\nwindow to overtake Clinton is narrowing. Top Sanders strategists tried to make\nthe case last week that the self-described democratic socialist from Vermont\nstill has a path to the Democratic nomination, which involves winning Michigan\nand other delegate-rich targets such as New York and California.But Clinton’s\nadvisers hope that by April, her delegate advantage will make it virtually\nimpossible for Sanders to claim the nomination. And Clinton has already begun\nshifting her focus on the campaign trail to a potential general election\nmatchup against the Republican front-runner, Donald J. Trump. In recent days,\nshe has pitched supporters with warnings about the GOP field.“We are the last\nline of defense against Trump succeeding President Obama as our 45th\npresident, and we have got to be ready to fight him with every last thing\nwe’ve got,” Clinton told supporters in a fundraising email. Michigan holds its\nprimary Tuesday and is the first of the delegate-rich industrial Midwest\nstates to vote. Sanders views the state as winnable despite Clinton’s steady\nand comfortable lead in state polling.A Detroit Free Press-WXYZ poll released\nlate Saturday shows her leading Sanders 56 percent to 31 percent, a gap that\n“suggests it may be too late for him to battle back to a victory here despite\na strong effort in recent days,” the newspaper wrote.The Democratic candidates\npounced on the Flint water crisis when it exploded in the public’s\nconsciousness in January.The crisis dates to April 2014, when the city, at the\ntime under state oversight, changed its water source from Detroit’s system to\nthe Flint River to save money. Corrosion-control additives were not added to\nthe water supply, which allowed lead from aging pipes to leach into the water\nused by the people in Flint.Complaints about the smell and taste of the water\nemerged almost immediately, but revelations emerged this year that the\nMichigan Department of Environmental Quality and other parts of Republican\nGov. Rick Snyder’s administration dismissed those complaints. Both Clinton and\nSanders have said that the crisis would never have happened in a richer,\nwhiter city.To Democrats, both in Michigan and nationally, the refusal to\nacknowledge the problem and the negligence that created it is emblematic of\nRepublican-led government failure. That Flint is predominantly poor and black\nexacerbated a narrative about Republicans being less concerned about\nminorities.Both Clinton and Sanders have made much of the Flint crisis. The\nformer secretary of state was first, making contact with Flint’s mayor in\nJanuary and incorporating references to the matter in virtually every speech\nsince. Clinton first mentioned the Flint crisis during a debate with Sanders\nin South Carolina, where a majority of Democratic voters are black. She also\nleft a losing campaign in New Hampshire for one day in February to hold a\ncommunity meeting in Flint, and she and her daughter, Chelsea, returned again\nin February.Sanders, who opened a campaign office in Flint, also has visited\nand has been running a television ad in recent weeks highlighting his dismay\nat the situation. Clinton, who has enjoyed strong support among African\nAmerican voters in the South, is expected to do well among black voters in\nMichigan, too. In 2008, 23 percent of voters who participated in Michigan’s\nDemocratic primary were African American, according to exit poll data\npublished by CNN.The senator has increasingly hammered his opponent on trade,\njobs and ties to Wall Street. On Friday, Sanders criticized Clinton’s support\nof trade agreements dating to the North American Free Trade Agreement, passed\nunder her husband. “If the people of Michigan want to make a decision about\nwhich candidate stood with workers against corporate America and against these\ndisastrous trade agreements, that candidate is Bernie Sanders,” he said\nFriday.“With another double-digit victory, we have now won by wide margins in\nstates from New England to the Rocky Mountains and from the Midwest to the\nGreat Plains,” the Sanders campaign said in a statement after the Maine win\nwas announced. “This weekend alone we won in Maine, Kansas and Nebraska. The\npundits might not like it, but the people are making history. We now have the\nmomentum to go all the way to the Democratic National Convention in\nPhiladelphia.”And the Sanders campaign maintains that Michigan is ripe\nterritory for the senator. Michigan has large numbers of working-class and\nstruggling middle-class white voters and union members, a constituency that\nhas gravitated toward Sanders elsewhere.Clinton delivered a speech on jobs and\ntrade on Friday, telling workers at a woman-owned Detroit auto parts\nmanufacturer that she opposes President Obama’s Trans-Pacific Partnership\ntrade deal with Asian nations because it does not offer enough protection for\nAmerican workers.But she warned that protectionism is not the answer,\neither.“There are people in both parties who think we can just shut ourselves\naway,” Clinton said. “But even if the United States never signs another trade\ndeal, globalization isn’t going away.”Michigan Democratic Party Chairman\nBrandon Dillon said the state’s Democrats are pleasantly surprised to be\nplaying a significant role in the nominating contest this year. Although\nMichigan offers 147 delegates, one of the biggest delegate prizes during the\nfirst two months of voting, Dillon said Democrats here had assumed that the\nrace would effectively be over by now. When the primary calendar was set last\nyear, Clinton held a double-digit lead over all potential challengers.“There’s\na lot of excitement, especially around the debate and because when this\nstarted, people didn’t think much attention was going to be paid to Michigan,”\nDillon said.Izadi reported from Washington.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e7183e955d14d6600b0386" }, "content" : "Gun control works, but you have to be smart about it.That's the takeaway from\na major new analysis out this month in the journal Epidemiologic Reviews.\nColumbia University's Julian Santaella-Tenorio and a team of researchers pored\nover the results of 130 studies on gun control legislation passed in 10\ndifferent countries to find out which policy interventions worked, which ones\ndidn't and on what issues the jury was still out.Big caveat up front: Sussing\nout cause from effect in the policy realm is a complicated task. Most of the\nstudies we have on gun violence are able to describe _associations_ \\-- after\nyou pass X law, Y effect happened. But that doesn't necessarily tell you that\nY happened _because_ of X. Researchers can control for various other factors\nthat might also cause Y to happen, like changes in economic situation or\ndemographics, but you can't eliminate uncertainty completely.Still, by looking\nat the totality of available research, like this analysis, you can usually get\na reasonably good picture of the associations between laws and outcomes. Its\nNo. 1 conclusion was that comprehensive gun legislation packages -- which\ninclude an array of different policy changes -- seem to be associated with\nreductions in gun deaths.\"The simultaneous implementation of laws targeting\nmultiple elements of firearms regulations reduced firearm-related deaths in\ncertain countries,\" Santaella-Tenoria and his colleagues conclude.The research\nsuggests that a package of various gun law reforms is better than the sum of\nits parts. For instance, Australia's National Firearms Agreement (NFA) of 1996\nbanned the ownership of certain types of guns, implemented a mandatory buyback\nprogram for some weapons and included provisions on background checks,\nlicensing and mental health requirements. Overall, the research Santaella-\nTenoria and his colleagues surveyed found that \"following the implementation\nof the NFA, a decline in firearm deaths and firearm suicides, as well as an\nabsence of mass shootings, occurred.\"Similar effects were found after multi-\npronged gun reforms were implemented in Brazil and South Africa.But results\nwere more mixed when it came to individual pieces of legislation. The United\nStates's famous assault weapons ban? \"No association between the law and\nhomicide rates in 15 states,\" one study found. The research on concealed-carry\nlaws is all over the place -- some has shown that more guns lead to more gun\ncrime, while other research shows precisely the opposite. Studies also showed\nthat voluntary gun buyback programs also appear to have little effect on\nhomicide rates.On the other hand, one particular policy intervention seems to\nhave a profound effect on reducing accidental gun deaths among children -- so-\ncalled \"child access prevention\" laws, which mandate safe storage of firearms\nand penalize gun owners who leave firearms out in the reach of children. \"Most\nstudies in the United States show that additional laws allowing for felony\nprosecution of offenders are associated with greater reductions in\nunintentional deaths among children,\" the authors found.Another area where the\nresearch was largely in agreement was gun background checks -- specifically,\nbackground checks that included checks on domestic violence restraining\norders. \"Studies on background checks suggest that the quality of systems used\nto review applicants, in terms of the access to local and federal information\non mental health conditions and criminal and domestic violence history, is a\ncritical component of these laws,\" the researchers found.One key point that\nSantaella-Tenorio's team stressed is that the existing body of gun violence\nresearch is still largely incomplete. \"Improving data on non-fatal gun-related\ninjuries will give us a much better understanding of the scope of the impact\nof these laws,\" he told me in an email. \"Current research focuses mostly on\nthe impact of firearm laws on gun-related deaths only, not on non-fatal\ninjuries.\"Most research focuses only on gun-related deaths, since those tend\nto leave a big paper trail that experts can analyze later. But firearm-related\ninjuries are at least twice as prevalent as fatalities, meaning that most of\nthe existing research is blind to one of the biggest effects of gun\nviolence.**More from Wonkblog:**Tennessee’s new official state rifle is so\npowerful it can ‘destroy commercial aircraft’People are getting shot by\ntoddlers on a weekly basis this yearWe've had a massive decline in gun\nviolence in the United States.

And\naccording to two outside scientists, we shouldn't.\"That’s too big -- I don’t\nbelieve that,\" said David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at the\nHarvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \"These laws are not that strong. I\nwould just be flabbergasted; I’d bet the house if you did [implement] these\nlaws, if you had these three laws and enforced them really well and reduced\ngun deaths by 10 percent, you'd be ecstatic.\"\"Briefly, this is not a credible\nstudy and no cause and effect inferences should be made from it,\" Daniel\nWebster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy &amp; Research\nwrote in an e-mail.The lead author, epidemiologist Bindu Kalesan of Boston\nUniversity, said that the study published in The Lancet provides policymakers\nthe hard evidence they need to prioritize individual gun control laws that\nwould have the biggest impact: background checks for gun and ammunition buyers\nand ballistic fingerprinting that allows bullets to be matched to the guns\nthat fired them. Implementing background checks for gun buyers at the federal\nlevel, alone, would cut firearm deaths in half, the study found.If ammunition\nbackground checks and ballistic fingerprinting were also implemented at the\nfederal level, the study finds, the 2010 rate of death in the U.S. from\nfirearms, 10 per 100,000, could drop to less than 1 per 100,000.\"We know\nthat's a stretch, but we still think we can,\" Kalesan said.To critics who do\nnot believe a 90 percent decline is realistic, she points to two states:\nLouisiana and Massachusetts. In Louisiana, 19 of 100,000 people died of\nfirearm deaths in 2010. In Massachusetts, which has stricter gun control laws,\nthat rate is 4 per 100,000. She and colleagues controlled in the study for\nmany of the factors that could influence likelihood of gun death beyond gun\ncontrol policies -- including unemployment, gun ownership, gun export rates\nand non-firearm homicides.\"The validity has to be established with the next\nsteps. We provide the first evidence that the three laws may reduce gun death\nrates. Now for the next step. Seldom is research a 1-stop process,\" Kalesan\nwrote in an e-mail.But Webster and Hemenway -- who both say there is a growing\nand compelling body of evidence that gun control, and particularly background\nchecks, do work \\-- cautioned against reading too much into some of its\nspecific findings.Why the impasse?As anyone who has read a medical study\nknows, trying to parse cause and effect merely by observing the world around\nus is complex. Does coffee make us healthier, or is there something subtly\ndifferent about coffee drinkers and those who don't partake?Well, the same\nthing applies to understanding gun control laws. People may have very\ndifferent inherent risks of death by firearm simply depending on whether they\nlive in a rural or urban area. And while gun control laws may affect death\nfrom firearms, so will other factors, such as urban environments, poverty and\ngang violence.Kalesan's team made an effort to account for differences that\ncould change risk of firearm death in different states. But Webster and\nHemenway said that there were many other factors that can influence a person's\nlikelihood of dying by gunshot.Hemenway pointed out that this isn't a flaw\nunique to this study -- the entire literature on gun policy comes with\ninherent limitations due to the nature of the data, and he suggested it is\nbest to think of this new study as a part of the whole instead of as a policy\nprescription for how to do away with gun deaths. Taken together with a bunch\nof other research, it supports the broad idea that gun control laws work.Some\nof the particulars of the study, however, are less clear. For example, the\nstudy found that ballistic fingerprint laws that require bullets to be able to\nbe traced by guns had the third biggest effect on reducing overall firearm\ndeaths and the strongest effect on preventing suicide death. Webster said that\nthose fingerprinting laws aren't even currently being implemented, raising the\nquestion of how they would prevent gun deaths -- and particularly in suicides\nwhere tracing the bullet to the gun hardly seems like a deterrent. Kalesan\nsaid that that the laws would result in fewer guns, and said the study wasn't\ndesigned to distinguish how policy contributions to suicide or homicide\ndeaths.In an accompanying comment, Hemenway pointed out possible statistical\nproblems and questioned its finding that nine minor laws might increase\nfirearm fatalities, such as police inspection of firearm dealers or required\ntheft reporting by gun dealers.Instead of assigning too much importance to\nthose findings, he thinks its reasonable to look at the study as yet another\npiece of supporting evidence for the broader idea gun control works.But\nWebster took a different perspective, noting that any research on the effects\nof gun control policy can be politicized and that a high-profile study that is\nflawed but in favor of gun control laws could shake people's faith in the\nscience and fuel critics to question the study's ultimate conclusion that gun\ncontrol works. He said he frequently finds himself explaining to policy makers\nand the public that they should be cautious in accepting research that hasn't\nbeen peer-reviewed and published in a journal.\"What I find both puzzling and\ntroubling is this very flawed piece of research is published in one of the\nmost prestigious scientific journals around,\" Webster said in an\ninterview.\"Something went awry here, and it harms public trust.\"_This story\nhas been updated._**Read More:**The death toll from guns no one talks\naboutWe’ve had a massive decline in gun violence in the United States.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71a7d955d14d6aff1027a" }, "content" : "Billionaire climate activist Tom Steyer has spent millions of dollars trying\nto make climate change a major issue on the 2016 campaign trail. But neither\nthe candidates nor the voters seem to notice.After one of the Democratic\npresidential debates, Mr. Steyer issued a statement lamenting that the focus\non climate change was “far too brief.” Following a Republican debate, he\nexpressed outrage that “not a single Republican presidential candidate took\nthis threat seriously,” to which he added, “And that’s why not a single one of\nthese candidates is qualified to get anywhere near the Oval Office.”To be\nfair, Mr. Steyer does appear to hold sway over the Democratic presidential\ncandidates. Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have, at Mr. Steyer’s\ninsistence, pledged to achieve at least 50 percent “clean” energy by 2030. Mr.\nSteyer, who has yet to throw his support behind a candidate, appears to be\ndangling his wealth and endorsement over the Democratic candidates to cajole\nthem to do even more.Just days before the New Hampshire primary, Mrs. Clinton\nwas asked if she would support banning the extraction of natural gas, oil, and\ncoal on public lands. “Yeah, that’s a done deal,” was her reply. Clarifying\nher position to another activist, she said, “No future extraction. I agree\nwith that.” Similarly, Mr. Sanders has co-sponsored legislation in the Senate\nthat would block the development of these resources on federal lands.\nAccording to a recent study commissioned by the Institute for Energy Research,\nof which I am president, these “keep it in the ground” proposals would forgo\nmillions of jobs, trillions of dollars in higher wages, and $20.7 trillion in\neconomic activity.Fortunately, on the whole, Mr. Steyer’s campaign to restrict\naffordable and reliable energy isn’t getting many converts. Mr. Steyer spent\n$73.7 million of his own money in a failed effort to make climate change a\nmajor issue in the 2014 elections. He wasted millions of dollars on ads that\noften didn’t even address climate change and whose truthfulness was disputed\nby fact-checking organizations like Poltifact and Factcheck.org. After his\nnearly yearlong campaign, climate change actually dropped as a priority among\nvoters, ending up near the bottom of their list of concerns.Mr. Steyer\nshouldn’t be entirely surprised if presidential hopefuls aren’t jumping\nthrough his hoops with enthusiasm. In a recent Gallup poll of the most\nimportant problems facing the United States, climate change was not even\nlisted. The broader “Environment/Pollution” was in 18th place as a concern of\njust 2 percent of the respondents. The political reality is that candidates\nmust attract the mainstream electorate, who prioritize the economy, jobs and\npoverty — issues that are in direct conflict with Mr. Steyer’s goals.Mr.\nSteyer’s own state of California is ripe with examples of his agenda clashing\nwith the people’s needs. Due in part to regulations that require non-\nhydroelectric renewables to represent 33 percent of the state’s electricity\nsupply by 2020, residential electricity bills are nearly 40 percent higher\nthan the national average and the ninth highest in the nation. Nevertheless,\nlast year, Mr. Steyer testified in favor of legislation that would have bumped\nthe current 33 percent renewables target up to 50 percent by 2030.Mr. Steyer\nalso supports California’s cap-and-trade program, which could raise gasoline\nprices by anywhere from 16 cents to 76 cents per gallon. Meanwhile, he’s\npushing a ballot measure that would impose a 10 percent tax on oil extraction.\nThis tax would, of course, raise gasoline prices for the state’s motorists,\nwho already pay a 59 cents per gallon gas tax — one of the nation’s highest\nand about 11 cents more than the national average. Even without new taxes,\nCalifornia already has some of the highest gasoline prices in the\ncountry.Higher energy costs have created a serious problem in California.\nAccording to a report by the Manhattan Institute, one million California\nhouseholds live in energy poverty, which is defined as a household in which 10\npercent or more of the residents’ income is spent on household energy costs\n(excluding gasoline and other transportation-related costs). Higher energy\ncosts leave these families with less money to spend on other necessities like\ngroceries or proper healthcare.Candidates seeking the presidential nomination\n— particularly in the Democratic camp — can’t square their rhetoric with their\npolicies. They claim to help the poor, but they support energy policies that\nwill make it harder for low-income families to make ends meet. Meanwhile, poll\nafter poll shows Americans are more concerned about growing the economy and\ncreating jobs than sacrificing their economic futures at the altar of Tom\nSteyer’s climate agenda.**• **_Thomas J.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71a7d955d14d6aff1027c" }, "content" : "Yesterday it was still February, but the high temperature hit 64 degrees here\nin Washington, with snow drifts still melting from last month’s massive East\nCoast blizzard. So what are we to make of the weather and the climate change\ncontroversy? Is it getting warmer or colder?It’s not even a question worth\nasking, as far as the analysts at NASA are concerned. Before the blizzard hit,\nthey had already announced that 2015 was the hottest year on record. Not that\nthis is anything new for most Americans. We hear dire global warming\nproclamations on a near-daily basis, and it’s always just been the hottest\nday, week, month or year — no matter what the weather’s like outside.Yet, as\nclimate expert David Kreutzer recently pointed out, NASA is fairly selective\nabout which information you’re supposed to believe. The agency’s own satellite\ndata shows that while last year was indeed warm, it wasn’t as warm as 2010 or\n1998.But wait, some may say. You can chalk up this discrepancy to the\ndifference between what the satellite data says and what the surface\ntemperatures are (which NASA gathers from thousands of sites worldwide, with a\nfew “adjustments” thrown in). But it doesn’t matter. Neither data set supports\nthe wild predictions being bandied about by global warming alarmists.Search\nall the data for evidence of the accelerated warming projected by the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and you come up empty-handed.\nSometimes temperatures go up, but not always. There’s no constant warming.\nIndeed, the data show a significant moderation of the warming trend. At times\nit appears to have leveled off or even cooled a bit.Should we be surprised?\nNot really. When you throw in variables such as measurement errors, as well as\nEl Nino and La Nina, it makes sense that the average temperature for some\nyears will be higher even if the overall trend is flat.“Will the trend stay\nflat? Probably not,” Mr. Kreutzer writes. “The Earth has been recovering from\nthe Little Ice Age for a couple of centuries and recovering from a real ice\nage for thousands of years. So there is a reasonable chance that we will\nrevert to an overall warming trend, but there is no guarantee. Who knows? We\nmight even be headed into another ice age (as was predicted in the\n1970s).”None of this is to say that human-caused carbon-dioxide emissions\nhaven’t contributed to some warming. They likely have. But the bottom line is\nthat, one way or the other, there’s no reason to believe that the sky is\nfalling. Or, to be more exact, that the earth beneath it is warming up to\nlevels that should frighten us.No data points to catastrophic warming,\nhysterical predications aside. And, it should be noted, the National Oceanic\nand Atmospheric Administration and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange show that there have been no upward trends in hurricanes, tornadoes,\nfloods or droughts.Small wonder then, that liberal groups who are vested in\nglobal warming alarmism often ignore data that contradict their agenda. They\ntell us repeatedly that the debate is over, as if there is an expiration date\non free speech. Unfortunately, too many in the media comply. Some outlets,\nsuch as the Los Angeles Times, won’t even accept letters to the editor that\nquestion the gospel of man-made climate change.Hence we get very selective\nreporting. “For example, the national media hyped NASA’s finding that 2014 was\nthe hottest year on record,” writes Republican Rep.

It’s\ncertainly scarce in Washington, where the quest for knowledge is vulnerable to\nthe bias of politics. Skeptics of President Obama’s climate change agenda say\nthey see new evidence of fraud. If administration officials are colluding with\nscientists to cook the evidence, such as it might be, to demonstrate that the\nplanet is warming, the skeptics deserve everyone’s thanks.Whistleblowers\nwithin the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) complained\nlast year that a major study by agency researcher Thomas Karl, refuting\nevidence of a pause in global warming, had been rushed to publication. The\nimplication was that the study was coordinated with Obama administration\nofficials to add to the urgency of the president’s climate change agenda in\nadvance of the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris. Republicans\non the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology issued a subpoena of\nrecords of NOAA communications dealing with the study.The inquiry began afresh\nlast month when Rep. Lamar Smith, wrote to NOAA expressing disappointment\n“with the slow pace and limited scope of the agency’s production [of such\nrecords],” which had yielded only 301 pages. Mr. Smith directed officials to\nbroaden their search for relevant documents. He said the committee had\nreceived a letter signed by 325 scientists, engineers, economists and other\nscholars questioning whether the agency had properly peer-reviewed the\n“quality, objectivity, utility and integrity” of the data used in the Karl\nstudy.Data consist of facts, and facts can be cherry-picked to yield a desired\neffect. In the NOAA study, researchers found that ocean temperatures measured\nby ships were warmer than those recorded by buoys anchored in place, and\nscientists “developed a method to correct the difference between ship and buoy\nmeasurements.” Ship’s engines, however, can heat nearby water and produce\nfalse readings. By including those values, critics contend, the agency may\nhave effectively erased evidence of the global warming pause.President Obama’s\nefforts to “re-engineer” the American energy industry is based on the argument\nthat combustion of fossil fuels endangers the planet, and a rapid transition\nto renewable power sources is essential. The argument was the basis for the\nParis climate change agreement, endorsed by nearly 200 nations. If documents\nwere to emerge suggesting temperature data was doctored to reach an expedient\nconclusion in the NOAA study, and if White House officials were part of such a\nscheme, that would be proof that science had been recruited to serve politics.\nTrust in government would be further eroded.This would not be the first\ninstance of Obama-era back-channel scheming. Republican members of the Senate\nEnvironment and Public Works Committee issued a report last summer accusing\nthe Environmental Protection Agency of colluding with the Natural Resources\nDefense Council and other “green” organizations to develop the president’s\nlandmark Clean Power Plan, which will saddle Americans with billions of\ndollars in higher energy bills for decades to come. EPA officials quietly\nschemed with environmentalists to write regulations reinforcing their shared\nclimate change agenda. The agency has denied the accusations.Science must be\nfree from pressure to validate political goals. If findings and measurements\nare altered to serve a political agenda, the findings are flawed. It’s called\nfraud, and should be punished.\n\n", "title" : "EDITORIAL: The doctored science of global warming - Washington Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "EDITORIAL: The doctored science of #globalwarming http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/3/editorial-the-doctored-science-of-global-warming/#.VtkAiXbZA28.twitter  #climatechange pic.twitter.com/cBeByjaVLI", "link" : "https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/705596484750852096", "retweets" : 22, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-03T11:31:25.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 11, "hashtags" : "#globalwarming # #climatechange", "id" : "705596484750852096" }, "topic" : "climate change", "source" : "washtimes", "link" : "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/3/editorial-the-doctored-science-of-global-warming/" }

Researchers analyzed chemical isotopes in\nboulders that were left by advancing glaciers over the last 1,000 years in\nSouthwestern Greenland and nearby Baffin Island. Evidence points to a\ndifferent story where Vikings settled a far colder, icier Greenland.The\nfindings reveal that the Medieval Warm Period, a balmy season that Europe\nexperienced from 950-1250, was not felt elsewhere, including Greenland.\nRecords show that Vikings first sailed from Iceland to Greenland in 985. They\nsettled there in the 10th Century and anywhere from 3,000-5,000 settlers lived\non Greenland, farming and harvesting walrus ivory.**Related: **Stonehenge\nstones may have been first erected in another country“It’s becoming clearer\nthat the Medieval Warm Period was patchy, not global,” said lead author\nNicolás Young, a glacial geologist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty\nEarth Observatory, in a statement. “The concept is Eurocentric - that’s where\nthe best-known observations were made. Elsewhere, the climate might not have\nbeen the same.”The research not only challenges climate theories about the\ntime when Greenland was settled by Vikings, it also calls into question long-\nheld beliefs about the disappearance of the Viking settlers a handful of\ngenerations later. It was once believed that the colonies, which vanished\nsometime between 1360 and 1460, succumbed to a colder climate. The Vikings’\ndisappearance was thought to have followed the onset of the so-called Little\nIce Age, which ran from about 1300-1850. Experts, however, have questioned\nthis theory, noting the lack of early historical climate records from\nGreenland.While the disappearance of the colonies remains a mystery, other\ntheories now include hostility with the native Inuit, a decline in ivory trade\nand soil erosion caused by the Vikings’ cattle.**Related:** Ancient 'wand' may\nbe oldest example of lead work in the Levant“I do not like the simplistic\nargument that the Greenland people went there when it was warm, and then ‘it\ngot cold and they died’,” said Astrid Ogilvie, a climate historian based at\nIceland’s Akureyri University, in the statement. “I think the Medieval Warm\nPeriod has been built on many false premises, but it still clings to the\npopular imagination.”Europeans did not re-inhabit Greenland until the\n1700s.The rocks were analyzed at the University of Buffalo, and at the Lamont-\nDoherty lab of geochemist and study coauthor Joerg Schaefer. The analyses\nmeasured buildups of small amounts of Beryllium 10, an isotope created when\ncosmogenic rays strike rock surfaces newly exposed by melting ice, according\nto the statement.In addition to Young and Schaefer, the paper was coauthored\nby Avriel Schweinsberg and Jason Briner of the University at Buffalo, who\ncarried out the Greenland part of the fieldwork.__\\+ Follow**FoxNewsSciTech**\non Facebook\n\n", "title" : "Climate change didn't force Vikings to abandon Greenland, scientists say | Fox News", "twitter" : { "body" : "Climate change didn't force Vikings to abandon Greenland, scientists say http://fxn.ws/1OSseFG via @fxnscitech pic.twitter.com/4ERIxC2wun", "link" : "https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/674494954668843008", "retweets" : 72, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-12-08T15:45:03.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "@fxnscitech", "favs" : 118, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "674494954668843008" }, "topic" : "climate change", "source" : "FoxNews", "link" : "http://fxn.ws/1OSseFG" }

Some delegates started crying. Others embraced.“In short,\nthis agreement will mean less of pollution that threatens our planet. Full\nimplementation of this agreement and will pave the way for more progress in\nstages over the years. It sends a powerful signal: a low carbon future, in\nclean energy at a scale we have never seen before.” Obama said.The pact, known\nas “the Paris agreement,” is supposed to take effect in 2020 and strives to\nlimit global temperature rise even more, to 1.5 degrees Celsius.Sky News\nreported that countries most vulnerable to climate change had lobbied for the\n1.5C limit while big polluters such as China, India and Saudi Arabia preferred\n2C.In his remarks, Obama also hit back at critics and “skeptics [who] said\nthese actions would kill jobs.”“Instead…we have driven our economic output to\nall-time highs in nearly two decades.”“All countries have a role to play in\nclimate change, wind and solar [energy] …creating a new and steady stream of\nmiddle class jobs,” Obama said.Responding to the climate pact’s approval,\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., called its goals\n“unattainable,” and slammed Obama’s claims about what the international deal\nwould achieve:“The President is making promises he can’t keep, writing checks\nhe can’t cash, and stepping over the middle class to take credit for an\n‘agreement’ that is subject to being shredded in 13 months,” the Senate’s top\nRepublican, and a staunch Obama critic, said in a statement released following\nthe speech.Secretary of State John Kerry praised the new accord as a \"victory\nfor all of the planet and for future generations.\"Kerry told fellow\nnegotiators Saturday in Paris that \"it will help the world prepare for the\nimpacts of climate change that are already here and also for those that we\nalready know are on our way inevitably.\"He added the pact would \"prevent the\nworst most devastating consequences of climate change from ever happening.\"The\nvote to adopt the agreement was held up for two hours because of a last-minute\nsnag involving the U.S., the Associated Press reported, citing a Western\ndiplomat as its source.The diplomat said the U.S. wanted the word \"shall\"\nchanged to \"should\" in a clause on emissions targets out of fears that it\nmight require the Obama administration to seek approval from the Republican-\ncontrolled Senate.Hours earlier, Fabius said the climate talks would be a\n“historic turning point” if delegates were to adopt the final draft as\npresented by the French government.The deal on climate change will limit\nwarming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), Fabius\nsaid, according to Sky News.“The world is holding its breath, it’s counting on\nall of us,” the minister added.In the pact, the countries pledge to limit the\namount of greenhouse gases emitted by human activity to the same levels that\ntrees, soil and oceans can absorb naturally, beginning at some point between\n2050 and 2100.In practical terms, achieving that goal means the world would\nhave to stop emitting greenhouse gases -- most of which come from the burning\nof oil, coal and gas for energy -- altogether in the next half-century,\nscientists said. That's because the less we pollute, the less pollution nature\nabsorbs.Achieving such a reduction in emissions would involve a complete\ntransformation of how people get energy, and many activists worry that despite\nthe pledges, countries are not ready to make such profound and costly\nchanges.The deal now needs to be ratified by individual governments -- at\nleast 55 countries representing at least 55 percent of global emissions --\nbefore taking effect.Negotiators had a few hours to analyze the draft before\nthe vote to adopt it took place. French President Francois Hollande, who\njoined the meeting Saturday to underscore the deal’s importance, urged\napproval.“The decisive agreement for the plant is here and now,” Hollande\nsaid. “France calls upon you to adopt the first universal agreement on\nclimate.”An air of optimism surrounded the negotiations late Friday that had\nbeen missing only hours earlier.\"We are pretty much there,\" Egyptian\nEnvironment Minister Khaled Fahmy, the chairman of a bloc of African\ncountries, told The Associated Press late Friday. \"There have been tremendous\ndevelopments in the last hours. We are very close.\"A top climate scientist who\nwas critical of draft negotiation texts on Friday has praised the final draft\nas being consistent with science.John Schellnhuber, director of Germany's\nPotsdam Institute for Climate Research, says that \"if agreed and implemented,\nthis means bringing down greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero within a few\ndecades.\"He says the accord presented Saturday \"is in line with the scientific\nevidence we presented of what would have to be done to limit climate risks\nsuch as weather extremes and sea-level rise. To stabilize our climate, CO2\nemissions have to peak well before 2030 and should be eliminated as soon as\npossible after 2050.\"The  draft removes controversial terms like \"climate\nneutrality\" or \"emissions neutrality\" which had appeared in earlier drafts but\nwere met with opposition from countries including China.The deal marks the\nworld’s first comprehensive climate agreement with all countries, not just\nwealthy ones, taking action to tackle global warming.The agreement comes after\nmore than two decades of U.N. efforts to persuade governments to work together\nto reduce the man-made emissions that scientists say are warming the planet.\nMelting glaciers, rising seas and expanding deserts linked to such climate\nchange are threatening populations around the world, the Associated Press\nreported.Activists held protests across Paris on Saturday, demanding even\ntougher limits and to call attention to populations threatened by climate\nchange.\"This puts the fossil fuel industry on the wrong side of history,\" said\nKumi Naidoo of Greenpeace. \"This deal alone won't dig us out of the hole we're\nin.\"The world has already warmed by about 1 degree Celsius since pre-\nindustrial times, and poor low-lying nations have pushed to set a goal of\nlimiting the rise to another half-degree on top of that.Ben Strauss, a sea\nlevel researcher at Climate Central, said limiting warming to 1.5 degrees\ninstead of 2 degrees could potentially cut in half the projected 280 million\npeople whose houses will eventually be submerged by rising seas.The previous\nemissions treaty, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, included only rich countries and\nthe U.S. never signed on.

And what are the limits of engineering fixes to climate change\nand rising seas? To learn about that, I called up Susanne Torriente, assistant\ncity manager and \"chief resiliency officer\" for Miami Beach, a 90,000-person\nisland municipality off the coast of Miami proper. The following is a\ntranscript of our conversation, edited for length and clarity: **CNN: Do you\nthink Miami Beach can survive climate change in the long term? **Torriente: I\ndon't know what the long term is, but I know Miami Beach is adapting to\nclimate change. We're starting already. ... We're starting to adapt today. And\nthe approach is really incremental adaptation. What can we do in our one-year\nbudget, in our five-year capital plan -- and maybe in some of our 20-year\nmaster plans -- to start to really start to deliver government services in a\ndifferent way? We have more data nowadays. We have sea level rise projections.\n**CNN: What are you doing today to try to fight sea-level rise? **What they've\ndone here in Miami Beach is an aggressive stormwater program that includes\ninstalling pumps. ... We're installing these pumps that actually take the\nwater and push it out. We're elevating roads. We're working on our seawalls.\nWe have 63 miles of seawalls. Only three (miles) are actually public. But\nwe're looking at elevating those and restoring those. **CNN: I'm wondering how\nthat has worked so far. From what I've read, Miami Beach has seen a lot of\nflooding in recent years associated with higher tides. **Last fall, the pumps\nwere working and those streets were dry. Versus two years ago, you see those\npictures of some of our roads that were really flooded rather high. This year,\nwhere the pumps were installed, they worked. **CNN: When I was driving around\non Miami Beach, I came to these intersections where you feel like you're\nalmost going up a ramp into a parking garage or something. The road level just\ngoes up dramatically. But seeing that I wondered: Does the floodwater just\ncollect below that? If you're just raising the road level, how is that\nhelpful? **Well, you're elevating. So the water's not getting up to you,\nessentially. That's on the public side. And we're also looking at our land use\ncode. Local governments have that kind of building and zoning and planning\nauthority. We are looking at private development -- what should be those\nelevations as well. **CNN: I've read that for other low-lying cities like New\nOrleans there's more potential to put up levees and seawalls to hold the ocean\nback. But because Miami sits on limestone, which is porous, it's hard to do\nthat. The water would just go under them.**I'm not an engineer, but I've heard\nthe engineers talk about, well, are there ways to combat that? Are there ways\nto seal the limestone? I just heard my city engineer talking about that\nearlier this week. Yes, that is a challenge for us. The water does come up\nthrough this porous limestone that we do sit on. It's not as easy as just\nbuilding a wall. That's why we have to work in other ways, like pumping the\nwater out or elevating the roads. **CNN: What would you want to say to someone\nin Miami Beach -- or another coastal community -- who's worried about sea\nlevel rise? **The important message is: Climate change is here and sea level\nis rising. But our eyes are wide open to the issue. We're actively planning\nand we're actively doing. We're actively designing and constructing these\nkinds of incremental adaptation options that continue to reduce our risk. The\nwork we're doing today is safeguarding us for the future. As time passes and\nwe have more information and more data we can continue to build upon what\nwe're doing today. **CNN: I met a Miami Beach resident who told me he is\npacking up and planning to move out of Miami Beach because he's worried about\nthe long term viability of his home, and, more immediately, he's worried about\nhis investment given the risks of climate change. I'm wondering what you think\nof that decision. Do you think it's alarmist? Is it prudent?**I think it's a\npersonal decision. People have their own circumstances in life, and you make\nthose personal decisions. But I do think it's important for the residents here\nto know -- and they do know -- that this city commission and the residents\ntoday here in the city are willing to invest. They raised their stormwater\nrates so we could issue the bonds to pay for these investments. And the\ninvestments we're making are in fact reducing those risks. If were a coastal\ncommunity that was getting flooded and we had our eyes closed and were doing\nnothing, then there should be some worry. But we're a coastal community\nheavily involved in designing and constructing -- and working to reduce that\nrisk. **CNN: I got some comments with people saying this isn't climate change,\nthis isn't happening. This is just the coast of Florida and of course it\nfloods sometimes. How certain are you that what you see happening now is\nclimate change? **We're a local government. We have to be responsible. These\nthings are happening. And so that argument really doesn't happen in South\nFlorida anymore. It's about actually doing something about. **CNN: Marco Rubio\nis from South Florida and is a Republican presidential contender. And I would\nsay he's injecting a lot of false doubt into the climate conversation. I'm\nwondering what you think about that -- or about the election as a whole? **As\na local government appointed official, I'm not going to get into too much of\nthe politics of it. But the science is there. These things are happening. And\nwhoever gets in office needs to understand that these are issues that are\nfacing these communities. We need the help and the coordination from the state\nand the feds. Right now it's really the local governments that are stepping up\nto this. ... It's not a partisan issue down here. **CNN: Is this a pretty\nexpensive problem to deal with? **Yeah. **CNN: I was told you all have pledged\nsomething like $400 million to fight this. **The estimate is somewhere around\n$400 million, and the numbers change as you're out in the field and\nconstructing these things. And it's essentially a three- to five-year program\nto install these pumps in these low-lying areas of the city. South Florida is\ncoastal and low-lying. I kind of say we're flat and flatter. You look at the\nareas that are most vulnerable and start there. **CNN: I think some people\ncould see that number -- $400 million -- and think, 'Oh my gosh, that's a lot\nof money that's being used to fight something that's unwinnable.'**But you\nspent time here, right? This is a vibrant, beautiful coastal community. People\nstill want to come live, work and play here. So, I'm not ready to give up.\n(Laughs). There are a lot of people who are not ready to give up. These\ninvestments continue to reduce our risk and make us less vulnerable and buy\ntime. Yeah, I think the key message is we're not willing to give up. That\nwould be disappointing for a lot of folks. Our eyes are wide open, and we're\nactively involved in making this community beautiful and vibrant and\nresilient. You know, 100 years from now, 200 years from now, it'll be\ndifferent. I joke with my staff that we're creating 'Tomorrowland.' It will\nlook different. Maybe other generations will have to adapt more and learn to\nlive with the water even more. The design of the city will be different. But\nwe're not giving up.**CNN: What do you think that 'Tomorrowland' might look\nlike? **Maybe some roads are allowed to flood or some areas are allowed to\nflood, and we create investments that are built to hold water sometimes and be\ndry in others. There's a whole kind of opportunity to create a different city.\nWe've had conversation with folks from The Netherlands. That's really their\nphrase: \"Learning to live with the water.\" Our behavior may be different, the\nway we conduct our lives, but we've been doing that for years. Generations\nadapt. _Add John D.

Follow him on Snapchat, Facebook and email. The opinions\nexpressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)On Thursday night, the remaining\nRepublican presidential candidates -- led, of course, by Donald Trump -- will\ngather in the Miami area for yet another debate.South Florida, whether or not\nit's stated, is a crucial front line for climate change. And my hope is that\nthe candidates, particularly Trump, won't be able to keep dismissing questions\nabout this issue. For Trump, it's not only rhetoric and votes that are at\nstake. It's property. I plugged the addresses of a few luxury hotels bearing\nthe Trump name into a handy tool developed to visualize the rise in sea levels\nthat's associated with global warming. The Trump International Beach Resort,\nin Sunny Isles Beach, Florida, will sit on a slender island of land at 6 feet\nof sea-level rise, which the federal government says is possible this century.\nIt looks like Trump Hollywood, meanwhile, will be submerged at that point. (Go\nto EyesOnTheRise.org/app, and you can search other locations.)BuzzFeed's Peter\nAldhous had a similar idea and used NOAA data to make gifs out of the coming\nflood for the Trump-name real estate empire in South Florida. Tellingly, he\nquoted a conservative radio host who asked Trump if he believes that \"sea\nlevels are increasing dramatically.\" Trump's reply: \"No, no I don't.\"Super\nobservant of him. I hope he gets pushed on this issue. Even if he doesn't,\nthough, the location of this debate serves to highlight a troubling irony:\nTrump, Ted Cruz (from Houston, another city threatened by rising seas) and\nMarco Rubio, who is from South Florida, all have much that is personally at\nstake when it comes to climate change. They fail to recognize this, however.\nAnd they fail to notice that low-income people will be hurt even worse.\n\"Obama's talking about all of this with the global warming and ... a lot of\nit's a hoax. It's a hoax,\" Trump said at a South Carolina rally, according to\nPolitiFact. \"I mean, it's a money-making industry, OK? It's a hoax, a lot of\nit.\"It's not a hoax. More than 97% of scientists agree it's real and we're\ncausing it by burning fossil fuels and chopping down rainforests. Failing to\nact will lead to coastal flooding, displaced people, poverty, death and mass\nextinction in the plant and animal worlds. It's our moral duty to create a\ncleaner economy. Yet the GOP presidential contenders continue to either deny\nthe existence of human-made climate change or fail to propose the needed\nsolutions. To beat this thing, we need to get off of fossil fuels sometime\naround 2050. None of the presidential candidates, including the Democrats, has\na plan that's bold enough to do what the science tells us must be done if\nwe're not going to imperil future generations. But the Democrats, Hillary\nClinton and Bernie Sanders, boldly acknowledge the reality of climate change,\nthey admit we're causing it, and they have plans to start cutting back on\npollution. This is a crucial difference between the parties that must be\nrecognized. I hope this becomes apparent in Florida on Thursday. Already, the\ncity of Miami Beach, not far from the site of the debate at the University of\nMiami, is spending $400 million to try to pump out floodwater. They're seeing\nfloods on sunny days associated with higher tides. I recently met a resident\nthere who is packing up and planning to move to higher ground because of it.\nThis problem is real. It's massively important. And, luckily, there is still a\nlittle time to address it.Thursday is another chance for Trump and the GOP to\nprove it can change, that it can adopt a rational and informed stance on\nclimate policy and science. South Florida would be the perfect place to do it.\nIf not for the rest of us, then at least for the Trump hotels._Join us on\nFacebook.com/CNNOpinion.__Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine._\n\n", "title" : "The question Donald Trump can't dodge (Opinion) - CNN.com", "twitter" : { "body" : ". @jdsutter : Climate change could impact @realDonaldTrump 's Florida properties http://cnn.it/1p8Dgyi @CNNOpinion pic.twitter.com/KoP0IvrDQl", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CNN/status/707667526281535491", "retweets" : 68, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-09T04:41:00.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "@jdsutter @realDonaldTrump @CNNOpinion", "favs" : 151, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "707667526281535491" }, "topic" : "climate change", "source" : "cnn", "link" : "http://cnn.it/1p8Dgyi" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71a7d955d14d6aff10287" }, "content" : "Washington (CNN)The Supreme Court on Tuesday dealt President Barack Obama a\nblow by moving to temporarily block his administration's rules to limit\ngreenhouse gas emissions from power plants. Reacting to a lawsuit from 29\nstates, as well as the energy industry, justices blocked the Environmental\nProtection Agency's Clean Power Plan from going forward while the rule is\nchallenged in court. The decision means that Obama now has two major legacy\nactions -- immigration and climate change -- stuck in the court system with\nthe specter of a Republican taking over the White House in January. Obama has\npushed action on global warming as a key part of his legacy, an effort that\nreached its peak with the deal at the U.N.-led talks on climate change in\nParis in December. Proponents of the plan did not expect the high court to\nstep in at this juncture , particularly since the United States Court of\nAppeals for the D.C. Circuit will hold oral arguments in June and neither the\nindustry nor the states would have had to come into compliance for at least\ntwo years.. That a divided Supreme Court stepped in at this juncture to block\nthe program after a lower court declined to do so sends a signal that at least\nfive justices are concerned with some aspect of the plan. \"This is an\nexceedingly uncommon situation for the court to step in, and it jeopardizes\nthe plan all together from going into affect while President Obama remains in\noffice,\" said Bruce Huber, professor of law at Notre Dame Law school. \"The\nSupreme Court's order signals serious misgivings among some of the justices\nabout the legality of the plan.\"The four liberal justices on the court -- Ruth\nBader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elana Kagan -- dissented\nfrom the order.In a statement, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said\n\"we disagree\" with the court's action.\"The Clean Power Plan is based on a\nstrong legal and technical foundation, gives states the time and flexibility\nthey need to develop tailored, cost-effective plans to reduce their emissions,\nand will deliver better air quality, improved public health, clean energy\ninvestment and jobs across the country, and major progress in our efforts to\nconfront the risks posed by climate change,\" Earnest said. \"We remain\nconfident that we will prevail on the merits.\"The EPA rule would require\nstates to meet specific carbon emission reduction standards based on their\nindividual energy consumption. It also includes an incentive program for\nstates to get a head start on meeting standards on early deployment of\nrenewable energy.\"Power plants are the single biggest source of harmful carbon\npollution that contributes to climate change,\" Obama said in a video released\nlast August. \"Until now, there have been no federal limits to the amount of\ncarbon pollution plants dump in the air.\"Senior administration officials said\nTuesday they were \"surprised\" by the high court's action. One official called\nthe court's move \"extraordinary and unprecedented,\" saying it's rare for the\nSupreme Court to grant a stay on a rule whose legality hasn't been reviewed by\na lower court.But officials nonetheless expressed confidence in the\npresident's climate plan moving forward, even as it becomes exceedingly\nunlikely the litigation process is resolved by the time Obama leaves office.\nThey said individual states could still move forward with implementing plans\nto reduce carbon output, and added the court's decision was unlikely to affect\nthe U.S. commitment to the international climate accord agreed to in Paris in\nDecember.\"We've always known that this rule was going to be litigated and that\nthere were going to be opponents that were going to challenge the rule under\nany circumstances. And so I think the bottom line is that this decision is not\none that we agree with, but it's a procedural decision and we'll have the\nopportunity to make the case on the merits,\" one official said.As for the\nadministration's strategy using executive actions to advance their agenda, the\nofficials were forceful in defending the White House's methods.\"The President\nhas undertaken to do bold things, but only within the parameters of his\nauthority. And while that's certainly triggered a good deal of litigation,\nthat litigation is going to play out, whether it's immigration, or health\ncare, or anything else,\" one official said. \"Because he's confident in the\nadvice he gets from the Department of Justice about the legality of his\nactions, he's going to keep doing what he thinks is appropriate to help the\nAmerican people,\" the official continued. \"And I don't think there's a single\nlawsuit, on any issue, that would deter him from doing anything he can to help\nthe American people in whatever time is left in this\nadministration.\"Congressional Republicans have fought the rules, voting to\nblock the EPA limits on the same day Obama spoke at the Paris talks. And the\nadministration's actions on climate change have been regularly criticized on\nthe campaign trail by Republican candidates. House Speaker Paul Ryan called\nthe rule \"unlawful\" in a statement Tuesday.\"This rule should be struck down\npermanently before coal country is destroyed completely, and American\nconsumers are consigned to higher energy prices,\" Ryan said. \"Great news for\nWyoming &amp; American energy. Republicans will do what we can to keep this\nrule permanently blocked,\" Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, tweeted.Karen\nHarned, executive director of the National Federation of Independent Business\nSmall Business Legal Center, celebrated the Supreme Court's action. \"What the\ncourt said today is that states cannot be forced to comply with a regulation\nthat it may ultimately decide is unconstitutional. This is a temporary but\nimportant victory for small businesses, which were facing substantially higher\nenergy costs.\"David Doniger, director of the climate and clean air program at\nthe Natural Resources Defense Council, said he is \"confident the courts will\nultimately uphold the Clean Power Plan on its merits. The electricity sector\nhas embarked on an unstoppable shift from its high-pollution, dirty-fueled\npast to a safer, cleaner-powered future, and the stay cannot reverse that\ntrend. Nor can it dampen the overwhelming public support for action on climate\nchange and clean energy.\"\"If there was ever a Supreme Court decision that\nlooked backwards instead of towards the future, this was it,\" said Jamie Henn\nof the environmental group 350.org.\n\n", "title" : "Supreme Court blocks Obama climate change rules - CNNPolitics.com", "twitter" : { "body" : "#SCOTUS has blocked @POTUS ' climate change rules http://cnn.it/1QUe4Vw pic.twitter.com/0JJ1vEM12c", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CNN/status/697215656345911296", "retweets" : 249, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-09T08:29:00.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "@POTUS", "favs" : 261, "hashtags" : "#SCOTUS", "id" : "697215656345911296" }, "topic" : "climate change", "source" : "cnn", "link" : "http://cnn.it/1QUe4Vw" }

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71a7d955d14d6aff10289" }, "content" : "Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders faced off on Sunday night in Flint, Mich.,\non the debate stage for the seventh time, just two days before the Michigan\nprimary.Here are all of the highlights; all times are Eastern.**10 p.m.:\n**Closing statements. Sanders focuses on his economic message and the crises\naffecting Flint, adding, though, “It’s not just in Flint, Mich..\"“It is too\nlate for establishment politics and establishment economics,\" he said. He also\nhit on the theme that's animated his campaign: “We need in this country a\npolitical revolution.”Clinton said her campaign was about taking on the many\nbarriers facing many Americans, from student debt to “systemic racism.\"**9:53\np.m.**: A few questions about religion. Sanders is asked about his Judaism,\nsaying \"I am very proud to be Jewish, and being Jewish is so much of what I\nam.\" He cites the impact the Holocaust had on his family, saying his faith is\nan “essential part of who I am as a human being.\"Clinton is asked who she\nprays for and says she prays for people she knows and those going through\nspecific difficult periods in their lives.She added: “I pray for the will of\nGod to be known so that we can know it and to the best of our limited ability\ntry to follow it and fulfill it.”**9:49 p.m.**:Clinton is asked about her\nemails, which Trump promises to talk about daily. “His bigotry, his bullying,\nhis bluster are not going to wear well on the American people,” she said. “I\nwill look forward to engaging him.” Sanders cites polls showing him beating\nTrump by larger margins than Clinton does.**9:37 p.m**.:Clinton is asked\nwhether she supports fracking. “I don’t support it when any locality or any\nstate is against it,” Clinton says, outlining conditions for fracking. There\nprobably aren’t many places where it should be taking place, she says. My\nanswer is a lot shorter, says Sanders, explaining that he doesn’t support\nfracking.**9:25 p.m**.:The issue is education. The U.S. has one of the highest\nchild poverty rates, says Sanders. “That is a disgrace,” he says. The wealthy\nwill start paying their fair share of taxes to make sure every child gets the\nquality education they need. Clinton wins applause when she says she would end\nthe emergency management of the city of Detroit and turn schools back to local\nofficials. She would also support more federal help, she said, to bring more\nteachers into schools.Sanders said his campaign is about “thinking big.” He\nbelieves public colleges should be tuition-free.**9:14 p.m.:**How would you\nimprove race relations?Sanders says Obama has given us a good base and\nfoundation. He would make sure the Department of Justice investigates every\nsuspicious killing, ends “militarization of police departments,” ends minimal\nsentencing and give judges more discretion. Clinton is asked about her\nprevious comments calling some kids “super predators,” and she says while she\nwas referring to some drug cartels, that she regrets using the language.\nSanders uses the opportunity to hit her on another 1990s piece of legislation:\nwelfare reform. Clinton said she disagrees with the way it was applied and\nthat a lot of provisions were stripped out by Republicans.**9:05\np.m**.:Sanders is asked what experiences he’s had that help him understand\nother cultures. He mentions his early work on desegregating Chicago schools,\nto applause. Clinton goes back to when she was 14 years old and listened to\nDr. King speak, not directly answering the question. “I know I’ve never had\nthe experience that so many people in this audience have had,” she said. She\nsaid she’s asking white people to try to understand what it’s like to be the\nmother of an African-American child shot to death. “It is incredibly\nhumbling,” she said, “because I have not had the experience you have had.”**9\np.m**.:Clinton is asked about her husband’s crime legislation that led to an\nunprecedented increase in incarceration of black males. Aspects of it “were a\nmistake,” she said. Sanders, too, supported the legislation. “In that bill\nthere were some good provisions,” including the Violence Against Women Act, he\nsaid. “At the end of my first term we will not have more people in jail than\nany other country,” he said.**8:50 p.m**.:The issue is guns. The father of a\nyoung girl shot by an Uber driver asks about what new laws should be passed.\n“I don’t want to hear anything about tougher laws for mental health or\nbackground” checks “because that doesn’t work,” he said.Clinton hits Sanders\non his vote for granting immunity for gun makers in a 2005 vote. “We should\nvery seriously move to repeal that,” she says.Sanders says no one can\nguarantee another mass shooting won’t happen. “We’ve got to do everything we\npossibly can,” he said, citing his D- rating from the NRA. He also cites his\nprior support for an assault weapons ban and agreed with Clinton on closing\nthe so-called Charleston loophole that allowed shooter Dylann Roof to acquire\na weapon before completing a background check.Does Sanders agree with the\nSandy Hook family lawsuit against the maker of the gun used in the massacre?\nSanders said if a gun company is knowingly selling guns into crime areas\nthat’s one thing, but suing any gun maker whose weapon happens to end up in\nthe hands of someone who is mentally ill would effectively shut down gun\nmanufacturing in the U.S., he said. Clinton said the gun industry is the only\none in the U.S. with absolute immunity. \"The gun companies sell guns to make\nas much money as they can,\" she says.**8:35 p.m**.:Sanders keeps up his\nassault on trade policies. Detroit went from being one of the richest cities\nin the 1960s to today one of the poorest. Wages are down even adjusted for\ninflation, he said. Clinton subtly raps him for focusing on the 1990s instead\nof the future and defends her husband’s economic record and the U.S. Export-\nImport Bank. Sanders calls it the “Bank of Boeing.” He says “Democrats have\nnot always been right,” including “corporate welfare” and “disastrous trade\npolicies.”**8:30 p.m.**:Sanders goes on the offense again, calling on Clinton\nto release transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street banks. Clinton\nreprises her talking points on how she has talked tough to Wall Street and\nsays current law allows the government to break up big banks if necessary. “I\nhave said I would use the tools” to break up big banks if they pose a systemic\nthreat.**8:23 p.m.:**The issue is trade. Clinton touts her “clawback tax” to\npunish companies that move jobs overseas. Sanders takes a swipe at Clinton for\n“getting religion” on trade. He says he was out protesting with unions in the\nearly 1990s to oppose free trade. Clinton counterpunches by saying that she\nsupported the auto bailout and Sanders didn’t.That draws a fierce rebuke from\nSanders, who calls it the “Wall Street bailout” that ruined the economy.\nClinton says as a senator she voted against the only trade agreement that came\nbefore her in the Senate. She again defends her vote on the auto bailout by\nsaying it’s what the state’s two senators and President Obama wanted. “The\nauto industry would have collapsed, taking 4 million jobs with it,” she\nsaid.**8:16 p.m.:**The question is whether people should go to jail for what\nhappened in Flint. Clinton and Sanders say they’ll support whatever the\noutcome of the investigations are.Another Flint resident asks Clinton why\nshould the people of Flint believe “you aren’t just using the crisis to score\npolitical points?” Clinton cited her longtime advocacy on behalf of kids and\nfamilies and the fact that she was meeting with residents as soon as the\ncrisis became public. “When I am president it will always be a priority for\naction for me,” she said.Sanders is also asked “what took you so long?\"\nSanders said he met “privately” with parents and kids and cites a town hall\nmeeting “as nonpolitical as I could make it” to tell the world through the\nmedia what is happening. His whole career, he said, he’s stood with poor\npeople and the unempowered.**8:10 p.m.:**The moderator asks why is more\ngovernment the answer?“Maybe you should let Wall Street come in and run the\ncity,” Sanders quips. Clinton says if EPA officials at any level were\nresponsible they should be fired. Sanders agrees, answering the question more\ndirectly.**8:05 p.m.: **The first question is from a Flint resident about\nwhat’s needed to restore the trust of the city’s residents in their water\nsource.

They endorse putting body cameras on police officers and accepting\nrefugees from war-torn countries such as Syria.A USA TODAY/Rock the Vote\nMillennial Poll finds an emerging generation that is more pragmatic than\nideological and not yet firmly aligned with either political party. Donald\nTrump leads the Republican field among millennials, and Vermont Sen. Bernie\nSanders the Democratic one — especially among millennial women. Across\npartisan lines, millennials have reached a generational consensus on some of\nthe major issues that have proved divisive for their elders.What is less\ncertain, the national survey shows, is whether they'll bother to vote in 2016,\neven in an election where they identify an agenda they call crucial.President\nObama is preparing to deliver his State of the Union Address before a joint\nsession of Congress on Tuesday night, and the contests to win the Democratic\nand Republican nominations to succeed him begin in just three weeks — an apt\nmoment to look at attitudes of a demographic tide that over time is likely to\nreshape American politics. The poll is part of USA TODAY's One Nation\ninitiative, a series of forums across the country on the most important issues\nof 2016.USA TODAY Network's One Nation is a series of 10 forums in 10 cities\non topics shaping the presidential election. (Photo: USA TODAY)The online\nsurvey by Ipsos, the first of four this year in conjunction with Rock the\nVote, was taken last Monday through Thursday of 1,141 adults, ages 18 through\n34. The credibility interval, akin to a margin of error, is plus or minus 3.5\npercentage points.\"I'm a voter,\" declares Stephanie Acs, 27, a Navy veteran\nnow attending school in Albuquerque who was among those polled. \"If I have a\nview on something, I don't just post it on Facebook or Twitter.\" But Dewayne\nSmithy, 33, of Baldwin, Miss., dismisses the idea that casting a ballot is\nlikely to make a difference. \"I can't really find a candidate that I like, for\none thing,\" he said in a follow-up phone interview.The top issue by far for\nmillennials is the economy, including concerns about jobs, the minimum wage\nand paid leave. On that, millennials have the same pocketbook focus as baby\nboomers and Gen Xers. \"I want to make sure the economy is flourishing,\" says\nMisha Shah, 32, of Chicago, an account executive for a tech firm that sells\nnetworking and storage. \"When the economy slows down, it's a domino effect.\nThat's when companies start getting leaner\" and layoffs can threaten.The\neconomy also matters to Yendri Badilla, 26, of Lakewood, N.J., now juggling\nthree jobs to make ends meet.Their second-ranking issue is specific to their\nstage of life: college affordability and student debt. That's followed closely\nby foreign policy and terrorism, health care and guns. A combination of those\nwho cite climate change and those who cite energy puts that issue in the top\nrank as well.Brianne Stone, 29, of Huntsville, Ala., says her biggest concern\nis global warming. \"We aren't going to take any actions, and by the time that\nwe do, it's going to be the point that it's too late,\" she says. She wants the\ncandidates \"first and foremost to admit that it's a real thing.\"\"If we don't\nhave a place to live, then it doesn't really make sense to worry about\nanything else,\" agrees Scott McGeary, 34, of Seattle, citing the threat of\nclimate change to the future of the planet.By an overwhelming 80%-10%, those\nsurveyed say the United States should transition to mostly clean or renewable\nenergy by 2030, an ambitious goal that would surely require the leadership of\nthe next president. By more than 2-1, they say the government should invest\nmore heavily in buses and rail.By a lopsided 82%-12%, millennials support\nbackground checks for all gun purchasers. While that's an issue that splits\ncongressional Democrats and Republicans, there is almost no partisan divide on\nit among millennials: 89% of young Democrats and 83% of young Republicans\nendorse universal background checks.By double digits, those surveyed say\nstricter gun laws would help prevent gun violence, though they blame failures\nin the mental-health system, not gun laws, for mass shootings. And a 58%\nmajority want to protect the Second Amendment right of Americans to buy\nguns.\"I'm all for the Second Amendment and protecting it,\" says Jorge Antonio\nVillasenor Llamas, 31, of Tujunga, Calif., but he was shocked when he heard\nabout the so-called gun show loophole that allows some purchasers to bypass\nbackground checks. \"It kind of scares me,\" he says.When it comes to public\npolicy, millennials aren't reliably liberal or conservative.On economic\nissues, more call themselves conservative (38%) than liberal (33%). By a wider\nmargin, on foreign policy, they also are inclined to describe themselves as\nconservative (37% to 28%). It is on social issues that they lean left: 42% say\nthey're liberal, 32% call themselves conservative on questions including race\nrelations and gay rights.Even so, voters under 35 have a partisan tilt: 41%\nidentify with the Democratic Party, just 28% with the GOP. That presumably\nmeans the Republican Party's stance on social issues is undercutting its\npotential appeal to millennials on foreign policy and the economy.\"They are\njust campaigning based on hate and intolerance and not anything positive and\nnot anything constructive,\" says Robert Pelletier, 34, of Blairs, Va. He\nprobably will support Democrat Hillary Clinton. \"The other side isn't giving\nme any options.\"Donald Trump easily leads the field among younger Republicans\nand independents, at 26%, but that is a lower level of support that the\nbillionaire businessman now holds in the overall electorate. He is backed by\n34% of GOP voters in the RealClearPolitics average of recent national\nsurveys.\"I'm not really sure where I stand on him right now,\" says Acs, the\nstudent from New Mexico and a Republican. Trump's support nationwide and in\nkey states means \"he must be doing something right,\" she says, \"but I don't\nknow if I would vote for him.\"No other Republican contender seems to have\nbroken through, at least not yet. Retired pediatric neurosurgeon Ben Carson,\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Texas Sen. Ted\nCruz are bunched within 3 points of one another. Other contenders are in low\nsingle digits.Donald Trump poses with supporters after a campaign rally on\nDec. 21, 2015, in Grand Rapids, Mich. (Photo: Carlos Osorio, AP)On the\nDemocratic side, among the overall electorate in national polls, Clinton now\nleads Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by close to 20 percentage points. But\nSanders, the oldest candidate running, has captured the allegiance of younger\nvoters. The 73-year-old democratic socialist from the Green Mountain State is\nleading Clinton, 46%-35%, among millennial Democrats and independents.\"The\nBernie Sanders thing has really got me on board,\" says McGeary, an IT\nprofessional from Seattle. \"I was pretty cynical at first about the whole\nmovement — I mean, I supported it, but I had no idea it would pick up this\nkind of steam.\" He praises Sanders' reliance on small donors and lumps Clinton\nin with the Republican field as \"people who keep protecting corporations\ninstead of people.\"Indeed, he says he might leave the country if Sanders isn't\nelected because of his frustration that the United States isn't doing more to\naddress issues such as social inequality and health care.There is an age\ndivide within the millennial generation. Among those 18 to 25 years old,\nSanders has a big lead. Among those 26 to 34, Clinton has a small edge.There\nis a gender gap as well — and not the one that favors Clinton among baby\nboomer women. Men under 35 support Sanders by 4 percentage points. Women back\nhim by almost 20 points. The possibility of breaking new ground by electing\nthe first female president apparently carries less persuasive power among\nyounger women than their mothers' generation.Stone is ready to support\nClinton, though she prefers Sanders. \"He's actually talking about breaking up\nthe big banks and helping income inequality,\" she says, \"and given that I'm\ncurrently unemployed, income inequality is pretty important.\"By 2-1,\nmillennials see police violence against African Americans as a problem, and\nthree-fourths say the government should require police officers to wear body\ncameras to protect citizens. Two-thirds support reducing the prison sentences\nfor people convicted of non-violent crimes such as drug possession.There is\nless consensus when it comes to fighting terrorism: 47% say the United States\nshould commit troops on the ground to combat the self-proclaimed Islamic\nState; 37% disagree. On this issue, there is a partisan divide: a 69% majority\nof Republicans support deploying ground forces; a 45% plurality of Democrats\noppose the idea.By 53%-37%, younger Americans say the United States should\naccept refugees from foreign conflicts such as in Syria, a question that has\ninflamed the Republican presidential contest. On that, Democratic millennials\nsupport the idea by more than 2-1; a majority of Republicans oppose it.\nDemocrats overwhelmingly say the United States should help alleviate extreme\npoverty in other countries as a way to combat extremism; Republicans split\nevenly on the question.The threat of terrorism by radical extremists has\nhelped shape the millennial generation the way the Cold War shaped baby\nboomers. The millennials were between 4 and 20 years old when the 9/11\nattackers struck in 2001; now some have served themselves in the wars in Iraq\nand Afghanistan.The rising generation is distinctive in other ways as well —\nfrom adopting new technology to dealing with an economy in which wages have\nlong been stagnant for most workers. The U.S. Census Bureau says millennials,\nnow numbering 75.3 million, in 2015 surpassed baby boomers as the largest\nliving generation.Other national polls have found fears that the classic\nAmerican dream is imperiled. If so, this is the generation most likely to\nsuffer the consequences.Alex Martinson, of Westport, Conn., peels off an \"I\nVoted\" sticker to hand out to residents leaving a polling place on Nov. 4,\n2014. (Photo: Charles Krupa, AP)That said, the USA TODAY/Rock the Vote poll\nfound a generally upbeat attitude: 57% say they are optimistic about the\nfuture of the United States; 34% are pessimistic.They see many ways in which\nan individual can bring about change, including volunteering in their\ncommunity or running for office themselves. But the message they send about\nvoting is mixed: Only a third say they're likely to vote in the Republican\nprimaries. Four in 10 say they're likely to vote in the Democratic primaries.\nSix in 10 say they are likely to vote in November.Fifty-five percent agree\n\"there are better ways to make a difference than voting.\" But three of four\nalso say voting is a way to change things in their communities and have an\nimpact on issues they care about. A majority say their vote could decide an\nelection.\"These poll numbers should put to rest the notion that Millennials\nare unaware of the value of their vote,\" said Ashley Spillane, president of\nRock the Vote. \"But the numbers also underscore how critical the work we do to\nengage young people in the entire civic process — from demystifying\nregistration and voting to providing key information about candidates and\nissues. It's on all of us to make sure new voter to know how much critical\nthey are to the future of our democracy.\"\"You are getting something given to\nyou and it's a gift; a lot of people in other countries don't have that\nright,\" says Badilla, the New Jersey woman who is working three jobs — as a\nreceptionist at a car dealership and at a coffee shop during the week, then as\nan accountant for her uncle on weekends. Her parents were immigrants. \"I was\nraised to believe that every vote makes a difference.

But what about\nhuman-caused weather?Nuclear and coal-fired power plants, because of the\nintense steam they emit, can produce in the areas surrounding them micro\nblizzards. Construction equipment such as towering cranes in urban areas can\nfoster strong winds if not tornadoes. Data centers and black-top roofs,\ndriveways, parking lots and road surfaces can create heat waves. Even the\nclothes on our backs can induce severe weather: manufacturing plants in China,\nwhere much of our goods are made, spew pollution that travels across the ocean\nand exacerbates thunderstorms in the Pacific Northwest. From forest fires\nbegun by people that blanket the atmosphere and cause cold waves, to condo\ndevelopments that disturb water tables and feed hurricanes, the human\nfingerprints on nature’s weapon — weather — abound.The first-ever red alert\nfor pollution issued in China this week due to the unhealthy air quality in\nBeijing is testimony to the fact that we humans are doing more than just\nabstractly damaging over time our climate and the environment, causing\natmospheric conditions to change in myriad ways, including a steady rise in\nglobal temperatures. We are foiling conditions now.Resiliency and adaptation\nefforts need to be centered more fully in the spotlight. At the United Nations\nclimate negotiations in Paris, Secretary of State John Kerry announced that\nthe U.S. will double its funding to $800 million a year by 2020 in grants to\nvulnerable countries to help reduce climate risks. Still, funding for adaption\nmeasures has fallen far short of commitments. At the U.N. climate meeting in\nCancun in 2010, $100 billion in funding had been targeted. A research report\nby the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates\nthat only $62 billion has been committed.The reason the world needs more\ninvestment in infrastructure, agriculture, health and water services is that\napproximately 7.3 billion people are at physical risk and subject to imminent\ndanger due to climate change. Yes, that is the entire global population. And\nmany — nearly two billion people — are in the direct line of fire. They are\namong the world’s poorest who live in more vulnerable places. It’s in these\nareas that large, industrial and utility operations also make their homes\nbecause land values are inexpensive and it’s cheaper to operate. The cycle of\ndestruction and repercussion isn’t hard to imagine or see for yourself.When I\nvisited Linfen, China —  for years called the world’s dirtiest city because of\nits poor air quality — I could barely see my own hand in front of my face at\ncertain times of the day, mostly at dusk when pollution is universally at its\nworst. Millions of people live in the Shanxi province where Linfen is located\nand are affected.You don’t have to travel to Mongolia to experience this\nplight. Winds carry pollutants from there to the U.S. West Coast, so much so\nthat efforts need to be nearly doubled to combat ozone level rise in the\nregion.To be sure, we should acknowledge the climate in general is changing\nand do something about it. Let’s not forget about weather vulnerability due to\nour own actions, too.The Federal Emergency Management Agency has devised a\ndisaster plan to ready the nation for what may be record severe weather this\nwinter on account of the strong El Niño.

That same song, used by Spike Lee to cap his seminal\nfilm “Do the Right Thing,” also played at the end of the show as the credits\nrolled.

It's important that we do that because the way the\nconversation has been had traditionally is in black and white terms.

Rock's video, filmed about a week before the ceremony, actually took place in front of the Rave Cinema 15 (formerly Magic Johnson Theatres) at Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza.

Although cities are\ngreat for concentrating people and resources, they’re also vulnerable to\nrising sea levels, extreme weather events and other changes associated with\nclimate change. The complex array of effects also includes rising demand for\nenergy and a growing scarcity of water.To exacerbate matters, experts say\nthese effects will be disproportionately visited upon people whose lives are\nmost unstable.“Cities in developing countries are thought to be even more\nvulnerable to climate change owing to widespread poverty, lack of\ninfrastructure, unplanned informal settlements and a lack of spending on\nadaptation,” wrote the study authors, a University of College London-led team\nof British researchers.Scientists who flew an airplane equipped with sensors\nthrough the plume of natural gas leaking into the Porter Ranch area have found\nthat at its peak, the nearly four-month leak released roughly 100,000 tons of\nmethane — effectively doubling the methane emissions rate of the entire Los\nAngeles...Scientists who flew an airplane equipped with sensors through the\nplume of natural gas leaking into the Porter Ranch area have found that at its\npeak, the nearly four-month leak released roughly 100,000 tons of methane —\neffectively doubling the methane emissions rate of the entire Los Angeles...To\ntry to get a handle on what that urban response to climate change looks like,\nthe team focused on 10 of the world’s megacities — those with populations\nexceeding 3 million, or with a gross domestic product (GDP) that puts it in\nthe top 25 of cities — and analyzed how much money they spent on measures to\nadapt to climate change effects.The diverse metropolitan roster, picked on the\nbasis of  size, location and developmental status, included: London, Paris,\nNew York, Mexico City, Beijing, Sao Paulo in Brazil, Mumbai in India, Jakarta\nin Indonesia, Lagos in Nigeria and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia.“It is important to\nstudy a range of cities in different regions of the world, with different\nclimates and at different states of socioeconomic development,” the study\nauthors explained. “Although, in economic terms, disaster losses from weather,\nclimate and geophysical events are greater in developed countries, fatalities\nand economic losses as a proportion of GDP are higher in developing\ncountries.”The numbers showed a high contrast between cities in more\neconomically advanced countries and those in developing nations. New York\nspent $2.26 billion (0.22% of its city GDP), while Addis Ababa spent  $21\nmillion (0.14% of its city GDP).In fact, essentially all the wealthy cities\nspent about 0.22% of their city GDP on measures responding to climate change,\nwhile the developing cities mostly spent around 0.16%. (The exception was\nBeijing, which spent 0.33% of its city GDP, or $1.19 billion).Sliced another\nway, Paris spent the most per person ($553.76), while Addis Ababa spent the\nleast ($6.56), followed closely by Lagos ($7.69).“The evidence seems to\nsuggest that current adaptation responses may be largely influenced by market-\nbased responses to protecting physical capital, rather than at-risk\npopulations,” the study authors concluded. The findings highlight a need to\nshift the focus to protecting the people who will bear the brunt of climate\nchange’s effects, they wrote.**Follow @aminawrite on Twitter for more science\nnews and \"like\" Los Angeles Times Science &amp; Health on Facebook.**\n\n", "title" : "Do cities' climate-change adaptations aim to protect property or people?

There\nhave been no reported cases in Colombia of newborns with microcephaly, or\nabnormally small heads, as seen in Brazil.

But the fetus is potentially\nvulnerable to neurological complications at any stage of pregnancy. It’s very\npossible that viral infections in later stages of pregnancy could lead to\nfuture developmental disorders for the child in the future, such as epilepsy\nand learning and language disabilities.

It seems to produce a kind of cross-attack against the nervous\nsystem. We suspect the virus may have the direct capability to attack the\nbrain and spinal cord. Scientists in the 1950s experimenting with animals were\nable to demonstrate that Zika targeted neurons, the cellular elements of the\nbrain and spinal cord.**You say that Zika’s apparent role in promoting\nGuillain-Barre disease is as worrisome, if not more so, than microcephaly.\nWhy?**I have just come from seeing a Guillain-Barre patient here in Cali and\nit is horrible to see how they are left weak and incapacitated. It can be\ndevastating for them and for caregivers. It is a temporary condition in most\ncases, but it is very aggressive and some will be incapacitated for the rest\nof their lives.

And where there is dengue, you have the possibility of Zika.**What\ntreatment is there for Zika, and is there hope for a vaccine?**There is no\ntreatment and a vaccine will take years and years to develop.

There is\nevidence that Zika is present in the urine, saliva and semen. That means the\nvirus has the potential to attack different cell populations and organs,\nwhereas dengue affects mainly the blood. That means Zika has a potential to\ncause more complications from the disease and for it to spread.**Looking\nahead, what encourages you?**In January we established a task force of\nresearchers from Johns Hopkins and Columbia University medical schools and the\nNational Institutes of Health with our Colombian colleagues at six different\nuniversity hospitals here.

The brief order suggests that most of the\njustices have doubts about the legality of the EPA's policy.The order could\nalso be a sign that conservative justices are increasingly skeptical of\nObama’s use of executive authority. In a separate case this term, the high\ncourt will decide whether Obama went too far in issuing an executive action to\ndefer deportation of more than 4 million immigrants here illegally.Chief\nJustice John G. Roberts Jr.  and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy,\nClarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. joined in support of the order.The\nfour liberal justices dissented: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia\nSotomayor and Elena Kagan.A former Justice Department attorney who has worked\non environmental litigation called the order significant.It is “extraordinary\nand fairly surprising,” Washington lawyer James Rubin said. “The court\nessentially reviewed the merits before the D.C. Circuit even had a chance to\nrule on them, something the court has not done before in the context of a\nrule-making challenge. It’s a significant blow to the EPA and the\nadministration’s climate change plan.”**See more of our top stories on\nFacebook &gt;&gt;**The EPA regulations, known as the Clean Power Plan, would\nset state-by-state targets for reducing greenhouse gases from power plants.\nThe rules would force many states to shut down older coal-fired plants and\nproduce more electricity using natural gas or solar and wind power.Lawyers for\nWest Virginia, Texas and 24 other states sued, contending the EPA does not\nhave the authority under the Clean Air Act to launch a broad attack on\ngreenhouse gases.They filed an emergency appeal at the end of January asking\nfor the high court to put the EPA plan on hold while their lawsuit\nproceeds.The challengers reminded the justices that they ruled last year in a\nseparate case that the EPA had failed to weigh the $9-billion cost before\nrequiring power plants to eliminate mercury emissions. But because the high\ncourt had allowed the rules to take effect while the legal challenge went\nforward, by the time the industry won, it was too late because the power\nplants had complied. Their message was that the high court this time needed to\nintervene early.The appeals court said it would hear arguments in June for the\nclimate case and would probably rule in the fall, during Obama's last months\nin the White House.“Make no mistake: This is a great victory for West\nVirginia,” said the state’s attorney general, Patrick Morrisey. “We are\nthrilled that the Supreme Court realized the rule’s immediate impact and froze\nits implementation, protecting workers and saving countless dollars as our\nfight against its legality continues.” West Virginia and Texas led the\ncoalition of states challenging the EPA regulations.The National Rural\nElectric Cooperative Assn., one of several groups that joined the challenge,\napplauded the court’s move.“Charging ahead with implementation of the Clean\nPower Plan would have caused immediate and irreparable harm to America’s\nelectric co-ops,” said Jeffrey Connor, the group’s interim chief executive.The\npresident's lawyers had urged the justices to turn down the emergency request,\ncalling it “extraordinary and unprecedented.” Meanwhile, 18 mostly Democratic-\nled states, including California and Illinois, filed a brief supporting the\nadministration.In a statement Tuesday, the White House said it disagreed with\nthe court’s decision.“We remain confident that we will prevail on the merits,”\nthe statement said. “Even while the litigation proceeds, EPA has indicated it\nwill work with states that choose to continue plan development and will\nprepare the tools those states will need.”The Environmental Defense Fund\nexpressed disappointment in the court order.“Today’s court decision is\nunfortunate, but it does not reflect a decision on the merits,” said Vickie\nPatton, its general counsel.

These range\nfrom the adequacy of the fund's size to its secrecy-minded operations. And\nit's all part of a worldwide effort mandated by the Paris climate deal, whose\noverall cost could reach $16.5 trillion.Part of the climate accord struck over\nthe weekend in Paris, the Green Climate Fund will subsidize the developing\nnations in adopting such steps as carbon-free power generation and protections\nagainst global warming-linked catastrophes like hurricanes and rising\nseas.Climate cleanup work is an expensive proposition. The total tab, focused\non developed economies curbing their voluminous carbon emissions, is around\n$16.5 trillion, the International Energy Agency estimates. A switch from\nfossil fuels would entail a massive reordering of global energy production and\ndelivery, moving toward renewable sources and greater energy efficiency, the\nagency said.Low-lying nations such as Zimbabwe and Madagascar are most at risk\nfrom major storms and escalating oceans. But according to the Notre Dame\nGlobal Adaptation Index, they have the least financial ability to stave off\nenvironmental havoc. In fact, their carbon emissions are -- relative to major\nindustrial powers like the U.S. and China -- minuscule, so they haven't\ncontributed much to the problem.In a statement issued two weeks ago, Héla\nCheikhrouhou, the fund's executive director, said the $100 billion kitty was\ndedicated to supporting the climate conference's \"objective on climate change\nto keep temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius.\" He noted that its board\nalready had approved a $168 million outlay for eight projects, including\nsafeguarding Amazon River wetlands in South America and building hurricane\nshelters in Bangladesh. The fund did not respond to a request for comment\nabout criticisms. Potential problems include: **Insufficient money.** A study\nby the London School of Economics concluded that the fund's intended size of\n$100 billion per year was far too small to get the job done. The LSE report\nrecommended at least $400 billion, and found that a sum up to $2 trillion was\nmore likely to be effective. Even scraping together the $100 billion might be\ntough. The Green Climate Fund has so far received pledges of around $10\nbillion, but actually has just $1 billion of that in hand, says Climate\nCentral, an environmental study group.President Barack Obama has said the\nUnited States would chip in $3 billion, but the GOP-run Congress intends to\nscuttle that. Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), a member of the Senate Environment\nand Public Works Committee, said: \"Congress has never authorized funding the\nGreen Climate Fund, and we cannot support providing taxpayer dollars to the\nfund.\"Meanwhile, potential aid recipients are disconcerted that the reference\nin the Paris climate pact was only in the document's preamble, thus not giving\nit adequate legal force to ensure it is enshrined in international\npolicy.**Waste. **Among Republican lawmakers,there's a strong suspicion that\nthe fund's money will end up frittered away or in the bank accounts of corrupt\nofficials.Lending credence to the waste fears was the Bangladesh government's\n$3.1 million project to build \"climate-resilient housing\" along the nation's\ncoast after a cyclone battered it. The watchdog agency Transparency\nInternational Bangladesh discovered that the homes had no walls. Why? The\ngovernment wanted to stretch its budget and build more houses. Channeling\nGreen Climate Fund largesse to boondoggles like Bangladesh's risks more of the\nsame.**Secrecy.** The fund has drawn criticism for operating behind closed\ndoors. Green groups were furious to learn last summer that Deutsche Bank was\none of the financial institutions the fund tapped to distribute the money. It\nturns out the German bank is a big investor in the coal industry. (The bank\nissued a statement saying that it fully supports the objective of a \"low-\nemission economy.\")To be sure, in the wake of the Paris conclave, there is a\nlot of momentum behind the Green Climate Fund and international commitments to\nhold down greenhouse gas emissions. So some of the good intentions may end up\nactually coming to pass. Obama is hedging his bets on corralling the money\nneeded for the Green Climate Fund by enlisting private financial sources.\nMicrosoft billionaire Bill Gates recently declared he would invest $2 billion\nin technology to combat climate change.

The takeaway was a shift\nfrom dependence on fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy, with the hope of\naverting dangerous climate effects.\"Nobody will get 100 percent of what they\nwant,\" Fabius said. \"What I hope is that everyone remembers the message of the\nfirst day, when 150 heads of state and government came from all around the\nworld to say, 'The world needs a success.'\"There was little doubt that high-\nlevel arm-twisting made the deal happen, most notably a Thursday call by\nPresident Obama to China's President Xi Jinping, which followed earlier calls\nto Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Brazilian President Dilma\nRousseff.Janos Pasztor, the U.N. assistant secretary-general on climate\nchange, told CBS News that the message of the plan is to \"send a strong signal\nto the markets, the private sector that this is the direction we are going, to\na low-carbon, low-emissions world, so investing in new technology is the way\nto go.\"\"What it means is, for example,\" Pasztor said, \"is get your act\ntogether, oil and gas industry, and develop these carbon capture storage\nsystems.\"\"What we want is zero emissions at some point in the future; from a\nclimate point of view, it is perfectly OK to continue oil and gas for some\ntime to come,\" Pasztor said.U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that 186\ncountries, representing close to 100 percent of global carbon emissions, had\nsubmitted their national climate plans, called the Intended Nationally\nDetermined Contributions (INDCs).\"This is quite encouraging,\" he said, adding\nthat municipal and business leaders as well as civil society organizations\nwere also at the conference to play a role.An agreement would be judged,\ndelegates and U.N. officials say, on its ability to send a message to the\nmarkets if investors shift from fossil fuels and put it into low or zero-\ncarbon energy sources.\"I have absolute confidence in the ability of capital to\nmove where the signal of the marketplace says 'go' after Paris,\" U.S.\nSecretary of State John Kerry said to the \"Earth to Paris\" summit earlier in\nthe week.Not everyone is thrilled with the final compromise result; during the\nnegotiations some scientists said that the final agreement is too weak and\nthat sections that were deleted in the intense, often politically motivated\nnegotiations, leading to an agreement that will not avert the dangerous\nwarming of the world. Others believed it will restrict the U.S. and other\ndeveloped countries too much.Crafting the mechanism to submit the reports on\nreducing carbon emissions proved to be difficult. India wanted a voluntary\nmeasure. Locking horns with the U.S. and European Union countries, the China\ndelegation wanted \"differentiation,\" what its deputy chief, Liu Zhenmin, said\nmeant that rich countries, which does not include China or India, would make\ndeeper emissions cuts and pay more into the fund.But in the end, delegates and\ncivil society groups were visibly pleased that the summit ended in the\napproval of an agreement.\"The agreement requires the world to wean itself off\nof fossil fuels by the middle of the century,\" said Alden Meyer, the director\nof strategy and policy of the Union of Concerned Scientists. \"We have to get\nto net zero of greenhouse gases by 2060 or so. That can be through a\ncombination of reducing emissions and increasing uptake of carbon dioxide by\nforests and agriculture by natural syncs. There is no way to meet this goal\nwithout phasing out fossil fuels over that time.\"\"We would have liked to see a\nrequirement that all countries revise the level of ambition in their proposed\npost-2020 commitments based on the science by the end of the decade,\" Meyer\nsaid.Included in the deal is a temperature goal to keep warming to a limit,\nbut that, along with who would pay for damages brought on by global warming\nand what countries would contribute to fundraising to be raised annually, were\nthe contentious issues, resulting in the negotiations dragging into an extra\nday.The final agreement reads, \"the Parties to the Paris Agreement shall set a\nnew collective quantified goal from a floor of USD 100 billion per year,\ntaking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries.\"After a\nbriefing by Fabius on Thursday evening, Ségolène Royal, the French minister of\nEcology, Sustainable Development and Energy, met with reporters and told CBS\nNews, \"The financial sector should bear the responsibility of gathering the\nnecessary funds, help countries transition to a low-carbon economy.\"The plan\nrequires countries to keeping the rise in the global average temperature \"well\nbelow\" 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and \"endeavor to limit\" them\neven more, to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the year 2100, compared with pre-\nindustrial levels.Emma Ruby-Sachs, acting executive director of Avaaz, a\nglobal civil action group concerned with the climate, said: \"This deal will\nrepresent a turning point in history, paving the way for the shift to 100\npercent clean energy that the world wants and the planet needs. By marching in\nthe streets, calling leaders and signing petitions, people everywhere created\nthis moment, and now people everywhere will deliver on it to secure the future\nof humanity.\"\"It will be a big step forward for all of humanity,\" Fabius said\nFriday.\"The agreement is a mechanism for how countries will behave - the new\nrules of the game,\" Pasztor told CBS News. \"Whatever they commit to is not\nlegally binding but they have to report ... it is not name and shame, it is\nname and encourage.\"Ban, reacting to the final agreement, said, \"Nature is\nsending urgent signals.

The issue will be discussed at a major U.N. climate conference in Paris that opens Nov. 30.In the Cantillon brewery in the center of Brussels, the unusually warm weather means the copper vessels that should be steaming with golden brew are empty.\"The goal was to brew yesterday, so if we did it (the vessel) would be totally full,\" he said. \"But as you can see: totally empty,\" Van Roy said.Cantillon is renowned for its traditional methods and refuses to use artificial refrigeration, which some other brewers have switched to. It makes Van Roy's brewing season totally dependent on the seasonal temperatures.In his grandfather's days, the season would run from mid-October to early May. \"We are beginning right now, mainly in November, to end in the end of March or early April,\" Van Roy said.\"We are losing more than one month and if it continues we will lose maybe two months and that is certainly do to the global warming,\" he said.Even Brazilians are hunkering for a dip in temperatures. \"I am hoping that we get cold, so that they can start the production very soon,\" said Brazilian visitor Francisco Romanini.The Belgian brewer's claims come after U.S. government scientists said that 14 extreme weather events in 2014 were made worse by climate change caused by pollution.Extreme heat events were one focus of the U.S. government's report on the impact of climate change around the world. The study found that in 2014, extreme heat waves, like one that gripped South Korea, were made worse by human-caused climate change which includes things such as car emissions, burning coal and methane gas.\n\n", "title" : "Renowned Belgian beer brewer Cantillon says it's a victim of climate change - CBS News", "twitter" : { "body" : "Renowned Belgian beer brewer says it's a victim of climate change http://cbsn.ws/1WFqCB0 pic.twitter.com/XGNpCFfex8", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/662700857662775296", "retweets" : 32, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-11-06T02:39:31.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 17, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "662700857662775296" }, "topic" : "climate change", "source" : "CBSNews", "link" : "http://cbsn.ws/1WFqCB0" }

Yet already the Supreme Court of the United States\nsaid no, delaying much of the Obama administration’s strategy to deliver\nAmerica’s contribution to the collective effort.The White House claims it will\nprevail, assuring a fidgety international community it will deliver on the\npromises made at the climate meeting in Paris in December. Those commitments\nproved critical to keeping the diplomacy on track and ultimately producing a\ndeal among more than 185 countries representing more than 98 percent of global\nemissions.And yet the Supreme Court’s temporary stay of the administration’s\nClean Power Plan — the last decision of global consequence of the right-\nleaning court on which Justice Antonin Scalia had sat since the Reagan\nadministration — underscores just how far the United States remains from its\nclimate goals.Consider the administration’s own assessments. Even as the\nAmerican delegation in Paris offered to cut emissions to 26 to 28 percent\nbelow their 2005 levels by 2025, the Energy Information Administration of the\nDepartment of Energy was offering a different outlook.Its reference case,\nbased on federal policies on the books at the end of 2014, forecast that\nemissions of carbon dioxide from energy use (the United States’ main source of\ngreenhouse gases) would not decline but remain flat through 2025 and\nbeyond.Methane emissions, which account for under 10 percent of greenhouse\ngases spewed into the atmosphere but trap much more heat than CO2, could\nincrease 6 percent over the next 10 years, according to the Environmental\nProtection Agency. Emissions of highly potent hydrofluorocarbons could\nincrease by half.What’s more, the carbon storage of American forests, which\noffset as much as 13 percent of the nation’s total greenhouse gas emissions in\n2013, could start declining as early as 2020.These, of course, are not\nforecasts but projections. Emissions could fall faster because of new\nregulation, technological breakthroughs, changes in land use and the like.\nSome of the nation’s most critical policies to combat climate change were\npassed only last year. A case in point is the Clean Power Plan, the crown\njewel of the lot, which would require states to come up with plans to reduce\nthe CO2 emissions from their electric power plants.Still, the Supreme Court’s\ndecision last week to delay the plan — until the United States Court of\nAppeals in Washington decides on the merits of a challenge by 27 mostly\nRepublican-governed states — underscores just how politically vulnerable the\nUnited States’ promises truly are.Because for all the administration’s claims\nthat it can deliver on its commitments regardless, the fact remains that even\nunder the most optimistic outlook — if the Supreme Court’s stay were to melt\naway and the Power Plan were to work impeccably — current policies do not get\nus there.Last month, before the Supreme Court’s decision, the Rhodium Group, a\nresearch firm that has performed extensive analysis of climate-change\nprojections, published a report concluding that even if the administration\nexecuted all its existing and planned policies with maximum effect, and the\nmost optimistic forecasts for technological development and forest sink\ncapacity were borne out, the United States would still not hit the\ntarget.Using different assumptions — say, if the economy grew faster or energy\ntechnology didn’t progress as fast — it would remain even further behind.\nAssuming all the administration’s current and proposed policies were carried\nout, the analysis suggests that by 2025 American greenhouse gas emissions\nwould be, at best, 23 percent lower than in 2005. In the worst case they would\nbe only 10 percent lower.That suggests we should hurry. “While the U.S. still\nhas nearly a decade to put additional policy in place,” the report notes, “it\nwill need to do so relatively quickly for the impact to be felt by the time\nthe 2025 pledge comes due.”The pledges offered in Paris are not a magic\nnumber. They are important nonetheless. Stiff cuts by the United States, the\nworld’s second-largest emitter, after China, were crucial to holding the\ninternational coalition together. These cuts are supposed to be just the\nbeginning of a process of increasingly stringent emissions limits.How will the\nUnited States get there, then? The Rhodium Group’s analysis proposes stricter\nlimits for transportation and for electric power generation, which would\nremain the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the country over the next\ndecade even if the Clean Power Plan were put in place.One idea would be\nfurther tightening the fuel economy standards for cars and trucks. The report\nsuggests looking at emissions by the industrial sector — the third-largest\nemitter — which under current policies are expected to increase by 18 percent\nby 2025. Land use policies to enhance the forest carbon sink and tighter rules\nto reduce methane emissions from oil and gas could also help.But these\nproposals just underscore how the American problem is first and foremost\npolitical. It is critical, the report concludes, “that policy makers now\nengage in a broad exploration and frank discussion of what additional steps\ncan help deliver on America’s climate goals.” It will be difficult to hold\nthis discussion when Congress is run by a party that rejects climate\nscience.We have known about these obstacles for some time. The Obama\nadministration’s plan to repurpose the Clean Air Act rather than propose new\nlegislation to combat climate change acknowledged that the courts offered a\nbetter shot than Congress.And in that regard, the news is not entirely bad. If\nthe Senate were to confirm whomever President Obama nominates to succeed\nJustice Scalia, one of the most conservative justices on the bench, the\nSupreme Court would probably become more sensitive to the imperative to combat\nclimate change. That’s not just good news for the Clean Power Plan. It could\nopen the door to more aggressive policies.Last month, for instance, scholars\nfrom the law schools of Columbia University, New York University and the\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles, released a report that suggested there\nis a provision in the Clean Air Act that would allow the E.P.A. to require\nstates to reduce emissions that endangered other countries if such countries\nprovided reciprocal protections to the United States.“E.P.A. and the states\ncould use the provision to establish an economywide, market-based approach for\nreducing greenhouse gas emissions,” the group wrote. “Such a program could\nprovide one of the most effective and efficient means to address climate\nchange pollution in the United States.”Last week, this kind of thinking would\nhave been unlikely to survive a spin through the Supreme Court. But perhaps it\ncould survive a different one — maybe one that placed more weight on\ninternational harmony.\n\n", "title" : "Next Supreme Court Justice Will Be Crucial to Climate Change - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Next Supreme Court justice will be crucial to climate change http://nyti.ms/1XwIQGK", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/699789373521469440", "retweets" : 213, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-16T10:56:02.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 226, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "699789373521469440" }, "topic" : "climate change", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1XwIQGK" }

Can that be a\ncoincidence?Scientists say it will take them years to figure that out, and\npointed to other factors that may have played a larger role in starting the\ncrisis. But these same experts added that the Zika epidemic, as well as the\nrelated spread of a disease called dengue that is sickening as many as 100\nmillion people a year and killing thousands, should be interpreted as\nwarnings.Over the coming decades, global warming is likely to increase the\nrange and speed of the life cycle of the particular mosquitoes carrying these\nviruses, encouraging their spread deeper into temperate countries like the\nUnited States.Recent research suggests that under a worst-case scenario,\ninvolving continued high global emissions coupled with fast population growth,\nthe number of people exposed to the principal mosquito could more than double,\nto as many as 8 billion or 9 billion by late this century from roughly 4\nbillion today.“As we get continued warming, it’s going to become more\ndifficult to control mosquitoes,” said Andrew Monaghan, who is studying the\ninteraction of climate and health at the National Center for Atmospheric\nResearch in Boulder, Colo. “The warmer it is, the faster they can develop from\negg to adult, and the faster they can incubate viruses.”Already, climate\nchange is suspected — though not proved — to have been a factor in a string of\ndisease outbreaks afflicting both people and animals. These include the spread\nof malaria into the highlands of eastern Africa, the rising incidence of Lyme\ndisease in North America, and the spread of a serious livestock ailment called\nbluetongue into parts of Europe that were once too cold for it to thrive.In\ninterviews, experts noted that no epidemic was ever the result of a single\nvariable.Instead, epidemics always involve interactions among genes, ecology,\nclimate and human behavior, presenting profound difficulties for scientists\ntrying to tease apart the contributing factors. “The complexity is enormous,”\nsaid Walter J. Tabachnick, a professor with the Florida Medical Entomology\nLaboratory, a unit of the University of Florida in Vero Beach.The epidemics of\nZika and dengue are cases in point. The viruses are being transmitted largely\nby the yellow fever mosquito, Aedes aegypti. That creature adapted long ago to\nlive in human settlements, and developed a concomitant taste for human\nblood.Cities in the tropics, the climate zone most favorable to the mosquito,\nhave undergone explosive growth: Humanity passed a milestone a few years ago\nwhen more than half the population had moved to urban areas. But spending on\nhealth care and on basic public health infrastructure, like water pipes and\nsewers, has not kept pace. Mosquito control has also faltered in recent\ndecades.The mosquito lays its eggs in containers of water, of a sort that are\nespecially common in the huge slums of Latin American cities. With unreliable\naccess to piped water, people there store water in rooftop cisterns, buckets\nand the like. Old tires and other debris can also become mosquito\nhabitat.Water storage near homes is commonplace in areas where Zika has spread\nrapidly, like the cities of Recife and Salvador in northeastern Brazil, and\nwhere dengue experienced a surge in 2015, like São Paulo, Brazil’s largest\nstate.Altogether, dengue killed at least 839 people in Brazil in 2015, a 40\npercent increase from the previous year. Worldwide, dengue is killing more\nthan 20,000 people a year.Several experts said in interviews that a main\nreason for the disease outbreaks was most likely the expansion of the number\nof people at risk, through urbanization, population growth and international\ntravel. They see the changing climate as just another stress on top of a\nsituation that was already rife with peril.While they do not understand to\nwhat degree rising temperatures and other weather shifts may have contributed\nto the outbreaks, they do understand some of the potential mechanisms.The\nmosquitoes mostly live on flower nectar, but the female of the species needs a\nmeal of human blood to have enough protein to lay her eggs. If she bites a\nperson infected with dengue, Zika or any of several other diseases, she picks\nup the virus.The virus has to reproduce in the mosquito for a certain period\nbefore it can be transmitted to another person in a subsequent bite. The\nhigher the air temperature, the shorter that incubation period. Moreover, up\nto a point, higher temperatures cause the mosquitoes to mature faster.With\nrising temperatures, “You’re actually speeding up the whole reproductive cycle\nof the mosquitoes,” said Charles B. Beard, who heads a unit in Fort Collins,\nColo., studying insect-borne diseases for the Centers for Disease Control and\nPrevention in Atlanta. “You get larger populations, with more generations of\nmosquitoes, in a warmer, wetter climate. You have this kind of amplification\nof the risk.”Aedes aegypti is present across the southern tier of the United\nStates. Brief outbreaks of dengue have occurred recently at the warmest\nmargins of the country, and one is underway in Hawaii. But with pervasive\nwindow screens and air-conditioning, the risk of disease transmission is far\nless for most Americans than for people in poorer countries.The mosquito does\nnot thrive in areas with cold winters. Some research suggests that continued\nclimatic warming could allow the mosquito to colonize more of North America in\ncoming decades, though how much of a disease risk that would represent is\nanybody’s guess.The yellow fever mosquito competes with a cousin, the Asian\ntiger mosquito, that has also colonized the United States, and is more\ntolerant of cold weather. Whether one would beat out the other in a hotter\nclimate is unclear. Likewise, it is unclear how effective the Asian tiger\nmosquito might become at transmitting Zika or dengue viruses.In principle, the\nrisk from continued global warming applies not just to temperate countries,\nbut to cities at high altitude in tropical countries. Researchers are keeping\na close eye on Mexico City, for instance.With 21 million people in the city\nand its suburbs, Mexico City is the largest metropolis of the Western\nHemisphere. While the lowlands of Mexico are plagued by yellow fever\nmosquitoes and the viruses they transmit, the country’s capital sits on a\nmountain plain that has — up to now — been too cold for the mosquitoes.But\ntemperatures are rising, and the mosquitoes have recently been detected in low\nnumbers near Mexico City. “The mosquito is just down the hill, literally,” Dr.\nMonaghan said. “I think all the potential is there to have virus transmission\nif climatic conditions become a bit more suitable.”\n\n", "title" : "In Zika Epidemic, a Warning on Climate Change - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Climate change could allow the mosquito that spreads Zika virus to colonize more of North America in coming decades http://nyti.ms/1TsVUxv", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/700398147672084481", "retweets" : 139, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-18T03:15:05.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 110, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "700398147672084481" }, "topic" : "climate change", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1TsVUxv" }

In December, he had a\nstar turn with world leaders at the United Nations climate change conference\nin Paris.But despite all his efforts, California’s emissions rose modestly\nover the first three years after he took office in 2011, the last years for\nwhich data is available. The latest blow came from Porter Ranch, a Los Angeles\nsuburb where a breach at an underground natural-gas storage site in October\nreleased 107,000 tons of climate-changing methane and ethane — the largest\nsuch leak in terms of climate impact in American history — before it was\ncapped late last month.A report in the journal Science last week concluded\nthat the Porter Ranch breach, at its peak, effectively doubled the amount of\nmethane emitted daily in the Los Angeles Basin, highlighting how such\naccidents can set back even the best-intentioned climate policies.Speaking on\nbehalf of the Brown administration, Mary D. Nichols, the chairwoman of the\nCalifornia Air Resources Board, said her agency had been working on\nregulations for methane as a short-lived climate pollutant when the leak\noccurred.She said that the environmental policy makers — not just the Brown\nadministration — had only recently started to focus on the effects of\npollutants like methane, and that the Porter Ranch leak had added a sense of\nurgency to address that.“It’s been a jolt for everybody, realizing what\npotential for really major harm can come from this sector, which we have\ntended to take pretty much for granted,” Ms. Nichols said. New studies have\nshown that, even aside from the leak, “there’s more methane escaping into the\natmosphere than we previously thought,” she added.The leak not only snarled\nthe state’s climate-change efforts but also prompted complaints that the\ngovernor was slow to address the problem and that his regulators had failed to\nprevent it.Food &amp; Water Watch, a group that works to ban hydraulic\nfracturing and protect the water supply, sometimes brings a papier-mâché\nlikeness of Mr. Brown to its rallies to decry what it sees as his support for\nthe oil and gas industry.

We need\nto be planning for a 100 percent renewable future in California, and we’re not\ndoing it.”Ms. Nichols of the California Air Resources Board defended the\ngovernor, saying he had made addressing climate change a priority across state\ngovernment. “He is not going to get a perfect score from environmentalists,”\nshe said. “Environmental advocates are always looking to push for more.”In the\nlast year, Mr. Brown has pushed through legislation accelerating a shift to\nrenewable energy, and struck clean-energy agreements with a host of states and\ncities. California now gets 26 percent of its power from renewable sources,\ncompared with an average of 10 percent in other states.Ms. Nichols said that\nthe governor “has a broad view of what the state needs to be doing on these\nissues, and it’s now been incorporated into the work of every relevant\nagency.” For example, the Department of General Services now considers the\nenvironment when buying fleets, she said, and the Department of Transportation\nincludes greenhouse gas emissions in its plans.But there have been setbacks\nfor the governor and his goals besides Porter Ranch. In 2013, the state was\nunexpectedly forced to close the San Onofre nuclear power station north of San\nDiego, eliminating a zero-emissions source of electricity. Last October, the\nCalifornia State Legislature spurned what was perhaps Mr. Brown’s most\nambitious proposal — to cut petroleum use in half by 2030 — after a campaign\nby the oil industry raised voters’ fears of higher gasoline prices.And there\nare signs of fatigue here with environmental regulations in general. Last\nmonth, the agency charged with preserving California’s coastline ousted its\nexecutive director, who was deemed too hostile to development. And on Friday,\nthe regional commission that oversees air quality for 17 million people in the\nLos Angeles area made a similar move: Republicans committed to making\npollution regulations more business-friendly, who took control of the\ncommission last month, ousted its executive director.John Laird, California\nsecretary for natural resources, offered a laundry list of accomplishments\nduring the Brown administration, beginning with the focus on climate change,\nbut moving on to a variety of habitat protection efforts that are far less\nheralded, like negotiating a deal with Nevada to maintain Lake Tahoe and\ncreating a network of marine protected areas.“Sometimes, it’s hard to\nappreciate what’s going on around us,” Mr. Laird said. “I think people will\nprobably look back with much greater appreciation on what is happening in this\ntime.”Yet even many who applaud that record suggest that Mr. Brown should\nguard against overconfidence.“Clearly on climate and clean energy, there are\nlarge promises and commitment and soaring vision,” said V. John White, the\nexecutive director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable\nTechnology, an advocacy group. “But in the details, there is still much work\nto be done.”Some criticisms verge on Monday-morning quarterbacking: Mr. Brown,\nenvironmental advocates say, has not courted state legislators enough to\nsecure their votes on crucial issues — like the proposal on petroleum use —\nthat might have passed with more effort.But some are more substantive. Example\none is the San Onofre shutdown, after which Mr. Brown pushed to quickly\nreplace lost electrical generating capacity with a brace of new gas-fired\npower plants.

Together with\ncolleagues, Jeffery Greenblatt, a scientist and expert on low-carbon\ntechnology at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley has used\ncomputer models to study whether the first step toward Mr. Brown’s 2050 goal —\ngetting greenhouse-gas emissions back to 1990 levels by 2020 — was feasible.\nUnder three different scenarios, the resulting graphs show a line representing\ncarbon emissions steadily dropping until the 2020 goal is met.That the line\nwas still rising in 2013 is interesting, he said, but not worrisome — yet.“As\nwe get closer to 2020,” Dr. Greenblatt said, “I would start to get concerned\nif it does not go down.”\n\n", "title" : "California Gas Leak Threatens Jerry Brown’s Image as a Climate Change Hero - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "California Gas Leak Threatens Jerry Browns Image as a Climate Change Hero http://nyti.ms/1TyA8ZX", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/706123743895093249", "retweets" : 81, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-04T22:26:34.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 100, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "706123743895093249" }, "topic" : "climate change", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1TyA8ZX" }

Together with\ncolleagues, Jeffery Greenblatt, a scientist and expert on low-carbon\ntechnology at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley has used\ncomputer models to study whether the first step toward Mr. Brown’s 2050 goal —\ngetting greenhouse-gas emissions back to 1990 levels by 2020 — was feasible.\nUnder three different scenarios, the resulting graphs show a line representing\ncarbon emissions steadily dropping until the 2020 goal is met.That the line\nwas still rising in 2013 is interesting, he said, but not worrisome — yet.“As\nwe get closer to 2020,” Dr. Greenblatt said, “I would start to get concerned\nif it does not go down.”\n\n", "title" : "California Gas Leak Threatens Jerry Brown’s Image as a Climate Change Hero - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "A record gas leak in California is threatening Jerry Browns image as a climate change hero http://nyti.ms/1prI9TO pic.twitter.com/AOvM4E7F0f", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/706172449126281216", "retweets" : 123, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-05T01:40:06.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 177, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "706172449126281216" }, "topic" : "climate change", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1prI9TO" }

Mr. Trudeau was greeted by cheering onlookers waving miniature\nAmerican and Canadian flags, reflecting the same brand of rock-star adulation\nthat characterized many of Mr. Obama’s 2008 campaign appearances.The official\nvisit unfolded against the backdrop of an increasingly intense campaign to\nsucceed Mr. Obama. Mr. Trudeau, who has joked about welcoming Americans to his\ncountry if they are afraid of a Donald J. Trump presidency, diplomatically\ndeclined to criticize the Republican presidential front-runner during the news\nconference.“I have tremendous confidence in the American people and look\nforward to working with whomever they choose to send to this White House later\nthis year,” Mr. Trudeau said, answering a question about the stakes for his\ncountry and its relationship with the United States should Mr. Trump or\nSenator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, win the White House.A somewhat amused\nMr. Obama rejected the idea that his own tenure had helped to fuel Mr. Trump’s\nrise, arguing that the “Republican political elites” and news media were\nresponsible for setting a divisive tone and elevating an us-versus-them\nmentality — including questions about the president’s birthplace — that\ncreated an atmosphere in which Mr. Trump thrived.“I have been blamed by\nRepublicans for a lot of things, but being blamed for their primaries and who\nthey’re selecting for their party is,” Mr. Obama said with a long pause and a\ngrin, “novel.”“What I’m not going to do is to validate some notion that the\nRepublican crackup that’s been taking place is a consequence of actions that\nI’ve taken,” he added.On policy, Mr. Obama and Mr. Trudeau promised that their\ntwo countries would “play a leadership role internationally in the low-carbon\nglobal economy over the coming decades.” As part of the announcement, United\nStates officials said they would immediately begin a new push to regulate\nmethane emissions from existing oil and gas facilities, though finishing that\nprocess before the end of Mr. Obama’s tenure is unlikely.The Obama\nadministration wants to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by\n40 percent to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025. The Interior Department has\nproposed a number of regulations on methane leaks, but it has yet to write a\nregulation governing such leaks from current oil and gas drilling on public\nland.Mr. Obama and Mr. Trudeau also pledged to cooperate in preserving the\nArctic, and to move more quickly to carry out agreements made in climate talks\nin Paris last year.“The president and I agree on many things, including, of\nparamount importance, the direction we want to take our countries in to ensure\na clean and prosperous future,” Mr. Trudeau said, thanking the president, whom\nhe addressed as Barack, for his leadership on climate change. “Canada and the\nU.S. will stand side by side to confront the pressing needs that face not only\nour two countries, but the entire planet.”The official visit was to conclude\nwith a state dinner in the East Room of the White House.The arrival of Mr.\nTrudeau and his wife, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau — accompanied by their three\nyoung children — has prompted comparisons to a similar visit in 1977 by Pierre\nTrudeau, then the prime minister and the current leader’s father. That visit\nmade headlines when Margaret Trudeau, his wife, wore a short dress that fell\njust below the knee to the White House state dinner.While Canada and the\nUnited States have long been close allies, Mr. Obama’s efforts to confront\nglobal warming was a major point of contention with Mr. Trudeau’s predecessor,\nStephen Harper, who sought to aggressively expand Canada’s oil industry.As Mr.\nObama became more determined to leave behind a lasting environmental legacy,\nhe delayed and eventually rejected construction of the Keystone XL pipeline,\nwhich would have transported nearly a million barrels a day of heavily\npolluting petroleum from the Alberta oil sands to refineries on the Gulf\nCoast.Mr. Obama’s rejection of the pipeline severely strained relations with\nMr. Harper, but Mr. Trudeau’s election last year signaled a shift in policy\nthat was welcomed by the White House. Mr. Trudeau did not criticize Mr.\nObama’s stance on the pipeline, and he has pledged to pursue an ambitious\nenvironmental agenda dovetailing with Mr. Obama’s policies.In December,\nCanadian officials helped to push through a historic global climate agreement\nin Paris.In their Oval Office meeting on Thursday, the leaders also discussed\nmilitary cooperation, efforts to combat terrorism, improvements in trade and\nenvironmental concerns.They agreed to push forward on an agreement allowing\ntravelers from each country to be pre-cleared through immigration and customs,\naiding tourism and commerce. The two leaders also struck a deal to share more\ninformation — including on no-fly lists and border crossings — in an effort to\nprevent foreign fighters from traveling freely between Canada and the United\nStates.They parted with some issues unresolved, most prominently a decades-old\ndispute over softwood lumber. American officials say lumber from Canada is\nunfairly subsidized by the government there, an assertion that Canadian\nofficials reject. Both leaders said they were optimistic about resolving their\ndifferences on the matter in the coming months.“It’s been a longstanding\nbilateral irritant, but it hardly defines the nature of the U.S.-Canadian\nrelationship,” Mr. Obama said, adding that while each side would likely be\ndissatisfied with the outcome, officials would ultimately find a middle ground\non the issue. “People will complain and grumble,” Mr. Obama said. “But it will\nbe fine.”\n\n", "title" : "Obama and Canada’s Justin Trudeau Promote Ties and Climate Plan - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Obama and Justin Trudeau announce efforts to fight climate change http://nyti.ms/1SCsIDx", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/707940719189762048", "retweets" : 271, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-09T22:46:35.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 435, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "707940719189762048" }, "topic" : "climate change", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1SCsIDx" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71a7d955d14d6aff1029d" }, "content" : "Humans are making global warming worse, all right — but in more ways than you\nthink.That’s the result of an important new study in Nature, which finds that\nthe Earth’s land “biosphere” — defined as all the plants, animals and\nmicroorganisms living on the surface of the Earth (excluding the oceans) — is\nnow a “net source” of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Thus, the biosphere\nis now adding to global warming in much the same way that all of our fossil\nfuels are.The research, which was led by Hanqin Tian of Auburn University with\na long list of 22 co-authors, points the finger at phenomena like animal\nagriculture, rice cultivation and waste disposal as key features of climate\nchange that don’t get much attention, but that overall are causing the Earth\nto heat up even more than it would otherwise.It’s yet another finding that\nunderscores the importance of a sector that has, somewhat surprisingly,\nlargely escaped attention in the climate debate: global agriculture. And the\nworld will need to produce even more food to keep up with growing populations,\nsays Tian.To understand the new study, you have to consider that greenhouse\ngases that warm the planet are far more numerous than carbon dioxide, which\ngets the lion’s share of the attention. There’s also methane, which causes\nmuch  more warming over a 10-year time horizon (but dissipates far more\nquickly), and nitrous oxide, to name a few.And these gases pack quite a punch.\n“The methane global warming potential is 28 times larger than carbon dioxide,”\nsays Tian. “And nitrous oxide is 265 times greater than carbon dioxide, in\nterms of global warming potential” over 100 years, he added.“These two gases\nare really important non-CO2 greenhouse gases,” Tian said.Methane doesn’t just\nemerge from leaks from oil and gas operations — it is also belched by\nruminants (i.e., cows) and emerges from wetlands, landfills and much more.\nNitrous oxide, meanwhile, is emitted from nitrogen fertilizers used in\nagriculture, among other sources.In the new study, the researchers calculated\na comprehensive, worldwide inventory of how much methane, nitrous oxide, and\ncarbon dioxide the land biosphere is pulling in each year vs. how much it is\nreleasing. And they found that while land-based living things are still\npulling in more carbon dioxide each year than they themselves are giving off —\nrendering the biosphere a carbon dioxide “sink” — they are a net source of\nboth methane and nitrous oxide.Moreover, when you then convert the three gases\nto a comparable unit based on their potential to warm the planet over a\n100-year time frame, the planet’s biosphere works out to be a net source of\ngreenhouse gases, causing a warming comparable to the effect of between 3.8\nand 5.4 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year. That’s close to\nwhat the U.S. itself emits annually.“Human actions not only are emitting\ngreenhouse gases based on our own activities, but also are causing plants and\nanimals and microbes to be net emitters of greenhouse gases as well,” said\nAnna Michalak, a co-author of the study with the Carnegie Institution for\nScience in Stanford, Calif.This overturns prior assumptions that the Earth’s\nland is a carbon “sink,” which did not take into account these other\ngreenhouse gases.The picture would be a lot worse were it not for the fact\nthat, at least for now, the research calculates that the biosphere is still\npulling in more carbon dioxide than it is releasing. However, there are fears\nthat, due to factors like worsening wildfires or carbon dioxide emissions from\nArctic permafrost, this could change in the future, causing even more global\nwarming gases to flow from the land to the atmosphere.Surprisingly, the\nresearch finds that when it comes to these human-driven methane and nitrous\noxide emissions, a key driver is Southern Asia, and rice cultivation in\nparticular.“Southern Asia has about 90% of the global rice fields and\nrepresents more than 60% of the world’s nitrogen fertilizer consumption, with\n64%–81% of CH4 emissions and 36%–52% of N2O emissions derived from the\nagriculture and waste sectors,” the study says. “Given the large footprint of\nagriculture in Southern Asia, improved fertilizer use efficiency, rice\nmanagement and animal diets could substantially reduce global agricultural N2O\nand CH4 emissions.”Rice fields emit methane because microorganisms in these\nwetlands are simply very good producers of the gas, when the field is under\nwater.One caveat to this analysis is that it depends on converting three very\ndifferent gases — carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide — into the same\nunits based on their “global warming potential” over 100 years. However,\nmethane only lives in the atmosphere for 12 years. Nitrous oxide lives there\nfor 114 years, and as for carbon dioxide, some of it lasts thousands of\nyears.So if we’re worried about warming in 2016 or 2017, or even 2050, all of\nthese gases are a very big deal. But if we’re worried about warming over the\nvery long term, of the sort that causes seas to rise and ice sheets to melt,\ncarbon dioxide surges in importance.Nonetheless, for this century, the results\nare a very big deal – and point to ways that we can weaken global warming\nwithout even targeting carbon dioxide.“A lot of these additional emissions are\nones that can be managed if we alter the ways in which we do things like\nagriculture,” Michalak said.**More at Energy &amp; Environment:**Before his\ntragic death, nature photographer shot iconic images of climate change’s\nthreatChina vowed to peak emissions by 2030.

Sea\nlevels have risen several inches near Miami since 1960, according to data from\nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.At the debate, The\nWashington Post's Karen Tumulty, serving as a moderator, noted that two dozen\nFlorida mayors had requested that candidates address the subject in a debate.\nThey wrote an open letter, asking for candidates to answer three questions:\nWhat investments will you make to protect our coastal assets and economy from\nthe growing impacts of sea level rise and climate change?, What are specific\npolicies you would put in place to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? and What\npolicies would you put in place to ensure that America delivers on its\ncommitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?Tumulty's question was more\ndirect, posed to Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.) first. Since Republicans refuse to\nact on climate change — a function of skepticism in their base and among their\nallies — how can climate change be addressed?Sanders suggested that\nRepublicans were afraid to address the subject because they were worried about\nlosing campaign funding. Later, he called for a \"tax on carbon\" and for heavy\ninvestments in energy efficiency and sustainable energy. He also called for an\nend to fracking.It's worth explaining each of those things. A \"carbon tax\" is\nbasically what it sounds like. For large sources of carbon dioxide emissions —\nmostly coal-burning power plants — there would be a fee associated with those\nemissions. (Scientists believe that carbon dioxide emitted from burning fossil\nfuels stays in the atmosphere, preventing heat from escaping into space.) This\nis not as controversial as it sounds; a number of oil companies have backed\nsuch a tax. Energy efficiency comes at a reduction in greenhouse gases from\nthe other side. Since energy use means more electricity production and,\ntherefore, more burning of coal, or since more heat means more heating oil,\nefforts to reduce the amount of energy we use will indirectly reduce the\namount of fuel we burn. Sustainable energy is wind and solar, forms of\ngenerating electricity without burning coal.These are some of the most\ncommonly considered ways to reduce the long-term effects of climate change.\nBut they don't do much for Miami Beach right now.Tumulty then offered the same\nquestion to Hillary Clinton. Clinton dropped some local knowledge about Miami\nBeach and mentioned the need to transition from coal to natural gas to\nrenewable energy sources. This is her response to Sanders's no-fracking\ndemand: Natural gas emits far less greenhouse gas when burned, making it\npreferable to coal. The problem is that natural gas itself is a very potent\ngreenhouse gas that often escapes into the atmosphere as it's removed from the\nground.

On Thursday night — after nothing else worked — the\nrivals of Donald Trump seemed to try another tactic: They would try . . .\nnothing at all.The result was a low-key, civil debate, where the Republican\nfront-runner was often given free reign to muse. In some cases, that meant\ncontradicting himself — Trump excoriated visas for high-skilled workers but\nsaid he used them. He lamented that Democrats would not change Social Security\nand then said he, too, wouldn’t change it. He attacked the current system of\nbig-money campaign finance but then said that as a donor he had used it — and\nmight soon use it again, by possibly soliciting big donations as a general-\nelection candidate. He said he wanted to be neutral in negotiations between\nIsraelis and Palestinians. Except that he would be really pro-Israeli. Except\nthat he’d say he was neutral so that the Palestinians would trust him.At one\npoint, Trump hinted that he would change his mind far more often as president,\nhinting that he would be “flexible” on a variety of topics after a campaign\nbuilt on hard-line, taboo-breaking proposals. A moderator asked: Flexible\nabout what? “It depends on what comes up,” Trump said.His rivals rarely\npointed out when Trump had contradicted himself. The moderators often let him\noff without follow-ups, in contrast to the probing questions Trump got from\nFox News last week.Even Trump himself seemed surprised. “So far, I cannot\nbelieve how civil it’s been up here,” he said at one point.Would civility be\nthe thing that finally took Trump down? It doesn’t seem likely. But nothing\nelse about this campaign has, either.“Sometimes, being positive isn’t all that\ninteresting,” said Ohio Gov. John Kasich at the debate’s end. Kasich, like the\nothers, had largely spared Trump as the night went on. Now, he was making his\nfinal closing argument before his home state votes Tuesday, and he was\nadmitting that many people might not find him very exciting. “But it’s very\ninteresting to my family” and friends, Kasich said.The other two candidates\nonstage — Sens. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and Marco Rubio (Fla.) — seemed to take on\nTrump only on the issues, not his character.When Trump said that he does not\ncondone violence against protesters at his rallies — but also seemed to excuse\nthe anger that motivated them, Rubio said: “I’m concerned about violence in\ngeneral in this society.”Kasich’s criticism was relatively oblique: “Elections\nare important. But the unity of this country really matters.”And Cruz turned\nhis attack instead on President Obama. “We’ve seen for seven years, a\npresident who believes he’s above the law, who behaves like an emperor,” Cruz\nsaid. He turned to the crowd: “How many of y’all feel disrespected by\nWashington. Washington isn’t listening to the people. And that’s the\nfrustration that is boiling over.”That seemed to reinforce Trump’s statement\nwhen he was asked about an altercation at a rally between a protester and one\nof his supporters, who on Thursday was charged with assault.“People come with\ntremendous passion and love for the country. And when they see protesters,”\nTrump said, then trailed off. “When they see what’s going on with this\ncountry, they have anger that is unbelievable.”He was asked by a moderator\nabout statements the candidate himself had made from the stage, suggesting\nthat protesters might be punched, or roughed up by the crowd. Trump responded\nby saying that the violence was often started by protesters.“We have some\nprotesters who are bad dudes. They have done bad things. They are swinging,\nthey are really dangerous, and they get in there and they start hitting\npeople,” Trump said.Earlier, Trump gave an unusually wide-ranging denunciation\nof Islam and Muslims in Thursday’s GOP debate, saying that “a lot of ’em” hate\nAmerica.“I will tell you, there’s something going on that maybe you don’t know\nabout, maybe a lot of other people don’t know about, but there’s tremendous\nhatred,” Trump said, after he was asked about a comment he made this week that\n“Islam hates us.” Rubio criticized Trump in his most forceful attack of the\nnight, saying that Trump’s comments would hurt America’s interests by\nalienating Muslims overseas. Trump stood by it, and expanded with his own\ncriticism of Islam’s treatment of women.“You can be politically correct if you\nwant. I don’t want to be so politically correct. I like to solve problems,”\nTrump said. “Islam. Large portions want to use very, very harsh means. Let me\ngo a step further. Women are treated horribly. You know that, you do know\nthat.”That brought a rebuttal from Cruz, who had mocked Trump several times in\nthe debate with caveman-like over-simplifications of policy arguments.Islamic\nterrorism was a huge threat, Cruz said, and he blamed President Obama for\nunder-playing and under-estimating the threat. “That is maddening,” Cruz said.\n“But the answer is not simply to yell, ‘China bad! Muslims bad!’”Then Cruz\nturned to an argument that, in essence, Trump’s harsh rhetoric belied his\nactual policy positions on the Middle East, which Cruz believed were not hard-\nline enough. For instance, Cruz believed that Trump was not sufficiently pro-\nIsrael and would give away too much by seeking to be a neutral broker in\nfuture talks between Israel and Palestinians.Prior to the exchange, the most\nspectacular arguments were between Trump and — himself. In two instances,\nTrump outlined a policy that he said was bad — and then explained how he\nhimself embraced it.On the question of immigration, for instance, Trump said\nthat the system of H-1B visas, meant for highly skilled foreigners, was\nharmful to U.S. workers. But he still uses it at his businesses.“It’s\nsomething that I frankly use. And I shouldn’t be allowed to use. And we\nshouldn’t have it,” Trump said of the H-1B program. “It’s sitting there\nwaiting for you. But it’s very bad . . . for our workers. And it’s very unfair\nfor our workers.”And then, on the subject of Social Security, Trump seemed to\ncriticize Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for saying\nthey didn’t want to change Social Security, and even wanted to expand it.Trump\nthen said that he, too, did not want to change Social Security.“I will do\neverything in my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it\nis,” Trump said, after Rubio had said he wanted to gradually change Social\nSecurity so that future generations of retirees would retire later. “It’s my\nabsolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is.”It was an almost\npost-apocalyptic debate, in which Trump rivals who had been blasting him a\nweek earlier seemed to see little point in fighting anymore. As the debate\nwent on, Trump even seemed to turn the heat up gradually against Cruz, saying\nthat he had supported “amnesty” for undocumented immigrants. It was one of the\nworst insults of this campaign so far. Cruz just laughed, and the debate moved\non. At another moment, a moderator noted that Cruz had mocked Clinton for\nsaying something that Trump had just said right in front of him — that Social\nSecurity could be salvaged by cutting only ‘Waste, fraud and abuse” — and not\nany benefits that people actually need.Did he just compare Trump to Hillary\nClinton? A moderator asked.Cruz, even then, didn’t bite. “I will let Donald\nspeak for himself,” Cruz said.Social Security is a major issue in Florida,\nwhere Thursday’s debate was held. That the debate was held in Florida was\nrecognition that the biggest prize at stake on Tuesday is the Sunshine State,\nwhere 99 delegates will be awarded to the winner, regardless of the voting\npercentages.On Thursday, a Washington Post-Univision News poll showed Trump\nleading Rubio by 38 percent to 31 percent among likely Republican voters in\nFlorida. That actually is good news for Rubio: Previous polls have shown him\nlosing to Trump by double digits. But still, he would come away empty handed\nif he lost his home state.On another key issue in Florida, climate change,\nRubio took a strong stance, although one that may not prove popular in Miami.\nHe rejected the idea of adopting new policies to fight climate change, saying\nthat the U.S. government could do nothing that would make a difference.Rubio\nwas asked by a moderator about a statement from Miami’s mayor, a Republican\nwho has endorsed Rubio, worrying that rising sea levels would swamp parts of\nhis city. Rubio responded with skepticism that climate change was really a\nman-made phenomenon, saying that the climate was always changing. Rubio then\npivoted to a slightly different argument — saying, in essence, that U.S.\npolicies could not stop climate change because other countries were already\npumping out so many greenhouse gases.“I am not going to destroy the U.S.\neconomy for a law that will do nothing for the environment,” Rubio said. It\nwas a remarkable contrast from the Democratic debate the night before, when\nboth Democratic candidates spoke about climate change as an urgent problem and\narticulated an urgent need to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions.Kasich responded\nby saying, “I do believe” that man-made climate change is occurring. Trump and\nCruz were not asked their opinion.Thursday night’s debate contrasted sharply\nwith previous few weeks encounters, when the GOP nominating process became\nsurreal as Trump’s challengers turned desperate.Rubio, in particular, had\nsought to copy Trump’s insult-comic style, mocking the front-runner’s tan and\ninsulting the size of his fingers. Trump responded in the next debate with an\neven more surreal moment: to reassure anyone who would draw implications from\nthe size of his hands, he volunteered onstage that there was “not a problem”\nwith the size of his genitals.If that moment hurt Trump, it didn’t hurt him\nmuch: He has won five of the seven states that have voted since then.Losing\nFlorida would be devastating not just to Rubio’s presidential campaign, but\nalso to his political career. Rubio is leaving the Senate, and he would have\nto face the next phase of his life with Trump’s epithet “Little Marco”\nmetaphorically hung around his neck.For Kasich, who as in previous debates\ntried to stay out of the fighting, the firewall is his home state, Ohio, which\nwill be almost as big a prize as Florida, with 66 delegates for the winner and\nzero for everybody else. Polls show Kasich in a close race with Trump in Ohio,\nwhere the GOP apparatus is strongly behind the governor and he has a fairly\nhigh approval rating. If he can beat Trump anywhere, Ohio is it.Trump so far\nhas won GOP contests in 15 states. He has accumulated about 458 Republican\ndelegates, 99 more than Cruz, his closest rival. Trump needs 1,237 delegates\nto win the nomination.During the debate, Trump said he would be the best at\nundoing the damage done to American workers by foreign trade deals — and his\nargument was that, as a businessman, he has exploited those very laws\nskilfully.“Nobody knows the system better than me,” Trump said when debate\nmoderator Anderson Cooper asked about Trump’s hiring of foreign workers for\nhis businesses. Trump also has been criticized for having his name-branded\nclothing and other products made overseas, despite his campaign-trail rhetoric\nbemoaning the loss of American manufacturing jobs. “I will take advantage of\nit — they’re the laws. But I’m the one who knows how to change it,” Trump\nsaid.The subject of foreign trade has become a powerful issue in both the\nRepublican and Democratic presidential primaries, with Trump and Democratic-\nprimary candidate Bernie Sanders appealing to white working-class voters by\nblaming long-serving politicians for the trade deals that shipped jobs away.In\nThursday’s GOP debate, the two candidates who are in the Senate sounded\nstrongly skeptical of deals that allow freer trade, which have long been\nfavored by Republicans in Washington. Both accused the Obama administration of\nessentially failing to hammer out trade deals that worked well and failing to\nproperly enforce what had been agreed to before.“There are great trade deals,\nand there are bad ones,” Rubio said.“We’re getting killed in international\ntrade right now,” Cruz said.Another Washington deal issue came up during the\ndebate: Cuba.Trump appeared to make up his policy on Cuba on the spot, pausing\nfor a moment to decide that he would undo President Obama’s decision to reopen\nthe U.S. Embassy in Havana.“I would probably have the embassy closed,” Trump\nsaid, after being pressed by CNN’s Dana Bash. He said the closure would be\ntemporary, while he renegotiated the terms of America’s rapprochement with\nCuba. “Make a deal. It would be great. But it’s got to be a great deal. Not a\nbad deal by the United States.”What followed was one of Rubio’s best moments\nof the night — a chance to defend a hard-line policy toward Cuba’s communist\nregime, which was a key part of his platform during his rise in Florida\npolitics. Rubio is the son of Cuban immigrants.“Here’s a good deal. Cuba has\nfree elections. Cuba stops putting people in jail” for political reasons,\nRubio said, listing the details he would demand in a future deal with the\nisland’s communist government. “You know what? Then we can have a relationship\nwith Cuba. That’s a good deal.”Trump opened the debate by saying that his\nparty’s establishment should embrace him — not fight him — because he is\nbringing new voters into the primary process.“They’re voting out of\nenthusiasm. They’re voting out of love. Some of these people, frankly, have\nnever voted before,” Trump said, calling his success in the GOP primaries one\nof the biggest political stories around the globe. He said that the GOP\nestablishment should accept him, because he could defeat a Democrat in the\nfall: “We’re going to beat them soundly.”Earlier in the day, reports indicated\nthat Trump will soon be endorsed by a candidate who was involved in earlier\nmain-stage debates — retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson.Later in the debate,\nTrump was asked whether he would give up a pledge to “self-fund” his campaign\nif he became the Republican nominee and needed an influx of cash to take on a\nDemocratic candidate.“I have not made that decision yet,” Trump said. “My\ndecision was that I would go through the entire primary season” without taking\nlarge contributions, Trump said. Despite his rhetoric, he is still taking\ndonations, including from people who use the “Donate” button on his website.He\nlater condemned the very system he was now considering joining. “They make\nlarge contributions to politicians, and they have total control over those\npoliticians. I don’t want anybody to control me, but the people right out\nthere” he said, meaning the debate audience.Trump then returned to a tactic he\nemployed several times Thursday night: citing his political impurities as a\nprivate citizens as proof that he can purify the system as a politician.“I\nknow the system is broken,” Trump said, speaking of campaign finance as\nsomeone who has given large amounts to politicians from both parties.\n“Frankly, I know the system better than anybody else. And I’m the only up here\nwho’s going to be able to fix that system.”Toward the end of the debate, Trump\nseemed to sum up his approach to governing in one sentence: despite his\npromises of a hard-line stance on a variety of subjects, he would be flexible\nwhen actually setting policy. Flexible on what? “It depends on what comes up,”\nhe said.\n\n", "title" : " GOP debate: It was mostly a civil affair, with rivals laying off attacking Trump - The Washington Post", "twitter" : { "body" : "Donald Trump says he doesnt condone violence against protesters, but expresses understanding http://wapo.st/1P2ZFCs", "link" : "https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/708142169421430785", "retweets" : 57, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-10T12:07:04.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 50, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "708142169421430785" }, "topic" : "climate change", "source" : "washingtonpost", "link" : "http://wapo.st/1P2ZFCs" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71a7d955d14d6aff102a1" }, "content" : "Marvin Odum, president of Shell Oil, was attending a meeting of the parent\ncompany’s executive committee in Singapore when word trickled in that an\nexploration well drilled in Alaska’s Chukchi Sea — the crowning step in a\nmulti-year $7 billion quest — was a dry hole. Maybe not bone dry. In a recent\ninterview, Odum wouldn’t say. But in the oil business glossary, a dry hole is\none that can’t pay off commercially, and Shell’s hole definitely qualified.\nThe parent company, Royal Dutch Shell, abruptly dropped any further drilling —\na setback for the industry, though a relief for environmentalists. For years,\nthey had fought a vigorous, litigious and politically intense battle over the\nChukchi. Meanwhile Shell, lured by potentially rich rewards, had overcome a\ncouple of embarrassing rig mishaps at sea and patiently navigated the courts\nand the Obama administration’s permitting process. Now, geology had rendered\nits verdict. Odum, who subsequently announced that he would be retiring at the\nend of this month, said the news about the well didn’t hit all at once, but\nthat the drilling results and analysis came in small, painful drips over\nseveral days of the executive committee meeting. Odum knows all too well the\nelement of chance that drives the oil-drilling business. The mechanical\nengineer has spent his entire 34-year working life at Shell and has overseen\nsuccessful exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere. (About a third of\nShell’s capital spending goes to North America.) The tools of the trade have\ngrown more sophisticated over time, with computer-aided seismic surveys that\ncan give exploration companies detailed three-dimensional, multicolored maps\nof the subsurface. Still, at the end of the day, there is only one way to find\nout for certain whether oil or natural gas is lurking deep in the\nEarth.“Through geology and seismic surveys, we had reduced the risk to where\nthe only way to reduce it more was to put down a well,” Odum said, adding that\nShell put it “where we thought there was the highest prospect” of a discovery.\nIf they had been correct, Odum said, the reward could have been fields as rich\nin oil as the Gulf of Mexico, which produces 1.6 million barrels a day worth\n$22 billion a year, even at today’s depressed prices.“The size of the prize\nwas always big enough to take that next step and find out for sure,” he said.\nOdum took time to reflect during a recent visit to the University of\nPennsylvania’s Wharton School. Odum’s departure has saddened many at Shell who\nsee him as, well, a nice guy. He says now is a logical time to leave Shell,\nwhich hired him on the spot during the one and only job interview of his life.\nHis father also did some work for Shell, devising a specially fitted type of\nsteel pipe that made drilling easier — and which NASA later used, too. But\nnow, Royal Dutch Shell is undergoing a massive reorganization to gird itself\nfor a more climate-conscious world, but one that Shell says will still need\nvast quantities of fossil fuels. With the recent $52 billion acquisition of\nthe British BG Group, Royal Dutch Shell is making liquefied natural gas a\nbigger part of its future. It also picked up alluring deepwater oil fields off\nBrazil. It has reorganized its lines of management by function, rather than\ngeography. And it is planning to sell $30 billion in assets over the next\nthree years, twice the normal rate. That could include some items in North\nAmerica. To many analysts, it looked like Odum was pushed into leaving. “He’s\na very competent guy. Very low key and sure of himself,” said Fadel Gheit, oil\nanalyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. “But unfortunately for him, the results\nwere pretty bad. It’s basically on his watch.” Gheit said the drilling rig\nmishaps at sea cost hundreds of millions of dollars and, back on the mainland,\nShell had to write down the value of shale oil and gas properties. But, he\nadded, these setbacks were “not entirely his fault.”Odum says that while he’s\nnot rushing into anything, he plans to find new work in the oil business. He\nalso plans to spend more time with his new grandson, his golf clubs, his cello\n(an eight-year-old Christmas present he’s just learning) and his three\nmotorcycles — a Harley-Davidson, a BMW and a Ducati. “I love riding. It’s the\nengineer in me,” he said. The night before Odum arrived at the University of\nPennsylvania, students from the Penn Sustainability Review, an environmental\npublication, met to figure out how to pressure the university into selling the\nendowment’s investments in fossil fuel companies. Last year, 88 percent of\nPenn undergraduates who voted in a referendum favored divestment from fossil\nfuels. (A third of undergraduates voted.) Similar measures are sweeping across\ncollege campuses, efforts that in some ways resemble the anti-apartheid\ndisinvestment campaigns aimed at South Africa.Fossil Free Penn, which launched\nthe referendum, has called for the university to stop new investments in the\nfossil-fuel industry, sell off holdings in the top 200 fossil-fuel companies\nwithin five years and reinvest a portion of the funds into renewable energy.\nThe group estimates that 4 percent of Penn’s $9.6 billion endowment is\ninvested in fossil-fuel companies.Royal Dutch Shell is a big target not only\nbecause it produces oil and gas to satisfy global demand, but also because of\nits record in places such as Nigeria’s Niger Delta, where thieves and local\ninsurgents frequently siphon oil from pipelines, sometimes causing leaks or\nexplosions. Community leaders and environmental groups have accused the\ncompany of ruining the environment; the company has been selling or reducing\nits troubled operations onshore and sticking to those offshore.And in the\nUnited States, the push to drill in the Alaskan Arctic drew sharp opposition.\nUnder Odum, “the company consistently demonstrated a lack of preparedness and\na willingness to push the limits of the law, technology and common sense,”\nsaid Michael LeVine, a lawyer with Oceana, which opposes all offshore\ndrilling. “Shell’s misadventures in the Arctic Ocean should serve as a\ncautionary tale for other oil companies considering investments in remote and\ndangerous places.”If ever the oil industry needed a human face, however, Odum\nhas been it, representing Shell in a coalition that supported the Obama\nadministration’s cap-and-trade climate strategy back in 2009. At Penn, he said\nthe Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan — which would favor gas over coal\n— was “not perfect, but it’s a good reasonable place to start” and he was\n“supportive.” He said he would prefer an economy-wide carbon tax if it were\never politically feasible, even though it would raise retail prices of oil\nproducts.“I intellectually understand it,” he said during a class in which a\nstudent asked about the divestment movement. “If your point is to divest from\nfossil fuel companies, just be very clear what you want to accomplish. If it’s\na symbolic move — ‘we want to voice our position’ — I say, ‘fine.’ I’d much\nrather say there is an opportunity here, particularly with companies like\nShell, to co-create a solution with a company that deeply understands energy\nmarkets.”Odum said, “The idea that you can turn fossil fuels off and other\nsources on and all will be well in 10 years, it’s just wrong.” He said,\ntherefore, that “if you’re going down that route [toward divestment], then I\nwould ask you to look at differences between companies out there. I think\nwe’re trying to do the right things.”Shell has long basked in a bit of\nclimate-sensitive sunshine because of Odum’s revelation (at a Washington Post\nevent) that the company factors in a $40-a-ton carbon price when it does the\neconomic analysis on a new project, an adjustment that would penalize\nproposals that are the worst from a climate change point of view. Asked about\nthe Paris climate accord, he said “we will never get this transition going at\nthe pace people want without a price on carbon.”A Penn professor had an astute\nquestion: Does Shell assign a carbon price only to the energy the company uses\nto extract oil or gas? Or does it apply the price to the end use on all oil\nand gas found? Odum clarified that it applied only to the amount used in\nextraction — a tiny sliver of the overall climate impact of a project. Odum\ndeflected a question about whether Shell should use part of its huge annual\ncapital budget, now about $33 billion after the BG merger, to promote\nrenewable energy. He said that shareholders of a company like Shell might\nprefer if Shell stuck to what it knew — finding oil and gas — and let\nshareholders take other money and invest it in firms specializing in renewable\nenergy. Odum said that Shell is considering investing in large-scale biofuels,\nwind and solar, but most likely side-by-side with and complementing Shell\nnatural gas projects; Shell is not going to start manufacturing solar panels.\nDivestment is not the only hot-button issue at the University of Pennsylvania.\nWhen Odum arrived earlier in the day at the Wharton School’s radio station to\ndo an interview, the producer offered to screen out callers who were\nparticularly irate about shale gas drilling, which has been a huge issue in\nPennsylvania, where many residents say wells have contaminated drinking water.\nOdum told her not to worry. And when the subject didn’t come up, he brought it\nup himself. “What’s happened in the back yard here in Pennsylvania has changed\nthe world,” Odum said of the giant Marcellus gas reserve in the state that has\nlowered prices and made it possible to replace dirty burning coal-fired power\nplants with gas-fired ones. But he added, “there is a right way to develop\nthis gas” and then there are the pollution hazards residents worry about.\n“Those are not difficult problems to solve,” he said. Shell is part of a group\nof companies cooperating with the Environmental Defense Fund to measure potent\nmethane leaks that could negate climate benefits of burning gas instead of\ncoal. “I come out in favor of very clear, very strong regulations,” Odum said.\n“From the perspective of a company like us, it protects us because everybody\nthen has to do it the right way.”But most of the students who saw him in a\nclassroom, and later at an open event, zeroed in on business decisions steered\nby the price of oil, which has tumbled about 70 percent since July 2014. Shell\nhas slashed capital spending to about $20 billion from about $35 billion, and\nit has shelved its planned Carmon Creek oil sands project in Canada. Instead\nof exploring for shale oil in two dozen basins, he said the company is down to\nsix “sweet spots.” “We’re in a commodity business, and when you’re in a down\ncycle, everything is difficult to decide,” he said. “You’ve got to keep your\nbalance sheet strong. Not just to remain solvent but able to make strategic\nmoves when everyone else is suffering.”When deciding on a project, he said,\nShell looks at its economics, its “resilience” if economic conditions go bad,\npolitical factors, country risk and environmental issues. He said that before\nthe steep price drop, Royal Dutch Shell had been weighing on six or seven big\nprojects a year, but in the past year had signed off on only two. “You don’t\nmake multibillion-dollar choices lightly,” he said, when asked about his\ntoughest decisions. “I could pick an easy one: Alaska. We spent many billions\nof dollars exploring off Alaska,” he said, “but the final answer comes from\nthe drill bit when the oil that we needed for it to be viable wasn’t there.”\n\n", "title" : " An oilman’s $7 billion refresher course in the economics of drilling and climate change - The Washington Post", "twitter" : { "body" : "An oilmans $7 billion lesson in the economics of climate change http://wapo.st/24UX35a", "link" : "https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/708363880435679235", "retweets" : 49, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-11T02:48:04.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 33, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "708363880435679235" }, "topic" : "climate change", "source" : "washingtonpost", "link" : "http://wapo.st/24UX35a" }

The\nDanish government has also adopted new rules to seize valuables from refugees\nto help pay for the cost of their stay in Denmark.According to Reuters,\nAustria is also announcing the deportation of 50,000 refugees.A new study\nestimates Germany will spend more than 50 billion euros on refugees in 2016\nand 2017, according to the Cologne Institute for Economic Research. Some\nestimates that indicate Germany is likely to spend more on refugees than it\ndoes on its military.According to the BBC, in Cologne, Germany, more than 500\nwomen have filed complaints about attacks by foreign migrants on New Year’s\nEve. More than 40 percent of the complaints involved sexual assault, ranging\nfrom groping to rape. A crowd of more than 1,000 foreign men had gathered\naround the train station in Cologne that night and systematically harassed\nGerman women.The American news media and American politicians have not had\nmuch to say about the alarming news coming out of European countries regarding\nrefugees from the Middle East. We are witnessing a conspiracy of politically\ncorrect silence. Our elites do not want to acknowledge that the wave of\nrefugees brings with it a lot of serious problems.In Germany, this politically\ncorrect silence meant the police and the news media downplayed the New Year’s\nattacks until the stream of complaints on social media overwhelmed their\nattempt to hide the truth.In the Scandinavian countries, there has been a\nconsistent policy of ignoring or minimizing refugee or migrant violence\nagainst Swedes.There is danger that we in the United States are only a few\nyears behind Europe in having our society inundated with people who do not\nshare our customs, understand our values or feel that violence is\ninappropriate. Americans need to take a careful look at the painful experience\nof the Europeans before we follow them down that path.The next time someone\ntells you the United States has nothing to fear from accepting tens or\nhundreds of thousands of refugees, ask them to explain what is happening in\nEurope. Why are so many European nations rejecting refugees?\n\n", "title" : "NEWT GINGRICH: Refugee lessons from Europe - Washington Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "NEWT GINGRICH: #Refugee lessons from Europe. http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/4/newt-gingrich-refugee-lessons-europe/ pic.twitter.com/GEcCuGqlNd", "link" : "https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/695429278054240256", "retweets" : 12, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-04T10:10:34.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 3, "hashtags" : "#Refugee", "id" : "695429278054240256" }, "topic" : "refugee", "source" : "washtimes", "link" : "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/feb/4/newt-gingrich-refugee-lessons-europe/" }

She waits to\nresume her life. She hoped that something would change after a peace deal was\nsigned last week to end the civil war in her native South Sudan. But that\nagreement is already threatening to fall apart, just like all the previous\nattempts at reconciliation in the bloody two-year civil war.So she waits for\npeace.“I came here with my kids to escape the civil war and to look for food,”\nmumbled Ms. Aluel, a widow who bore six children and now looks frail and\nsickly. “But I am willing to go back when peace prevails and build my own\ncountry.”The power-sharing agreement signed last week was supposed to be the\nculmination of peace accords reached in August to end the fighting between\nSouth Sudanese President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, and his rival, former\nVice President Riek Machar, of the rival Nuer tribe. The fighting has killed\ntens of thousands and displaced more than 2 million Sudanese, according to the\nUnited Nations. But on Sunday Mr. Machar accused Mr. Kiir of delay tactics and\ncalled back his negotiating team.That is not good news for those such as Ms.\nAluel.The widow arrived in Kakuma two years ago after she fled to Kenya with\nthree of her surviving children, all six or younger. Her husband and three\nother children were killed in fighting in Bor, the provincial capital of\nJonglei State, an eastern province in South Sudan where the violence has been\nmost intense.“I was also raped by rebel soldiers and my house burned,” she\nsaid. “I would rather risk starving than endure violence that killed my family\n[again].”Across the border between South Sudan and Kenya, a swarm of vultures\nhovers in the sky and a sickening smell fills the air. Slain bodies decaying\ncan be seen on the South Sudan side of the border.“Some of those people killed\nyou see are women and children,” Ms. Aluel said. “They died while trying to\ncross the border to Kenya. Most of them were weak and hungry. They couldn’t\nsurvive long enough to reach here.”The existing Kakuma facility, which opened\nin 1992, is itself a kind of mini-U.N., home to refugees of 18 nationalities.\nAbout 80,000 of the 185,000 camp residents are South Sudanese. Somalis account\nfor 30 percent. Significant numbers of refugees have also come from Ethiopia,\nBurundi, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The overloaded camp was\ndesigned to hold 125,000 people and is straining at the seams to service the\ndesperate refugees who flock here.“We do suffer because of hunger,” said\nStephen Pech Gai, a South Sudanese citizen who lives in Kakuma refugee camp.\n“We are not able to learn as well as we were in our country. Most students who\nwere supposed to join high school have dropped out because of many various\nchallenges we are facing in camp.”**Deadly power struggle**Violence has\nplagued South Sudan since it declared independence in a referendum from Sudan\nin 2011. First the country fought Sudan over disputed territory containing\nvaluable oil deposits. Then the power struggle between Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar\ndescended into civil war.Under the peace deal, the two longtime rivals would\nshare power, with members of the armed opposition sitting in parliament and\nMr. Machar controlling a third of government ministries. Voters would then\nreplace the so-called unity government in elections in three years._Story\nContinues →_\n\n", "title" : "South Sudan conflict peace deal again breaks apart, refugee despair grows - Washington Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Refugee despair grows as #SouthSudan peace deal again breaks apart: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/20/south-sudan-conflict-peace-deal-again-breaks-apart/", "link" : "https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/689980120736649221", "retweets" : 5, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-20T09:17:34.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 2, "hashtags" : "#SouthSudan", "id" : "689980120736649221" }, "topic" : "refugee", "source" : "washtimes", "link" : "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/20/south-sudan-conflict-peace-deal-again-breaks-apart/" }

Police said no one was\ninjured but a group of people gathered outside, some \"commenting with\nderogatory remarks or unashamed joy\" at the fire.While most Germans have been\nwelcoming toward refugees, a vocal minority has staged protests in front of\nrefugee homes, especially in the east. Germany last year saw a surge in\nviolence against such lodgings.Police ordered three people to leave the fire\nscene because they were hampering firefighters' work and then temporarily\ndetained two of them, whom they described as intoxicated 20-year-old locals,\nafter they ignored the order.Investigators found traces of a fire accelerant\nat the scene and believe the fire was caused by arson, police said. It wasn't\nimmediately clear whether the building can be restored.Saxony is home to the\nanti-Islam and anti-immigration group PEGIDA, and incidents there have caused\nconcern before. In August, a mob in Heidenau, outside Dresden, hurled bottles\nand fireworks at police protecting a shelter being set up for refugees.The\nBautzen fire came after a mob in the small town of Clausnitz, also in Saxony,\non Thursday screamed \"We are the people!\" and \"Go home!\" as they blocked a bus\ncarrying asylum-seekers outside a new refugee home.Police drew criticism in\nthat case for roughly hauling some refugees off the bus into the building —\nwhich they insist was necessary to prevent the situation from escalating — and\nfor saying that some of the refugees had made provocative gestures.Saxony\nGovernor Stanislaw Tillich called the two incidents \"appalling and shocking\"\nand described the perpetrators as \"criminals.\"\"This is abhorrent and\ndisgusting,\" Tillich told the Funke newspaper group.

(AP\nPhoto/Natalia Sancha) While the U.S. and Russia have announced “preliminary\nagreement” on the “cessation of hostilities” in Syria, humanitarian workers\nwarn that the violence on the ground remains unchecked, and the situation is\nworsening for tens of thousands of additional Syrians being forced to flee as\na result.Nor, they report, has the highly publicized entry of a small number\nof United Nations-sponsored relief convoys into a few of many areas besieged\nby the regime of Bashar Assad made much of a difference.The escalating\nviolence has made other avenues for filtering relief into embattled Syrian\nterritory extremely difficult and dangerous, and the initial U.N. convoys have\nso far not been followed by any others.“We have not seen a cease-fire on the\nground,” Christy Delafield, a spokesperson for the U.S.-based international\naid organization Mercy Corps, told Fox News. Her organization says that it is\nproviding humanitarian aid to some 500,000 Syrians monthly without the\nsupervision of the Russian-supported Assad regime, but that is growing more\nand more difficult.“The situation is not good,” she said. “The violence\ncontinues. We are looking at an intensification of the conflict, not a\ncessation of hostilities.”As a result, aid organizations like Mercy Corps face\ngreater and greater difficulty in getting supplies to areas of the country\nwhere regime sanctions supplies do not go -- a subject of growing criticism\nfor the U.N., which carries out relief operations under the sanction of\nAssad.“We have been cut off from the safest and most direct routes for\ndelivery,” Delafield reported. “There are bombs on the road that we do use. It\nis really dangerous.” Mercy Corps says that two of its off-duty aid workers\nwere killed in recent bombing attacks, and two persons killed and 20 injured\nin a bombing assault near an aid distribution point.  \n“We have not seen a cease-fire on the ground.”- Christy Delafield, of Mercy\nCorpsAs a result of the increasing military pressure, there has been a\ndramatic hike in the number of northern Syrian refugees headed for camps on\nthe border with Turkey, and also in other areas of the country where regime\nattacks have increased.“Displacement camps near the Turkish border doubled to\n65,000 people since January,” Delafield reported. “Now there are 75,000 people\nthere, with 27,000 living outside camps, sometimes in mosques and\nschools.”“Shelter is incredibly hard to come by,” she said. “We are\ndesperately trying to get tarps in. It is very challenging.”The new refugee\nflood is producing other desperation issues, including how to provide and\nmaintain latrines and other sanitary facilities for the ballooning refugee\npopulations, to prevent wildfire outbreaks of disease.The rising populations\non the move are straining humanitarian aid in other ways as well. Delafield\nsays that Mercy Corps has “shifted from our standard relief food kit -- which\nrequires a kitchen -- to a ready-to-eat kit that only lasts for two weeks, and\nis more expensive.”The switch to different rations also has put a sudden\nstrain on the new kinds of supplies. “There are not a lot of these around,”\nshe says.For its part, the U.N.’s World Food Program, which led the recent\nrelief convoys to a scattering of areas where starving residents have been\nwithout outside food supplies for months, says it is working hard to meet the\nsame relief surge.A WFP spokesperson said the U.N. organization has\ndistributed food rations for almost 74,000 people in the camps and itemized a\nlist of staples as well as ready-to-eat supplies.“We are sending additional\nready-to-eat rations to cover the needs of up to 45,000 more people should\ndisplacements continue in the coming days,” the spokesperson added.The relief\nconvoys that finally proceeded to besieged areas with Assad government\napproval brought supplies for 81,000 people that are intended to last for a\nmonth, the WFP spokesperson said.But efforts so far for other besieged areas\n-- there are at least 15 on a by-no-means exhaustive list -- have not achieved\nanything so far.The WFP spokesperson told Fox News that the U.N. organization\nhas gotten permission from the Damascus regime to send relief aid to two other\nbesieged areas, one in rural Damascus and the other in Deir Ezzor, a medium-\nsized city near Iraq.But even with formal permission, the spokesman noted,\n“the two areas have not been scheduled yet. We are working on the logistical\narrangements for both.”Meantime, she said, WFP, like the non-government aid\norganizations, is growing “very concerned because access to eastern Aleppo\ncity is getting more and more difficult due to ongoing fighting close to the\nroad that provides access to the city.”She added that “WFP has started sending\na two-month supply of food stocks to the city to cover the needs of over\n100,000 people.”That aid, however, largely flows through channels that depend\non agreement by the Assad government.While lauding the U.N. relief convoys to\na scattering of areas where starving residents have been without food supplies\nfor months, Mercy Corps spokesman Delafield observes that “the need is\ndesperate not just in areas that the U.N. designates as besieged. Their\nresidents deserve no less assistance.”“We need sustained humanitarian access,\neverywhere.”Not to mention an end to military assaults that so far, still seem\nendless._George Russell is editor-at-large of Fox News and can be found on\nTwitter:  @GeorgeRussell or on Facebook.com/GeorgeRussell___\n\n", "title" : "Syria: Violence and refugee plight worsening despite diplomatic deals | Fox News", "twitter" : { "body" : "Syria: Violence and refugee plight worsening despite diplomatic deals http://fxn.ws/1L6hYM2 via @GeorgeRussell pic.twitter.com/2R6PcHAYUU", "link" : "https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/701989878259515393", "retweets" : 60, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-22T12:40:03.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "@GeorgeRussell", "favs" : 48, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "701989878259515393" }, "topic" : "refugee", "source" : "FoxNews", "link" : "http://fxn.ws/1L6hYM2" }

A French court approved\nrazing tents at a camp known as the \"jungle.\" (AP Photo/Jerome Delay)CALAIS,\nFrance –  A French court on Thursday gave the state the green light to raze\ntents and lean-tos sheltering hundreds of migrants in a sprawling slum camp in\nCalais, where thousands dream of getting to Britain.The camp in the northern\nport city -- known as the \"jungle\" -- has been an embarrassing and often\nshocking chapter in Europe's migrant crisis, and the state announced this\nmonth that the densely populated southern half would be razed.Associations\nprotesting the move took the issue to court seeking a postponement of a\ndeadline reached last Tuesday for migrants to move out.The court in Lille\nruled that the makeshift shelters used by the migrants can be destroyed -- but\nthat common spaces like places of worship, schools and a library must\nstand.Demolition crews have been poised to start what officials say will be a\nbetter solution for migrants trapped in Calais with borders all but sealed by\nincreasing security.Officials estimate the number of migrants who will be\naffected at around 800 to 1,000. Humanitarian organizations say over 3,000\nmigrants live there.Moving the migrants out of the mini-slum will be the most\ndramatic step by the French state to end Calais' years-long migrant problem,\nwhich has transformed the northern city into a high-security tension point,\nfueled far-right sentiment and defied British and French government efforts to\nmake it go away. Critics contend that closing the camp may not solve the\nproblem.The same court in Lille ordered the state in November to clean up the\ncamp by adding running water, toilets and garbage bins, and counting the\nnumber of minors without families -- now 326 -- and help those in\ndistress.Saving the migrants' temporary homes from bulldozers became a mass\neffort by volunteers, humanitarian groups and a dose of star power. British\nactor Jude Law paid a visit last weekend and 260 French figures signed a\npetition against destroying the camp.In announcing plans to close the camp,\nauthorities cited security and sanitation concerns and the increasingly\ntarnished image of Calais, a city of nearly 80,000 that takes pride in drawing\ntourists to its Opal Coast. Its prime location -- with a major ferry port,\nEurotunnel rail system and truck traffic crossing the English Channel -- has\nput it in the crosshairs of the migrant crisis.Residents have mostly learned\nto live with migrants in their midst. But tensions rose when the camp's\npopulation spiked to 6,000 last fall before dropping to 4,000 more recently.An\nincreasingly vocal backlash is punctuated by militia-style violence. Truckers\nhave grown exasperated or fearful of increasingly bold tactics by migrants\ntrying to sneak rides across the English Channel.The area targeted for\ndestruction is dotted with rickety shops, cafes, places of worship and\nschools, built by aid groups and the migrants, most of whom traveled from\nconflict zones like Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan, or came to escape human rights\nabuses or poverty in African nations.A sense of anxiety mounted in the camp\nahead of the court ruling.\"Obviously, they are scared and concerned about what\nis going to happen,\" said Ed Sexton, of Help Refugees, one of numerous British\nassociations working in the camp.  \"The people have been here months, living\nin terrible conditions, but they don't want their shelters destroyed.\"Weary\ntravelers come to Calais driven by a dream -- circulated among migrants,\npeddled by smugglers -- that they will find peace and prosperity in Britain.\nLacking papers, they have to sneak across the Channel, and at least 20\nmigrants have died trying since late June, according to authorities.Camp\nresidents were offered the choice of being sent to temporary welcome centers\naround France, or staying in one of 125 heated containers set up last month in\na fenced-in area behind the camp.\"It's inhuman to live in the jungle. But\ncertain associations, certain billionaire stars are telling us to leave things\nalone,\" the head of the region, conservative Xavier Bertrand, said during a\nvisit last weekend. \"That's enough. The jungle must be evacuated.\"Humanitarian\nworkers predicted that those who refuse to leave would shelter in small groups\nelsewhere around Calais and the coast.\"You're basically going to scatter a lot\nof people,\" said Maya Konforti of the association Auberge des Migrants.An\nAfghan who identified himself only as Jan said he would look elsewhere for a\nshelter if Calais were closed.\"They are the government ... we can't fight with\nthem,\" he said.Nearby Belgium, concerned about an influx of Calais evacuees,\nhas implemented border checks.Another filthy camp known as a haven for\nsmugglers, near Dunkirk, France, is being relocated to a more hygienic site\nwith heated tents under the supervision of Doctors Without Borders.The\nprefecture, which announced plans to raze the camp on Feb. 12, said bulldozers\nwould not touch the camp's makeshift churches, mosques and a just-opened\nschool. Facing criticism of the eviction order, Interior Minister Bernard\nCazeneuve softened the ultimatum this week, saying the evacuation would be\n\"progressive.\"Authorities view the razing of much of the camp as a turning\npoint for Calais, but that's a far from certain outcome.A Red Cross-run camp\nin nearby Sangatte -- used during its three-year existence by some 68,000\nrefugees -- was shut down in 2002. Afterward, hundreds moved up the coast to\nset up small camps around Calais.Authorities periodically razed them, then\nopened a state-sponsored day center in April with showers, plugs to charge\nphones and a meal distribution center.

One depicts a hand reaching for a shapely,\nbikini-clad woman’s backside, and bears a universal-language slash\ndemonstrating such behavior is forbidden.“No verbal and bodily sexual\nharassment toward women in any kind of clothing,” reads the caption below.Mass\nsexual assaults of women by refugees during New Year’s Eve celebrations sent\nshockwaves through the nation. The attackers were believed to be among the\nestimated wave of 1 million Muslims who have poured into Germany in the last\nyear, prompting a culture clash that critics say Berlin has been slow to\ngrasp.Before and after the New Year’s Eve attacks, hundreds of which occurred\nin Cologne, there were widespread reports of male refugees sexually harassing\nand assaulting women in public. Many of the incidents occurred at the nation’s\npopular public swimming halls, where authorities this week posted signs and\nissued codes of conduct to discourage the violent behavior. (Public indoor\nswimming pools, like this one in Leipzig, are popular in Germany. (Reuters))\nIn the East German city of Leipzig, migrants have followed women into restroom\nand changing facilities, according to the newspaper Mitteldeutche Zeitung.\nElsewhere, male refugees have jumped into pools fully clothed or wearing\nunderwear and groped female bathers. Officials in several communities,\nincluding the Bavarian capital of Munich, have responded with anti-sexual\nharassment cartoon leaflets to stop the increasing number of sexual attacks\nand aggression in public swimming facilities.“These signs are a good step, but\nthey can only be a first initiative of more security measures to come,” Saba\nFarzan, executive director of Foreign Policy Circle, a Berlin strategy think\ntank, told FoxNews.com. “Protecting our women from vicious assaults means to\nteach refugees as well as migrants about gender equality.”But critics say\nlaws, not leaflets and signs, should be used to protect women from assault.“If\nour criminal and asylum laws can’t discourage perpetrators of sexual\nharassment and the activity of other offenses, what effect can signs in\nswimming facilities have?”  Cologne-based lawyer Stefanie Galla told\nFoxNews.com.The codes of conduct and leaflets are being printed in multiple\nlanguages, including Arabic and English.  The city of Leipzig also plans to\nrapidly introduce English signs about appropriate conduct and multi-language\ninformation pamphlets.  Security cameras are set to be installed in the\nswimming facilities. Berlin, the capital of Germany, announced this week that\nit will introduce behavioral codes and signs for refugees who enter swimming\nbuildings.The small western town of Hermeskeil now requires that refugees\nparticipate in a 30-minute behavioral class before entering public swimming\npools. The city requires that the migrants read 10 rules and sign a pledge\nthat they will follow them before issuing an entry card for swimming.“Swimming\nis only allowed in swimwear (not in underwear  or  jeans or T-shirt)!” reads\none of the rules.Some communities have found the education approach lacking.\nLast week, the town of Bornheim began barring adult male refugees from a\npublic swimming facility because of sexual assaults. Bornheim has a population\nof about 45,000, and has absorbed approximately 800 Muslim refugees.Sexual\nassaults also have been reported on public transportation facilities.\nChristian Janele, a city council representative in the Bavarian city of\nRegensburg, has suggested pink-colored “Lady Zones” where women would be\nseparated from men. The bill, which was rejected by the city, was not prompted\nby the refugees, Janele insisted.In the wake of the Cologne attacks, a\nprominent Muslim imam, Sami Abu-Yusuf, told reporters women were to blame\nbecause they “dress half naked and wear perfume.” The outrageous claim\nprompted Green Party Member of Parliament Volker Beck to file a criminal\ncomplaint against the cleric.___Benjamin Weinthal reports on human rights in\nthe Middle East and is a fellow at the __Foundation for Defense of\nDemocracies__.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71a7d955d14d6aff102ac" }, "content" : "(CNN)Turkey and the European Union say they have agreed on key points of a\n\"bold\" proposal to help resolve the migrant crisis, aimed at deterring\nmigrants from attempting the perilous journey to Europe.Under the proposed\ndeal, Ankara would agree to take back all migrants who leave Turkey's shores\nfor Europe in the future, including those intercepted in its territorial\nwaters, on the condition that one legitimate Syrian refugee is resettled in\nEurope for every Syrian returned to Turkey.EU-Turkey migrant deal in 5\nquestions -- how would it actually work?But international humanitarian groups\nhave harshly criticized parts of the agreement, with a senior official from\nthe U.N. refugee agency saying Tuesday that sending back refugees en masse\nwould not be \"consistent with European law.\"\"An agreement that would be\ntantamount to a blanket return to a third country is not consistent with\nEuropean law, not consistent with international law,\" Vincent Cochetel, Europe\nregional director of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees,\ntold reporters in Geneva, Switzerland.The plan would also see the EU provide\nTurkey with billions in additional funding for refugees, speed up talks on\nTurkey joining the EU and accelerate the lifting of visa requirements for\nTurkish citizens in Europe. The proposal still requires details to be hammered\nout before being sent for approval by EU leaders next week. \"The days of\nirregular migration to the European Union are over,\" said Donald Tusk,\npresident of the European Council -- as the group of 28 EU leaders is known --\nat the end of this week's emergency summit in Brussels, Belgium.He said\nTurkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu had \"confirmed Turkey's commitment to\naccept the rapid return of all migrants coming from Turkey to Greece that are\nnot in need of international protection.\" \"The EU will support Greece in\nensuring comprehensive, large-scale and fast-track returns to Turkey,\" Tusk\nsaid.A statement from EU heads of government said they agreed that \"bold moves\nwere needed\" to break the business model of smugglers, highlighting the\nimportance of a NATO anti-trafficking mission in the Aegean Sea that just\nexpanded into Greek and Turkish territorial waters.\"We need to break the link\nbetween getting in a boat and getting settlement in Europe,\" the statement\nsaid.Davutoglu said that his country, which hosts more Syrian refugees than\nany other, was motivated to enter into the arrangement primarily out of\nhumanitarian concern.\"We don't want to see women and children dying in the\nAegean Sea,\" he told reporters, according to Turkey's semiofficial Anadolu\nnews agency. European leaders are grappling with the biggest refugee crisis\nsince World War II, with more than 1 million people having entered EU\nterritory since the start of 2015. Most of the migrants are from Syria, where\nthe civil war has created more than 4 million refugees and displaced a further\n6 million within the country.The majority have come by using trafficking\nnetworks to cross the Aegean, which separates Turkey and Greece, before\nheading overland through the Balkans to Germany and other northern European\ncountries.The crossing is dangerous, with more than 400 migrants having died\nso far this year, according to the International Organization for\nMigration.Recently, a number of countries along the Balkan migration route\nagreed to all but close their borders, leaving a bottleneck of desperate\nmigrants stranded in Greece, already struggling with a debt crisis. Thousands\nof refugees stuck on Greece-Macedonia border as new rules take holdTusk\nconfirmed at the summit's end that EU leaders had decided to \"end the 'wave-\nthrough approach'\" through countries along the overland route to Western\nEurope.\"Irregular flows of migrants along the Western Balkans route have now\ncome to an end,\" the EU heads of government said in a joint statement.Making\ngood on that vow, Serbia closed its southern borders, with Macedonia and\nBulgaria, at midnight Tuesday, before Macedonia followed suit, sealing its\nborder with Greece.\"We stopped accepting migrants at the border with Greece\nMarch 8 due to the fact that the Serbian government stopped accepting migrants\non March 6 and the migrants couldn't reach their destination,\" a spokeswoman\nfor the Macedonian Interior Ministry told CNN.More than 11,000 people have\nbeen stuck on the Greece-Macedonia border in a transit camp at Idomeni\ndesigned for 1,500, according to Doctors Without Borders.Serbia said it\nlearned from Croatia that Slovenia, another EU member, would not receive\nmigrants without valid visas and passports, effectively closing the Balkan\nroute.** **\"Serbia cannot afford to become a collection center for refugees,\nso it will consolidate all measures with the European Union, and reciprocally\napply them in its southern and eastern borders with Macedonia and Bulgaria,\"\nSerbia's Ministry of Internal Affairs told CNN in an email.In Slovenia, the\nGovernment Communications Office director confirmed that the country was\nclosing its borders at midnight Tuesday. \"People who don't have proper\ndocuments -- i.e. people who don't have papers for Schengen -- cannot enter\nthe Schengen area,\" Kristina Krajnc Plavsak told CNN. \"We are strictly\nimplementing Schengen rules.\" She said the closure comes in coordination with\nSlovenia's neighbors and with other countries on the Balkan route, and it was\nnot a unilateral decision.Tusk said the EU would deploy \"massive humanitarian\nassistance\" to Greece to help it respond to the effects of the route's closure\nand would offer aid for the country to manage its external border.Migrants\nwere sent back from Greece to Turkey last week, Tusk said, in what he\ndescribed as the \"first visible step\" of the Greek-Turkish bilateral\nagreement.Other humanitarian organizations were quick to join the U.N. refugee\nagency in criticizing the proposal -- in particular, the mass return of\nrefugees to Turkey. Amnesty International said the plan showed an \"alarmingly\nshort-sighted and inhumane attitude\" to the migrant crisis and would deal a\n\"death blow to the right to seek asylum.\"The statement said Amnesty opposed\n\"the concept of a 'safe third country' in general, as this undermines the\nindividual right to have asylum claims fully and fairly processed,\" and that\nthere was \"huge cause for concern\" about sending migrants to Turkey, \"given\nthe current situation and treatment of migrants and refugees.\"The statement\nattacked the \"horse trading\" concept of resettling a Syrian refugee in Europe\nfor every compatriot sent back to Turkey, saying the proposal would make\n\"every resettlement place offered to a Syrian in the EU contingent upon\nanother Syrian risking their life by embarking on the deadly sea route to\nGreece.\"\"The idea of bartering refugees for refugees is not only dangerously\ndehumanizing, but also offers no sustainable long-term solution to the ongoing\nhumanitarian crisis,\" said Iverna McGowan, head of Amnesty's European\nInstitutions Office.Amnesty also expressed concern about the closure of the\nBalkan migration route, which would \"lead to thousands of vulnerable people\nbeing left in the cold with no clear plan on how their urgent humanitarian\nneeds and rights to international protection would be dealt with.\"The\nInternational Rescue Committee lauded the meeting in Brussels but warned that\n\"closing all of Europe's borders without offering alternative routes to safety\nwill not work.\"\"In fact,\" the organization said, \"the only winners will be the\nsmugglers, as people take more elaborate and more dangerous routes to\nsafety.\"U.N. refugee agency spokesman William Spindler said refugees should be\nreturned to a third country only if certain safeguards were in place, such as\na protections against \"refoulement,\" a legal term used to describe returning\nasylum seekers somewhere they would be at risk.Spindler called for the details\nof these safeguards to be clarified before the proposal was next put to EU\nleaders at a crisis meeting scheduled for March 17.Late last year, the\nEuropean Union and Turkey agreed to a joint action plan in response to the\nmigrant crisis. European leaders agreed to pay Turkey 3 billion euros ($3.3\nbillion) to support its refugee population and target people-smuggling\nnetworks -- a mission that has seen NATO warships deployed to the eastern\nMediterranean this year.Tusk said that \"despite good implementation\" of that\nplan, it had failed to reduce the migrant flow sufficiently and that extra\nsteps were necessary. The new proposal would focus on speeding up the\ndisbursement of the 3 billion euros already pledged to Turkey as well as\nproviding new funding to alleviate the crisis. Turkey requested an extra 3\nbillion euros at this week's summit, according to European Parliament\nPresident Martin Schulz.The EU would bear the cost of returning the migrants\nto Turkey under the proposal.Syrian refugees settled in the EU under terms of\nthe deal would be distributed among member states \"within the framework of the\nexisting commitments,\" a joint statement from the EU heads of government\nsaid.UK sends boats to Aegean Sea ahead of summitLast year, the EU agreed to\nresettle 160,000 refugees, but less than 1,000 have been processed so far.\nCNN's Arwa Damon, Laura Perez Maestro, Karen Smith and Don Melvin contributed\nto this report.\n\n", "title" : "Migrant crisis: Rights groups slam EU-Turkey proposal - CNN.com", "twitter" : { "body" : "EU and Turkey agree on 'bold' refugee swap proposal to solve migrant crisis http://cnn.it/1QA8VCa", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CNN/status/707185630690873344", "retweets" : 79, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-07T20:46:07.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 106, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "707185630690873344" }, "topic" : "refugee", "source" : "cnn", "link" : "http://cnn.it/1QA8VCa" }

They transform into outlines\nof human beings.\"Minawi, who lives in Lebanon, spent three years working as a\ntranslator for Syrian refugees who were applying for asylum in the United\nStates.\"I heard almost 1,000 stories,\" he says. \"Most of them were\ntraumatizing. For them, this interview is life-changing. It's like the last\nrope you throw to a drowned person. My own perception of life changed after\nthese interviews. You appreciate life differently, you see how these people\nwant a future, how they are craving it. I felt I had to create something\nrelated to what I heard.\"RELATED: Artist William Kentridge's incredible\nrefugee premonition The resulting sculpture, called \"My light is your light\",\nis a set of custom-made white neon lights that \"look like extremely fragile\nhuman bones\". For Minawi, the entire piece is a stripped down version of one\nparticular family in Lebanon whose story affected him deeply.\"They're crossing\nthe border,\" Minawi says. \"The father is in front watching out for the family.\nThe grandfather trails behind him, bent over and exhausted. The mother is\nwalking forward but looking down. The teenager has been left behind. He's just\nas traumatized as everyone else, but they don't notice. There's also an aunt\nand a little child.\"Like the Syrian refugees they represent, the six figures\nin Minawi's installation are crossing borders all over Europe and beyond. The\nwork, which premiered at the Amsterdam Light Festival in 2013, has also been\ndisplayed in Beirut, Istanbul and most recently, at London's Winter Lights at\nCanary Wharf festival. The sculpture proved so popular that it's staying in\nLondon for two months longer than planned.\"I was surprised that the\ninstallation was wanted by so many places,\" says Minawi. \"Now I have a plan.\nI'm going to tour it around Portugal and Belgium, but then I'm hoping to sell\nit in Germany. I contacted Angela Merkel to do an auction together, but she's\nreally hard to reach. \"RELATED: An artist's portrayal of Syria's struggle So\nfar, Minawi has written to the German Chancellor, the Minister for Refugees\nand has sent a long letter detailing his intentions to the German embassy in\nBeirut. He wants to work with the German government to exhibit and auction off\nthe sculpture at the end of its European tour. Most of the money raised would\ngo towards helping Syrian refugees in Germany.\"Angela Merkel was the first\nperson who was brave enough to open the doors to refugees,\" he says. \"I\nappreciate what she did. I want this to be my contribution to her actions.\nDoing this would give the installation another value beyond delivering an\nemotional message.\"According to Minawi, the installation has a message not\nonly for Europeans, but also for refugees themselves.\"I want to tell them that\nyou shine light and you can move on,\" he says. \"There are five statues whose\nheads are all down. Except for the little kid.\"Unlike the older figures, the\nsmallest child in the sculpture looks straight ahead, and was intended as a\nsymbol of hope and resilience.\"Children always adapt,\" Minawi says. \"They're\nstronger than what we think. This little boy was just running and he saw\nsomething that grabbed his attention. It's enough for him to forget about what\nhe's been through.\"As a refugee himself, Minawi grew up listening to the\nstories of his grandfather, who fled Palestine in 1948. \"My grandfather owned\nfive houses in Palestine,\" he recalls. \"But when he became a refugee, he lived\nin a tent in a graveyard in Beirut.

(CNN)As Christmas arrives,\nmany of the over two billion people in the world who identify as Christians\nbegin to refocus in a particular way, thinking about the meaning of this holy\ncelebration. They do so, of course, with varying degrees of intensity. For\nsome, it's only a matter of jingle bells and the exchange of gifts, perhaps a\nkiss under the mistletoe. There is usually a tree with lights and ornaments.\nCandles may flicker in the windows. And Santa may play a more important role\nthan Jesus in many of their lives.But those who care about the practice of\ntheir faith keep Jesus front and center. His birth and the story that\nsurrounds it is the reason for Christmas, and its message should sing loudly\nthrough the season.It is a moving story, with elements of joy and terror. A\nyoung family from Galilee comes into a small town as strangers, the mother is\npregnant, and there is \"no room for them in the inn.\" (Luke 2:7). When the\nchild is born, the magicians, or \"magi,\" come looking for him from the East to\nworship him, after inadvertently telling a wicked king about this newborn with\ngreat potential. The king wants to kill him; he believes the child may be a\nfuture rival. Angel appears to Joseph, and he is told to run with his young\nfamily and to hide in Egypt; Jesus becomes - at once - a refugee, on the run\nfor his life.The Christmas story appears in the gospels of Matthew and Luke,\nand in the former it's very much a tale of horror and flight, the murderous\nking ordering the immediate slaughter of all children younger than 2 in the\nvicinity of Bethlehem. (Matthew 2:16-18). This is straight from the annals of\nterrorism, even though it has perhaps less claim to historical veracity than\none might like. Yet the mythic point is real, undeniable: Jesus arrives into\nthis troubled world in a threatened situation. Thomas Merton, the poet and\nTrappist monk, writes memorably about the manger scene in Bethlehem: \"Into\nthis world, this demented inn, in which there is absolutely no room for him at\nall, Christ has come uninvited.\" It's because of his extreme situation, a\nnewborn on the run, a refugee who must flee with his parents to Egypt to\nescape persecution and death, that Jesus stands for all political refugees,\nall those in despair of having a place to lay their head. Jesus is always\npresent with those, as Merton says, \"for whom there is no room.\"I love the\nChristmas story in its terrifying and beautiful dimensions. Jesus is a human\nbeing who is fully inhabited by God. Thus he becomes, in the Greek word, the\nChristos, or the anointed one, a person in whom God dwells -- as in the word\nEmmanuel, which in Hebrew means \"God dwelling within.\" Christmas is, for those\nwho wish to follow the way of Jesus, an invitation to accept into our\ncomfortable and safe lives those who come to us from far away, who seem\nragged, marginal, in transition. This is how God finds us, at this very dark\ntime of the year, the winter solstice, when the daylight hours have shrunk to\ntheir minimal light. He comes knocking at the door, looking for a haven, for a\nplace to rest and recover.In John 8:12, Jesus calls himself \"the light of the\nworld.\" This light shines into the darkest corners of our bleak midwinter\nexistence and offers a glimmering of hope. It's a light coming from an\nunexpected place.I don't believe it's possible to imagine a Jesus who would\nnot welcome refugees with open arms, who would not fight hatred with love, who\nwould not understand that the \"war on terror\" -- whether it flashes from the\nthrone of Herod the Great or Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi -- is fundamentally a war of\nideas. You can't defeat ISIS with weapons, with boots on the ground, with\ncarpet bombing or any vengeful threats. You overcome darkness with light, and\nthis is not some vague, wishy-washy, \"liberal\" idea. It's the hard reality\nthat Jesus taught us, over 2,000 years ago. And every year at Christmas, he\ncomes to us as a child on the run with his impoverished and terrified parents.\nHe knocks at the door of our house and our hearts. And we let him in -- or we\nturn him away._Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.__  \nRead CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine._\n\n", "title" : "At Christmas, remember that Jesus was a refugee - CNN.com", "twitter" : { "body" : "At Christmas, remember that Jesus was a refugee http://cnn.it/1S6iBGk via @CNNOpinion pic.twitter.com/izXgjQ6mVq", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CNN/status/679086814934749184", "retweets" : 604, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-12-21T07:51:28.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "@CNNOpinion", "favs" : 762, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "679086814934749184" }, "topic" : "refugee", "source" : "cnn", "link" : "http://cnn.it/1S6iBGk" }

The All Blacks and Chiefs player, who was key to New\nZealand's Rugby World Cup success in London in August, tweeted a photo of what\nappears to be two young children who have been killed in an explosion. He\naccompanied the split image with: \"What did these children do to deserve this?\nThis summer share a thought for the innocent lives lost everyday (sic) in\nwar.\" The tweet was posted on Tuesday, after Williams had returned from a\nvisit to settlements in the Bekaa Valley near the Syrian border with Lebanon,\nwhere he was working with UNICEF New Zealand as an ambassador. He is not an\nofficial UNICEF ambassador, but rather was invited to join the trip with the\norganization to help him understand -- and promote awareness of -- the plight\nof those affected by Syria's civil war. The tweet has met with mixed\nresponses, and at the time of writing had been retweeted 1,700 times and liked\n2,100 times. Some called him \"insensitive\" while others supported his decision\nto \"highlight reality.\" UNICEF New Zealand has distanced itself from Williams'\npost, and a spokesman confirmed that the photos were not taken while Willimas\nwas in Lebanon. While acknowledging that he was clearly \"deeply moved\" by his\nexperience with the Syrian refugees, the organization condemned his decision\nto display the photo to his 556,000 followers.\"We see it as a fundamental\ninfringement of those children's rights,\" UNICEF spokesman Patrick Rose was\nquoted as saying in the New Zealand Herald. \"But at the same time, we don't\nhave the capacity to censor or edit private citizens' showing what they find\non their individual explorations online.\"We are as disturbed as anyone when we\nsee those images but we want to offer a positive framework for people to\nrespond to that.\"We can't stop the war, we can't stop these things happening\nto people, but what we can do is help children by getting them clean water, by\ngetting them counseling to help them deal with that trauma and to help them\nhave a better future by keeping them in school.\"The organization had\npreviously posted images of Williams, or SBW as he is known in New Zealand,\nplaying with children at the Lebanese camps. The Herald later reported that\nthe photos were of two children killed in a Russian airstrike which were\ncirculated in Turkish media, quoting a Syrian civil defense official who said\nthat the deadly strike happened in Idlib province. **READ: Sonny Bill\nWilliams: Islam brings me happiness****READ: All Blacks star given new World\nCup winner's medal **\n\n", "title" : "All Blacks star tweets graphic photo of dead children  - CNN.com", "twitter" : { "body" : "Rugby star criticized for tweeting photo of dead children after visit to refugee camp. http://cnn.it/22y9GCa pic.twitter.com/wcw2BIM3Fz", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CNN/status/682164985431257088", "retweets" : 73, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-12-29T19:43:01.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 134, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "682164985431257088" }, "topic" : "refugee", "source" : "cnn", "link" : "http://cnn.it/22y9GCa" }

Obama last\ntapped the fund in 2014 to provide $50 million to deal with a refugee crisis\nin South Sudan.Secretary of State John Kerry said Wednesday the the Obama\nadministration was responding to \"the worst refugee crisis that the world has\nseen since the Second World War.\" The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees\nestimates there were 19.5 million refugees globally at the end of 2014, up 2.9\nmillion from the previous year.Kerry said the State Department plans to expand\nrefugee aid to help families and individuals from El Salvador, Guatemala, and\nHonduras, allowing them a safe and humane alternative to human smuggling and\nmodern slavery.Citing an \"unprecedented number of refugees in need of\nresettlement,\" Obama signed a presidential determination allowing him to tap a\nspecial fund set up by Congress for refugee emergencies. Congress replenished\nthe fund in the budget agreement signed into law last month.But unlike similar\npresidential declarations in the past, the determination Obama signed\nWednesday is the first that contains no geographical restrictions, meaning the\nrefugee aid could be spent on refugees worldwide.Through a similar declaration\nlast year, Obama raised the ceiling on the number of refugees allowed into the\nUnited States from 70,000 in fiscal year 2015 to 85,000 in 2016 and 100,000 in\n2017.\"The refugee crisis is not just a Syrian problem, nor a Middle Eastern\nproblem, or a European or an African problem is a global challenge of historic\nproportions and dimensions, and it tests our values, our self-confidence, and\nour very humanity,\" Kerry said Wednesday in a speech to the National Defense\nUniversity in Washington.

He developed stomach cancer and had\ntrouble getting treatment in Turkey, where he and millions of other Syrians\nhave fled.

I am so proud and honored to be in this country and look forward to\none day becoming an American citizen so that we can be part of making America\na strong and great country.\"The invitation creates a sharp contrast to\nRepublicans who want to block refugees from war-ravaged Middle East nations\nbecause Islamic State radicals and other terrorists might try to sneak into\nthe country by claiming refugee status.Republican presidential front-runner\nDonald Trump has called for a temporary ban on admitting Muslims until the\nU.S. government can \"figure out what is going on.\" House Republicans passed a\nbill in November to temporarily halt Syrian and Iraqi refugee programs and to\nscreen future applicants more carefully.Those fears ramped up when a group of\nSyrians was caught along the southwestern border and another group of\nU.S.-bound Syrians was stopped in Honduras using fake passports.

They\nchoose to sail eastward on creaky boats run by callous smuggling syndicates.\nTheir goal: securing underground work in Thailand or Malaysia, even though\nboth nations warn them to stay away.Many die at sea. Those who do not are\noften swept into mafia-run human trafficking rings infamous for rape,\nextortion and burying those who can’t pay ransoms in jungle graves.But the\nrisk is deemed worth it among many Rohingya who, in recent years, have decided\nthe danger is preferable to remaining in their homeland.In Myanmar, the\nRohingya have been subjected to ethnic cleansing, local mob massacres and a\ngovernment that derides practically all 1 million Rohingya inhabitants as\ninvaders from Bangladesh. More than 140,000 are confined to bleak government-\nrun camps after pogroms, stoked by radical Buddhist monks, purged them from\ntheir homes.As the West copes with a highly politicized influx of families\nfleeing Syria and Iraq, this lesser-known Asian crisis still simmers.It is\nmuch smaller in scale: roughly 100,000 have fled the Rohingya’s native Rakhine\nState and neighboring Bangladesh by sea in recent years, according to the\nUnited Nations, while Syria has produced a staggering 4.3 million refugees.But\nthere are parallel horrors faced by both sets of escapees — from starvation\nand abuse by people smugglers to the wrath of citizens in their destination\ncountries.  \n“It’s been happening for years but, unfortunately, the world never paid much\nattention,” says Khin Maung Myint, a Rohingya activist. “It’s an unbearable\nsituation. They’re forced to flee their ancestral lands.” He compared some of\nMyanmar’s most abusive security forces to “Nazi Gestapo.”Monsoons over the\nRohingya exodus route, the Bay of Bengal, have only recently subsided. So far,\nat least 1,000 are known to have sailed through these waters since September,\naccording to Vivian Tan, a spokesperson for the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.More\nare expected to flee in coming months.Myanmar is a dazzlingly diverse country\nwhere ethnic minorities make up more than 30% of the population. But it is\neconomically and militarily dominated by majority Buddhist Bamar. The nation’s\nall-powerful army has a long history of grinding down minorities through\njungle warfare.In response, practically every sizeable ethnic group has\nassembled an armed guerrilla defense force — except for the Rohingya. It’s no\ncoincidence that, in recent years at least, they have suffered more than any\nother group in Myanmar.“They’re a target of many people’s affection,” says\nAnthony Davis, a Bangkok-based security analyst with Jane’s Defence Weekly.\n“They are, if you like, the baby seals of the Southeast Asian Islamic world\nwhose main claim to fame is getting clubbed over the head on a regular\nbasis.”Some dream of assembling a force to defend the vulnerable Rohingya.\nIslamic radicals in the Southeast Asia have repeatedly expressed a desire to\nhelp them fend off mistreatment.But to date, Davis says, vows to mount an\narmed struggle have yet to come to anything.“There’s no evidence of that\nhappening,” he says. “Because the baby seals basically want out and are\nlooking for jobs in Malaysia. They’re not looking to raise the black flag of\njihadist struggle.”That hasn’t stopped Myanmar’s government and even Western\nmedia from attempting to connect the Rohingya to terrorism. Most of these\nwarnings cite the Rohingya Solidarity Organization, a tiny armed group set up\nin the 1980s that is now “essentially defunct,” according to the International\nCrisis Group.There is no armed wing “worth its salt” within the Rohingya\ndiaspora, says Sidney Jones, an expert on Southeast Asian extremism with the\nInstitute for Policy Analysis of Conflict in Jakarta. She warns that “if there\nwas ever an extremist operation that Indonesian jihadis could join in Myanmar,\nit would be off like a flash” but “it’s not there now.”That leaves Myanmar’s\nleague of famous anti-tyranny dissidents, led by the idolized Aung San Suu\nKyi, to demand better treatment for the Rohingya.Her party, the National\nLeague for Democracy, swept historic November elections and will dominate a\nnew government when it takes power in March 2016. Cheered on by the White\nHouse, they are the self-proclaimed voice of the oppressed citizenry and have\npromised to heal the bloody rifts between minorities and the government.That\npledge, however, may not extend to the Rohingya. The Rohingya are still\nconsidered unwanted foreigners even among Myanmar’s otherwise enlightened pro-\ndemocracy crowd.One of Aung San Suu Kyi’s chief confidantes previously told\nGlobalPost that she believes the word Rohingya is a “made-up name of the\nBengali,” which is a term — implying as it does that Rohingya belong in\nBangladesh — used by the government to insist they have no rightful home in\nMyanmar.Asked after the elections about the Rohingya’s plight, another\nspokesman from her party told _The Telegraph_ that they “have other\npriorities.”Meanwhile, the Rohingya continue to endure dismal conditions in\ncamps guarded by government security forces. Apartheid-esque laws seek to\nprevent them from traveling from town to town, having more than two children\nand voting in the recent elections.“The government denies that Rohingya even\nexist,” says Shwe Maung, a Rohingya parliamentarian prohibited from running as\nan incumbent in the latest election. “This reinforces the perception among\nRohingya that we’re unwanted and have no future in Myanmar.“No wonder so many\nRohingya try to flee.”_The article originally appeared on GlobalPost.

Greece's migration minister has warned that 70,000 migrants could\nend up “trapped” in Greece.The flow of refugees heading this way is increasing\nby several hundred a day, and United Nations officials said Tuesday there are\nnow an estimated 8,500 migrants waiting for passage in this quiet rural\ncommunity.Alagha, 21, left his hometown in Syria in early February and was\nhoping to make it to the German town of Marl, where his fiancee has been for\nthree months.

The overloaded raft has been taking on water since it\nlaunched from a crag off the Turkish shore, about six miles away.The 18\nSyrians on board desperately try to bail water...Instead, he is stuck at a\ncamp for migrants and refugees here in Idomeni, a small farming village that\nis the settlement closest to the border.Idomeni was a name unknown even to\nmany Greeks until it became in recent months a focal point of Europe’s\nmigration crisis. The town sits along a path that begins in Turkey, where\nmigrants go by sea to one of Greece’s islands, then by bus to Athens and north\ntoward Macedonia.The camp is a cluster of tents set amid farm fields.\nOccupants sprawl out on bunk beds in the tents or pick up food and bottled\nwater at booths. In one corner, there are tables with paper and crayons for\nchildren to draw. The drawings, hung on a wall, show houses and smiling\nfamilies.Alagha sat on a wooden bench with several other young Syrian men,\nfighting off boredom and the stress of not knowing how long they will be in\nlimbo. “Maybe later today, maybe tomorrow,” Alagha said of moving on. “I just\nwant to go. There’s nothing to do in Syria. There’s nothing to do here.”The\nyoung men ask every uniformed aid worker or volunteer who passes, “Do you know\nwhen they will open the border?” The answer is always no.In late January, a\nstrike by Greek ferries meant that arrivals from Turkey couldn’t get from the\nislands to the mainland, and that slowed the flow north. But ferry traffic\nresumed after that and the camp has been filling fast. Bus after bus pulls in,\nand passengers disembark lugging backpacks and suitcases. Alagha was fleeing\nhis hometown of Aleppo, which has been split in two by Syria’s civil war, one\nside controlled by the government, the other by a mishmash of rebel\nmilitias.Over the past few years Alagha heard screeching bombs and rockets\nwhenever he tried to sleep or study. His patience ran out a few weeks ago when\na close friend was shot in the leg by a sniper.“I realized then that I could\ndie at any time,” he said.**Join the conversation on Facebook &gt;&gt;**He\npaid a smuggler 1,200 euros (a little more than $1,300) to take him from\nAleppo into Turkey. The smugglers, he said, abandoned him and the other\nrefugees he was traveling with on a mountain near the Turkish border. He had\nto walk for an hour dodging border guards, then crawl through a hole in a\nbarbed-wire border fence.Alagha’s plan is to join his fiancee in Germany,\nwhere he says first he will learn the language, then look for a school where\nhe can work toward a degree in medicine. But with the border shut, those plans\nwere on hold.Alagha paced in the afternoon sun, looking for something to pass\nthe time. He watched German language instruction videos on YouTube (the camp\nhas free wi-fi) but said he misses movies — simple, romantic ones are his\nfavorite. “I like romance and want to live a simple life,” he said.Alagha said\nhe is sure that he and his fiancee will be reunited in the end.

Now, they splash\nin salt water pools and teeter on boardwalks as the permafrost below thaws and\nthe Ninglick River chips away at the community. Soon even the boards will be\nswallowed by the rising tides.In 2017, it is projected that the highest point\nin Newtok — the school building — will be underwater. For these Alaskans,\nclimate change is not just a global temperature trend; it is happening under\ntheir feet. Shoreline erosion is forcing residents to abandon their community\nas rising water inundates the lives they once lived. Twenty years ago, the\nsigns were already in place and Newtok made the difficult decision to\nrelocate. Since then, it has been slowly rebuilding its school, homes, and\nlives inland to escape the ever-encroaching waters.Newtok residents will be\namong our country's first climate refugees — but not our last.In the decades\nto come, thousands more from along America's most fragile shorelines will\nembark on a great migration inland as their homes disappear beneath the\nwater's surface. Over the last 10 years, the Isle de Jean Charles community in\nLouisiana has lost two-thirds of its residents to dislocation. In the\nChesapeake Bay, Tangier Island's shoreline recedes by about 14 feet a year. On\nWashington's Olympic Peninsula, the Quinault Indian Nation relies on a 2,000\n-foot-long sea wall for protection until it can complete its move uphill.For\nthem and the residents of dozens of other American towns and ultimately\ncities, the question is no longer what will be lost to climate change, but\nwhat will be saved.Over the last seven years, President Obama has built a\nlegacy of action on climate change. He negotiated a bilateral agreement with\nChina to reduce greenhouse emissions, lowered tariffs on clean technologies to\nencourage their spread, and set new rules to cut carbon at home with the Clean\nPower Plan. With the climate change agreement in Paris successfully negotiated\nin December, he is set to use his final year in office to continue his\ncommitment to reduce America's greenhouse gas emissions, to try to “accelerate\nthe transition away from old, dirtier energy sources,” as he said in his State\nof the Union speech.Before most Americans were even aware of global warming,\nExxon was investing in high-quality research on the subject.

According to reports in\nthe Los Angeles Times and elsewhere, the oil company's scientists concluded in\nthe 1970s, '80s and '90s that climate change was real, would transform\nthe...While it is essential to mitigate the sources of carbon in the United\nStates, it will not help citizens on the front lines of climate change right\nnow. In order to alleviate the most extreme consequences of a shifting\nclimate, the president must give equal attention to helping communities adapt\nto a rapidly changing homeland.As they stand today, federal programs for\ndisaster assistance are limited and mostly unavailable to towns that require\nclimate-induced relocation. Relief programs focus on sudden natural disasters\nlike Hurricane Sandy, and on rebuilding in place, not on financially\nsupporting the relocation of towns facing gradual inundation.Because of this,\ncoastal communities across the country must rely on ad hoc federal and state\ngrants, and attempt to rebuild and relocate in bits and pieces, in the hope\nthat the work will be done before an emergency evacuation is needed.Some steps\nhave been taken to provide support adaptation specific support, but they fall\nshort of any real impact. In September 2015 during the first presidential\nvisit to the Arctic, Obama pledged $2 million to help with voluntary climate-\ninduced relocation efforts in Alaska. This covers less than 2% of the cost to\nrelocate one town, estimated at $100 to $200 million.In Alaska alone, climate\nchange flooding and shoreline erosion already affects more than 180 villages,\n31 of which are in “imminent” danger of becoming uninhabitable.To truly make a\nlasting climate change legacy, Obama must take seriously the issue of climate\nrelocation. This means creating a legal and financial structure that can\nadequately respond to communities in need.The first step is simple: Convene\nlocal, state, and federal stakeholders to draft a framework for relocating all\nclimate refugees within the United States. The difficulty will be in the\ndetails, especially determining the source of the financial resources that\nwill be required. The debate over who will fund relocation and which agencies\nwill lend technical assistance will be intense. But those negotiations must\nbegin in order to protect the lives of our most vulnerable citizens.In\nSeptember during his visit to Alaska, Obama told the country, “Climate change\nis no longer some far-off problem. It is happening here. It is happening now.”\nHe must recognize American climate refugees today and use his last year in\noffice to inaugurate the process of saving them from America's eroding\nedges._Victoria Herrmann is director of the Arctic Institute.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71a7d955d14d6aff102b9" }, "content" : "The image of a dead Syrian toddler washed up on a beach last year stirred\nworldwide outrage over a growing refugee crisis.Rob Lawrie decided to do\nsomething about it. The British former soldier closed down his cleaning\nbusiness, bought a van and started delivering tents, clothing and food across\nthe English Channel to the Jungle, a refugee shantytown of more than 4,000\npeople near the French port city of Calais.He now says his compassion got the\nbetter of him.In a case that has elicited broad public support for Lawrie, he\nwas set to go on trial Thursday in France on suspicion of trying to smuggle a\n4-year-old girl out of the Jungle and into England.\"I'm not a smuggler,\" he\ntold Le Monde newspaper in December. \"No money changed hands. It wasn't even a\npremeditated act. I did it on a sudden feeling.\"His French lawyer, Lucile\nAbassade, said Lawrie intends to plead guilty to the charge — aiding illegal\nimmigration — but argue that breaking the law was a humanitarian act. He faces\nup to five years in prison and a $41,300 fine if convicted by the court in the\ncoastal town of Boulogne-sur-Mer.Lawrie's version of events goes like this:\nAfter he started volunteering in the shantytown, the girl, a refugee from\nAfghanistan named Bahar Ahmadi, began following him everywhere. Everybody\ncalled her by her nickname, Bru. Her father, Reza Ahmadi, whose wife had been\nkilled back home, begged him many times to take her to Leeds in the north of\nEngland, where several cousins had settled legally. Lawrie refused.But one\nnight last October, he cracked in a \"moment of madness,\" 49-year-old Lawrie\ntold journalists.He was preparing to leave France when British border police\nfound two migrants from Eritrea in the back of his van.Lawrie insisted that\nthe men had stowed away without his knowledge. When French police handcuffed\nhim, he told them they had missed Bru, who was apparently in a storage\ncompartment.Lawrie was not charged in relation to the Eritreans, only the\ngirl.\"I just couldn't leave her to spend one more night in that horrendous\nplace,\" Lawrie told a British newspaper. \"And when you have seen what I have\nseen all rational thought goes out of your head.\"He elaborated in an interview\nwith Al Jazeera: \"We cannot help everyone, but everyone can help someone and\nshe had become my someone. I just did it because I could no longer see her\nlive in this squalid environment.\"She's a special little girl and in all the\nmonths that I spent with her, I never saw her without a smile,\" he\nadded.Lawrie, who served for seven years as a physical training instructor\nwith the Royal Corps of Transport, also said that he regretted his actions.\nAfter his arrest, his second marriage broke up, and his wife took their two\nchildren, he said.His lawyer said he plans to argue that to have ignored the\nappeal by the girl's father would have flouted a French law requiring people\nto give assistance to someone in danger.In a show of support for Lawrie, about\n53,000 people signed a petition asking British authorities to help spare him\nfrom jail.\"Rob shouldn't be treated as a criminal, but as an ordinary man ...\ntrying to do the right thing in extraordinary circumstances,\" wrote the\npetition organizer, Jim Innes.A French petition on www.change.org has nearly\n120,000 signatures, and backers are being encouraged to demonstrate their\nsupport outside the courtroom.Refugees and migrants who gather on France's\nnorthwestern coast in hopes of making it across the channel to Britain have\nbeen a source of tension between the two countries for at least 15 years.The\nshanty dwellers near Calais are part of the recent crisis in which hundreds of\nthousands of people have arrived across Europe after being displaced from\nSyria, Afghanistan, Somalia, Eritrea and elsewhere.Though they could claim\nasylum in France, many prefer to take their chances with smugglers or stowaway\non lorries and vehicles to make the crossing to Britain.Over the years, as the\nauthorities on each side of the channel have tightened checks and controls,\nthe crossing attempts have become increasingly desperate and occasionally\nfatal. Last summer thousands of migrants stormed the entrance to the Channel\nTunnel and clashed with police trying to contain them.The Calais port is now\nheavily guarded by police and protected by high fences topped with razor wire\nand closed-circuit television cameras.Each month an average of 3,600 people\nare caught trying to cross illegally, and last year at least 12 people died\nduring such attempts.

But as the year drew\nto a close, the boats were still coming with nothing to suggest that the flood\nwould be stanched anytime soon.The crisis has exposed deep rifts among the\nEuropean Union's 28 members, which have struggled to respond amid acrimonious\nbickering and finger-pointing. Many have set up temporary border controls,\nthreatening one of the bloc's cherished achievements: the free movement of\ncitizens across most of its internal borders.Here is a look at what is driving\nthe crisis and what the new year may hold for Europe's migrants.**What lies\nbehind the rise ****in the numbers?**The surge was driven by Syrians, many of\nwhom have lost hope that the war that has torn apart their country will be\nbrought to an end. They make up nearly half of the migrants who arrived in\nEurope in 2015, according to the latest estimates.In nearby countries, to\nwhich more than 4 million refugees from Syria have fled, conditions are\nincreasingly desperate. Few refugees are allowed to work legally in Lebanon,\nJordan and Turkey, and humanitarian agencies say their appeals for more aid\nare not being met.Other long-standing conflicts have also contributed to the\nchaotic influx in Europe, with Afghanistan accounting for about 21% of\narrivals and Iraq 7%.**Join the conversation on Facebook &gt;&gt;**Around the\nworld, nearly 60 million people have been forced to flee their homes because\nof war, conflict and persecution, the highest number ever recorded, according\nto the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.**Where are the\nmigrants going?**The overwhelming majority of those trying to reach Europe —\nmore than 844,000, the U.N. says — cross the Aegean Sea from Turkey to nearby\nGreek islands. But most don't stay, preferring to move on to wealthier\ndestinations to the north.Germany has received nearly 1.1 million asylum\nseekers — more than any other EU nation. They include large numbers of\nEuropeans arriving overland from the Balkans.Hundreds of thousands of refugees\nhave poured into Europe in a desperate migration that has strained the\ncontinent's ability to cope.Hundreds of thousands of refugees have poured into\nEurope in a desperate migration that has strained the continent's ability to\ncope.Some poorer European nations have accused Germany of fueling the crisis\nwith its open-door policy and have tried to curb the influx by dispatching\ntroops to their borders and throwing up miles of fences. As the migrants keep\ncoming, even Germany and other wealthier countries, such as Sweden, have\nintroduced border checks to regulate the entry of asylum seekers.Although such\ncontrols are allowed in an emergency under European rules, they have been\nfiercely criticized by EU officials and human rights groups, which have called\non the bloc to uphold its values of compassion and meet international\nobligations to provide sanctuary to those fleeing war and persecution.However,\nmany people in Eastern and Central Europe agree with Hungarian Prime Minister\nViktor Orban that most of the migrants are seeking better economic\nopportunities rather than fleeing war, and believe that they, as Muslims, will\nundermine Europe's Christian identity. Fear and hostility toward the migrants\nhave spread since the discovery that at least two of the Islamic State gunmen\nwho killed 130 people in Paris on Nov. 13 posed as refugees to travel from\nSyria to Europe.Virginie Guiraudon, an immigration expert at the Center for\nEuropean Studies at Paris' Sciences Po university, said the crisis revealed a\nfundamental misunderstanding by major EU powers about the bloc's newest\nmembers.**NEWSLETTER: Get the day's top headlines from Times Editor Davan\nMaharaj &gt;&gt;**\"They thought that these countries would remain tame and\ncontrollable and would just be happy that they were allowed in,\" she said.\n\"This ignores the fact that these countries also have domestic opinions, also\nhave domestic party politics and their own agenda.\"**What is Europe doing to\nresolve the crisis?**In an attempt to ease the burden on frontline states such\nas Greece and Italy, Germany tried to persuade all EU members to accept a\nshare of refugees. Those efforts largely failed. Just over 200 people have\nbeen relocated so far.The focus has now shifted to finding ways to discourage\nthe migrants from embarking on the dangerous journey to Europe — and to ensure\nthat those who reach Europe are systematically registered and vetted. Tens of\nthousands of migrants fleeing war and poverty are trying to reach safety in\nEurope. This summer's unprecedented exodus from Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea\nand other nations in turmoil has inundated southern Europe and exhausted the\ngenerosity of countries suffering their own economic woes.EU leaders promised\nin November to give Turkey more than $3.2 billion in return for help stemming\nthe flow. But at their last summit of the year in December, the leaders failed\nto take action on another proposal, by the bloc's executive arm, to set up a\nnew border and coast guard service to bolster security at entry points.The\nplan has revived fears among some members, including Poland, about a loss of\nsovereignty to EU bureaucrats in Brussels. Still, members agreed to \"rapidly\nexamine\" the proposals with the goal of reaching an agreement by mid-2016.**Is\npeace possible in Syria?**The crisis in Europe has renewed interest in finding\na diplomatic solution to the war that has killed more than 200,000 people in\nSyria, caused vast destruction and left much of the country in the hands of\nhard-core Islamist militants.Russia's air campaign on behalf of President\nBashar Assad's government hasn't helped matters, in the view of the U.S.,\nwhich heads a coalition that has been carrying out airstrikes against Islamic\nState in Syria and neighboring Iraq. One of Syria's top rebel leaders, Zahran\nAlloush, was killed in a Dec. 25 strike for which Assad's government claimed\nresponsibility, but for which insurgents blamed Russia.The U.S. has its\nconcerns about Alloush's Islam Army, which is part of a rebel alliance with\nlinks to Al Qaeda. But State Department spokesman Mark Toner said he had been\nparticipating in the talks to bring about a cease-fire and a meaningful\npolitical dialogue in Syria.\"It doesn't send the most constructive message to\ncarry out a strike like that,\" Toner told reporters in Washington.U.N.\nmediator Staffan de Mistura plans to convene representatives of the Syrian\ngovernment and opposition groups for another round of talks in Geneva on Jan.\n25.But the negotiators face enormous questions: How to decide the fate of\nAssad?

The refugee crisis has reached a\ncritical point, spilling into Europe and beyond, and advocates are pushing the\nU.S. to accept more refugees. America has taken in 2,070 refugees from Syria\nacross 180 towns and cities since the conflict began in 2011.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71a7d955d14d6aff102c0" }, "content" : "**It was a grisly start** to the new era for Libya, broadcast around the world. The dictator was dragged from the sewer pipe where he was hiding, tossed around by frenzied rebel soldiers, beaten bloody and sodomized with a bayonet. A shaky cellphone video showed the pocked face of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, “the Leader” who had terrified Libyans for four decades, looking frightened and bewildered. He would soon be dead.The first news reports of Colonel Qaddafi’s capture and killing in October 2011 reached the secretary of state in Kabul, Afghanistan, where she had just sat down for a televised interview. “Wow!” she said, looking at an aide’s BlackBerry before cautiously noting that the report had not yet been confirmed. But Hillary Clinton seemed impatient for a conclusion to the multinational military intervention she had done so much to organize, and in a rare unguarded moment, she dropped her reserve.“We came, we saw, he died!” she exclaimed.Two days before, Mrs. Clinton had taken a triumphal tour of the Libyan capital, Tripoli, and for weeks top aides had been circulating a “ticktock” that described her starring role in the events that had led to this moment. The timeline, her top policy aide, Jake Sullivan, wrote, demonstrated Mrs. Clinton’s “leadership/ownership/stewardship of this country’s Libya policy from start to finish.” The memo’s language put her at the center of everything: “HRC announces … HRC directs … HRC travels … HRC engages,” it read.It was a brag sheet for a cabinet member eyeing a presidential race, and the Clinton team’s eagerness to claim credit for her prompted eye-rolling at the White House and the Pentagon. Some joked that to hear her aides tell it, she had practically called in the airstrikes herself.But there were plenty of signs that the triumph would be short-lived, that the vacuum left by Colonel Qaddafi’s death invited violence and division.In fact, on the same August day that Mr. Sullivan had compiled his laudatory memo, the State Department’s top Middle East hand, Jeffrey D. Feltman, had sent a lengthy email with an utterly different tone about what he had seen on his own visit to Libya.The country’s interim leaders seemed shockingly disengaged, he wrote. Mahmoud Jibril, the acting prime minister, who had helped persuade Mrs. Clinton to back the opposition, was commuting from Qatar, making only “cameo” appearances. A leading rebel general had been assassinated, underscoring the hazard of “revenge killings.” Islamists were moving aggressively to seize power, and members of the anti-Qaddafi coalition, notably Qatar, were financing them.On a task of the utmost urgency, disarming the militia fighters who had dethroned the dictator but now threatened the nation’s unity, Mr. Feltman reported an alarming lassitude. Mr. Jibril and his associates, he wrote, “tried to avert their eyes” from the problem that militias could pose on “the Day After.”In short, the well-intentioned men who now nominally ran Libya were relying on “luck, tribal discipline and the ‘gentle character’ of the Libyan people” for a peaceful future. “We will continue to push on this,” he wrote.In the ensuing months, Mr. Feltman’s memo would prove hauntingly prescient. But Libya’s Western allies, preoccupied by domestic politics and the crisis in Syria, would soon relegate the country to the back burner.And Mrs. Clinton would be mostly a bystander as the country dissolved into chaos, leading to a civil war that would destabilize the region, fueling the refugee crisis in Europe and allowing the Islamic State to establish a Libyan haven that the United States is now desperately trying to contain.“Nobody will say it’s too late. No one wants to say it,” said Mahmud Shammam, who served as chief spokesman for the interim government. “But I’m afraid there is very little time left for Libya.”Media reports referred to Mrs. Clinton’s one brief visit to Libya in October 2011 as a “victory lap,” but the declaration was decidedly premature. Security precautions were extraordinary, with ships positioned off the coast in case an emergency evacuation was needed. As it turned out, there was no violence. But the wild celebratory scenes in the Libyan capital that day actually highlighted the divisions in the new order.At a hospital, a university and government offices, Mrs. Clinton posed for photos with the Western-educated interim leaders and hailed the promise of democracy.“I am proud to stand here on the soil of a free Libya,” she declared, standing alongside a beaming Mr. Jibril. “It is a great privilege to see a new future for Libya being born. And indeed, the work ahead is quite challenging, but the Libyan people have demonstrated the resolve and resilience necessary to achieve their goals.”But everywhere Mrs. Clinton went, there was the other face of the rebellion. Crowds of Kalashnikov-toting fighters — the thuwar, or revolutionaries, as they called themselves — mobbed her motorcade and pushed to glimpse the American celebrity. Mostly they cheered, and Mrs. Clinton remained poised and unrattled, but her security detail watched the pandemonium with white-knuckled concern.At the University of Tripoli, students were trampling wall hangings of Colonel Qaddafi that had been pulled to the ground, recalled Harold Koh, the State Department’s top lawyer, who had flown in with Mrs. Clinton on an American military aircraft. One grateful student pointed out the gallows where anti-Qaddafi protesters had been hanged, while others wondered what the United States might do to help win the peace.“We know what the U.S. can do with bombs,” one student told Mr. Koh. “What else can you do?”When Mrs. Clinton’s entourage finally departed, Gene A. Cretz, the American ambassador, wrote a relieved email to Cheryl Mills, the secretary of state’s chief of staff. The visit, he wrote, had been “picture perfect given the chaos we labor under in Libya.”Mrs. Clinton certainly understood how hard the transition to a post-Qaddafi Libya would be. In February, before the allied bombing began, she noted that political change in Egypt had proved tumultuous despite strong institutions.\"So imagine how difficult it will be in a country like Libya,” she had said. “Qaddafi ruled for 42 years by basically destroying all institutions and never even creating an army, so that it could not be used against him.”Early on, the president’s national security adviser, Tom Donilon, had created a planning group called “Post-Q.” Mrs. Clinton helped organize the Libya Contact Group, a powerhouse collection of countries that had pledged to work for a stable and prosperous future. By early 2012, she had flown to a dozen international meetings on Libya, part of a grueling schedule of official travel in which she kept competitive track of miles traveled and countries visited.Dennis B. Ross, a veteran Middle East expert at the National Security Council, had argued unsuccessfully for an outside peacekeeping force. But with oil beginning to flow again from Libyan wells, he was pleasantly surprised by how things seemed to be going.“I had unease that there wasn’t more being done more quickly to create cohesive security forces,” Mr. Ross said. “But the last six months of 2011, there was a fair amount of optimism.”Even so, the gulf separating the suave English speakers of the interim government from the thuwar was becoming more and more pronounced.After decades in exile, some leaders were more familiar with American and European universities than with Libyan tribes and the militias that had sprung from them. Others, like Mr. Jibril, were suspect in some quarters because of previous roles in the Qaddafi regime. It was increasingly evident that the ragtag populist army that had actually done the fighting against Colonel Qaddafi was not taking orders from the men in suits who believed they were Libya’s new leaders.“It should have been clear to anyone,” said Mohammed Ali Abdallah, an opposition member who now heads a leading political party, “that there were clear contradictions in the makeup of the opposition and that unity could not last.”Jeremy Shapiro, who handled Libya on Mrs. Clinton’s policy staff, said the administration was looking for “the unifier — the Nelson Mandela.” He added: “That was why Jibril was so attractive. We were always saying, ‘This is the guy who can appeal to all the factions.’ What we should have been looking for — but we were never good at playing that game — is a power balance.”Under the circumstances, Libya’s push for elections by July 2012, nine months after Colonel Qaddafi’s death, appeared to some to be premature. But the schedule fulfilled the opposition’s promises to the West and had the backing of competing factions.“Suddenly you had people who belonged to political parties,” said Abdurrazag Mukhtar, a member of the interim government who lived in California for many years and is now Libya’s ambassador to Turkey. “The Muslim Brotherhood. Jibril. All these guys thinking, ‘Time for an election.’”“But we were not ready,” he said. “You needed a road map for security first.”By January 2012, there was an unmistakable drumbeat of trouble.His popularity sagging, Mr. Jibril had stepped down as transitional prime minister. A prominent Muslim scholar had accused him of guiding the nation toward a “new era of tyranny and dictatorship.” In a deal struck between two powerful militias, he was replaced by Abdurrahim el-Keib, an engineering professor who had taught for years at the University of Alabama.On Jan. 5, Mrs. Clinton’s old friend and adviser Sidney Blumenthal emailed her with the latest in a series of behind-the-scenes reports on Libya, largely written by a retired C.I.A. officer, Tyler Drumheller, who died last year.The memo detailed the roiling tensions between Islamists and secularists over the role of Islamic law, fighting between rival militias associated with two different towns and four visits to Mr. Keib’s office by “angry militiamen” demanding concessions.Mr. Keib, the email said, “believes that if he does not disarm the militias and meet their demands in the next six months, there is a good chance of increased fighting among rival groups that could lead to civil war.” Mrs. Clinton forwarded the message to Mr. Sullivan, her policy aide, with a single comment: “Worrying.”Such alarming reports might have been expected to spur action in Washington. They did not.After Colonel Qaddafi’s fall, with minimal violence and friendly interim leadership, Libya had moved quickly off the top of the administration’s agenda. The regular situation room meetings on Libya, often including the president, simply stopped. The revolt in Syria, in the heart of the Middle East and with nearly four times Libya’s population, took center stage.Libya, Mr. Ross said, “was farmed out to the working level.”The inattention was not just neglect. It was policy.“The president was like, ‘We are not looking to do another Iraq,’” said Derek Chollet, then handling Libya for the National Security Council. “And by the way, the Europeans were all along saying: ‘No, no, no, we’re doing this. We got it. We believe in Libya. This is in our neighborhood.’”So the president and the National Security Council set what one official called “fierce limits” on the American role: The United States would provide help only when it could offer a unique capability, only when Libya explicitly requested the services and only when Libya paid for them with its oil revenue. In practice, those conditions meant the United States would do very little.And though the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and the British prime minister, David Cameron, visited Libya together, they, too, were soon distracted, by re-election campaigns and economic worries.The neglect was made easier by the Libyans themselves. Displaying both naïveté and nationalism, the interim leaders insisted, at least in public, that they wanted no outside interference. They were so wary of foreign troops that they refused to let the United Nations maintain a basic security force to protect its compound.“They were very keen to take responsibility for their country,” Mr. Shapiro said. “And we were very keen to let them, for our own reasons. So there was a sort of conspiracy there.”As the months passed and the factional fighting grew worse, Mrs. Clinton pressed for the administration to do more, asking the Pentagon, for example, to help train security forces. But she was boxed in by the president’s strictures and the Libyans’ resistance.“It’s like you’re twisting yourself into a pretzel to try to say, ‘O.K., we won’t have boots on the ground, but we know we got to do something,’” Mr. Ross said.Even modest proposals foundered. When Mrs. Clinton proposed sending a hospital ship to treat wounded Libyan fighters, the National Security Council rejected the idea, aides said.But whatever her misgivings, Mrs. Clinton prized her relationship with the president and respected his authority to set policy. So she went along, as disciplined as ever.Andrew Shapiro was trying to make the best of a bad situation. He had to explain what the United States was doing to secure the vast military arsenal that Colonel Qaddafi had left behind — a notable exception to the hands-off policy.Speaking in Washington in February 2012, Mr. Shapiro, the assistant secretary of state for political-military affairs, described efforts to “galvanize an international response” to find and destroy arms caches. But he acknowledged that the $40 million program Mrs. Clinton had announced was not going as well as hoped, even when it came to the most worrisome weapons, the Manpads, shoulder-fired missiles capable of shooting down an airliner.“How many are still missing? The frank answer is we don’t know and probably never will,” Mr. Shapiro said. “We cannot rule out that some weapons may have leaked out of Libya.”The covert coals-to-Newcastle effort to arm the rebels during the revolution was the least of it. The dictator had stashed an astonishing quantity of weapons in the desert.“We knew he had a lot, but he had 10 times that,” said Jean-David Levitte, then a top aide to Mr. Sarkozy.While the C.I.A. moved quickly to secure Colonel Qaddafi’s chemical weapons, other efforts fell short. “There was one arsenal that we thought had 20,000 shoulder-fired, surface-to-air missiles, SA-7s, that basically just disappeared into the maw of the Middle East and North Africa,” recalled Robert M. Gates, the American defense secretary at the time.A major stumbling block was that the Obama administration was negotiating with interim Libyan ministers as if they represented a unified government. In fact, they were often rivals, jockeying for power in advance of the elections.“I know this sounds incredible, but for months and months and months on end we could not get anyone in authority in the government to just sign an agreement on anything, including our detailed offers of security assistance,” said Antony J. Blinken, then the top security aide to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. “There was total paralysis.”When it came to securing weapons, the Americans’ initial idea — to give the interim government assistance to buy them back itself — foundered when the Libyan ministers failed to carry out the program, several Libyan officials said.So the State Department, working with the C.I.A., was left to try to strike its own deals with the militias. But there was little incentive to sell. As Mr. Shammam, the former spokesman for the interim government, put it: “How are you going to buy a Kalashnikov for $1,000? With a Kalashnikov, someone can make $1,000 a day kidnapping people.”Worse, the program created an incentive for militias to import weapons to sell to the Americans, said Ali Zeidan, an adviser to the interim government who would inherit the problem in November 2012 when he became prime minister.“If you want to buy weapons, you have to control the border,” Mr. Zeidan said, adding that the failure to do that led fighters to “sell them, get more and sell them again.”Asked by a reporter that spring why it was so difficult for the United States to “get it right” when it intervened in the Middle East, Mrs. Clinton was still holding up Libya as a model of success. “I would take issue with the premise of that question,” said Mrs. Clinton, who declined to be interviewed for these articles.But she was well aware of the deteriorating security situation.In a February 2012 report, Amnesty International had called Libya’s militias “out of control.” The same month, Mr. Cretz, the American ambassador, warned in an email that the July elections would take place “in the context of militia control.”“Continuing rivalries among the militias remain dangerous from the perspective of the havoc they can wreak with their firepower,” he wrote to Mrs. Clinton’s policy adviser, Mr. Sullivan, who sent it on to her.In Mrs. Clinton’s inner circle, the boasting about her achievements in Libya had given way to a “nagging worry that it would go south,” one senior aide said. The aide recalled being instructed jokingly by Mr. Sullivan “to make sure that didn’t happen” before the American presidential election in November.So when Libyans went to the polls on July 7, in what international observers characterized as a fair election with high turnout and little violence, Mrs. Clinton and other advocates of the intervention were relieved. In the wake of the Arab Spring in Egypt and Tunisia, voters had chosen Islamist-led governments. But in Libya, the winning coalition consisted of Western-friendly political parties led by Mr. Jibril.The next month, with crowds in Tripoli chanting that the “blood of the martyrs will not be wasted,” power was handed over to the newly elected General National Congress, the first peaceful transition in Libya’s history.Mrs. Clinton, who one aide said privately shared the worry that the country was not ready for elections, nevertheless congratulated the Libyans on “this historic milestone.”“Now the hard work really begins to build an effective, transparent government that unifies the country,” she said.But unity was already impossible.“In a sense it was lost from the beginning,” said Gérard Araud, France’s ambassador to the United States and an early advocate of the intervention. “It was the same mistake you made in Iraq. You organize elections in a country with no experience of compromise or political parties. So you have an election, and you think that everything is solved. But eventually tribal realities come back to haunt the country.”While the Americans struggled against weapons proliferation and hoped for the best, a former rebel officer took on the problem at the core of Libya’s predicament: disbanding the volatile forces that had ousted Colonel Qaddafi and helping the fighters find a place in a peaceful new Libya. The officer, M. Mustafa El Sagezli, would never meet Mrs. Clinton. But the outcome of his lonely campaign would decide to a considerable degree Libya's place in her record as secretary of state.As deputy commander of the February 17 Martyrs Brigade, one of the largest and most capable rebel militias, Mr. Sagezli had tried his best to look after his recruits. It was, he felt, an obligation that did not end with the revolution.Shortly after Colonel Qaddafi was killed, Mr. Sagezli had gathered a group of fighters in Benghazi. A businessman with degrees from Utah State University and the London School of Economics, he knew the rebel militias had been organized along Libya’s deepest fault lines: tribal divisions, regional loyalties and differing stances on Islam’s proper role. Yet the country could not progress unless the militias were reintegrated into civil society and replaced by a regular army.“What do you need?” he asked the fighters. “What are your dreams?”Their modest answers surprised and encouraged him.“Some were very simple dreams,” he said. “‘Help us get married.’ Some wanted a scholarship.”The transitional government soon set up a Warriors Affairs Commission, headed by Mr. Sagezli. Many of the 162,000 former fighters it registered were illiterate and needed education. Some wanted to join a police force or a new army, but nearly half hoped to start small businesses.Mr. Sagezli said he had taken a proposal to the transitional government: The Labor Ministry could help would-be businessmen, the Interior Ministry could train customs and police officers, the Defense Ministry would absorb others into a national army, and so on.It was ambitious, but the government had plenty of money; Mrs. Clinton had worked hard to free up billions of dollars in Libyan assets that had been frozen by anti-Qaddafi sanctions. Her view, said one top aide, was that if the interim government “couldn’t rule by force, let them rule by finance.”But instead of giving priority to demobilizing the militias, as an aide said Mrs. Clinton had hoped, the transitional regime simply began paying fighters salaries that many viewed as protection money. In one illustrative incident in May 2012, Kikla militiamen stormed the office of Mr. Keib, the interim prime minister, demanding back pay as gunfire filled the air.“Don’t give them salaries for nothing,” Mr. Sagezli recalls begging. “Giving a commander money means giving strength to the militias, more loyalty for the commander, more armaments and more corruption. They never listened.” Instead, he said, “the politicians started bribing them to buy loyalty.”With the July elections, precedent became political imperative.In the run-up to the vote, a powerful militia shut down roads to press its demand that its eastern Libyan region have a greater say when the incoming Parliament drafted a constitution. The authorities capitulated, leaving the writing of the constitution for a second assembly to be elected later, with more seats from the east.That, in turn, made it harder to disarm the militias, since each faction and town knew its weapons might be needed to protect its interests in the constitutional process. That was how the game would be played.Mr. Zeidan, who became prime minister in November 2012, financed a few of Mr. Sagezli’s programs. But he continued to pay off militia leaders. Political parties aligned themselves with various commanders, and with no army or police force to carry out their will, the elected officials became increasingly dependent on the fighters extorting them.Haig Melkessetian, a former American intelligence operative whose company provided security for European embassies in Libya, described militia rule as “anarchy — there’s just no other word for it.”“We had to have five or six IDs to be able to pass, depending on the street,” he said.Assassinations and “the worst kind of vigilantism” became commonplace, said Sarah Leah Whitson, who was tracking abuses in Libya for Human Rights Watch. One militia leader told her, “The G.N.C. may have had electoral legitimacy, but we have revolutionary legitimacy.”Mr. Sagezli said he had discussed the difficulties with United Nations representatives and with the new American ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens. “I kept asking them for support,” he recalled.But if there was any pressure from American or European officials to stop the government payoffs, he said, “it wasn’t loud enough.”The American ambassador was hearing it from both sides.Officials from Libya’s moderate governing coalition were demanding that the United States stop the wealthy nation of Qatar from sending money and arms to militias aligned with Libya’s Islamist political bloc. The Islamists, in turn, were accusing a rival gulf power, the United Arab Emirates, of providing similar patronage to fighters aligned with their political enemies.The shipments violated a United Nations arms embargo. But Mr. Stevens told Mr. Abdallah, the Libyan party chief, that when he raised the issue with his Qatari and Emirati counterparts, he was met either with outright denials or with protestations that the shipments had gone through blessed official channels, namely government ministers aligned with various factions.“When I go to the U.A.E., they say, ‘I’m dealing with the minister of defense — how much more official can I get?’” Mr. Abdallah recalled the ambassador saying.It was bad enough that Libya’s elected officials lacked the will to force militias to lay down the arms they already possessed. Now, with Libya veering toward civil war, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates — waging a broader war for influence throughout the region — were providing opposing militia commanders with back-channel resupply routes.In Washington, though, it was the Islamists’ patrons, the Qataris, who were of paramount concern.During the 2011 Libyan revolution, Mrs. Clinton had successfully pushed the administration to take a direct role in arming opposition groups, hoping that would persuade the Qataris to stop sending weapons to extremist rebel factions. Though that clearly had not worked, she explored a similar play as she wrangled with what to do about “the Qatar problem” in 2012, aides said.Mrs. Clinton was already pushing for an aggressive American program to arm and train Syrian rebels trying to topple President Bashar al-Assad. What if she could secure what one top aide called a “bank shot” deal in which the United States would provide assistance to certain of Qatar’s allies in Syria in return for Qatar’s dropping its support for Islamist militias in Libya?But Mrs. Clinton’s activist streak ran up against President Obama’s deep wariness of further entanglement in the Middle East, and she lost the debate on arming the Syrian opposition. With no carrot to offer the Qataris, she asked aides to prepare a memo on how the United States might wield a stick.Mrs. Clinton typically relied heavily on a tiny circle of close advisers. But facing a thorny problem, she sometimes convened a larger group, 15 or more aides, in her outer office, where her long sofa sat beneath a window with a view of the Lincoln Memorial.“She really liked to get people to think through the what-if pieces — what if we do this, what are the consequences of doing that, and exploring alternatives,” said James B. Steinberg, her deputy secretary of state.Some advisers suggested trimming military aid to Qatar or threatening to move American military assets elsewhere in the region. But Middle East hands at the State Department pushed back, saying that pressuring the gulf monarchy would only backfire. And the Defense Department strongly objected: It had a 20-year history of close cooperation with Qatar, which hosted critical American military bases.In the end, there was no appetite for anything beyond quiet diplomacy. “We didn’t do nearly enough,” said Mr. Ross, who also explored ways to “raise the price” on Qatar, to no avail.Only last year did President Obama rebuke the nations meddling in Libya, and by then it was too late.“They created the monsters we are dealing with today,” Mr. Abdallah said, “which is these militias that are so empowered they will never subordinate themselves to any government.”On Aug. 8, 2012, a month after the elections, Mr. Stevens, the American ambassador, signed off on a cable sent to Washington titled \"The Guns of August,” playing on the title of a classic history of the first days of World War I. It described Benghazi as moving “from trepidation to euphoria and back as a series of violent incidents has dominated the political landscape” and warned of “a security vacuum.”No American official knew Libya better. He would pay with his life for his determination to see Libya’s tumultuous reality up close. A month after the cable was sent, Islamist extremists attacked the United States mission in Benghazi, and Mr. Stevens was one of four Americans killed.In the assaults on the diplomatic compound and nearby C.I.A. annex, the most worrisome trends in the country came together: the feeble central government, the breakdown of law and order, the rise of militants and the months of minimal attention from Washington. Republicans quickly seized on the episode for what would become years of inquiries, hearings and fund-raising focused on Mrs. Clinton.Still, in her last months at the State Department, Mrs. Clinton rode a wave of popularity, bolstered by an Internet meme called “Texts From Hillary.” Its emblem was a photograph of the secretary of state gazing through dark glasses at her BlackBerry. Few knew that it had been taken aboard the military transport plane taking her to Libya in those heady days after the dictator’s fall.If the attempt to pin blame for the Benghazi attack on Mrs. Clinton would largely fail, the notion that the Libyan intervention was among her successes had become steadily more threadbare. Libya would not conform, either as cudgel or brag, to the needs of American politics.As she exited the State Department in February 2013, factional violence, which would break into open civil war in 2014, was on the rise. The flow of refugees paying smugglers for a hazardous trip across the Mediterranean was swelling. And the Libyan chaos would give rise to two rival governments — one backed by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, the other by Qatar, Turkey and Sudan — providing sanctuary to extremists, soon to be joined by emissaries of the Islamic State.The weapons that had made it so hard to stabilize Libya were turning up in Syria, Tunisia, Algeria, Mali, Niger, Chad, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, Egypt and Gaza, often in the hands of terrorists, insurgents or criminals.In the fall of 2012, American intelligence agencies produced a classified assessment of the proliferation of arms from Libya. “It was like, ‘Oh, my God,’” said Michael T. Flynn, then head of the Defense Intelligence Agency. “We’ve not had that kind of proliferation of weapons since really the end of the Vietnam War.”A cynical line would begin to circulate in Washington: In Iraq, the United States had intervened and occupied — and things had gone to hell. In Libya, the United States had intervened but not occupied — and things had gone to hell. And in Syria, the United States had neither intervened nor occupied — and things had still gone to hell.It was a dark jest designed to shift blame from baffled American policy makers to a troubled region. But it raised a serious question about Libya: If overthrowing a hated dictator in a small and relatively rich country produced such epic troubles, was American intervention ever justified?“It’s true that things went wrong,” said Mr. Sagezli, of the warriors commission. “But from a Libyan point of view, things could not go right. We had 42 years of Qaddafi’s rule, no infrastructure, a terrible education system, thousands of political prisoners, divisions among tribes, destruction of the army. When you have such a state, when you take out the dictator, it’s like taking the cover off the pot.”Given that background, Ms. Whitson, who monitored Libya for Human Rights Watch, thought the United States’ failure to follow up was unforgivable.“If you are going to carry out a military intervention to decapitate the government, you are making a commitment to the stability of that country over the long haul,” she said. “Doing nothing, as we did here? A bunch of eighth graders can agree that is not an approach that is going to work.”The history that Mrs. Clinton often cited should have been instructive, Ms. Whitson said. “In Bosnia, yes, we intervened. But there’s been peacekeeping troops there for 20 years,” she said.Strikingly, President Obama said in 2014 that such criticism was just, and that Libya had provided his biggest lesson in foreign policy.He did not regret the intervention, he told Thomas L. Friedman, the New York Times columnist, because without Colonel Qaddafi’s overthrow, “Libya would have been like Syria, right? Because Qaddafi was not going to be able to contain what had been unleashed there.”But Mr. Obama said the United States and its allies “underestimated the need to come in full force” after the dictator’s fall. The Libyan experience, he said, is “a lesson that I now apply every time I ask the question: Should we intervene militarily? Do we have an answer for the day after?”Libya, aides say, has strongly reinforced the president’s reluctance to move more decisively in Syria. “Literally, this has given him pause about what would be required if you eliminated the Syrian state,” a top adviser said.Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, pushed for greater American involvement early in the Syrian civil war and has repeatedly called for a no-fly zone, a move Mr. Obama has so far rejected. The lessons of the Libya experience have not tempered her more aggressive approach to international crises.While remaining political allies, the president and his former top diplomat have taken revealing shots at each other. In a rare flash of emotion after leaving office, Mrs. Clinton derided the president’s guiding principle in foreign relations: “Don’t do stupid stuff.”“Great nations need organizing principles, and ‘Don’t do stupid stuff’ is not an organizing principle,” she said in a 2014 interview with The Atlantic.Last fall, frustrated with calls for greater American involvement in Syria, Mr. Obama dismissed them as “half-baked” and “mumbo jumbo.” Asked whether those labels applied to Mrs. Clinton’s proposals, the president denied it, not entirely convincingly.When asked to defend her record on Libya, Mrs. Clinton has taken a line quite the opposite of her aides’ previous insistence on her central role in the intervention. “At the end of the day, this was the president’s decision,” she told a House committee in October.She has said the military alliance that overthrew Colonel Qaddafi represented “smart power at its best,” but called Libya “a classic case of a hard choice.” Mostly, she has insisted that history’s judgment on the intervention, and her role in it, are not yet final.“I think it sometimes shows American impatience,” she said in 2014, “that, ‘O.K., you got rid of this dictator who destroyed institutions. Why aren’t you behaving like a mature democracy?’ That doesn’t happen overnight.”Yet if, for Mr. Obama, the Libyan experience has underscored doubts about the United States’ power to shape outcomes in other countries, it has demonstrated for Mrs. Clinton just how crucial an American presence can be.“We have learned the hard way when America is absent, especially from unstable places, there are consequences,” she said at a House hearing on Benghazi in October, articulating what sounded like a guiding principle. “Extremism takes root, aggressors seek to fill the vacuum, and security everywhere is threatened, including here at home.”_Read Part 1 of our examination of the American intervention in Libya and Hillary Clinton’s role in it._\n\n", "title" : "A New Libya, With ‘Very Little Time Left’ - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Thousands dead.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71a7d955d14d6aff102c1" }, "content" : "ROME — Roughly five weeks ago, Donald Tusk, one of the European Union’s most\npowerful political figures, issued a blunt warning to its 28 countries: Come\nup with a coherent plan to tackle the refugee crisis within two months, or\nrisk chaos.Surprisingly, given the plodding pace of European Union policy\nmaking, many of Europe’s national leaders are now moving swiftly, announcing\ntough new border policies and guidelines on asylum — even with three weeks\nremaining on the deadline set by Mr. Tusk, president of the European\nCouncil.The problem is that the leaders are not always adhering to European\nrules, possibly not sticking to international law and not acting with the\nunity envisioned by Mr. Tusk. In some cases, they instead seem to be reverting\nto historical alliances rather than maintaining the European Union’s mantra of\nsolidarity.This week, Austria joined with many of the Balkan countries to\napprove a tough border policy in what some are wryly calling the return of the\nHapsburg Empire. Four former Soviet satellites, led by Poland and Hungary,\nhave become another opposition power bloc.All the while, a call for unity by\nChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is increasingly being ignored, even as she\nstruggles to tamp down on a political revolt at home while searching for a\nformula to reduce the number of refugees still trying to reach Germany.“We are\nnow entering a situation in which everybody is trying to stop the refugees\nbefore they reach their borders,” said Ivan Krastev, chairman of the Center\nfor Liberal Strategies, a research institute in Sofia, Bulgaria.Mr. Krastev\nadded, “The basic question is, which country turns into a parking lot for\nrefugees?”For many months, European Union officials, joined by Ms. Merkel,\nhave tried to share the burden by distributing quotas of the refugees already\nin Greece and Italy to different member states. Many states have balked, and\nthe program is largely paralyzed.European Union leaders also agreed to pay 3\nbillion euros, roughly $3.3 billion, to aid organizations in Turkey to help\nstanch the flow of migrants departing the Turkish coast for the Greek islands.\nBut record numbers of migrants keep coming.Without an effective Europe-wide\npolicy response, and facing growing public anger in many countries, Europe’s\nnational leaders have splintered, searching for allies.Only months ago,\nAustria, like Germany, symbolized Europe’s welcoming embrace to Syrians and\nother refugees fleeing war and poverty. Now, Austria is defying European Union\nofficials — and frustrating Ms. Merkel — by placing a cap on refugees.Austria\nalso convened a meeting on Wednesday in Vienna with many of the Balkan states\nthat last year had allowed migrants to cross their borders while traveling\nnorth toward Germany and Sweden.The group in Vienna agreed to tighten limits\non the number of migrants allowed to travel north, and pledged to help\nMacedonia clamp down on its southern border with Greece.Poland and Hungary are\nalso providing help to Macedonia. Earlier, police chiefs in Austria, Croatia,\nMacedonia, Serbia and Slovenia established tighter rules for screening\nmigrants.Taken together, these moves threaten to turn Greece into the so-\ncalled refugee parking lot. Already, the Greek police have had to relocate\nseveral thousand migrants from the border checkpoint with Macedonia to refugee\ncenters on the outskirts of Athens.The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras,\nis incensed and Greece on Thursday recalled its ambassador to Austria.\nGreece’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement warning against the re-emergence\nof Europe’s ancient rivalries.“It is clear that the major problems of the\nEuropean Union cannot be confronted via thoughts, attitudes and extra-\ninstitutional initiatives that have their roots in the 19th century,” the\nstatement said.Greece is now the primary entry point for Syrians and other\nrefugees trying to reach Europe. Already this year, more than 100,000 migrants\nhave landed on Greek islands, the International Organization for Migration has\nreported, a number that could ultimately top one million or more. Greek\nofficials warn that the country — still reeling from the economic crisis —\ncould be thrown into civil conflict if it becomes a dumping ground for\nmigrants trying to reach the rest of Europe.“This is not a Greek problem,”\nsaid Megan E. Greene, chief economist for Manulife Asset Management and a\nlongtime analyst of Europe.“It is a European problem, and it needs a European\nsolution. We are seeing ‘solidarity’ go out the window.”Analysts say that if\nthe deal struck this week in Austria becomes integrated into a broader\nEuropean Union policy, with Macedonia effectively becoming the bloc’s outer\nedge, it would redraw the external borders of the group. Greece would be left\noutside the bloc’s de facto borders, despite being a European Union member.\nYet Macedonia and Serbia, neither of which are members, would be inside.The\nEuropean Union will hold a pivotal March 7 meeting with Turkey to discuss the\nflow of refugees. European leaders will then gather in Brussels on March 17-18\nfor a summit meeting intended to achieve a unified migration policy — the\nsession that represents Mr. Tusk’s deadline.Leaders like Ms. Merkel have long\nargued that migration demands a Europe-wide solution and is too big for any\nsingle country to adequately address. Yet it will not be easy.Hungary is now\nplanning to hold a public referendum on whether to accept or reject refugees.\nItaly — which has been dealing with migration for years — is calling for the\ncreation of so-called Eurobonds to finance the response to the migration\ncrisis — even as Germany and other countries remain wary.In Germany, the\npolitical pressure on Ms. Merkel is only growing, and some predict that the\nanti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland party could make serious inroads in\nthree important upcoming state elections.Moreover, Ms. Merkel’s own re-\nelection campaign next year could be in doubt. She has criticized Austria and\nthe other countries for acting outside European Union parameters, and for\npotentially isolating Greece. Yet a policy to tighten borders and stem the\nrefugee flow could likely help her politically.“For Germany, it is vital to\nbring the numbers down,” said Almut Möller, head of the Berlin office of the\nEuropean Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n", "title" : "With No Unified Refugee Strategy, Europeans Fall Back on Old Alliances - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "With no unified refugee strategy, Europeans are falling back on old alliances http://nyti.ms/1QBoruB pic.twitter.com/WPtr99jdS2", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/703157283711115265", "retweets" : 64, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-25T17:58:55.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 76, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "703157283711115265" }, "topic" : "refugee", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1QBoruB" }

The New York Times, which had prepared an obituary,\nlearned of his death on Friday.)_For more than a half-century, David Stoliar\nremained a silent witness to the worst civilian maritime disaster of World War\nII, the only survivor among nearly 800 Jews fleeing the Holocaust in Romania\naboard a refugee ship that was barred from Palestine, interned by Turkey for\nmonths, set adrift without power and torpedoed by a Soviet submarine in the\nBlack Sea in 1942.The sinking of the overloaded ship, a 150-foot steamer\ncalled the Struma, was a calamity compounded by Britain’s refusal to admit the\nrefugees into Palestine and by Turkey’s 71-day quarantine, ending with the\nvessel being towed out to sea. The coup de grâce was fired by the submarine as\nthe ship lay dead in the water seven miles offshore.The doomed voyage of the\nStruma might have been a forgotten footnote to Holocaust history had it not\nbeen for Mr. Stoliar’s survival and his willingness years later to attest to\nthe indifference and brutal decisions that put Palestine out of reach and led\nto the deaths of hundreds at the hands of nominal allies against Hitler.Mr.\nStoliar died on May 1, 2014, at his home in Bend, Ore., at the age of 91, his\nwife, Marda, said. News of his death was not widely reported, although a short\nitem appeared in The Oregonian. The loss of the Struma, and Mr. Stoliar’s\nsurvival, were largely unknown until the turn of the century, when he spoke to\na New York Times reporter.The war in Europe had been underway for two years\nand Jews in Romania, their numbers swollen by refugees from Czechoslovakia,\nAustria and Hungary, were perishing under the nation’s fascist Iron Guard.\nThousands hoped for passage out of Constanza, Romania’s port on the Black Sea,\nand through the Bosporus to Palestine. Their desperation was ripe for\nexploitation.On Dec. 11, 1941, the Struma left Constanza with more than 790\nRomanian, Bulgarian and Russian Jews — the number is still disputed — crammed\ninto a squalid, leaky former cattle boat with bunks stacked 10 high, little\nfood or fresh water, no kitchen and only eight toilets. There were no life\npreservers and just two small lifeboats. The crew of 10 were mostly\nBulgarians.Passengers paid up to $1,000 each, gouged by a charlatan who lied\nabout the ship’s seaworthiness and visas, which were never provided. Mr.\nStoliar’s father, a textile manufacturer, paid his passage. When the engine\nfailed a few miles out, the captain of a passing tug repaired it in exchange\nfor the passengers’ wedding rings, their last valuables.Three days later, as\nthe Struma limped toward Turkey, the engines failed again. Turkish tugs towed\nit into the Bosporus, the divide of Europe and Asia. Neutral Turkey, whose\nleaders feared angering either Britain or Germany, interned the Struma\noffshore while its fate was considered. Istanbul’s Jews donated food, but\nconditions onboard deteriorated as talks dragged on.Britain, which had control\nof Palestine, limited Jewish immigration to avoid antagonizing the Arabs, and\nrefused to let the passengers continue without visas. Ten were allowed to\ndisembark in Istanbul: a woman who suffered a miscarriage, and nine others\nhelped by an American oil executive, the Jewish Agency in Palestine and a\nTurkish Jew who aided refugees.Finally, the Turks cut the Struma’s anchor,\ntowed the ship back into the Black Sea and set it adrift. It was spotted the\nnext day by a Soviet sub, identified years later as SC-213. Its commander had\nstanding orders from Stalin to sink all neutral ships in the Black Sea to\nprevent supplies from reaching Germany.Despite the target’s benign profile, a\ntorpedo was fired at it dawn on Feb. 24, 1942. In a gray overcast, it struck\namidships with an explosion that tore the Struma apart.Most of the passengers\nand crew went down with the groaning ship in 250 feet of water. But scores\nmore, including Mr. Stoliar, 19, who had been asleep in a deckhouse, were\nhurled into the sea with a rain of debris, mostly planking from the shattered\ndeck.After years of silence, Mr. Stoliar told the story in 2000 in an\ninterview with Douglas Frantz, then a reporter for The Times.“I was one of the\nlucky ones who was blown up into the air, and I fell into the sea,” Mr.\nStoliar said. “When I came to the surface, there was nothing except a\ntremendous amount of debris and many, many people swimming in the water. It\nwas very, very cold, and we had a hard time moving our feet and our hands.”Mr.\nFrantz and Catherine Collins later recounted the sinking in a 2003 book,\n“Death on the Black Sea.” Mr. Stoliar told them he saw people screaming and\nthrashing in waves strewn with kindling. Many were clinging to a partly\nsubmerged section of the wooden deck, with cables and twisted metal from the\nship’s railing attached to it.He swam to the group, still clad in his heavy\nleather jacket, grabbed the railing and looked about at the terrified faces,\nshivering and sobbing in the cold. There was nothing to do but hang on. Hours\npassed and the cries gradually faded as people succumbed to hypothermia and\nexhaustion. Some floated off, others slipped into the deep.One man lost his\ngrip, grabbed Mr. Stoliar by the collar and dragged him under. But Mr. Stoliar\nbroke free and regained his hold as the man sank out of sight. Soon birds\nappeared, flying over the corpses. As the dead drifted away, the decking grew\nlighter and rose in the water. Mr. Stoliar, a strong youth, dragged himself on\ntop.In the afternoon, the Struma’s first mate, Lazar Ivanof Dikof, floated by\non a door. Mr. Stoliar pulled him onto his raft of wreckage. He told Mr.\nStoliar of seeing the torpedo’s approach. In the numbing cold, they were\nsurrounded by floating bodies. No one else appeared to be alive as night fell,\nand in the morning Mr. Dikof, too, was dead.Alone now, Mr. Stoliar thought of\ngiving up. He took out a jackknife to slit his wrists, but his fingers were\ntoo numb to open the blade. A short while later, about 24 hours after the\nStruma had sunk, a large ship appeared in the distance. He waved frantically,\nand saw figures on deck waving back.Soon a rowboat approached. He was pulled\naboard, wrapped in blankets and taken to a Turkish fishing village. His hands\nand feet were frostbitten. He was hospitalized in Istanbul, then jailed for\nsix weeks, apparently to keep him from the news media. Referring to the Turks,\nhe recalled, “I was the only witness to their inhumanity, really, from the\nbeginning to the end.”David Stoliar was born in Kishinev, Romania, on Oct. 31,\n1922, the son of Jacob Stoliar, a Jewish textile manufacturer in Bucharest.\nHis parents were divorced when he was 10, and he lived with his mother in\nParis for several years.In 1936, he returned to Bucharest and finished high\nschool. He wanted to become an engineer, but the war intervened. He was taken\nfor forced labor, digging trenches. As brutality against Jews spread, his\nfather tried to save him by arranging his passage aboard the Struma.For months\nthe ship’s sinking became a rallying cry for Jews around the world. It\ngenerated protests, a general strike in Palestine, death threats against\nBritish officials and responses by Turkey and Britain that voiced regrets but\ndenied responsibility.Mr. Stoliar reached Palestine eventually and joined the\nBritish Army’s Jewish Brigade in 1943, serving in Egypt and Libya. He also\nfought with the Israeli Army in the 1948 war of independence. He became an oil\nexecutive in the early 1950s and lived in Japan for 18 years.In 1945 he\nmarried Adria Nacmias. They had one son, Ronnie. His wife died in 1961. In\n1968 he married Marda Emslie. Besides his wife, he was survived by his son and\na granddaughter.Mr. Stoliar moved to Oregon in 1971 and later retired. For\ndecades he said nothing about the Struma, whose sinking was largely forgotten,\nnoted mainly in scholarly books. But interest was revived in 2000, when Greg\nBuxton, a Briton whose grandparents had died onboard, organized a successful\nsearch for the vessel, which they photographed.Mr. Stoliar spoke to newspapers\nand magazines and appeared in a 2001 documentary, “The Struma,” by the\nCanadian director Simcha Jacobovici. “For 58 years, no one asked me about the\nStruma,” he said, “and I felt that no one cared. I carried the memories in my\nhead as if it happened yesterday.”\n\n", "title" : "David Stoliar, Survivor of World War II Disaster, Dies at 91 - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "David Stoliar, the only survivor among nearly 800 Jews on a refugee ship sunk by the USSR, has died at 91 http://nyti.ms/1KwRihD", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/691254130854199297", "retweets" : 208, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-23T21:40:02.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 282, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "691254130854199297" }, "topic" : "refugee", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1KwRihD" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71a7d955d14d6aff102c3" }, "content" : "WARSAW, N.Y. — Purna Gurung and Hem Gurung stood in dung-slopped boots and\nrubber gloves, the heady perfume of wet cow, raw milk and manure permeating\nthe room. They washed down the dirty stalls in the rotary milking parlor at\nNoblehurst Farms in western New York, some 7,500 miles from their birthplace\nin Bhutan.“Everything here looks good to me,” Purna Gurung, 52, said in\nNepali, through an interpreter. “It’s hard work here, but I am more happy than\nbeing in the refugee camp. Now I have everything for my family.”The men were\nonce farmers, and then spent 20 years in refugee camps in Nepal, unable to\nhold legal jobs. Now they worked wordlessly alongside two other milkers, both\nMexican immigrants, in practiced repetition.The raw product would soon supply\na cross-cultural dairy case: Siggi’s, an Icelandic-style yogurt; Norman’s\nkosher Greek yogurt; and eggnog for Pittsford Farms Dairy.Hem and Purna Gurung\n(no relation) are among 23 Bhutanese refugees who have taken part in a state\nprogram, learning to be milkers at Alfred State College and then training on\nlocal farms.The Refugee Milker Training Program began in 2014 out of mutual\nneed: Refugees in Rochester wanted familiar agrarian jobs, and farms needed\nlabor to fuel the yogurt boom. Since then, it has evolved into a modest social\nexperiment in the state’s dairy heartland.“We need a stable work force; labor\nis our No. 1 issue,” said Sarah Noble-Moag, whose family has owned and\noperated Noblehurst Farms for seven generations.Ms. Noble-Moag explained how\nseveral years ago agents for Immigration and Customs Enforcement would raid\nfarms across the county to pick up the Mexican workers, many undocumented, who\nhad become the anchor of the work force. Entire shifts would be lost in a\nday.“We need to know that they are going to be here to milk cows,” she said.\n“And with the enforcement activity that comes and goes, we need to balance our\nwork force.”The raids have since decreased, Ms. Noble-Moag added, but the\naddition of the Bhutanese milkers, who work 12-hour shifts four days a week,\nhas provided insurance.The sparse break room at Noblehurst’s dairy in the town\nof York has a map of Mexico. “I’m going to get a map of Bhutan,” Ms. Noble-\nMoag promised.Not long ago, she knew that Bhutan was a landlocked Himalayan\nnation tucked between China and India. But she had no idea about the refugee\ncrisis that brought the milkers to her doorstep.It is a cruel irony that\nBhutan has become known as a country devoted to gross national happiness (as\nopposed to gross national product), considering that more than 100,000 people\nof Nepalese ancestry living in southern Bhutan were expelled by the king in\nthe 1990s during a period of ethnic cleansing.Since 2011, nearly 40,000\nBhutanese refugees have settled across the United States, in cities like\nAkron, Ohio; Houston; and Buffalo. In Rochester, the Bhutanese are the largest\nrefugee group, numbering about 2,000, according to the resettlement agency\nthere, Catholic Family Center.Pat Standish, an indefatigable leader in the\nregion, made the connection bridging the Bhutanese and farming\ncommunities.Twenty years ago, after her husband died, Ms. Standish founded the\nnonprofit group Community Action Angels to help residents contend with\npoverty, literacy and a lack of jobs. In late 2013, working with the Cornell\nCooperative Extension of Wyoming County, she contacted the Catholic Family\nCenter to enroll the first participants in the milker program, for which she\nobtained an initial grant. The state’s Office for New Americans provided\n$400,000 to help run the pilot program for two years.The first person she\nhired was Manoj Rai, who had recently moved to Rochester after first landing\nin Richmond, Va., to stay with a brother. Mr. Rai, 41, would serve as an\ninterpreter, mentor and liaison. He called himself a “guardian” of his\npeople.“I knew people would follow Manoj,” Ms. Standish, 69, said.For the\nfirst two winters, Mr. Rai and the milkers made the treacherous hourlong drive\nfrom Rochester to the farms and back to work. The weather made moving to rural\nWyoming County an easy sell. The refugees had lived in Bhutan’s tropical\nregion, not the northern Himalayas. They had never owned cars, let alone\ndriven in blinding snow squalls.On a recent white-swirled ride through the\nfarm roads, Mr. Rai pointed out the numerous spots where he had rescued fellow\nrefugees from ditches in the first year.He was the first to move, in September\n2014, to a house off Liberty Street with a jungle gym in the yard. Five other\nfamilies have followed him to the village of Warsaw, population 3,814. Most\nmoved into homes owned by Action Angels. They cut their commute to 20\nminutes.Slowly, and with snow tires, the refugees are adapting to their new\nlives.“I feel this is a wonderful place,” Mr. Rai said of Warsaw, which before\ntheir arrival was 97 percent white, according to census figures. Now, 27\nBhutanese immigrants live here, with 10 children attending the local\nschools.Warsaw also provided the Bhutanese residents shelter from their\nanxious urban life. In the last three years, Rochester has seen an increase in\ncrimes against immigrants, including robberies, assaults and a murder.Kaji\nRai, 35, who works at the farm Synergy, said moving closer had relaxed him,\nand not just because he drove fewer miles.“In Rochester, it was no good for\nthe children,” said Mr. Rai, no relation to Manoj. “There’s bad guys, too many\nthere.”The Action Angels, a division of Community Action for Wyoming County,\nhas served as a secondary refugee agency for the Bhutanese, offering ESL\nclasses, paying their first month’s rent and providing furniture.When Mr. Rai\ncould not find a used trumpet for Binuphsa, his 10-year-old daughter, to take\nlessons, Ms. Standish assembled an entire band’s worth of donated\ninstruments.The pilot program expires in December, and if not renewed, Ms.\nStandish said she was determined to keep it running.The industry’s fortune\nplays a role, too. When milk prices plummeted in 2015, the farms restricted\ntheir hiring. Currently, five Bhutanese are working at Noblehurst and Synergy\nfarms. Another 12 Bhutanese who completed training are waiting for the market\nto recover.Last spring, Ms. Standish found jobs for some of the farmworkers’\nwives when American Classic Outfitters, a local company that sews college\nfootball and baseball uniforms, called asking for workers. The employees were\ninitially skeptical, worried that the Bhutanese were taking away jobs from\nAmerican-born workers. But that was not the case, Lisa Carpenter, the\ncompany’s human resources administrator, said.Then there were the cultural\ndifferences. The women from Bhutan wiped their noses on their sleeves and spit\ninto trash cans. Mr. Rai gave them a lesson in American workplace etiquette,\njust as he had taught the farmers how to use forks and knives.By Christmas,\nthe divide started to dissolve when the Bhutanese women were sharing food in a\npotluck holiday lunch and taking part in the American tradition of Secret\nSanta.Back in Nepal, Kamali Gurung used to sew pink saris in the refugee\ncamp.On this day she was sewing seams on gold football pants. It was for the\nmost American of uniforms, the Navy Midshipmen. On the waist, the letters\nembroidered in-house read: “Don’t Give Up the Ship.”\n\n", "title" : "From Bhutan to New York’s Dairy Heartland - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "From refugee camps in Nepal to working, and assimilating, on New York farms http://nyti.ms/1SgOr2W pic.twitter.com/MGIhha7MW2", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/691951243271475200", "retweets" : 77, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-25T19:50:06.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 144, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "691951243271475200" }, "topic" : "refugee", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1SgOr2W" }

On Thursday, a judge gave the French\ngovernment a green light to begin destruction, although it is not yet known\nwhen demolition will begin. Although the government has claimed that only\nabout 800 to 1,000 refugees will be evicted, a census conducted last week by\nthe organization Help Refugees estimates that as many as 3,400 people from\nAfghanistan, Ethiopia, Sudan, Syria and other places are living in the\nJungle’s southern section. This figure includes 445 children, 305 of them\nliving alone without their families. The vast majority of the refugees are\ndesperately waiting for clearance to enter Britain, just over 20 miles from\nCalais. In their eyes, leaving Calais would mean abandoning their chances to\ncross the English Channel. “We are pleased,” Philippe Mignonet, Calais’s\ndeputy mayor, said of the court’s decision. “We’ve been asking for that for\nages.”As for concrete plans to destroy the camp, Mignonet added that, for now,\n“it’s wait and see.” Before any demolition begins, however, the refugees and\ncharitable and relief agencies — including L’Auberge des Migrants, Secours\nCatholique and Care4Calais — said they will appeal. “Obviously, we are very\ndisappointed, because the case really showed that the authorities didn’t have\nsufficient alternatives for the people,” said Clare Moseley, the founder of\nCare4Calais. “I’m almost certain that we’ll be appealing it to the European\nCourt of Human Rights.” Mignonet disputed the accusation that the authorities\ndid not provide sufficient alternatives for the refugees to be displaced. The\ngovernment’s plan for displaced refugees is to send them to new container\nunits built on the side of the Jungle or to other centers across France.\n“There are a lot of spaces available,” he said. “All the migrants in that area\ncan be driven somewhere in the country. But migrants have got to understand\nthat it’s impossible to stay in Calais forever.” Earlier on Thursday, French\nInterior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve was quick to dispel the image of\ngovernment violence against helpless refugees. “There was never any question\nof the French government sending bulldozers onto the site,” he said. The\njudge’s order prohibits French authorities from using force against the\nrefugees, and the demolition is slated to be a “humanitarian operation” that\nwould spare public areas such as the Jungle’s mosques, churches and schools.\nMignonet said the aim will instead be “persuasion.”But if refugees ignore the\ncall to leave, he added, and authorities still do not use force, “it will be a\nsign of the state’s loss of power.” **Read more:** Migrants find doors\nslamming shut across Europe Spring could bring a fresh surge of refugees.

But what struck observers most were not the slogans but\nrather the origins of those chanting them.Many protesters, according to German\nmedia reports, were themselves immigrants and former refugees.That Germany's\nnewest citizens are also among the country's most outspoken critics of\nmigrants has flabbergasted experts and politicians alike.A widely cited survey\nfrom several weeks ago showed that about one in four migrants thinks Germany\nshould stop taking in refugees altogether, whereas support for refugees is far\nhigher among all Germans, according to the polling institute infratest dimap.\nOverall, only 4 percent of all Germans agreed that refugees fleeing war should\nnot be granted asylum.According to the country's statistical office, about 10\nmillion immigrants (about 12 percent of the population) lived in Germany in\n2014, the year before the country took in more than 1 million refugees.There\nare two reasons that could explain why migrants are particularly opposed to\nthe refugee influx.**1\\. Fear of negative repercussions **Muslim migrants,\nparticularly, fear that the influx of refugees could have negative\nrepercussions for them -- both economically as well as on a more subtle level.\nIn an interview with German broadcaster Deutsche Welle, German sociologist\nFriedrich Heckmann recently explained that the aggressive reactions were part\nof \"competition between established migrants and newcomers over the same or\nsimilar resources.\"For instance, Heckmann referred to state subsidies, which\nare limited. However, the New Year's Eve incidents at Cologne's main station\nin which several migrants were alleged to have assaulted women have led to\nmore fears: Some migrants believe that Germans could ultimately turn against\nall refugees and fail to differentiate between criminals and established and\nassimilated migrants.**2\\. Fabricated coverage**A significant number of those\nmigrants opposed to the current refugee influx have Russian origins, according\nto German newspaper Die Welt. German politicians have recently accused Russian\nstate media of broadcasting a deliberately falsified picture of how the\ncountry handles the refugees.As my colleague Adam Taylor explained, an alleged\nrape of a young girl recently made headlines -- but only in Russia. German\nauthorities later said that the story was fabricated. Many Russians living in\nGermany still rely on Russian media outlets and consequently organized\nprotests in front of the chancellor's office in Berlin, for instance.German\nauthorities now accuse Russia of falsifying coverage and inciting tensions\nwithin Germany. According to the respected German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung,\nthe German government launched an investigation into the matter after its\nintelligence agency BND accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of reportedly\nsowing \"the seeds of discord in Europe by weakening Germany and Angela\nMerkel.\"In a statement, Christiane Wirtz, Germany's deputy government\nspokeswoman, acknowledged that authorities were \"closely monitoring the\ncurrent spike in Russian media activity.\"**Also read: **Hitler’s ‘Mein Kampf’\nis now a bestseller in GermanyWhy Germany allows certain sex offenders to go\nunpunished\n\n", "title" : " Why so many immigrants in Germany are opposed to the refugee influx - The Washington Post", "twitter" : { "body" : "Why so many immigrants in Germany are opposed to the refugee influx http://wapo.st/1KV3UoP", "link" : "https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/703996105420365824", "retweets" : 79, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-28T01:32:05.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 59, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "703996105420365824" }, "topic" : "refugee", "source" : "washingtonpost", "link" : "http://wapo.st/1KV3UoP" }

In a speech at the party, Edward Kallon, the U.N. resident and\nhumanitarian coordinator, dubbed her birth an “auspicious occasion,” while\nPopulation Fund officials used it to highlight the fact that there had been no\nmaternal deaths in all these childbirths.Rima’s parents are clearly grateful\nfor the help: After they were informed that their daughter was the 5,000th\nchild, they named her after their doctor in the clinic.As dramatic as it may\nsound, the 5,000 figure may understate just how much life is going on in\nZaatari. U.N. officials estimate that the total number of births for those in\nthe camp is closer to 10,000; several nongovernmental organizations offered\nchildbirth facilities before the clinic opened in 2013, and over 1,000 cases\nthat required more-advanced medical techniques have been referred to a nearby\nhospital run by the Moroccan military.Zaatari’s population surged in the early\nyears after the fighting started in Syria, at one point soaring to more than\n100,000 people — enough to make the camp the fourth-largest “city” in\nJordan.After many families moved to escape the crowding and live outside the\ncamp, the population dropped to around 80,000. Now, many argue that the camp\nis getting better and better — and that it may even evolve into a real city\nwithin a few years.“They have created something that is approaching normalcy,”\nAoife McDonnell, the U.N. refugee agency’s Jordan spokeswoman, said of the\nrefugees in the camp.At the event Tuesday, Rima’s father showed off some of\nthat normalcy, bringing plates of falafel from the restaurant he works at in\nthe camp to pass out to guests. Mohammed Salameh, 22, argued that the falafel\nis the best in Zaatari. He may well be right, but there is plenty of\ncompetition: Zaatari’s central street, dubbed the Champs-Elysees, is full of\nplaces to eat. There are estimated to be thousands of small businesses\noperating in the camp, with shops selling wares as varied as wedding dresses\nand bicycles.Back in a small trailer that Salameh shares with his extended\nfamily, it is clear that although things may have stabilized in the camp, the\nproblems are far from over.Salameh says he earns just 5 Jordanian dinar a day\nfor a 12-hour shift at the restaurant, barely $7. Over the course of the\nmonth, he makes around $210, a figure that is stretched extremely thin as he\nis the sole breadwinner for his large extended family.Despite the new start in\nZaatari, the family still faces daily challenges. Salameh’s father, who\nsuffered a stroke, needs medical attention. One of Salameh’s sisters was\nkilled by a barrel bomb in Syria. Her infant son, Fahad, now lives with\nSalameh in Zaatari; the family says he survived in the rubble for hours before\nbeing found. Another sister has a young child named Sham, an Arabic word that\nrefers to a part of Syria — the homeland where new mother Kholoud Suliman’s\nentire family remains, despite the risk and the distance from their\ndaughter.In the end, Salameh explained, the hope is that Rima and her sister\nwon’t go through all this. What he and his wife want for their daughters is\njust “a better chance than we did in our lives.” **Read more:** Most of the\nrefugees stuck in Greece are now women and children French court gives okay to\ndemolish Calais’s ‘Jungle’ refugee camp Germany seeks North African help to\nspeed migrant deportations Today's coverage from Post correspondents around\nthe world\n\n", "title" : " The 5,000th baby was just born in this Syrian refugee camp - The Washington Post", "twitter" : { "body" : "The 5,000th baby was just born in this Syrian refugee camp http://wapo.st/1LUvoFY", "link" : "https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/704974661361213440", "retweets" : 77, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-01T18:20:31.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 45, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "704974661361213440" }, "topic" : "refugee", "source" : "washingtonpost", "link" : "http://wapo.st/1LUvoFY" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71a7d955d14d6aff102c9" }, "content" : "AZRAQ REFUGEE CAMP, JORDAN — The sprawling Azraq refugee camp east of Amman\nwas designed with the benefit of hindsight.Before it opened in 2014, most\nSyrian refugees who arrived in Jordan ended up in chaotic situations, either\nat the densely packed Zaatari camp or in informal urban arrangements. But the\nAzraq camp’s ordered design and planned construction promised something\nbetter.Today, Syrian refugees who arrive in Jordan are taken to the camp,\nwhere they live in bare-bones homes and receive food and medical care.“It’s\nanother life,” said Abdullah Ahmad, a 32-year-old who arrived just days ago\nafter fleeing Islamic State-held territory near Aleppo, Syria’s largest city.\n“We hadn’t even tasted the joys of life before we arrived here.”Yet some\nvisitors to the camp are likely to be struck by something else. Despite its\nsize, tight security and the obvious amounts of money that have gone into\nbuilding it, large parts of Azraq are essentially empty. According to the\nlatest United Nations figures, fewer than 20,000 refugees live in the camp,\neven though it was designed to hold up to 100,000. Of Azraq’s four residential\n“villages,” just two are occupied. Another planned village has not been\nconstructed yet.In a way, it’s hindsight that caused the problem.When Azraq\nwas proposed, it was based on the assumption that the flow of Syrians would\ncontinue in the same tumultuous way that created the need for the Zaatari\ncamp.It did not.That doesn’t mean fewer Syrians are trying to reach Jordan.\nWhile Azraq sits partly empty, tens of thousands of refugees sit on the border\nin a no man’s land known as “the Berm,” a dusty, desolate patch of land barely\ninside Jordanian territory.Jordanian authorities say these people are leaving\nIslamic State-controlled territory and need stringent security checks before\nthey can enter Jordan.Hala Shamlawi, spokeswoman for the International\nCommittee of the Red Cross in Jordan, one of the few groups with consistent\naccess to the area, said that there have been several waves of arrivals since\nSeptember 2013 and that it is unclear how long some have been there. Recent\narrivals to Azraq describe having to wait for as long as five months.Jordan’s\nrefusal to take in these refugees may also be a sign of a broader problem.\nLong a country that has been willing to accept large numbers of refugees from\nthe Syrian war, Jordan may finally be reaching its limit. Almost 700,000\nSyrians are registered as refugees in Jordan, but the government estimates the\ntotal number in the country at considerably more than 1 million.In a country\nof just 6.5 million, that’s a significant proportion of the population, and\nmany Jordanians are frustrated. They say that refugees push wages down and\nprices up and that they take up a substantial amount of government spending.\nAnd with Turkey and Europe slowly becoming more difficult and risky options\nfor Syrians, there is a worry that letting masses of people through the border\nwill only encourage more Syrians to view Jordan as their best bet.Children\nplay at the Zaatari camp in Jordan on March 1, 2016. (Photos by Lorenzo\nTugnoli for The Washington Post)Figures released recently by the Jordanian\nBorder Guards with the U.N. refugee agency indicate that the number of\nrefugees on the border had reached 26,000. But aid agencies are reluctant to\ntalk about the situation at the Berm, concerned that their already limited\naccess to the refugees in the area may be curtailed. With few exceptions,\njournalists are refused entry to the border area, which is technically\nclassified as a military area.The government had been reluctant to discuss the\nsituation but has become more open. “If you want to take the moral high ground\non this issue, we’ll get them all to an air base and we’re more than happy to\nrelocate them to your country,” King Abdullah II said in an interview with the\nBBC last month.Nazmieh Azadeen Amoreh, a 57-year-old Syrian, arrived at Azraq\nfrom the Berm two weeks ago. When asked how many people are stuck on the\nborder, she repeated, “So many, so many, so many.” She then added her own\nexaggerated guess: 10 million.Often the families allowed through include women\nwho are in the late stages of pregnancy.Franjiah al-Ali, a 33-year-old woman\nfrom Idlib, arrived at the camp less than a month ago and gave birth in Azraq\ntwo weeks later. She and her family had been stuck at the border for five\nmonths, she says, with the Jordanian military repeatedly telling them it was\nsimply following a “procedure.” While her son, Muhammad, is healthy, staff at\nthe hospital where the baby was born say that Ali was dangerously malnourished\nwhen she arrived. “They saved my life,” Ali said.Compared with Zaatari, a\nbustling yet chaotic camp that is closer to the Syrian border, Azraq can seem\nlifeless. The camp was built in the middle of a desert, away from Jordanian\ntowns. Syrians who live in Zaatari or outside the camps often set up their own\nbusinesses, but Azraq is run in a top-down system — food is generally bought\nfrom an on-site supermarket. Security is notably tighter in Azraq than in\nZaatari.Some Syrians eventually flee the camp, deciding to try their luck in\ncities. A considerable number are granted permits to leave the camp to visit a\ncity. Many do not come back. Andrew Harper, the U.N. refugee agency’s\nrepresentative to Jordan, said that this in itself may be a security risk that\nthe Jordanian government is not willing to accept. “We may put up fences if\nthat is the issue that allowed refugees to be able to come in,” he said.But\nfor many new arrivals in the camp, it’s still better than what they escaped.\nEven in Azraq, Ahmad grimaces when he thinks of his time in Islamic State-\ncontrolled territory, where he was ordered to take a course on Islam after he\nwas seen talking to a woman who wasn’t a relative.Ahmad said he and his family\nspent four months on the border after their escape from Aleppo. He doesn’t\nknow why he was allowed into Jordan, but he’s glad he was. Now his family,\nincluding his wife and five children, is settling into life in Azraq.“I would\nlike to thank the Jordanian people,” he says. “Long live the king.”**** Syrian\nrefugees are pawns in a wider war Today’s coverage from Post correspondents\naround the world\n\n", "title" : " Refugee camp is partially empty while thousands wait at Jordanian border - The Washington Post", "twitter" : { "body" : "Refugee camp is partially empty while thousands wait elsewhere in Jordan http://wapo.st/1P3Pv4l", "link" : "https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/708343501768040449", "retweets" : 46, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-11T01:27:05.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 32, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "708343501768040449" }, "topic" : "refugee", "source" : "washingtonpost", "link" : "http://wapo.st/1P3Pv4l" }

Other documents included\ninformation on routes traveled by foreign recruits between their home nations\nand the Islamic State’s stronghold in Syria and Iraq.The documents come amid\nheated debate over the extent to which the various international military\ncampaigns against the Islamic State — by the U.S. and its allies, and by\nSyrian, Russian, Iraqi and Iranian forces — are affecting the terrorist\ngroup’s global reach.Pentagon officials have vowed this week that a revamped\nU.S. effort to train and equip moderate Syrian rebels to battle the Islamic\nState on the ground won’t repeat the mistakes that doomed a similar program\nlast year.Army Gen. Joseph Votel, President Obama’s choice to be the next U.S.\ncommander for the Middle East, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on\nWednesday that the new approach will be more of a “thickening effort” than the\nprevious effort, which aimed to raise a large defensive force against the\nIslamic State.**‘Omar the Chechen’ survives?**Separately, there were signs\nThursday that a recent American airstrike targeting one of Islamic State’s top\nmilitary commanders in Syria was not as successful as U.S. officials had\nhoped.The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights claimed that Abu Omar al-\nShishani, also known as “Omar the Chechen,” was injured but had survived the\nMarch 4 airstrike.Born in 1986 in Georgia, which was then part of the Soviet\nUnion, the red-bearded jihadi was a close adviser to Islamic State leader Abu\nBakr al-Baghdadi.Bill Roggio, a senior fellow on terrorism at the Foundation\nfor Defense of Democracies, said there is often difficulty in determining\nwhether a top jihadi commander has been killed or survived such a\nstrike.“Without possession of a body for positive identification, intelligence\nservices must rely on other means to determine his status,” Mr. Roggio wrote\nThursday in the foundation’s Long War Journal. “Often, the best way to know\nwhether a leader was killed or not is to get confirmation from the jihadists\nthemselves, as they wish to eulogize their leaders.”“This usually is\nreliable,” he added, “but you cannot rule out the possibility that various\ngroups are obscuring the status of their leaders.”Similar uncertainty has\nsurrounded the revelation of the memory stick with Arabic language documents,\npurportedly containing the identities of thousands of Islamic State recruits\nfrom around the world.While Sky News initially made headlines with the\ninformation, the material was reportedly also obtained by a Syrian newspaper\nand by Germany’s intelligence agency, and was being examined by U.S. and\nBritish intelligence by Thursday.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71cb4955d14d6f8076777" }, "content" : "No, it’s not ISIS or rampaging Shi’a militias. It’s the Mosul Dam, Iraq’s\nlargest, and its possible collapse, perhaps leading to millions of deaths.\nThose in the know worry catastrophe could strike this spring, as snows melt\nand build an uncontrollable water pressure.Hastily built in wartime for the\ndictator Saddam Hussein by a German-Italian consortium, the Mosul Dam was\nlocated where it is because one of Hussein’s cronies came from the area and\nused his pull, despite the fact that engineers knew from the start that its\nporous gypsum base could not sustain such a huge structure.What was then\ncalled the Saddam Dam opened in 1984 and within two years needed constant\ngrouting, that is, day and night infusions of microfine cement, lots of it —\n200 million pounds over the decades — to keep it from collapsing. The grouting\nkeeps the foundational problem from worsening but does not solve it.The years\nwent by; fortunately, there was no disaster on the American watch. Then,\nduring a fateful 10-day period, Aug. 7-17, 2014, the Islamic State (ISIS)\nseized control of the dam. While the group neither sabotaged nor blew up the\nstructure, grouting stopped for six weeks and the whole repair regime —\nespecially the skilled workers and the supply of cement — henceforth became\nless consistent.As a result, the dam has steadily weakened over the past 19\nmonths, to the point that experts worry that a surge of spring waters will\noverwhelm it and cause its collapse. That the dam’s two emergency floodgates\nare broken and cannot be opened to relieve intense pressure renders the\nsituation the more fraught.The consequences of a collapse are terrifying: A\nwall of water 45-70 feet high would reach Mosul, a city of about 1 million\ninhabitants, in about four hours. Then the flood wave would roll down the\nTigris River valley to other cities, including the capital Baghdad, before\ndispersing in a wide flood. A huge number of immediate casualties would be\nfollowed by drought, disease, lack of electricity, chaos, and crime, ensuring\nbiblical-level miseries and fatalities.For years, quiet grouting and blithe\nassurances kept the precariousness of the Mosul Dam obscure. But heightened\nalarms coming from the U.S. government since the start of 2016, relying\nprimarily on U.S. Army Corps of Engineers estimates, appear finally to have\nawakened Iraqis to the dangers they face. The U.S. embassy in Baghdad has even\nissued a highly unusual “Mosul Dam Preparedness Fact Sheet” with advice (in\nEnglish, alas) on evacuation steps, educational needs, and relief efforts.In\ncontrast, the Iraqi government issues a stream of dishonest assurances that\nthere’s no problem. Mohsen al-Shimari, Iraq’s minister for Water Resources and\nofficial in charge of the dam, says “The danger is not imminent, it’s far off.\nThe danger is 1 in 1,000” (itself, an unacceptable risk). Or he insists that\nMosul Dam is in “no greater” danger than other dams. At other times he\nactually claims “there is no problem in the dam that may lead to its\ncollapse.” Note the inconsistency, itself a sign of duplicity.In keeping with\nthis irresponsible, even criminal nonchalance, Iraqi authorities have done\nnext to nothing to prepare for a possible collapse. Yes, they claim that a\ncontingency plan exists, but no one has seen it, much less learned its\ndetails, so what use can it have in time of crisis? Yes, they signed a $300\nmillion deal with Trevi, an Italian company, to repair and maintain the Dam,\nbut this is a Band-Aid fix, not a long-term solution.To make matters worse,\nthe dam’s most vulnerable city, Mosul, labors under the rule of the\napocalyptic Islamic State, whose disregard for human life and extreme\nhostility toward the outside world negates both crisis planning and\ninternational assistance. But there is a silver lining here; ISIS’ monstrous\nrule has caused Mosul’s population to decline from 2.5 million two years ago\nto about 1 million now, thereby reducing the number of potential casualties\nthere.Assuming the dam survives this year’s snow melt, only one long-term\nsolution exists: to complete the Badush Dam downstream from the Mosul Dam that\nwould mitigate the consequences of a collapse. Started soon after the grouting\nbegan in 1986 but halted in 1990, this ancillary dam will cost US$10 billion\nthat the Iraqi government cannot afford. But it must be the country’s highest\npriority._• __Daniel Pipes is president of the Middle East Forum._\n\n", "title" : "DANIEL PIPES: Iraq set to fall into chaos - Washington Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Daniel Pipes: Collapse of #Iraq dam could send country into chaos. #baghdadi #ISIS http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/13/daniel-pipes-iraq-set-to-fall-into-chaos/", "link" : "https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/709136217359708160", "retweets" : 10, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-13T07:57:03.000-0700" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 5, "hashtags" : "#Iraq #baghdadi #ISIS", "id" : "709136217359708160" }, "topic" : "isis", "source" : "washtimes", "link" : "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/13/daniel-pipes-iraq-set-to-fall-into-chaos/" }

He is the youngest of three\nsons and was preparing to start graduate school at Mississippi State.Young, a\nsophomore chemistry major from Vicksburg, was the daughter of a school\nadministrator and a police officer who served in the Navy reserve. She was a\nformer honor student, cheerleader and homecoming maid at Warren Central High\nSchool.Court papers filed with the plea portray Young as the mastermind of the\ncouple's attempt to join the Islamic State, saying she had already expressed\nan interest in converting to Islam even before she began dating Dakhlalla in\nlate 2014.The papers confirm that both Young and Dakhlalla left farewell\nletters \"that explained they would never be back, with Young acknowledging her\nrole as the planner of the expedition and that Dakhlalla was going as her\ncompanion of his own free will.\"The court papers reiterate earlier government\nclaims that Dakhlalla, in online contacts, told an FBI employee that he was\ngood with computers and media and wanted to contribute to the Islamic State's\nstruggle. Court papers say Dakhlalla said online that he wanted to become a\nfighter and learn \"what it really means to have that heart in battle.\"The plea\nagreement drops a related charge against Dakhlalla, cutting the possible\nlength of any imprisonment. However, in the plea agreement signed Wednesday,\nDakhlalla and his lawyer acknowledged that the sentencing recommendation would\nbe adjusted upward because terrorism is involved.__\n\n", "title" : "Mississippi man accused of trying to join ISIS with fiancee pleads guilty | Fox News", "twitter" : { "body" : "Mississippi man accused of trying to join ISIS with fiancee pleads guilty http://fxn.ws/1YHgUR4", "link" : "https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/708507567589187584", "retweets" : 136, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-11T12:19:02.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 143, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "708507567589187584" }, "topic" : "isis", "source" : "FoxNews", "link" : "http://fxn.ws/1YHgUR4" }

The plan was outlined before a committee of the\nBritish parliament dedicated to counter-terrorism.The program is still in its\npilot stages, but House is hopeful that this new plan may provide a clever\ntool that protects the freedom of the Internet while protecting the\nlivelihoods of the world's citizens. \"We should get the bad stuff down, but\nit's also extremely important that people are able to find good information,\nthat when people are feeling isolated, that when they go online, they find a\ncommunity of hope, not a community of harm,\" said the Google manager.The idea,\nthe Internet giant says, is to provide a sort of alternative narrative to\nthose looking for information about extremism. In a statement, a Google\nspokesperson further explained, \"What was referenced is a pilot Google AdWords\nGrants program that's in the works right now with a handful of eligible non-\nprofit organizations.

U.S. officials have said that while in\ncustody, Mueller was repeatedly forced to have sex with Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,\nthe leader of the Islamic State groupThe criminal complaint, filed in federal\ncourt in Virginia, charges Umm Sayyaf with conspiracy to provide material\nsupport to a foreign terror organization, resulting in death.The case comes\none year after Mueller was confirmed dead by her family and the Obama\nadministration, though it's not clear when or if Umm Sayyaf will be brought to\nthe U.S. to stand trial. The 25-year-old Iraqi woman, who was captured last\nyear, is currently in Iraqi custody and facing prosecution there. Her husband,\nAbu Sayyaf, a former Islamic State minister for oil and gas, was killed last\nMay in a Delta Force raid of his compound.\"We fully support the Iraqi\nprosecution of Sayyaf and will continue to work with the authorities there to\npursue our shared goal of holding Sayyaf accountable for her crimes,\"\nAssistant Attorney General John Carlin, head of the Justice Department's\nnational security division, said in a statement. \"At the same time, these\ncharges reflect that the U.S. justice system remains a powerful tool to bring\nto bear against those who harm our citizens abroad. We will continue to pursue\njustice for Kayla and for all American victims of terrorism.\"Mueller, from\nPrescott, Arizona, was taken hostage with her boyfriend, Omar Alkhani, in\nAugust 2013 after leaving a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Aleppo, Syria,\nwhere he had been hired to fix the Internet service for the hospital. Mueller\nhad begged him to let her tag along because she wanted to do relief work in\nthe war-ravaged country. Alkhani was released after two months, having been\nbeaten.According to the FBI affidavit, Mueller was transferred in September\n2014 along with several other female captives from an Islamic State prison to\nthe Sayyafs. The couple at times handcuffed the captives, kept them in locked\nrooms, dictated orders about their activities and movements and showed them\nviolent Islamic State propaganda videos.After her capture last year, according\nto the affidavit, Umm Sayyaf admitted she was responsible for Mueller's\ncaptivity while her husband traveled for Islamic State business.The Justice\nDepartment's case echoes earlier assertions from U.S. intelligence officials,\nwho had told Mueller's family that their daughter was repeatedly forced to\nhave sex with al-Baghdadi.According to the affidavit, Umm Sayyaf said that al-\nBaghadi would occasionally stay at her home and that he \"owned\" Mueller during\nthose visits, which the FBI says was akin to slavery.A Yazidi teenager who was\nheld with Mueller and escaped in October 2014 said al-Baghdadi took Mueller as\na \"wife,\" repeatedly raping her when he visited. The 14-year-old Yazidi girl\nmade her way to Iraqi Kurdistan, where she talked to U.S. commandos in\nNovember 2014.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71cb4955d14d6f807677c" }, "content" : "  The nation’s top intelligence official confirmed Tuesday that the Islamic\nState has succeeded in making and deploying chemical agents in Iraq and Syria\n-- calling it the first such attack by an extremist group in more than two\ndecades. The confirmation of mustard gas use came during Director of National\nIntelligence James Clapper's testimony before the Senate Armed Services\nCommittee, where he spoke to the Islamic State's growing sophistication online\nand in the battlefield. He did not elaborate on where and when the chemical\nattacks occurred, though there has been mounting evidence the terror group was\nexperimenting with chemical weapons.“[The Syrian government] has used\nchemicals against the opposition on multiple occasions since Syria joined the\nChemical Weapons Convention. ISIL has also used toxic chemicals in Iraq and\nSyria, including the blister agent Sulfur mustard,” Clapper said. He said this\nmarks the first time an extremist group has produced and used a \"chemical\nwarfare agent in an attack since Aum Shinrikyo used sarin in Japan in 1995,\"\nreferring to the Tokyo subway terror attack that year. Fox News previously\nreported on ISIS' potential experimentation with chemical weapons. Photos\ntaken by the Kurds in northern Iraq last summer and reviewed by Fox News\nshowed burns and blistering on skin following exposure to “odorless,\ncolorless” agents absorbed through the clothing. A doctor who was in northern\nIraq last year said he treated Kurdish fighters whom ISIS used as \"lab rats\nfor WMD,\" adding that the variety of burns and illnesses suggested that\n\"mustard gas, precursors, as well as neurotoxic acids\" were being\ntested.Evidence has also indicated that Damascus has been using chemical\nweapons against the Syrian opposition and civilians, despite an agreement to\nreduce its stockpile two years ago. The Japan attack that Clapper referred to\nin his testimony occured in March 1995. Then, perpetrators hailing from the\ncult Aum Shinrikyo launched five coordinated Sarin gas attacks on the Toyko\nsubway, killing 12, severely injuring 50 and leaving some 1,000 people with\ntemporary vision impairment.Clapper dropped the latest revelation amid\ndiscussions of other worldwide national security threats, including North\nKorea, which he said has expanded a uranium enrichment facility and restarted\na plutonium reactor that could start recovering material for nuclear weapons\nin weeks or months.Meanwhile, Clapper told the Senate Armed Services Committee\nthat Islamic militants will continue plotting against U.S. interests overseas\nand homegrown attacks will pose the most significant threat from violent\nextremists to Americans at home. \"The perceived success of attacks by\nhomegrown violent extremists in Europe and North America, such as those in\nChattanooga and San Bernardino, might motivate others to replicate\nopportunistic attacks with little or no warning, diminishing our ability to\ndetect terrorist operational planning and readiness,\" he said.\"ISIL\ninvolvement in homeland attack activity will probably continue to involve\nthose who draw inspiration from the group's highly sophisticated media without\ndirect guidance from ISIL leadership,\" he said, using an acronym for the\nmilitant group. He also, in his prepared testimony, said ISIS has an\n\"unprecedented online proficiency.\" Clapper said that the North Korean\ngovernment announced in 2013 its intention to refurbish and restart nuclear\nfacilities, to include the uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon and its\ngraphite-moderated plutonium production reactor, which was shut down in 2007.\nHe added that U.S. intelligence had assessed that North Korea has expanded\nYongbyon and restarted the plutonium production reactor there.His testimony\nfollowed the North Koreans' recent underground test explosion and rocket\nlaunch. He said the communist nation is working to expand what is thought to\nbe a small nuclear arsenal. U.S.-based experts have estimated that North Korea\nmay have about 10 bombs, but that could grow to between 20 and 100 by\n2020.When asked, separately, if the the intelligence community suspected that\nthe Iranian government was violating its own nuclear agreement with Washington\nand its international partners, Clapper said, “no.”“We have no evidence thus\nfar that they are moving toward a violation,” he testified, adding that\nWashington is in “the distrust and verify mode” and is watching closely.On the\ncybersecurity issue, Clapper said China selectively uses cyber-attacks against\ntargets Beijing believes threaten Chinese domestic stability or regime\nlegitimacy.\"We will monitor compliance with China's September 2015 commitment\nto refrain from conducting or knowingly supporting cyber-enabled theft of\nintellectual property with the intent of providing competitive advantage to\ncompanies or commercial sectors,\" he said.  \n  \nHe also warned that Afghanistan is at \"serious risk of a political breakdown\nduring 2016.\" He said waning political cohesion, rising activities by local\npowerbrokers, financial shortfalls and sustained attacks by the Taliban are\neroding stability.Russia, meanwhile, continues to compete “to create an image\nof being co-equal with the United States,” and is “very paranoid about NATO\nand about being contained,” he said in response to a question on Russian\naggression in Syria and Ukraine. _Fox News' Catherine Herridge and The\nAssociated Press contributed to this report.___\n\n", "title" : "Top intel official confirms ISIS made, used chemical weapons | Fox News", "twitter" : { "body" : "Top intel official confirms ISIS made, used chemical weapons http://fxn.ws/1nVIkp6", "link" : "https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/697116521831632896", "retweets" : 202, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-09T01:55:05.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 118, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "697116521831632896" }, "topic" : "isis", "source" : "FoxNews", "link" : "http://fxn.ws/1nVIkp6" }

One official\ncalled him \"the key leader,\" but others could not say if he runs the entire\nchemical weapons program for ISIS.The information he provided to interrogators\nhas given the U.S. enough information to begin striking ISIS areas in Iraq\nassociated with the group's chemical weapons program. One U.S. official said\nthe goal is to locate, target and carry out strikes that will result in the\ndestruction of ISIS's entire chemical weapons enterprise -- mainly mustard\nagent ISIS produces itself.It was not immediately clear if the U.S. was able\nto strike all of the necessary targets. Intelligence and surveillance of the\ntargets had indicated in some Iraqi locations that civilians were present at\nprospective sites, officials told CNN.While the goal is to end ISIS'\ncapability to manufacture and use mustard agent, the actual targets being\nstruck include people, facilities and vehicles. The agent itself is made in\nrelatively small quantities and has a fairly short shelf life, the U.S.\ngovernment believes.RELATED: Army's Delta Force begins to target ISIS in\nIraqThe program is one the U.S. military has been tracking, with Defense\nSecretary Ash Carter saying last month the Pentagon was prepared to strike\nagainst it.\"It's something we watch very closely and it's something we take\naction against,\" Carter said in an interview that aired on PBS.Since the\nweekend, the U.S. has struck what it is calling \"improvised weapons\nfacilities\" and other targets near Mosul, Iraq, but officials would not say if\nthese were chemical weapons sites.At the request of the Pentagon, CNN\ninitially withheld publishing the detainee's connection to ISIS' chemical\nweapons program because defense officials said disclosing that would risk\nalerting ISIS to potential airstrike targets. With the chemical weapons\nprogram undisturbed, it would allow ISIS to use the weapons to strike\ncivilians, troops the U.S. supports, and possibly even U.S. troops.Officials\nwould not explain why they believed the detention itself hadn't jeopardized\nthe airstrikes, or why the U.S. military believes ISIS had not noticed the\ncaptured operative had gone missing from its ranks. However, the operative is\nsaid to have regularly moved around in Iraq, and officials said they still\nbelieve his capture was unknown to ISIS. U.S. Special Operations forces\ncaptured the operative more than three weeks ago. He has been held and\ninterrogated in Irbil, Iraq, for any information he has about the chemical\nweapons program and the location of other key ISIS personnel or weapons\nstocks. While there are other ISIS operatives involved in the program, the\nU.S. believes at this point that the captured man is crucial to understanding\nthis dangerous wing of the organization.The U.S. has long said any ISIS\noperatives captured by U.S. troops would only be held for a short time and\nthen turned over to either the Iraqis or the Kurds.RELATED: U.S. claims to\nhave killed 150 fighters from Al-Shabaab in SomaliaThe operative was captured\nin one of the first missions of the so-called Expeditionary Targeting Forces.\nIt is a group of some 200 Special Operations troops assembled in northern Iraq\nto gather intelligence and pursue ISIS operatives on the ground by either\ncapturing or killing them in Iraq, and eventually in Syria. Carter recently\nacknowledged the ETF is \"having an effect and operating.\"It's a tool that we\nintroduced as part of our -- the accelerated operations to conduct raids of\nvarious kinds, seizing places and people, freeing hostages and prisoners of\nISIL, and making it such that ISIL has to fear that anywhere, anytime, it may\nbe struck,\" he said in late February, using a different name for ISIS.The U.S.\nwent after this particular individual due to concerns about the \"skills and\nintent\" he has, one of the officials said. The mission to capture him was\nspecifically tailored to the location where he was, and was designed to allow\ntroops to be able to seize him. U.S. Special Operations forces were certain he\nwas at the location in Iraq after covertly surveying it for some days.The U.S.\nintelligence community has been tracking a number of confirmed chemical\nattacks by ISIS where powdered mustard agent was used in artillery shells, the\nofficial said. The most recent attack was a month ago.The U.S. intelligence\ncommunity has confirmed 12 cases of the use of mustard agent. Three other\ncases are suspected. They include locations in both Syria and Iraq. The\nmajority of the cases have been in Syria, some as far west as the Maraa line\nwhere fighting has raged. Other attacks have occurred across Iraq, including\nSinjar Mountain and the area around Mosul, as well as locations further south\ntowards Baghdad.However, U.S. officials are somewhat downplaying the attacks,\nsaying they believe any deaths were a result of being hit by artillery, not\nthe agent itself.Since interrogations of the detainee began, U.S. Special\nOperations forces have been using the information he has provided to begin to\nlocate targets.Under the rules of engagement, U.S. Special Operations forces\nmust have continuous surveillance of a target for a period of time to ensure\nthey know who is there and the locations of any potential nearby civilians\nbefore they strike.The U.S. has said all Special Operations missions are\ncoordinated with the Iraqi government.Vice President Joe Biden has spoken to\nIraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi twice in the last week, though White\nHouse readouts of the call did not mention the detainee.It could not\nimmediately be learned if there were Iraqi forces took part in the raid to\ncapture the man, or whether Iraqis were involved in the airstrikes.Director of\nNational Intelligence James Clapper recently hinted at the confirmation of\nchemical attacks by ISIS in congressional testimony.\"Chemical weapons continue\nto pose a threat in Syria and Iraq,\" Clapper told the House intelligence\ncommittee. \"ISIL has also used toxic chemicals in Iraq and Syria, including\nthe blister agent Sulfur Mustard. (It's) the first time an extremist group has\nproduced and used a chemical warfare agent in an attack since Aum Shinrikyo\nused sarin in Japan in 1995.\"Defense officials said this was the first public\nconfirmation by the U.S. government of mustard agent attacks.The Organization\nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons also continues to track reports of the\nuse of mustard agent and is talking with the U.S. about other possible\nattacks, U.S. officials said.Investigators will also want to know whether ISIS\nhas any plans to use chemical agents in attacks against the West. It's unclear\nwhether the captured operative has that knowledge.\n\n", "title" : "U.S.: ISIS detainee providing info on chemical weapons - CNNPolitics.com", "twitter" : { "body" : "A U.S. #ISIS detainee is providing crucial information on chemical weapons, officials say http://cnn.it/1p8F628 pic.twitter.com/jekLRFmSvY", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CNN/status/707671172402573312", "retweets" : 157, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-09T04:55:30.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 186, "hashtags" : "#ISIS", "id" : "707671172402573312" }, "topic" : "isis", "source" : "cnn", "link" : "http://cnn.it/1p8F628" }

Chris Harmer praised the aircraft's\nreactivation, telling CNN it was \"an excellent idea.\"Harmer, now the senior\nnaval analyst at the Institute for the Study of War, called the OV-10 a \"great\nplane to fly\" and said it was likely that U.S. pilots fought over who got the\nchance to fly it in combat.Harmer told CNN that the planes were a much more\ncost-effective alternative than jets like the F-15 or F-35, the latter of\nwhich is estimated to cost more than $150 million each.Using an F-35 to fly\nclose air support against insurgents would be akin to \"buying a brand new\nRolls Royce to take the garbage to the dump,\" Harmer said.Harmer estimated the\ncost of flying the more modern jets at $45,000 per hour of flight, while the\nolder Bronco could cost less than $5,000 per flight.The F-15 Eagle has a\ncruising speed of 570 mph, while the OV-10 has a cruising speed of 223 mph,\naccording to an Air Force fact sheet.While he acknowledged that the slower\nplanes were vulnerable to other modern enemy aircraft and anti-aircraft\nmissiles, he said the planes would be \"extremely effective\" in environments\nlike Iraq and Afghanistan, where the terrorists have very limited anti-\naircraft weapons.Paul Scharre, a former Army Ranger who served multiple tours\nin Iraq and Afghanistan, said these turboprop planes were the perfect middle\nground between drones and more technologically advanced jets.Scharre said that\nlike drones, the OV-10 can loiter over the battlefield for hours, but unlike\ndrones, the pilot has greater visibility of the battlefield and can see the\nlocation of enemy forces and attack them directly with machine guns and more\nbombs and missiles than a drone can carry.More modern jets travel too fast to\nsee events on the ground and become overly reliant on technology to target\nenemy combatants, he said. Additionally, these jets consume fuel at a much\nfaster rate, which means they cannot fly over the battlefield for as long as\ntheir propeller-powered counterparts.Scharre, a senior fellow at the Center\nfor a New American Security, told CNN that 15 years of counterinsurgency\nmissions had taken a toll on the technologically advanced and expensive\nAmerican fighter jet fleet, saying a jet \"can only have so many flying hours\nbefore it is worn out.\"Both Scharre and Harmer said that these light attack\naircraft would be in high demand by U.S. Special Operations forces because of\ntheir ability to provide persistent surveillance and close air support and\ntarget enemy forces up close without risking friendly fire casualties because\nthe pilots are flying slow enough to visually distinguish between enemy and\nfriendly forces.However, Harmer and Scharre think that resistance from higher-\nups in the military will hamper the drive to acquire these retro aircraft and\nthat the Air Force is too focused on the more expensive F-35 to give much\nconsideration to embracing a 50-year-old technology.READ: B-52s to take on\nISISThe Central Command representative told CNN that the results of the\ninitial experiment have been passed on to the Office of the Secretary of\nDefense Joint Requirements Oversight Council and that the information will\nhelp Pentagon \"decision makers determine if this is a valid concept that would\nbe effective in the current battlespace.\"He added, \"because the report is\nstill a draft, it would be inappropriate and premature to provide details\nregarding any findings or potential recommendations.\"\"The American way of\nfighting since World War II has been to have superior technology. There has\nbeen a constant focus on leading technological advancement that is on cutting\nedge,\" Harmer said.But Scharre is optimistic that these effective aircraft\nwill find a niche within the military, possibly with Air Forces Special\nOperations acquiring some planes to support Special Operations forces.The need\nfor close air support in the fight against ISIS also helped convince the Air\nForce to reconsider plans to retire the A-10 Warthog, a 1970s-era ground\nattack jet.READ: Defense chief says A-10s needed in ISIS fightScharre also\nthinks that these turboprop aircraft will prove ideal for equipping and arming\nU.S. partners that are fighting insurgencies and terrorists.In January, the\nUnited States also provided Afghanistan with four turboprop A-29 Super Tucano\nplanes, the Afghan air force's first fixed-wing combat aircraft.\n\n", "title" : "Decades-old OV-10 Bronco planes used against ISIS - CNNPolitics.com", "twitter" : { "body" : "A pair of nearly 50-year-old planes has been brought out of retirement to fight ISIS http://cnn.it/1QKS3Jd pic.twitter.com/TOW29BUKsE", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CNN/status/708428921549799424", "retweets" : 288, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-11T07:06:31.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 531, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "708428921549799424" }, "topic" : "isis", "source" : "cnn", "link" : "http://cnn.it/1QKS3Jd" }

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71cb4955d14d6f8076785" }, "content" : "The attacks in Paris that killed at least 129 people Friday night suggest the\nIslamic State has broadened its reach beyond the Middle East and is capable of\nexecuting devastating attacks in the West.“It suggests a major shift in the\norganization’s global strategy,” said William McCants, an analyst at Brookings\nInstitution and author of _The ISIS Apocalypse_.French President Francois\nHollande blamed the attacks on the terror group and vowed to step up military\naction against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. France has\nparticipated in the U.S.-led air campaign against the Islamic State in Iraq\nand Syria.In a statement, the Islamic State claimed responsibility for the\nmassacre, calling Paris “the capital of prostitution and obscenity” and\npledged further attacks. “This attack is the first of the storm,” the\nstatement said. The statement could not be independently verified.Previous\nattacks in the West, such as the January attacks that included an assault on\nthe satirical newspaper _Charlie Hebdo_ and left 20 people dead including\nthree attackers, appear to have been inspired by the Islamic State.What\ndistinguishes the Paris attacks is the complexity of the attack, which appears\nto have involved extensive planning and preparation and suggests they were\ndirected from the group’s central leadership. “It’s not the kind of operation\nyou would expect from a group of guys who had never traveled abroad or\nreceived training,” McCants said.Hollande said the slaughter is “an act of war\nthat was prepared, organized, planned from abroad with internal help.”The\nterror organization’s statement said the attacks were carried out by eight\nterrorists armed with assault rifles and wearing suicide vests.The attack\ncomes in the wake of at least two other recent bombings in which the Islamic\nState had reached beyond its traditional stronghold in Syria.The group claimed\nresponsibility for the downing of the Russian airliner over Sinai last month\nthat killed all 224 passengers and crew aboard.It also claimed to be behind\nbombings in Beirut on Thursday that killed 43 civilians in a neighborhood\ncontrolled by Hezbollah, a Shiite group backed by Iran. The Islamic State is a\nSunni organization that considers Shiites the enemy.“All of this coming in\nrapid succession suggests they are willing to take the fight to the enemy”\nmore globally, McCants said.“You would guess they had least one more in the\nbag,” he said. “My worry is the one more would be in the United States.”Even\nbefore the Paris attacks, analysts questioned President Obama's claim that the\nU.S. had contained the terror group. “How do you explain the expansion of the\nIslamic State into Sinai, Afghanistan and Libya,” said Michael Rubin, an\nanalyst with the American Enterprise Institute.\"I don't think they're gaining\nstrength,\" Obama said in an interview with ABC's _Good Morning America\n_broadcast Friday. \"What is true, from the start our goal has been first to\ncontain and we have contained them.\" Obama said the strategy has not yet\ndecapitated the group's command and control structure.The U.S. military\nstrategy to counter the Islamic State is centered on using local ground forces\nin Iraq and Syria backed by a U.S.-led coalition air campaign, to battle the\nmilitants. The United States has also targeted the Islamic State directly with\nairstrikes. The Pentagon said it had launched an airstrike Friday in Libya\ntargeting Abu Nabil, an Islamic State leader.The Islamic State’s rise as a\ndeadly terror group has been rapid. Its de facto capital is in Raqqa, Syria,\nbut it began to emerge as a global threat last year when it attacked Iraq,\nseizing large swaths of territory, including Mosul, Iraq’s second largest\ncity.Islamic State fighters in Raqqa, Syria, in 2014. (Photo: Uncredited,\nAP)The group has said it seeks to create a caliphate, a state ruled under\nIslamic law, across Iraq and Syria. The Islamic State has regularly\nslaughtered and abused people in lands it controls. When it drove the Yazidis,\na religious minority, from their home in northern Iraq last year, they pressed\nmany of the women and girls into sexual slavery.What has set Islamic State\napart from al-Qaeda and other terror groups is its ability to hold terrain.\nPlanning and directing large attacks far from its base in Syria would\nrepresent a new capability.The apparent shift comes as al-Qaeda has changed\nits own tactics. In 2013 al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri warned against\nindiscriminate bombings and attacks that might kill innocent Muslims or non-\ncombatants.The Islamic State’s new aspirations could be part of its\ncompetition with al-Qaeda or been part of a long-term plan, McCants said.“We\ndon’t know yet,” he said. “Maybe we won’t know for several years.”\n\n", "title" : "Paris attacks signal Islamic States's global aspirations", "twitter" : { "body" : "Paris attacks signal ISIS global aspirations http://usat.ly/1WSvc42 via @usatoday", "link" : "https://twitter.com/USATODAY/status/665584919477923840", "retweets" : 75, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-11-14T01:39:45.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "@usatoday", "favs" : 71, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "665584919477923840" }, "topic" : "isis", "source" : "usatoday", "link" : "http://usat.ly/1WSvc42" }

It stems\nIslamic State propaganda, but also takes away a venue where the intelligence\ncommunity can collect information.The FBI declined to comment on the\nactivities of the cyber vigilantes.**Terms of Service**Most social media sites\ntake down terrorist postings as soon as they become aware of them. Last year\nIslamic State supporters threatened Twitter employees with death for removing\ntheir accounts.But while Twitter, Facebook, Google and others all monitor for\nsuch material, given their sheer size it's difficult to find all such\npostings. Hactivists aid in that effort by reporting breaches of a site's\nterms of service, said White.For example Telegram, a popular instant messaging\nservice that emphasizes privacy, posted Wednesday that it had blocked 78\nIslamic State-related chat channels across 12 languages, which had been\nreported to it.Facebook said it worked aggressively to ensure there were no\nterrorists or terror groups using the site and removed any content that\npraised or supported terrorism.The site's 1.5 billion users flag content that\nis inappropriate and it has a global team responding to those reports around\nthe clock. Terrorism-related reports are prioritized for immediate review, the\ncompany said in an emailed statement.**More to come**Anonymous on Sunday\nreleased a video in French saying it would punish the Islamic State, which has\nclaimed responsibility for the attacks in Paris on Friday.Wearing the group's\ntrademark Guy Fawkes mask, an unidentified man called the terrorists \"vermin\"\nand said \"Anonymous activists from all over the world will hunt you down.\"\"So\nget ready for a massive reaction from Anonymous.

Officials said he was\nresponsible for the video last year that showed militants beheading 21\nEgyptian workers, all Coptic Christians, along the Mediterranean coast of\nLibya.Islamic State has found fertile ground in Libya, which has had no\nfunctioning central government since the North Atlantic Treaty Organization\nbombing campaign helped a popular uprising oust Moammar Kadafi in 2011.\nCompeting factions have fought a low-level civil war since 2014.Islamic State\nhas taken advantage of the power vacuum, attacking oil fields and\ninstallations, hobbling a major source of income. A U.S. intelligence estimate\nthis month concluded that group has about 5,000 fighters in Libya, double the\nofficial estimate last fall.The U.S. military, along with British, French and\nItalian special forces, has been monitoring Islamic State movements in several\nLibyan cities, including the militants' stronghold of Sirte.The White House\nhas resisted calls from some aides and Congress members to escalate the U.S.\nmilitary role to counter the potential threat, although Friday's attack\nsuggested at least a modest shift in that policy.“I think this is the\nbeginning of what will be a broader pattern of operations in the country in\nwhich the U.S. will strike, while being extremely careful about targeting,”\nAnthony Cordesman, a defense expert at the Center for Strategic and\nInternational Studies, a nonpartisan Washington think tank, said Friday.At a\nnews conference Monday after a summit with Southeast Asian leaders, President\nObama appeared to suggest U.S. raids in Libya are likely to increase.“With\nrespect to Libya, I have been clear from the outset that we will go after ISIS\nwherever it appears, the same way that we went after Al Qaeda wherever they\nappeared,” Obama said, using another name for Islamic State.“We will continue\nto take actions where we've got a clear operation and a clear target in mind,”\nhe said. “As we see opportunities to prevent ISIS from digging in, in Libya,\nwe take them.”**ALSO****Latinos seek answers from Sanders and Clinton in Las\nVegas****Manny Pacquiao posts Bible verse that states gay people should be\nkilled****Change in bullet train construction plans will delay rail line's\narrival in Southern California**\n\n", "title" : "U.S. airstrike destroys Islamic State training camp in Libya - LA Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "U.S. warplanes hit multiple ISIS targets in Libya http://lat.ms/1osoDpo", "link" : "https://twitter.com/latimes/status/700658801733672960", "retweets" : 24, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-18T20:30:50.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 15, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "700658801733672960" }, "topic" : "isis", "source" : "latimes", "link" : "http://lat.ms/1osoDpo" }

The U.S. is “taking\nthem out, day in and day out, one after another after another.”Though the\nvideo probably does not signify an ongoing plot, it could prompt an Islamic\nState supporter to target employees of the social media giants, according to\nRick “Ozzie” Nelson, a former U.S. counter-terrorism official now at the\nnonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.“I\nthink it does increase the risk to the employees of those companies,\nparticularly from a homegrown extremist,” Nelson said. “That's what concerns\nme the most.”In addition to organizing or sponsoring deadly terrorist attacks\nin Europe, Canada, the Middle East and North Africa, Islamic State and its\naffiliates have used social media to recruit followers and encourage “lone\nwolf” attacks on the United States and its allies.The married couple who shot\nand killed 14 people in San Bernardino on Dec. 2 pledged allegiance to the\nIslamic State leader that morning on Facebook, for example. But they had no\nknown contact with the group.In May, however, Islamic State claimed direct\nresponsibility for the attempted attack on a prophet Muhammad cartoon contest\nin Garland, Texas. Both gunmen were shot dead.Last fall, FBI bulletins warned\nthat Islamic State was promoting attacks against law enforcement personnel,\nmembers of the news media and the U.S. military.It urged service members to\n“review their online social media presence for any information that might\nattract the attention of violent extremists,” including home addresses.The\nlatest video, purportedly created by pro-Islamic State hackers calling\nthemselves “Sons of the Caliphate Army,” was shared on the messaging app\nTelegram and was first reported by the online media company Vocativ.“If you\nclose one account we will take 10 in return and soon your names will be erased\nafter we delete you sites, Allah willing, and will know that we say is true,”\nreads English-language text in the video.Twitter announced on Feb. 5 that it\nhad suspended more than 125,000 accounts since mid-2015 for “threatening or\npromoting terrorist acts,” mostly related to Islamic State.It's not clear how\neffective that effort has been. Islamic State supporters have been known to\nquickly replace deleted accounts with new Twitter handles.Twitter declined to\ncomment Thursday, pointing to the Feb. 5 statement that begins, “We condemn\nthe use of Twitter to promote terrorism.”Facebook, which also declined to\ncomment Thursday, has taken an aggressive approach to identifying and blocking\ncontent and users who promote terrorist groups or sympathize with Islamic\nState.Speaking Monday at a telecommunications conference in Barcelona, Spain,\nZuckerberg said his company was working with governments to prevent terrorist\nattacks. “We feel a pretty strong responsibility to help make sure that\nsociety is safe,” he said.Apple also has assisted the government in scores of\nterrorism investigations. But it is fighting a federal magistrate's order to\nwrite software so the FBI can access a locked iPhone used by one of the San\nBernardino killers.Doing so, Apple argued in a motion filed Thursday, would\ncreate “a backdoor to defeat the encryption on the iPhone, making its users'\nmost confidential and personal information vulnerable to hackers, identity\nthieves, foreign agents, and unwarranted government surveillance.”The Obama\nadministration has launched a concerted campaign to press social media\ncompanies to take bolder steps to prevent extremists from using the Internet\nto recruit fighters, inspire attacks and publish threats to U.S.\nofficials.Senior White House officials met with tech executives in San Jose on\nJan. 8 to seek their help in thwarting terrorist attacks and preventing online\nrecruitment.Secretary of State John F. Kerry met with Hollywood studio\nexecutives this month to discuss ways filmmakers could counter Islamic State's\nonline recruitment and exhortations to violence.On Wednesday, representatives\nfrom Facebook, Google, Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, Tumblr, Microsoft and\nother companies attended a three-hour meeting at the Justice Department.The\nsession was billed as the “Madison Valleywood Project” because it brought\ntogether Madison Avenue advertising firms, Silicon Valley tech companies and\nHollywood film and television studios.One panel examined Islamic State's media\nstrategy from a marketing perspective and discussed how to counter the\nextremist message, according to one attendee who spoke on condition he not be\nidentified.Federal agencies have struggled to prevent recruitment over social\nmedia, John P. Carlin, assistant attorney general for national security, told\nthe group, attendees said.The director of the National Counterterrorism\nCenter, Nick Rasmussen, said some social media platforms had taken aggressive\nsteps to take down accounts used by terrorist groups.Megan Smith, national\nchief technology officer; Jen Easterly, senior director for counter-terrorism\nat the White House; and George Selim, head of community outreach for the\nDepartment of Homeland Security, also attended.The Obama administration “is\ncommitted to taking every action possible to confront and interdict terrorist\nactivities wherever they may occur, including in cyberspace,” Justice\nDepartment spokesman Marc Raimondi said in a\nstatement._brian.bennett@latimes.com__Times staff writers Christi Parsons in\nWashington and Paresh Dave in Los Angeles contributed to this report._\n\n", "title" : "Islamic State threatens Facebook and Twitter chiefs - LA Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "ISIS posts video threatening Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter's Jack Dorsey http://lat.ms/1OxYcUo pic.twitter.com/Hih7Ygmk3l", "link" : "https://twitter.com/latimes/status/702937532582010880", "retweets" : 81, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-25T03:25:42.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 45, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "702937532582010880" }, "topic" : "isis", "source" : "latimes", "link" : "http://lat.ms/1OxYcUo" }

His call for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the\nUnited States” — a temporary measure, he says, “until we can figure out what\nthe hell is going on” — has served only to divide America, offend and inflame\nMuslims worldwide, and quite possibly drive deeper into alienation the small\nminority of disaffected Muslims who are teetering on radicalism’s edge.If we\naccept the logically straightforward premise that Trump’s pronouncements\nconstitute a form of help to ISIS, an ironic and disquieting corollary\nfollows.

He's commonly\ndescribed as a creature of the far right, given his ultra-hard-line stances on\nMexican and Muslim immigration. But polls commonly show that his strongest\nbase of support is among moderate-to-liberal Republicans. Conservative\npundits,...Let us presume that ISIS, however twisted its ideology, has at\nleast a rudimentary understanding of American politics. It wouldn’t take much\nmore than watching CNN for the terror organization’s leadership to gain a\nrough grasp of our political dynamic. What would leap off of the TV screen is\nthat in the aftermath of the attack in San Bernardino, and following Trump’s\nrelease of his proposal to ban the entry of Muslims, the tycoon's support has\nsurged. He has double the standing of his nearest rival in national polls and\nis gaining momentum. Perhaps even more significantly, they would see\ntelevision screens showing mass rallies of wildly enthusiastic Americans\ncheering Trump as he calls to exclude Muslims from American life. Such images\nare every bit as valuable to ISIS as images of American soldiers abusing\nprisoners at Abu Ghraib.Looking at the American political scene, ISIS would\nnot need a David Axelrod or a Karl Rove in its ranks to understand that well-\ntimed terror attacks in the U.S. could spur a dynamic already in motion and\nthat San Bernardino has accelerated. Although we do not really know how ISIS\ncalculates the time and locations of its operations, history can be a guide.\nAt least some Islamist terrorist attacks appear to have been launched with the\ngoal of influencing the outcome of elections in democratic societies.The most\nprominent instance is the March 11, 2004 attack on the Madrid transit system\nthree days before the Spanish national elections. Prior to the attack, the\ngovernment of Prime Minister José María Aznar, which had aligned Spain with\nthe United States in prosecuting the war in Iraq, was leading in the polls by\n5%. The Al Qaeda terror operation succeeded in killing 181 people and maiming\n1,800 more, had a demonstrable effect on public opinion. The Socialist Party,\nled by José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, who had pledged to end Spain’s\nparticipation in the war, ended up winning the election by 5%. It would not be\ndifficult for the leadership of ISIS, looking at this Al Qaeda success, to\nhave concluded that the terror attacks succeeded in swinging the electorate by\na whopping 10 percentage points.Could ISIS attempt to replicate such an\ninfluence operation in the United States? There is a high probability that the\nresources for carrying out such a strategy are already in place. The FBI says\nit has active investigations of ISIS supporters in every state, with some 900\nopen cases. And, of course, as alarming as those numbers are, they include\nonly the suspects of whom the U.S. intelligence community is aware. As is made\nplain by the husband-wife team that conducted the San Bernardino massacre,\nhomegrown jihadist cells can acquire lethal weapons and operate in the United\nStates completely beneath the radar screen. The FBI and the rest of the\nintelligence community do not know what they do not know.Looking at the United\nStates in the aftermath of San Bernardino, ISIS might well conclude than\nanother such operation — or several — in the period immediately before the\nIowa caucuses, would fuel enthusiasm for their candidate of choice. If Trump\ndoes succeed in securing the Republican nomination, they might also conclude\nthat attacks during the general election season would severely undercut\nHillary Clinton. After all, she is inextricably tied to an administration that\n— at that juncture — would have spectacularly failed to keep the country\nsecure.One can think of many reasons why such a scenario might not come to\npass, not least of which are the now redoubled efforts of the FBI to keep the\ncountry safe. But as ISIS looks at the disarray in American politics, and if\nit has the resources in place, it would have every reason to settle on a\nstrategy that aims at advancing Trump’s prospects on the American political\nstage. Even if they fail at the difficult-to-accomplish goal of making Donald\nJ. Trump the 45th president of the United States, they would have succeeded\nhandsomely in helping him spread his vile and venomous anti-Muslim propaganda.\nWin or lose, his candidacy is for them a bonanza._Gabriel Schoenfeld, a senior\nfellow at the Hudson Institute, was a senior advisor to the Mitt Romney\ncampaign in 2011 and 2012._**Follow the Opinion section on Twitter\n****@latimesopinion**** and ****Facebook**\n\n", "title" : "Donald Trump's rhetoric is helping ISIS -- and vice versa - LA Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Op-Ed: Donald Trump's rhetoric is helping ISIS -- and vice versa http://lat.ms/1T4D64r pic.twitter.com/m4xIkpWtht", "link" : "https://twitter.com/latimes/status/677655809648627714", "retweets" : 45, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-12-17T09:05:09.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 26, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "677655809648627714" }, "topic" : "isis", "source" : "latimes", "link" : "http://lat.ms/1T4D64r" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71cb4955d14d6f807678c" }, "content" : "******WASHINGTON --** The U.S. military has launched a newly aggressive campaign of cyberattacks against militants with the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, targeting the group's abilities to use social media and the Internet to recruit fighters and inspire followers, U.S. officials told The Associated Press.The surge of computer-based military operations by U.S. Cyber Command began shortly after Defense Secretary Ash Carter prodded commanders at Fort Meade, Maryland, last month to ramp up the fight against ISIS on the cyber front.U.S. officials confirmed that operations launched out of Fort Meade have focused on disrupting the group's online activities. The officials said the effort is getting underway as operators try a range of attacks to see what works and what doesn't. They declined to discuss details, other than to say that the attacks include efforts to prevent the group from distributing propaganda, videos, or other types of recruiting and messaging on social media sites such as Twitter, and across the Internet in general.Other attacks could include attempts to stop insurgents from conducting financial or logistical transactions online.Several U.S. officials spoke about the cyber campaign on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. Much of the effort is classified.Carter mentioned the operations briefly Thursday, telling a House Appropriations subcommittee only that Cyber Command is beginning to conduct operations against ISIS. He declined to say more in a public setting.The more aggressive attacks come after months of pressure from Carter, who has been frustrated with the belief that the Pentagon - and particularly Cyber Command - was losing the war in the cyber domain.Late last year Carter met with commanders, telling them they had 30 days to bring him options for how the military could use its cyberwarfare capabilities against the group's deadly insurgency across Iraq and Syria, and spreading to Libya and Afghanistan. Officials said he told commanders that beefing up cyberwarfare against ISIS was a test for them, and that they should have both the capability and the will to wage the online war.But the military cyber fight is limited by concerns within the intelligence agencies that blocking the group's Internet access could hurt intelligence gathering.Officials said Carter told commanders that he wanted creative options that would allow the U.S. to impact ISIS without diminishing the indications or warnings intelligence officers can glean about what the group is doing.On Jan. 27, Carter and Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, went to Fort Meade for an update.Officials familiar with Carter's meetings said the secretary was frustrated that as Cyber Command has grown and developed over the past several years, it was still focused on the cyberthreats from nations, such as Iran, Russia and China, rather than building a force to block the communications and propaganda campaigns of Internet-savvy insurgents.\"He was right to say they could be more forward leaning about what they could possibly do against ISIS,\" said James Lewis, a cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"You could disrupt their support networks, their business networks, their propaganda and recruitment networks.\"However, Lewis added, the U.S. needs to be careful about disrupting the Internet to insure that attacks don't also affect civilian networks or systems needed for critical infrastructure and other public necessities.U.S. officials have long been stymied by militants' ability to use the Internet as a vehicle for inspiring so-called lone wolf attackers in Western nations, radicalized after reading propaganda easily available online.\"Why should they be able to communicate? Why should they be using the Internet?\" Carter said during testimony before the defense appropriations subcommittee. \"The Internet shouldn't be used for that purpose.\"He added that the U.S. can conduct cyber operations under the legal authorities associated with the ongoing war against ISIS.The U.S. has also struggled to defeat high-tech encryption techniques used by ISIS and other groups to communicate. Experts have been working to find ways to defeat those programs.Cyber Command is relatively new. Created in 2009, it did not begin operating until October 2010.Early on, its key focus was on defending military networks, which are probed and attacked millions of times a day.

The army would argue that those fighters are with al Nusra and therefore fair game under the terms of the agreement.![Fighters from the Democratic Forces of Syria inspect weapons and ammunition that, according to them, belonged to Islamic State of Iraq and Syria fighters in al-Shadadi, Syria, Feb. 26, 2016.](http://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2016/02/27/9b21bcfa-4b51-4efc-9abf-4c55bf09d2a1/thumbnail/620x350/39006cd88278824ad96ec474319cdeb6/isis-syria-2016-02-26t215054z.jpg)\n\nFighters from the Democratic Forces of Syria inspect weapons and ammunition\nthat, according to them, belonged to Islamic State of Iraq and Syria fighters\nin al-Shadadi, Syria, Feb. 26, 2016.\n\nReuters/Rodi Said\n\nSyria's state-run news agency said armed groups fired several shells on\nresidential areas in the capital in the first breach of a cease-fire at midday\nSaturday. SANA says the shells were fired by \"terrorist groups\" entrenched in\nJobar and Douma, two opposition-held Damascus suburbs.Rebel groups said they\nhave registered numerous violations by government forces across the country\nthat could threaten the agreement.Lt. Col. Fares al-Bayoush, commander of the\n1,300-strong Fursan al-Haq Brigade, a U.S.-backed rebel faction, told The\nAssociated Press that his group and others affiliated with the mainstream Free\nSyrian Army are so far abiding by the truce.\"If they continue with these\nviolations we will be forced to retaliate accordingly,\" he said by phone from\nsouthern Turkey. He added, however, that the cease-fire has sharply reduced\ngovernment attacks across northern Syria, where his group is based.A top\nmilitary official in Moscow said Russia has grounded its warplanes in Syria to\nhelp secure the cease-fire.Lt.-Gen. Sergei Rudskoi, of the General Staff, said\nthat while Russia will continue air strikes against ISIS and al Nusra, Moscow\nis keeping its aircraft on the ground for now \"to avoid any possible\nmistakes.\"Rudskoi said that 17 opposition units have contacted the Russian\nmilitary to adhere to the truce.He said the Russian military had established\nhotlines to exchange information with the U.S. military in order to help\nmonitor the cease-fire and quickly respond to any conflict situations.The U.S.\nhas provided the Russian Defense Ministry with similar maps and its own list\nof opposition units, which have agreed to respect the cease-fire.Rudskoi said\nthat according to the U.S.-Russian agreements, a rebel unit that accidentally\ncomes under attack should contact Russian or U.S. representatives, who would\nquickly resolve the matter.A coordination center at the Hemeimeem air base in\nSyria's coastal province of Latakia, where Russian warplanes are based, has 61\nofficers who negotiate with groups willing to join the cease-fire and\ncoordinate the deliveries of humanitarian aid.According to Syrian state media,\nISIS launched two suicide attacks near the central town of Salamiyeh, one on\nan army checkpoint that killed two and wounded four. The second car bomb was\ndestroyed by Syrian troops before reaching a military post, state TV said.The\nISIS-affiliated Aamaq news agency said ISIS claimed responsibility for the\nblasts in the area, where most residents belong to the Ismaili branch of\nShiite Islam.

Tal Abyad has been\nheld by Kurdish fighters since July.Sillo and the main Kurdish militia in\nSyria, the YPG, said some of the ISIS fighters came from Turkey. The YPG\nstatement said its fighters had killed the attackers after hours of\nfighting.The Aamaq news agency reported that ISIS fighters launched a\n\"surprise attack\" on several areas in northern Raqqa province, where Tal Abyad\nis located.

Smoke rose from smoldering cars that had been lined up at the main checkpoint at the northern entrance to the city of Hillah, located about 60 miles south of Baghdad.\"The blast has completely destroyed the checkpoint and its buildings,\" Falah al-Khafaji, a senior security official in Hillah, said as he stood at the edge of the blast site. \"More than 100 cars have been damaged.\"ISIS has carried out scores of suicide bombings against security forces and the country's Shiite majority. Hillah is in the country's mainly Shiite south, far from the front lines of the war against ISIS.Among the dead were 39 civilians, while the rest were members of the security forces. The attacker struck shortly after noon when the checkpoint was crowded with dozens of cars, a police officer said. He added that up to 65 other people were wounded.A medical official confirmed the causality figures. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to release information.Iraq has seen a spike in violence in the past month, with suicide attacks claimed by ISIS killing more than 170 people. The attacks follow a string of advances by Iraqi forces backed by U.S.-led airstrikes, including in the western city of Ramadi, which was declared fully \"liberated\" by Iraqi and U.S.-led coalition officials last month.Such attacks \"force the government and the militias to look back and reallocate resources and reassess,\" said Bill Roggio, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, referring to the mainly Shiite militias fighting alongside government forces.IS still controls large swaths of Iraq and neighboring Syria and has declared an Islamic \"caliphate\" on the territory it holds. The extremist group controls Iraq's second largest city, Mosul, as well as the city of Fallujah, 40 miles west of Baghdad.At least 670 Iraqis were killed last month due to ongoing violence, of whom about two-thirds were civilians, according to U.N. figures.\n\n", "title" : "ISIS suicide bomber kills 47 near Baghdad - CBS News", "twitter" : { "body" : "ISIS suicide bomber kills at least 47 people, injures dozens near Baghdad, officials say http://cbsn.ws/1TYoW8J pic.twitter.com/dkaLzgSWhm", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/706623267176587264", "retweets" : 94, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-06T07:31:29.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 22, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "706623267176587264" }, "topic" : "isis", "source" : "CBSNews", "link" : "http://cbsn.ws/1TYoW8J" }

There are 12 reported instances of ISIS using mustard gas on the\nbattlefield.It's the first known major success of Washington's more aggressive\npolicy of pursuing the jihadis on the ground.The Obama administration launched\nthe new strategy in December, deploying a commando force to Iraq that it said\nwould be dedicated to capturing and killing ISIS leaders in clandestine\noperations, as well as generating intelligence leading to more raids.U.S.\nofficials said last week that the expeditionary team had captured an ISIS\nleader but had refused to identify him, saying only that he had been held for\ntwo or three weeks and was being questioned.The two Iraqi officials identified\nthe man to The Associated Press as Sleiman Daoud al-Afari, who worked for\nSaddam Hussein's now-dissolved Military Industrialization Authority where he\nspecialized in chemical and biological weapons. They said al-Afari, who is\nabout 50 years old, heads ISIS' recently established branch for the research\nand development of chemical weapons.He was captured in a raid near the\nnorthern Iraqi town of Tal Afar, the officials said. They would not give\nfurther details.The officials, who both have first-hand knowledge of the\nindividual and of the ISIS chemical program, spoke to the AP on condition of\nanonymity as they are not authorized to brief the media.The U.S.-led coalition\nbegan targeting ISIS' chemical weapons infrastructure with airstrikes and\nspecial operations raids over the past two months, the Iraqi intelligence\nofficials and a Western security official in Baghdad told the AP.Airstrikes\nare targeting laboratories and equipment, and further special forces raids\ntargeting chemical weapons experts are planned, the intelligence officials\nsaid. They and the Western official spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity\nbecause they were not authorized to brief the press.ISIS has been making a\ndetermined effort to develop chemical weapons, Iraqi and American officials\nhave said. It is believed to have set up a special unit for chemical weapons\nresearch, made up of Iraqi scientists from the Saddam-era weapons program as\nwell as foreign experts. Iraqi officials expressed particular worry over the\neffort because ISIS gained so much room to operate and hide chemical\nlaboratories after overrunning around a third of the country in the summer of\n2014, joined with territory they controlled in neighboring Syria.Still, its\nprogress has been limited. It is believed to have created limited amounts of\nmustard gas. Tests confirmed mustard gas was used in a town in Syria when ISIS\nwas launching attacks there in August 2015. Other unverified reports in both\nIraq and Syria accuse ISIS of using chemical agents on the battlefield.But so\nfar, experts say, the extremist group appears incapable of launching a large-\nscale chemical weapons attack, which requires not only expertise, but also the\nproper equipment, materials and a supply-chain to produce enough of the\nchemical agent to pose a significant threat.\"More than a symbolic attack seems\nto me to be beyond the grasp of ISIS,\" said Dan Kaszeta, a former U.S. Army\nchemical officer and Department of Homeland Security expert who is now a\nprivate consultant. \"Furthermore, the chemicals we are talking about are\nprincipally chlorine and sulfur mustard, both of which are actually quite poor\nweapons by modern standards.\"The United States has been leading a coalition\nwaging airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria for more than a year. The\ncampaign has been key to backing Iraqi and Kurdish forces that have slowly\nretaken significant parts of the territory the militants had seized.But after\ncoming under pressure at home for greater action against the militants, the\nObama administration moved to the tactic of stepped up commando operations on\nthe ground.Last year, U.S. special forces killed a key ISIS leader and\ncaptured his wife in a raid in Syria, but the new force in Iraq was intended\nas a more dedicated deployment. American officials have been deeply secretive\nabout the operation. Its size is unknown, though it may be fewer than 100\ntroops.\"This is a no-kidding force that will be doing important things,\" was\nabout all Defense Secretary Ash Carter would say about the force in testimony\nto the Senate Armed Services Committee in December.\n\n", "title" : "ISIS chemical weapons expert captured by U.S. commandos - CBS News", "twitter" : { "body" : "U.S. commandos capture chemical weapons expert for ISIS , @CBSDavidMartin reports http://cbsn.ws/1nwR4lj pic.twitter.com/YnfApeIj7I", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/707642279784292352", "retweets" : 53, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-09T03:00:41.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "@CBSDavidMartin", "favs" : 70, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "707642279784292352" }, "topic" : "isis", "source" : "CBSNews", "link" : "http://cbsn.ws/1nwR4lj" }

After interrogating him, U.S.\nintelligence was able to identify a building in Mosul where mustard agent was\nmanufactured and loaded into artillery shells.Video released by the British\nDefense Ministry shows a building described as an ISIS weapons factory being\ndestroyed by an airstrike last weekend.By the Pentagon's count, ISIS has\nmounted a dozen chemical weapons attacks in Iraq and Syria, a fact confirmed\nby CIA Director John Brennan in a \"60 Minutes\" interview.\"We have a number of\ninstances where ISIL has used chemical munitions on the battlefield,\" Brennan\nsaid.CBS' Scott Pelley asked Brennan if ISIS has access to chemical artillery\nshells.\"There are reports that ISIS has access to chemical precursors and\nmunitions that they can use,\" Brennan said.The day before the strike on the\nchemical weapons building, U.S. aircraft targeted a top ISIS commander, known\nby the alias Omar the Chechen, who the Pentagon considered to be the\nequivalent of the group's Secretary of Defense.U.S. intelligence was trying to\nconfirm if he was in fact killed.

Steve Warren told\nreporters Friday.Experts also say the extremist group appears incapable of\nlaunching a large-scale chemical weapons' attack, which requires not only\nexpertise, but also the proper equipment, materials and a supply-chain to\nproduce enough of the chemical agent to pose a significant threat.The\ncoalition began targeting ISIS' chemical weapons infrastructure with\nairstrikes and special operations raids two months ago, Iraqi intelligence\nofficials and a Western security official in Baghdad told the AP.Airstrikes\nare targeting laboratories and equipment, and further special forces raids\ntargeting chemical weapons experts are planned, the officials said.

The attacks were mostly carried out with homemade\nbombs placed along roads in the capital's southern and eastern neighborhoods.\nThere were no immediate claims of responsibility, but ISIS often claims\nresponsibility for bomb attacks in the Iraq capital targeting civilians.As the\ngroup has endured territorial losses in Iraq -- most recently the city of\nRamadi which was declared \"fully liberated\" by Iraqi and U.S. officials last\nmonth -- they have stepped up insurgent style attacks in Baghdad and other\nareas far from the front lines.Hamish De Bretton Gordon, a former British army\nofficer and chemical weapons expert, says the use of chemical weapons by ISIS\nalso appears to be linked to losses on the battlefield.\"As they get more and\nmore pushed, we're seeing them use it more and more often,\" he said. \"They are\ntrying to prevent defeat.\"The mustard agent that ISIS is using is not very\ntoxic, Gordon says, but \"it has a huge physiological impact that far outweighs\nits physical impacts.\"Fatima's father Wais said he was planning to return to\nthe frontline with ISIS as soon as possible. \"Now I will fight Daesh more than\nbefore, for Fatima.\"\n\n", "title" : "​Iraqi officials: ISIS chemical weapons attacks kill child, wound 600 - CBS News", "twitter" : { "body" : "Iraqi officials: ISIS chemical weapon attack kills child, leaves hundreds burned, wounded http://cbsn.ws/22bXrdo pic.twitter.com/iDnNrYi8YA", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/708776963041792001", "retweets" : 127, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-12T06:09:31.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 58, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "708776963041792001" }, "topic" : "isis", "source" : "CBSNews", "link" : "http://cbsn.ws/22bXrdo" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71cb4955d14d6f8076791" }, "content" : "DOHUK, Iraq — Locked inside a room where the only furniture was a bed, the 16\n-year-old learned to fear the sunset, because nightfall started the countdown\nto her next rape.During the year she was held by the Islamic State, she spent\nher days dreading the smell of the ISIS fighter’s breath, the disgusting\nsounds he made and the pain he inflicted on her body. More than anything, she\nwas tormented by the thought she might become pregnant with her rapist’s\nchild.It was the one thing she needn’t have worried about.Soon after buying\nher, the fighter brought the teenage girl a round box containing four strips\nof pills, one of them colored red.“Every day, I had to swallow one in front of\nhim. He gave me one box per month. When I ran out, he replaced it. When I was\nsold from one man to another, the box of pills came with me,” explained the\ngirl, who learned only months later that she was being given birth control.It\nis a particularly modern solution to a medieval injunction: According to an\nobscure ruling in Islamic law cited by the Islamic State, a man must ensure\nthat the woman he enslaves is free of child before having intercourse with\nher.Islamic State leaders have made sexual slavery as they believe it was\npracticed during the Prophet Muhammad’s time integral to the group’s\noperations, preying on the women and girls the group captured from the Yazidi\nreligious minority almost two years ago. To keep the sex trade running, the\nfighters have aggressively pushed birth control on their victims so they can\ncontinue the abuse unabated while the women are passed among them.More than\nthree dozen Yazidi women who recently escaped the Islamic State and who agreed\nto be interviewed for this article described the numerous methods the fighters\nused to avoid pregnancy, including oral and injectable contraception, and\nsometimes both. In at least one case, a woman was forced to have an abortion\nin order to make her available for sex, and others were pressured to do\nso.Some described how they knew they were about to be sold when they were\ndriven to a hospital to give a urine sample to be tested for the hCG hormone,\nwhose presence indicates pregnancy. They awaited their results with\napprehension: A positive test would mean they were carrying their abuser’s\nchild; a negative result would allow Islamic State fighters to continue raping\nthem.The rules have not been universally followed, with many women describing\nbeing assaulted by men who were either ignorant of the injunction or defiant\nof it. But over all, the methodical use of birth control during at least some\nof the women’s captivity explains what doctors caring for recent escapees\nobserved: Of the more than 700 rape victims from the Yazidi ethnic group who\nhave sought treatment so far at a United Nations-backed clinic in northern\nIraq, just 5 percent became pregnant during their enslavement, according to\nDr. Nagham Nawzat, the gynecologist carrying out the examinations.It is a\nstunningly low figure given that the normal fertility rate for a young woman\nis between 20 percent and 25 percent in any given month, four to five times\nthe rate that has been recorded so far, said Dr. Nezar Ismet Taib, who heads\nthe Ministry of Health Directorate in Dohuk, which oversees the clinic where\nthe victims are being treated.“We were expecting something much higher,” he\nsaid.The captured teenage girl, who agreed to be identified by her first\ninitial, M., has the demeanor of a child and wears her hair in a bouncy\nponytail. She was sold a total of seven times. When prospective buyers came to\ninquire about her, she overheard them asking for assurances that she was not\npregnant, and her owner provided the box of birth control as proof.That was\nnot enough for the third man who bought her, she said. He quizzed her on the\ndate of her last menstrual cycle and, unnerved by what he perceived as a\ndelay, gave her a version of the so-called morning-after pill, causing her to\nstart bleeding.Even then, he seemed unsatisfied.Finally he came into her room,\nclosed the door and ordered her to lower her pants. The teenager feared she\nwas about to be raped. Instead he pulled out a syringe and gave her a shot on\nher upper thigh. It was a 150-milligram dose of Depo-Provera, an injectable\ncontraceptive, a box of which she showed to a reporter.“To make sure you don’t\nget pregnant,” she recalled him saying.When he had finished, he pushed her\nback onto the bed and raped her for the first time.Thousands of women and\ngirls from the Yazidi minority remain captives of the Islamic State, after the\njihadists overran their ancestral homeland on Mount Sinjar on Aug. 3, 2014. In\nthe months since then, hundreds have managed to escape, returning to a\ncommunity now living in tents in the plains of the yellow massif, hours from\ntheir former homes.Many of the women interviewed for this article were\ninitially reached through Yazidi community leaders, and gave their consent.\nAll the underage rape victims who agreed to speak were interviewed alongside\nmembers of their family.In its official publications, the Islamic State has\nstated that it is legal for a man to rape the women he enslaves under just\nabout any circumstance. Even sex with a child is permissible, according to a\npamphlet published by the group. The injunction against raping a pregnant\nslave is functionally the only protection for the captured women.The Islamic\nState cites centuries-old rulings stating that the owner of a female slave can\nhave sex with her only after she has undergone istibra’ — “the process of\nensuring that the womb is empty,” according to the Princeton University\nprofessor Bernard Haykel, one of several experts on Islamic law consulted on\nthe topic. The purpose of this is to guarantee there is no confusion over a\nchild’s paternity.Most of the Sunni scholars who ruled on the issue argued\nthat the requirement could be met by respecting a period of sexual abstinence\nwhenever the captive changes hands, proposing a duration of at least one\nmenstrual cycle, according to Brill’s Encyclopedia of Islam.In its own manual,\nthe Islamic State outlines the abstinence method as one option. But it also\nquotes the minority opinion of a Tunisian cleric who in the 1100s argued that\nit was enough to fulfill merely the spirit of the law. That opens the way for\nother means, including modern medicine, to circumvent the waiting period.A\ntotal of 37 women abducted by the Islamic State who agreed to be interviewed\nover three trips to northern Iraq described an uneven system: Some fighters\ninsisted on double and even triple forms of contraception, while others\nviolated the guidelines entirely. Although it remains unclear why some hewed\nclosely to the regulations while others flouted them, one emerging pattern was\nthat women held by senior commanders were more likely to be given\ncontraception, in contrast to those held by junior fighters, who perhaps were\nless versed on the rules.J., an 18-year-old, said she had been sold to the\nIslamic State’s governor of Tal Afar, a city in northern Iraq. “Each month, he\nmade me get a shot. It was his assistant who took me to the hospital,” said\nJ., who was interviewed alongside her mother, after escaping this year.“On top\nof that he also gave me birth control pills. He told me, ‘We don’t want you to\nget pregnant,’” she said.When she was sold to a more junior fighter in the\nSyrian city of Tal Barak, it was the man’s mother who escorted her to the\nhospital.“She told me, ‘If you are pregnant, we are going to send you back,’”\nJ. said. “They took me into the lab. There were machines that looked like\ncentrifuges and other contraptions. They drew three vials of my blood. About\n30 or 40 minutes later, they came back to say I wasn’t pregnant.”The fighter’s\nmother triumphantly told her son that the 18-year-old was not pregnant,\nvalidating his right to rape her, which he did repeatedly.When that fighter\ntired of her, he gave her as a gift to his brother. Yet the brother did not\ntake her back to have another blood test, forcing her to have sex without\nascertaining whether she was carrying another man’s child. Several other women\nreported a similar set of circumstances, including being given birth control\nby some of their owners but not by others.However, the low pregnancy rate, say\nmedical professionals, is evidence that the rules intended to avoid pregnancy\nwere more likely to have been applied than not.In his office in Dohuk’s\nMinistry of Health Directorate, Dr. Taib, the physician tasked with overseeing\nthe treatment of the hundreds of victims, was initially puzzled by the low\npregnancy rate.In other conflicts where rape has been used as a weapon of war,\nit has led to waves of unwanted pregnancies — either because the attackers did\nnot use birth control or, as was the case in the former Yugoslavia, because\nthey purposefully tried to impregnate their victims. One medical study of 68\nCroatian and Bosnian rape victims found that 29 had become pregnant.With more\nthan 700 cases of rape recorded so far, Dr. Taib’s center has treated only 35\npregnancies. He expected to see at least 140. “Even higher than that, if you\nconsider that these women had multiple partners and were raped every day over\nmany months,” Dr. Taib said.“I concluded that either they did an abortion\nbefore they came back or they used contraception. And if there were abortions,\nthen there would have been physical signs,” which would have been noted by the\ngynecologist treating the returnees, he said. “There were no signs.”The\nprohibition surrounding pregnancy is perhaps the only instance when the codes\nthat the jihadists were applying lined up with the concerns of their victims,\nwho dreaded carrying their rapists’ children.Ahlam, a middle-aged woman who\nwas kidnapped with her six children, said she had been not raped because she\nhad been deemed unattractive. Because she spoke Arabic, the Islamic State used\nher as an interpreter.One day, she was asked to chaperone a group of young\nYazidi women to the hospital in Tal Afar, where each woman was given 150\nmilligrams of Depo-Provera.Over the months that followed, she said, she\nescorted in all around 30 victims to get the injection both in Tal Afar and\nlater in the Iraqi city of Mosul. Twice she was asked to escort her own\nteenage daughter, who was raped by multiple fighters.She explained the\nconflicted feelings she had at the time. “ISIS took our girls as slaves, only\nfor sex,” Ahlam said, but the insistence on birth control brought some relief.\n“No one wants to carry the child of their enemy.”Others described how the\nfighters so opposed pregnancy that some tried to force young women to\nabort.Abdal Ali said his sister, 20, was in her second trimester at the time\nof her capture in 2014. Still, one commander so urgently wanted her as his\nslave that he tried to end the pregnancy by giving her pills that would cause\nher to miscarry.“She hid them under her tongue, and then when they weren’t\nlooking, she spit them out,” said Mr. Ali, who related the story on behalf of\nhis sister because she is undergoing medical treatment abroad for the injuries\nshe suffered. “They wanted to get rid of the child so that they could use the\nwoman.”A 20-year-old who asked to be identified only as H. began to feel\nnauseated soon after her abduction. “The smell of rice made me gag,” she\nsaid.Already pregnant at the time of her capture, she considered herself one\nof the fortunate ones. For almost two months, H. was moved from location to\nlocation and held in locked rooms, but she was spared the abuse that was by\nthen befalling most of the young women held alongside her.Despite being\nrepeatedly forced to give a urine sample and always testing positive, she,\ntoo, was eventually picked.Her owner took her to a house, shared by another\ncouple. When the couple was present, he did not approach her, suggesting he\nknew it was illegal. Only when the couple left did he forcibly have sex with\nher, and when he did he appeared drugged.“I was telling him: ‘I’m pregnant. In\nyour book it says that you can’t do this.’ He had bloodshot eyes. He acted\nlike he was high,” she said.Eventually he drove her to a hospital with the aim\nof making her have an abortion, and flew into a rage when she refused the\nsurgery, repeatedly punching her in the stomach. Even so, his behavior\nsuggested he was ashamed: He never told the doctors that he wanted H. to\nabort, instead imploring her to ask for the procedure herself.When he drove\nher home, she waited until he left and then threw herself over the property’s\nwall. “My knees were bleeding. I was dizzy. I almost couldn’t walk,” she\nsaid.Weeks later, with the help of smugglers hired by her family, she was\nspirited out of Islamic State territory. Her belly was sticking so far out\nthat she could no longer see her toes when she finally crossed to safety.Her\nfirst child, a healthy baby boy, was born two months later.\n\n", "title" : "To Maintain Supply of Sex Slaves, ISIS Pushes Birth Control - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "ISIS 's slave industry is built on birth control for its victims http://nyti.ms/24WHQRg pic.twitter.com/GrCLR1Ka2d", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/708677691109728256", "retweets" : 312, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-11T23:35:02.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 241, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "708677691109728256" }, "topic" : "isis", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/24WHQRg" }

More than anything, she\nwas tormented by the thought she might become pregnant with her rapist’s\nchild.It was the one thing she needn’t have worried about.Soon after buying\nher, the fighter brought the teenage girl a round box containing four strips\nof pills, one of them colored red.“Every day, I had to swallow one in front of\nhim. He gave me one box per month. When I ran out, he replaced it. When I was\nsold from one man to another, the box of pills came with me,” explained the\ngirl, who learned only months later that she was being given birth control.It\nis a particularly modern solution to a medieval injunction: According to an\nobscure ruling in Islamic law cited by the Islamic State, a man must ensure\nthat the woman he enslaves is free of child before having intercourse with\nher.Islamic State leaders have made sexual slavery as they believe it was\npracticed during the Prophet Muhammad’s time integral to the group’s\noperations, preying on the women and girls the group captured from the Yazidi\nreligious minority almost two years ago. To keep the sex trade running, the\nfighters have aggressively pushed birth control on their victims so they can\ncontinue the abuse unabated while the women are passed among them.More than\nthree dozen Yazidi women who recently escaped the Islamic State and who agreed\nto be interviewed for this article described the numerous methods the fighters\nused to avoid pregnancy, including oral and injectable contraception, and\nsometimes both. In at least one case, a woman was forced to have an abortion\nin order to make her available for sex, and others were pressured to do\nso.Some described how they knew they were about to be sold when they were\ndriven to a hospital to give a urine sample to be tested for the hCG hormone,\nwhose presence indicates pregnancy. They awaited their results with\napprehension: A positive test would mean they were carrying their abuser’s\nchild; a negative result would allow Islamic State fighters to continue raping\nthem.The rules have not been universally followed, with many women describing\nbeing assaulted by men who were either ignorant of the injunction or defiant\nof it. But over all, the methodical use of birth control during at least some\nof the women’s captivity explains what doctors caring for recent escapees\nobserved: Of the more than 700 rape victims from the Yazidi ethnic group who\nhave sought treatment so far at a United Nations-backed clinic in northern\nIraq, just 5 percent became pregnant during their enslavement, according to\nDr. Nagham Nawzat, the gynecologist carrying out the examinations.It is a\nstunningly low figure given that the normal fertility rate for a young woman\nis between 20 percent and 25 percent in any given month, four to five times\nthe rate that has been recorded so far, said Dr. Nezar Ismet Taib, who heads\nthe Ministry of Health Directorate in Dohuk, which oversees the clinic where\nthe victims are being treated.“We were expecting something much higher,” he\nsaid.The captured teenage girl, who agreed to be identified by her first\ninitial, M., has the demeanor of a child and wears her hair in a bouncy\nponytail. She was sold a total of seven times. When prospective buyers came to\ninquire about her, she overheard them asking for assurances that she was not\npregnant, and her owner provided the box of birth control as proof.That was\nnot enough for the third man who bought her, she said. He quizzed her on the\ndate of her last menstrual cycle and, unnerved by what he perceived as a\ndelay, gave her a version of the so-called morning-after pill, causing her to\nstart bleeding.Even then, he seemed unsatisfied.Finally he came into her room,\nclosed the door and ordered her to lower her pants. The teenager feared she\nwas about to be raped. Instead he pulled out a syringe and gave her a shot on\nher upper thigh. It was a 150-milligram dose of Depo-Provera, an injectable\ncontraceptive, a box of which she showed to a reporter.“To make sure you don’t\nget pregnant,” she recalled him saying.When he had finished, he pushed her\nback onto the bed and raped her for the first time.Thousands of women and\ngirls from the Yazidi minority remain captives of the Islamic State, after the\njihadists overran their ancestral homeland on Mount Sinjar on Aug. 3, 2014. In\nthe months since then, hundreds have managed to escape, returning to a\ncommunity now living in tents in the plains of the yellow massif, hours from\ntheir former homes.Many of the women interviewed for this article were\ninitially reached through Yazidi community leaders, and gave their consent.\nAll the underage rape victims who agreed to speak were interviewed alongside\nmembers of their family.In its official publications, the Islamic State has\nstated that it is legal for a man to rape the women he enslaves under just\nabout any circumstance. Even sex with a child is permissible, according to a\npamphlet published by the group. The injunction against raping a pregnant\nslave is functionally the only protection for the captured women.The Islamic\nState cites centuries-old rulings stating that the owner of a female slave can\nhave sex with her only after she has undergone istibra’ — “the process of\nensuring that the womb is empty,” according to the Princeton University\nprofessor Bernard Haykel, one of several experts on Islamic law consulted on\nthe topic. The purpose of this is to guarantee there is no confusion over a\nchild’s paternity.Most of the Sunni scholars who ruled on the issue argued\nthat the requirement could be met by respecting a period of sexual abstinence\nwhenever the captive changes hands, proposing a duration of at least one\nmenstrual cycle, according to Brill’s Encyclopedia of Islam.In its own manual,\nthe Islamic State outlines the abstinence method as one option. But it also\nquotes the minority opinion of a Tunisian cleric who in the 1100s argued that\nit was enough to fulfill merely the spirit of the law. That opens the way for\nother means, including modern medicine, to circumvent the waiting period.A\ntotal of 37 women abducted by the Islamic State who agreed to be interviewed\nover three trips to northern Iraq described an uneven system: Some fighters\ninsisted on double and even triple forms of contraception, while others\nviolated the guidelines entirely. Although it remains unclear why some hewed\nclosely to the regulations while others flouted them, one emerging pattern was\nthat women held by senior commanders were more likely to be given\ncontraception, in contrast to those held by junior fighters, who perhaps were\nless versed on the rules.J., an 18-year-old, said she had been sold to the\nIslamic State’s governor of Tal Afar, a city in northern Iraq. “Each month, he\nmade me get a shot. It was his assistant who took me to the hospital,” said\nJ., who was interviewed alongside her mother, after escaping this year.“On top\nof that he also gave me birth control pills. He told me, ‘We don’t want you to\nget pregnant,’” she said.When she was sold to a more junior fighter in the\nSyrian city of Tal Barak, it was the man’s mother who escorted her to the\nhospital.“She told me, ‘If you are pregnant, we are going to send you back,’”\nJ. said. “They took me into the lab. There were machines that looked like\ncentrifuges and other contraptions. They drew three vials of my blood. About\n30 or 40 minutes later, they came back to say I wasn’t pregnant.”The fighter’s\nmother triumphantly told her son that the 18-year-old was not pregnant,\nvalidating his right to rape her, which he did repeatedly.When that fighter\ntired of her, he gave her as a gift to his brother. Yet the brother did not\ntake her back to have another blood test, forcing her to have sex without\nascertaining whether she was carrying another man’s child.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71cb4955d14d6f8076794" }, "content" : "DOHUK, Iraq — Locked inside a room where the only furniture was a bed, the 16\n-year-old learned to fear the sunset, because nightfall started the countdown\nto her next rape.During the year she was held by the Islamic State, she spent\nher days dreading the smell of the ISIS fighter’s breath, the disgusting\nsounds he made and the pain he inflicted on her body. More than anything, she\nwas tormented by the thought she might become pregnant with her rapist’s\nchild.It was the one thing she needn’t have worried about.Soon after buying\nher, the fighter brought the teenage girl a round box containing four strips\nof pills, one of them colored red.“Every day, I had to swallow one in front of\nhim. He gave me one box per month. When I ran out, he replaced it. When I was\nsold from one man to another, the box of pills came with me,” explained the\ngirl, who learned only months later that she was being given birth control.It\nis a particularly modern solution to a medieval injunction: According to an\nobscure ruling in Islamic law cited by the Islamic State, a man must ensure\nthat the woman he enslaves is free of child before having intercourse with\nher.Islamic State leaders have made sexual slavery as they believe it was\npracticed during the Prophet Muhammad’s time integral to the group’s\noperations, preying on the women and girls the group captured from the Yazidi\nreligious minority almost two years ago. To keep the sex trade running, the\nfighters have aggressively pushed birth control on their victims so they can\ncontinue the abuse unabated while the women are passed among them.More than\nthree dozen Yazidi women who recently escaped the Islamic State and who agreed\nto be interviewed for this article described the numerous methods the fighters\nused to avoid pregnancy, including oral and injectable contraception, and\nsometimes both. In at least one case, a woman was forced to have an abortion\nin order to make her available for sex, and others were pressured to do\nso.Some described how they knew they were about to be sold when they were\ndriven to a hospital to give a urine sample to be tested for the hCG hormone,\nwhose presence indicates pregnancy. They awaited their results with\napprehension: A positive test would mean they were carrying their abuser’s\nchild; a negative result would allow Islamic State fighters to continue raping\nthem.The rules have not been universally followed, with many women describing\nbeing assaulted by men who were either ignorant of the injunction or defiant\nof it. But over all, the methodical use of birth control during at least some\nof the women’s captivity explains what doctors caring for recent escapees\nobserved: Of the more than 700 rape victims from the Yazidi ethnic group who\nhave sought treatment so far at a United Nations-backed clinic in northern\nIraq, just 5 percent became pregnant during their enslavement, according to\nDr. Nagham Nawzat, the gynecologist carrying out the examinations.It is a\nstunningly low figure given that the normal fertility rate for a young woman\nis between 20 percent and 25 percent in any given month, four to five times\nthe rate that has been recorded so far, said Dr. Nezar Ismet Taib, who heads\nthe Ministry of Health Directorate in Dohuk, which oversees the clinic where\nthe victims are being treated.“We were expecting something much higher,” he\nsaid.The captured teenage girl, who agreed to be identified by her first\ninitial, M., has the demeanor of a child and wears her hair in a bouncy\nponytail. She was sold a total of seven times. When prospective buyers came to\ninquire about her, she overheard them asking for assurances that she was not\npregnant, and her owner provided the box of birth control as proof.That was\nnot enough for the third man who bought her, she said. He quizzed her on the\ndate of her last menstrual cycle and, unnerved by what he perceived as a\ndelay, gave her a version of the so-called morning-after pill, causing her to\nstart bleeding.Even then, he seemed unsatisfied.Finally he came into her room,\nclosed the door and ordered her to lower her pants. The teenager feared she\nwas about to be raped. Instead he pulled out a syringe and gave her a shot on\nher upper thigh. It was a 150-milligram dose of Depo-Provera, an injectable\ncontraceptive, a box of which she showed to a reporter.“To make sure you don’t\nget pregnant,” she recalled him saying.When he had finished, he pushed her\nback onto the bed and raped her for the first time.Thousands of women and\ngirls from the Yazidi minority remain captives of the Islamic State, after the\njihadists overran their ancestral homeland on Mount Sinjar on Aug. 3, 2014. In\nthe months since then, hundreds have managed to escape, returning to a\ncommunity now living in tents in the plains of the yellow massif, hours from\ntheir former homes.Many of the women interviewed for this article were\ninitially reached through Yazidi community leaders, and gave their consent.\nAll the underage rape victims who agreed to speak were interviewed alongside\nmembers of their family.In its official publications, the Islamic State has\nstated that it is legal for a man to rape the women he enslaves under just\nabout any circumstance. Even sex with a child is permissible, according to a\npamphlet published by the group. The injunction against raping a pregnant\nslave is functionally the only protection for the captured women.The Islamic\nState cites centuries-old rulings stating that the owner of a female slave can\nhave sex with her only after she has undergone istibra’ — “the process of\nensuring that the womb is empty,” according to the Princeton University\nprofessor Bernard Haykel, one of several experts on Islamic law consulted on\nthe topic. The purpose of this is to guarantee there is no confusion over a\nchild’s paternity.Most of the Sunni scholars who ruled on the issue argued\nthat the requirement could be met by respecting a period of sexual abstinence\nwhenever the captive changes hands, proposing a duration of at least one\nmenstrual cycle, according to Brill’s Encyclopedia of Islam.In its own manual,\nthe Islamic State outlines the abstinence method as one option. But it also\nquotes the minority opinion of a Tunisian cleric who in the 1100s argued that\nit was enough to fulfill merely the spirit of the law. That opens the way for\nother means, including modern medicine, to circumvent the waiting period.A\ntotal of 37 women abducted by the Islamic State who agreed to be interviewed\nover three trips to northern Iraq described an uneven system: Some fighters\ninsisted on double and even triple forms of contraception, while others\nviolated the guidelines entirely. Although it remains unclear why some hewed\nclosely to the regulations while others flouted them, one emerging pattern was\nthat women held by senior commanders were more likely to be given\ncontraception, in contrast to those held by junior fighters, who perhaps were\nless versed on the rules.J., an 18-year-old, said she had been sold to the\nIslamic State’s governor of Tal Afar, a city in northern Iraq. “Each month, he\nmade me get a shot. It was his assistant who took me to the hospital,” said\nJ., who was interviewed alongside her mother, after escaping this year.“On top\nof that he also gave me birth control pills. He told me, ‘We don’t want you to\nget pregnant,’” she said.When she was sold to a more junior fighter in the\nSyrian city of Tal Barak, it was the man’s mother who escorted her to the\nhospital.“She told me, ‘If you are pregnant, we are going to send you back,’”\nJ. said. “They took me into the lab. There were machines that looked like\ncentrifuges and other contraptions. They drew three vials of my blood. About\n30 or 40 minutes later, they came back to say I wasn’t pregnant.”The fighter’s\nmother triumphantly told her son that the 18-year-old was not pregnant,\nvalidating his right to rape her, which he did repeatedly.When that fighter\ntired of her, he gave her as a gift to his brother. Yet the brother did not\ntake her back to have another blood test, forcing her to have sex without\nascertaining whether she was carrying another man’s child. Several other women\nreported a similar set of circumstances, including being given birth control\nby some of their owners but not by others.However, the low pregnancy rate, say\nmedical professionals, is evidence that the rules intended to avoid pregnancy\nwere more likely to have been applied than not.In his office in Dohuk’s\nMinistry of Health Directorate, Dr. Taib, the physician tasked with overseeing\nthe treatment of the hundreds of victims, was initially puzzled by the low\npregnancy rate.In other conflicts where rape has been used as a weapon of war,\nit has led to waves of unwanted pregnancies — either because the attackers did\nnot use birth control or, as was the case in the former Yugoslavia, because\nthey purposefully tried to impregnate their victims. One medical study of 68\nCroatian and Bosnian rape victims found that 29 had become pregnant.With more\nthan 700 cases of rape recorded so far, Dr. Taib’s center has treated only 35\npregnancies. He expected to see at least 140. “Even higher than that, if you\nconsider that these women had multiple partners and were raped every day over\nmany months,” Dr. Taib said.“I concluded that either they did an abortion\nbefore they came back or they used contraception. And if there were abortions,\nthen there would have been physical signs,” which would have been noted by the\ngynecologist treating the returnees, he said. “There were no signs.”The\nprohibition surrounding pregnancy is perhaps the only instance when the codes\nthat the jihadists were applying lined up with the concerns of their victims,\nwho dreaded carrying their rapists’ children.Ahlam, a middle-aged woman who\nwas kidnapped with her six children, said she had been not raped because she\nhad been deemed unattractive. Because she spoke Arabic, the Islamic State used\nher as an interpreter.One day, she was asked to chaperone a group of young\nYazidi women to the hospital in Tal Afar, where each woman was given 150\nmilligrams of Depo-Provera.Over the months that followed, she said, she\nescorted in all around 30 victims to get the injection both in Tal Afar and\nlater in the Iraqi city of Mosul. Twice she was asked to escort her own\nteenage daughter, who was raped by multiple fighters.She explained the\nconflicted feelings she had at the time. “ISIS took our girls as slaves, only\nfor sex,” Ahlam said, but the insistence on birth control brought some relief.\n“No one wants to carry the child of their enemy.”Others described how the\nfighters so opposed pregnancy that some tried to force young women to\nabort.Abdal Ali said his sister, 20, was in her second trimester at the time\nof her capture in 2014. Still, one commander so urgently wanted her as his\nslave that he tried to end the pregnancy by giving her pills that would cause\nher to miscarry.“She hid them under her tongue, and then when they weren’t\nlooking, she spit them out,” said Mr. Ali, who related the story on behalf of\nhis sister because she is undergoing medical treatment abroad for the injuries\nshe suffered. “They wanted to get rid of the child so that they could use the\nwoman.”A 20-year-old who asked to be identified only as H. began to feel\nnauseated soon after her abduction. “The smell of rice made me gag,” she\nsaid.Already pregnant at the time of her capture, she considered herself one\nof the fortunate ones. For almost two months, H. was moved from location to\nlocation and held in locked rooms, but she was spared the abuse that was by\nthen befalling most of the young women held alongside her.Despite being\nrepeatedly forced to give a urine sample and always testing positive, she,\ntoo, was eventually picked.Her owner took her to a house, shared by another\ncouple. When the couple was present, he did not approach her, suggesting he\nknew it was illegal. Only when the couple left did he forcibly have sex with\nher, and when he did he appeared drugged.“I was telling him: ‘I’m pregnant. In\nyour book it says that you can’t do this.’ He had bloodshot eyes. He acted\nlike he was high,” she said.Eventually he drove her to a hospital with the aim\nof making her have an abortion, and flew into a rage when she refused the\nsurgery, repeatedly punching her in the stomach. Even so, his behavior\nsuggested he was ashamed: He never told the doctors that he wanted H. to\nabort, instead imploring her to ask for the procedure herself.When he drove\nher home, she waited until he left and then threw herself over the property’s\nwall. “My knees were bleeding. I was dizzy. I almost couldn’t walk,” she\nsaid.Weeks later, with the help of smugglers hired by her family, she was\nspirited out of Islamic State territory. Her belly was sticking so far out\nthat she could no longer see her toes when she finally crossed to safety.Her\nfirst child, a healthy baby boy, was born two months later.\n\n", "title" : "To Maintain Supply of Sex Slaves, ISIS Pushes Birth Control - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "ISIS fighters use birth control so they can rape the women passed among them http://nyti.ms/1Reks7s", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/708828187061575681", "retweets" : 302, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-12T09:33:03.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 160, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "708828187061575681" }, "topic" : "isis", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1Reks7s" }

He said\nthat process was crucial to prevent it from sliding into the hands of the\nIslamic State.“We’re still not at the victory that we want to achieve and will\nachieve in either Syria or Iraq, and we have seen Daesh playing a game of\nmetastasizing out to other countries, particularly Libya,” he said as the\nmeetings began. “The last thing in the world you want is a false caliphate\nwith access to billions of dollars of oil revenue.”Mr. Kerry said that the\ncoalition’s gains in pushing back the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria were\n“undeniable,” but that its members had to do more to sustain the success. On\nTuesday, some countries were asked to provide additional training, medical\nsupplies or other services for Iraqis, while Norway agreed to help clear mines\nfrom liberated areas of Iraq, including Ramadi, where the Islamic State left\nbehind explosives and booby-trapped buildings.At a conference in London on\nThursday, Mr. Kerry said, the United States and other nations will announce\nadditional humanitarian aid for Syria, where he said 13.5 million people,\nincluding six million children, were in urgent need. Next week in Munich,\ndiplomats will discuss “additional contributions” that can be made by a group\nof nations pushing for a resolution of Syria’s civil war, he said. And defense\nministers of the coalition countries will assemble for the first time next\nweek in Brussels to talk about expanding the military offensive against the\nIslamic State.“We are committed to using every resource at our disposal in\norder to remain on the offensive on every front,” Mr. Kerry said.He described\na United Nations-led effort unfolding in Geneva to bring about a political\nsolution to the Syrian conflict as a vital piece of that process, calling\nPresident Bashar al-Assad “a magnet for terrorism” and accusing his government\nof war crimes for preventing humanitarian relief efforts to reach starving\nSyrians.“Starvation as a tactic of war is against the laws of war, and it is\nbeing used every single day as a tactic by the Assad regime,” Mr. Kerry said\nat the start of the gathering. He said there was an urgent need for the talks\nin Geneva to deliver a cease-fire, immediate humanitarian assistance and\nprotection for civilians at risk from daily airstrikes.“It would help\nenormously if those who say they are there to fight Daesh fight Daesh,” Mr.\nKerry said later, apparently referring to Russian forces that have carried out\nairstrikes far from the Islamic State’s strongholds, in areas dominated by\nanti-Assad rebels.His remarks came amid reports of a government drive in\nnorthern Syria that threatened supply lines from Turkey to rebel forces in and\naround the Syrian city of Aleppo. The new offensive, backed by heavy Russian\nairstrikes, threatened to render meaningless the Geneva talks.\n\n", "title" : "Anti-ISIS Coalition to Intensify Efforts, John Kerry Says - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "John Kerry Urges Coalition to Address Growing ISIS Threat in Libya http://nyti.ms/1QWIZCs", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/694477606784233472", "retweets" : 95, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-01T19:08:58.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 88, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "694477606784233472" }, "topic" : "isis", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1QWIZCs" }

They killed\n23 people, including 17 foreigners. Two months later, a lone gunmen smuggled a\nKalashnikov-type rifle under a beach umbrella and began shooting beach-goers\nat a resort in Sousse, on Tunisia’s coast. That attack left 38 dead. The\nIslamic State claimed responsibility for both the Bardo and Sousse\nrampages.Both attacks targeted Tunisia’s tourism industry and managed to deal\na sharp blow to the small country’s economy.According to a Tunisian news site,\nChouchane was a kick boxer who lived in Italy for a time and later joined the\nmilitant group Ansar al-Sharia. His family is from Sidi Bouzid, a city in\ncentral Tunisia, according to the site. The Post could not independently\nverify that information.The airstrike near Sabratha, in western Libya, Friday\nmorning was conducted by U.S. F-15 strike fighters.

And as the group attempts to hold what\nterritory it has in Iraq and Syria, it has become a staple of the group’s\ndefensive and offensive capabilities.The modern IED came of age during the\nearly years of the last Iraq War, as bands of insurgents began attacking U.S.\nvehicles and patrols with hidden bombs made of unexploded ordnance, industrial\nsupplies and whatever else could be squeezed into a container and made to\nexplode. Countering the low-budget, highly lethal devices became a game of\nchess for the United States and its allies fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nFor every American widget put into the field, the enemy would make a bomb\ncapable of, at the least, undermining it. But with the United States long wars\nof occupation winding down, groups like the Islamic State–who are now fighting\nopponents with little of the same capabilities the United States once brought\nto bear–are producing the weapons on an almost industrial scale.[_ISIS attacks\nspike in Syria with help from Russian air cover, report says_]A report\npublished Thursday by the weapon research group, Conflict Armament Research,\nexamines a sampling of the Islamic State’s IEDs gathered from the battlefields\nof Syria and Iraq. The group, over the course of almost two years, examined\nmore than 700 IED components and traced them back to 51 countries and 20\ncompanies spread from Turkey to the United States.While the report points out\nthat all companies involved in the trade of the components did so legally, its\nmost striking finding is how fast the items found their way into the hands of\nthe Islamic State.“The appearance of these components in possession of Islamic\nState forces, as little as one month following their lawful supply to\ncommercial entities in the region, speaks to a lack of monitoring by national\ngovernments and companies alike,” the report says. “It may also indicate a\nlack of awareness surrounding the potential use of these civilian-market\ncomponents by terrorist and insurgent forces.”The report only details\ncommercially available items, not any of the military-type explosives that\nmight be used in tandem with the devices. The report also does not go into\ndetail about what the purpose of these IEDs might have been used for, i.e. to\ndestroy vehicles, maim foot patrols, etc.[_The fight against the Islamic State\njust entered a new phase — and it could grow soon_]Many of the items used to\nbuild IEDs are commonly found in and around construction sites and mining\nfacilities–including detonation cord and chemical components. Yet their\nprevalence in seemingly benign settings hasn’t made them any less problematic.\nThe report points to countries like Turkey and Iraq as those responsible for\nfunneling the majority of the reports’ recorded IED material.“Islamic State\nacquisition networks draw most heavily on lawful commerce in the countries\nthat border their territory,” the report says.Additionally, and somewhat\nunsurprisingly, the Islamic State’s preferred cell phone for remotely\ntriggering some of their IEDs is the Nokia Model 105. According to the report,\nof the 10 phones documented, eight had been sent through a third party in the\nUAE while two were acquired in Iraqi Kurdistan.

By contrast, the 2015 attack on Mohammed Emwazi, the\nISIS executioner known by many as “Jihadi John,” eliminated a more symbolic\nmember of the terrorist group. Shadadi has been the site of heavy fighting in\nrecent weeks as the Syrian Democratic Forces and Kurdish YPG fighters have\nfought to retake the town from Islamic State forces. Backed by U.S. airstrikes\nand advisers, the two groups managed to take the town — a key intersection for\nIslamic State forces moving into Iraq — relatively quickly.“It is unusual and\nnoteworthy that [Shishani] — who was the ISIL equivalent of the secretary of\ndefense — had traveled to the al-Shadadi area from Raqqa,” the official\nsaid.Shishani’s presence near Shadadi “was likely to bolster the sagging\nmorale of ISIL fighters there,” the official said, using an acronym for the\nIslamic State.A Georgian by birth known also as “Omar the Chechen” and by his\nbirth name of Tarkhan Tayumurazovich Batirashvili, Shishani fought in the\nGeorgian armed forces during the country’s short war in 2008 against the\nRussians. After serving out his time in his home country’s military, Shishani\njoined a number of rebel brigades fighting in Syria following the start of the\ncountry’s civil war in 2011. Sometime in 2013, Shishani joined the Islamic\nState. In September 2014, Shishani was added to the U.S. Treasury Department’s\nlist of specially designated global terrorists.“Batirashvili is a battle-\ntested leader with experience who had led ISIL fighters in numerous\nengagements in Iraq and Syria,” Cook said in an emailed statement. “His\npotential removal from the battlefield would negatively impact ISIL’s ability\nto recruit foreign fighters — especially those from Chechnya and the\n[Caucasus] regions — and degrade ISIL’s ability to coordinate attacks and\ndefense of its strongholds like Raqqah, Syria, and Mosul, Iraq.” **Read\nmore:**The current chaos in Syria may help the Islamic StateTurkey pledges to\nsend ground forces to fight the Islamic State in SyriaIslamic State is no\nlonger so formidable on the battlefield\n\n", "title" : " Pentagon official: ISIS secretary of defense likely killed in airstrike - The Washington Post", "twitter" : { "body" : "Top ISIS leader potentially killed in airstrike, Pentagon official says http://wapo.st/1OZ2Par", "link" : "https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/707321749965242369", "retweets" : 106, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-08T05:47:01.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 110, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "707321749965242369" }, "topic" : "isis", "source" : "washingtonpost", "link" : "http://wapo.st/1OZ2Par" }

The\nraid was carried out by the Expeditionary Targeting Force — a unit that was\ndeployed to Iraq in recent months with specific orders to capture and kill\nhigh-value Islamic State fighters throughout the region.It was unclear where\nAbu Dawud was held while in U.S. custody.

Dawud was transferred\nearlier today into the custody of the Government of Iraq,” Pentagon spokesman\nPeter Cook said in an emailed statement, using an acronym for the Islamic\nState.According to Cook, intelligence gleaned from Dawud “resulted in multiple\ncoalition airstrikes that have disrupted and degraded ISIL’s ability to\nproduce chemical weapons and will continue to inform our operations in the\nfuture.”While U.S. officials would not confirm the Islamic State has used\nchemical weapons against its opponents, there are numerous instances where\nlocal forces have reported coming under attack from chemical agents —\nespecially in northern Iraq.

Now, the Obama administration is using its final 10\nmonths to bolster the consumer experience on the Web portals, part of a\nbroader push to promote enrollment and mitigate insurers’ losses.Mr. Slavitt\nsaid the administration is cracking down on “bad actors” by requiring\nconsumers to submit proof of life events that qualify them for special\nenrollment periods outside the regular signup season, so they don’t just enter\nthe marketplace once they become sick.He said insurers, too, play a role in\nmaking sure their plans are attractive enough to retain enrollees.“The\nexchange is still in its early stages. Consumers are still getting educated\nabout what their coverage means. I think the health plans, to be fair, are\nstill experimenting with how to offer the best products and services. And for\nour part, we’re watching closely, looking at the data and making sure that we\noperate an exchange that continues to work,” Mr. Slavitt said.While it may be\na long-term project, the law faces short-term expectations on Capitol Hill.GOP\ncritics eyeing repeal with a White House ally in 2017 have pointed to\nUnitedHealth Group and other insurers who have worried aloud about their\nfinancial prospects on the exchanges, saying they are losing money as sicker\nthan expected customers sign up.They say premiums are going up in many places\n— not down — while out-of-pocket costs tied to some offerings leave enrollees\n“functionally uninsured.”Also, congressional budget scorekeepers had projected\nthat 21 million people should be using the exchanges at this point, compared\nto the 13 million that actually signed up. GOP critics say that’s proof that\nenrollment is “stalling out,” though the administration says the initial\nprojection was wrong.Mr. Slavitt said the 2010 law is already working,\nextending coverage to 20 million Americans who didn’t have it.Beyond the\nexchanges, officials in 31 states and D.C. have expanded their Medicaid\nprograms, while young adults can remain on their parents’ plans until 26.“It\nmay be one of the most significant things that any of us have been through or\ngo through in our careers in health care,” Mr. Slavitt said. “The question is,\nwhat happens next?”\n\n", "title" : "Top Obamacare official eyes stability on exchanges, a $40 billion market - Washington Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Top #Obamacare official eyes stability on exchanges, a $40 billion market http://goo.gl/RFJqTx #healthcare", "link" : "https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/707257163169832963", "retweets" : 3, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-08T01:30:22.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 1, "hashtags" : "#Obamacare #healthcare", "id" : "707257163169832963" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "washtimes", "link" : "http://goo.gl/RFJqTx" }

If the two don’t match, then filers will either\ncough up more to the IRS or get more money back.Only 52 percent had to repay a\nportion of government subsidy during last year’s tax season, compared to 60\npercent this year — undercutting the belief that subsidized customers would\nget better at estimating their annual pay after a year of practice.The average\namount they’ve paid back to Uncle Sam has also gone up, from $530 last year to\n$579.“With millions of new marketplace enrollees going through the\nreconciliation process for the first time we expected to see some confusion,”\nsaid Mark Ciaramitaro, vice president of H&amp;R Block’s taxes and health care\nservices. “But the fact a majority of returning marketplace enrollees are\nunderestimating and having to pay back a portion of the [tax credit] signals\nthere is still a steep learning curve on how to accurately estimate income in\napplying for the premium tax credit when enrolling in a marketplace plan.”He\nsaid the problem could be due to high year-to-year volatility in how much low-\nincome households take in each year.H&amp;R Block said customers who had to\nrepay some subsidy still saw an average refund of $2,022, although it is less\nthan what they would have received.More than a third of taxpayers who claimed\nObamacare tax credits overestimated their income and got extra money back from\nthe IRS — $450 on average. Only 3 percent of customers didn’t see any impact\non their refunds because of their exchange subsidies.H&amp;R Block’s analysis\nadds to data reported last month by TurboTax, a tax-filing company that said\nseven in 10 taxpayers using its online system this season claimed an exemption\nfrom the Obamacare mandate tax.Many of those say even the cheapest plans\navailable to them at work or on the exchanges are still too expensive, and so\nthey claimed the IRS’s financial burden exemption in refusing to gain\ncoverage. Others said they were exempt because they’d recently been evicted,\nhad a close family member die, or had another hardship that excused them from\nthe mandate._Story Continues →_\n\n", "title" : "H&amp;R Block: Customers paying twice as much to satisfy Obamacare penalty - Washington Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "H&R Block: Customers paying twice as much to satisfy Obamacare penalty http://bit.ly/1W6AMLG", "link" : "https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/707274275070337024", "retweets" : 21, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-08T02:38:22.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 4, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "707274275070337024" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "washtimes", "link" : "http://bit.ly/1W6AMLG" }

No one would expect on\nthe natural reading of the word ‘sex’ that that would include subjective\nconcepts like gender identity, when it’s not specifically mentioned.”The\nreinterpretation could strike down laws in states that ban Medicaid funds from\nbeing used in sex-reassignment procedures.“I think it’s another striking\nexample of federal overreach and intrusion, not only into the operations of\nthe states, but into the operations of individual hospitals, physicians, and\ninsurers, who should have the ability to make their own decisions when it\ncomes to controversial treatments,” Mr. Severino said.Underlying the debate on\nwho should pay for the surgeries is whether such procedures even work to treat\ntransgender people.Dr. Paul McHugh, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns\nHopkins University School of Medicine, said gender dysphoria is a psychosocial\nailment — similar to anorexia and other body-dysmorphic maladies — and\ntherefore should be treated through psychotherapy and counseling.He said there\nis scant evidence to suggest that sex change surgeries work and argues that\nproponents of the procedures are taking a “great shot in the dark for an\nideological reason.”“Nobody would give this kind of treatment, with this kind\nof evidence, for anything other than ideological reasons,” said Dr. McHugh,\nwho ended such procedures at Johns Hopkins in his capacity as chairman of the\nDepartment of Psychiatry in 1979.But Sarah Warbelow, legal director of the\nHuman Rights Campaign, said Dr. McHugh’s understanding flies in the face of\nstandard medical practice, citing the American Psychiatric Association and\nAmerican Medical Association, which recommend a physical rather than mental\nremedy.“Mental health services are important for a wide variety of people for\na wide variety of needs,” Ms. Warbelow said. “And certainly transgender people\ndo seek relationships with mental health care providers, but the appropriate\ntreatment as deemed by the American Medical Association and every major\nphysical and mental health-care organization out there is to affirm people in\ntheir gender identity.”_Story Continues →_\n\n", "title" : "Transgender man says Obamacare requires Pennsylvania to pay for uterus surgery - Washington Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "#Transgender man says #Obamacare requires Pa. to pay for uterus removal surgery: http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/8/transgender-man-says-obamacare-requires-pennsylvan/", "link" : "https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/707394688689553409", "retweets" : 8, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-08T10:36:51.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 5, "hashtags" : "#Transgender #Obamacare", "id" : "707394688689553409" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "washtimes", "link" : "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/8/transgender-man-says-obamacare-requires-pennsylvan/" }

Rob Portman, the Ohio\nRepublican who chairs the investigatory panel on the Homeland Security and\nGovernmental Affairs Committee.Democrats originally promoted the co-ops, or\n“Consumer Operated and Oriented Plans,” during the Obamacare debate of 2009 as\na fallback to attempt to win passage of a “public option,” or government-run\nplan to be offered alongside private plans in the new web-based health\nexchanges to be set up in the states.Designed to give consumers more\nbargaining power in the marketplace, the co-op program instead has turned into\na major headache for President Obama, who is trying to place his signature law\non firm footing before leaving office.One of the co-op plans, CoOportunity\nHealth of Nebraska and Iowa, abruptly shut down in early 2015, foreshadowing\nthe ill fates of co-ops in Louisiana, Nevada, New York, Kentucky, Tennessee,\nColorado, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, Arizona and Michigan.Andy Slavitt,\nacting administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,\ntestified that CoOportunity should have been shut down even before the 2015\nplan year, though he argued his agency didn’t have enough claims data to size\nup and shutter more co-ops until the middle of last year.As it stands, he said\nthe Justice Department is doing what it can to wrest back some of the\ngovernment’s money from the failed co-ops.The department has frozen “tens of\nmillions” of dollars in payments that the plans expected from Obamacare\nprograms designed to spread out risk in the marketplace, and it is eyeing\nfunds that co-ops might recoup from their vendors.In the end, taxpayers will\nonly get back an unknowable fraction of the $1.2 billion, Mr. Slavitt\nsaid.“There will be funds recovered for the taxpayers,” he told senators,\nthough he refused to offer a dollar amount. “I can’t guess.

The inflammation got worse over the next few months. Now\nanytime I try to put my arm above my head, pain shoots up my arm. I often wake\nup at night with an agonizing throb in my shoulder.So I finally and\nreluctantly went to the orthopedic surgeon and he said that I had a rotator\ncuff tear and I probably would need surgery. Ugh. He scheduled me for an MRI\nbut the day I was set to go, the hospital called to tell me my insurance\ncompany declined to pay for the scans. The insurance company, CIGNA, tersely\nsent me a note: “You will need to complete six weeks of conservative\ntreatment, such as physical therapy and anti-inflammatory medication. Once\nthat has been completed and you have been re-evaluated, we can try to have the\nMRI re-authorized.” Gee, thanks. You guys are the best.What’s that about? I’ve\nbeen doing therapy for many months already with not much improvement. The\ndoctor explained that the insurance companies want to make sure that\nphysicians aren’t padding bills with unnecessary procedures. Incidentally,\nI’ve paid for health insurance for 30 years and have almost never used the\nmedical care system. I calculate the insurers have made well over $100,000 off\nof me.But I am lost inside the bureaucratic maze. They don’t want to pay for\nthe MRI because they don’t want to have to reimburse for rotator cuff surgery.\nSo their hope is that I will just go away. Studies show these delay tactics\nand bureaucratic runarounds work to reduce insurance payouts.I’m starting to\nfeel just like Helen Hunt in the movie “As Good As It Gets,” during the\nmemorable scene when she finds out her health coverage won’t pay for the\nproper treatment for her son’s asthma condition and out of frustration she\nyells: “F*&amp;#ing HMO bastard pieces of @#*@.”Everyone has horror stories of\ninsurance companies denying coverage for valid procedures. As an analysis in\nthe Baltimore Sun recently put it: “Among insurance professionals, it is\ncommon knowledge that health insurers are denying claims for coverage with\nincreasing frequency.” This is what the health industry calls “cost\ncontrol.”Look, I get it that the insurance companies are trying to root out\nthe fraud and abuse of excessive procedures, which drive up costs for\neveryone. But the insurance companies are becoming barriers to care even when\nit is for legitimate and necessary procedures.What’s the root of the problem\nhere?First, the excess of health insurance actually drives up cost. The more\ninsurance for a procedure, the more expensive it is. Health inflation and\npremiums has been rising for at least the last decade by nearly double the\nCPI. This is also why there are so many frivolous procedures performed.\nPatients have been removed from the decision-making process.Second, Obamacare\nhas increased demand for health care and is driving up costs, so insurers\nappear to be cutting their expenses by denying claims more often. By the way,\nthe insurance lobby should take note that this sleazy practice only plays into\nthe hands of the likes of Bernie Sanders who wants a single payer government\nsystem to take over the health insurance system.That will make medical care\nworse — and more expensive. Studies on Medicaid patients find little or no\nimprovement in health outcomes compared to the uninsured population — because\nthe level of care is so lousy. Government health care will be Medicaid-type\ncoverage for all. It will be “fair” because we will all get equally subpar\nmedical care — and I would never get my shoulder surgery under that system.The\nhealth insurance scandal in America today argues not for a vast expansion of\ngovernment-run health care, but the medical savings account approach, where\npeople put money tax-free into an IRA account and draw it down to pay for\ntheir first few thousand dollars of coverage. That way it isn’t an insurance\ncompany who makes the call as to whether I should get an MRI. I make the call\nwith my own money. Is the pain so bad in my shoulder that I want to shell out\n$1,200 to have a scan? Right now, CIGNA says I don’t get to make that choice.\nSo it’s “free” but I don’t get it. Wonderful.The only people who really know\nwhether my shoulder is in such bad shape that I need surgery is not the\nfaceless bean-counting claims adjusters living in Toledo, Ohio, but me and my\ndoctor._• __Stephen Moore is an economic consultant with Freedom Works and a\nFox News contributor._\n\n", "title" : "STEPHEN MOORE: Health care requires more than insurance - Washington Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Stephen Moore: Solving America's #healthcare crisis requires more than just #insurance . #Obamacare http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/13/stephen-moore-health-care-requires-more-than-insur/", "link" : "https://twitter.com/WashTimes/status/709134713768845316", "retweets" : 9, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-03-13T07:51:05.000-0700" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 9, "hashtags" : "#healthcare #insurance #Obamacare", "id" : "709134713768845316" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "washtimes", "link" : "http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/mar/13/stephen-moore-health-care-requires-more-than-insur/" }

Rob Portman, R-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said in his opening statement at the hearing.“In some states, these losses will be absorbed by other insurance companies—which means, by the policyholders of other insurance companies who have to pay increased … premiums,” he said. “In other states, doctors, hospitals and individual patients stand to suffer large out-of-pocket losses due to the co-op failures—as our report details.” Portman’s statement, first obtained by Fox News, refers to an investigation by the committee’s majority staff. It claims the most recent balance sheets provided to the subcommittee show the failed cooperatives owe more than $700 million to doctors and hospitals for plan year 2015.The failed cooperatives lost $376 million and exceeded the projected worst-case-scenario losses outlined in their loan applications by more than $260 million in 2014. They lost an additional billion dollars in 2015, according to the report.“Once the co-ops got going in 2014, things went south in a hurry—both in terms of financial losses and enrollment figures that wildly deviated from the co-ops’ own projections,” Portman said. “Despite getting regular reports that the co-ops were hemorrhaging cash, HHS [the Department of Health and Human Services] took essentially no corrective action for over a year.”  Deloitte Consulting initially granted the cooperatives a passing grade based on an HHS-designed grading scale. However it added seven of the 12 had serious deficiencies in their enrollment strategy, according to the report.  Others submitted budgets that were “incomplete, unreasonable, not cost-effective” and several “relied on unreasonable projections about their own growth.” The report cited in Portman’s statement also claims that from 2014–2015, the administration lent an additional $848 million to the failed cooperatives, as they lost more than $1.4 billion.In previous testimony, administration officials have told congressional panels that the administration scrutinized cooperative business plans and then placed them on corrective oversight when necessary. “In 2015 we conducted 27 financial and operational reviews, 16 in-person visits, and had 43 formal communications,” Andy Slavitt, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, told the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year.  “Not to mention hundreds of phone calls. And we've kept the states up to speed on every important interaction to help inform their regulatory actions.”When questioned how much money the government could salvage from the failed cooperatives, officials said they were only beginning to determine amounts.“We are in the process of recouping that loan money right now,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, the chief operating officer and chief of staff of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, last month to a House panel. “We’ll look at their excess revenue and then use all the tools available to us through their loan agreements and state and federal law to pull back federal tax dollars.”ObamaCare provided $2.4 billion in federal loans to establish 23 non-profit cooperatives.  A dozen failed and the administration has required eight of the remaining eleven to adhere to a “corrective action plan” designed to fix business flaws and prevent additional failures.  The closed cooperatives account for $1.2 billion in federal loans.Defenders of the law and cooperatives say these non-profit  insurers operated in difficult markets and that it often takes years of financial commitment to build a viable business.The failed cooperatives left hundreds of thousands of customers searching for a new insurance company.  In some states, the loss was significant.“HHS gave the New York co-op $90 million to prolong its financial life, rather than allow it to scale down, that co-op went on to lose another $544 million in 2015,” according to Portman’s statement, citing his staff’s report.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner in the Democratic presidential delegate count, pledged she would address the market void left by the failed cooperatives.“We need to get more companies, more nonprofits, to fill this space. The ones that knew what they were doing have provided good services, but a lot of them have failed because they didn't have the right support,” she said Monday at a Democratic presidential forum hosted by Fox News.“Even in those markets where those co-ops had previously operated, we have seen a commitment on the part of those who are administering the markets to try to facilitate greater competition,” said White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.  “And creating the co-ops was just one way to do that, but we certainly are going to be open to other ways to encourage other entities, private or public, to get engaged in this process.”When previously questioned by Congress, administration officials declined to forecast how many of the remaining cooperatives would survive this year.“The co-ops themselves are really the ones who are going to be the ones to determine whether or not they ultimately will be successful,” said Cohen.  “They have a lot of work to do to rapidly mature their entities, their small businesses as you know and they’re still getting their foothold on this business.”__Rich Edson is a Washington correspondent for Fox News Channel.

(Reuters)Illegal immigrants and individuals with unclear legal\nstatus wrongly benefited from up to $750 million in ObamaCare subsidies and\nthe government is struggling to recoup the money, according to a new Senate\nreport obtained by Fox News.The report, produced by Republicans on the Senate\nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, examined Affordable Care\nAct tax credits meant to defray the cost of insurance premiums. It found that\nas of June 2015, “the Administration awarded approximately $750 million in tax\ncredits on behalf of individuals who were later determined to be ineligible\nbecause they failed to verify their citizenship, status as a national, or\nlegal presence.”The review found the credits went to more than 500,000 people\n– who are illegal immigrants or whose legal status was unclear due to\ninsufficient records. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services confirmed\nto FoxNews.com on Monday that 471,000 customers with 2015 coverage failed to\nproduce proper documentation on their citizenship or immigration status on\ntime – but stressed that this does not necessarily mean they’re ineligible.\n“Lack of verification does not mean an individual is ineligible for financial\nassistance, but only that a Marketplace did not receive sufficient information\nto verify eligibility in the time period outlined in the law,” CMS spokesman\nAaron Albright said. The Senate report also accused the administration of\nlacking a solid plan to get that money back – and predicted that in the end,\nthe IRS will be “unable to fully recoup the funds.”“The information provided\nto the Committee by the IRS and HHS reveals a troubling lack of coordination\nbetween the two agencies ... and demonstrates that the IRS and HHS neglected\nto consider how they would recover these wasteful payments,” the report\nsays.Under the law, the feds can dole out these payments on a temporary basis\nif a recipient’s legal status is unclear, but are supposed to cut off funding\nand coverage if the recipient does not later come up with the paperwork. Up to\na half-million “ineligible” people, according to the report, applied in this\nway -- with their credits paid in advance to the insurers. The IRS, though, is\nsupposed to get overpayments back from the individuals themselves.The Senate\nreport, based on a review launched by committee Chairman Sen. Ron Johnson,\nR-Wis., derisively describes this approach as “pay and chase.” In other words,\nthe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pays credits and subsidies to\nthe insurance companies on behalf of the applicants – and the feds then\n“chase” after any overpayments to ineligible people once they are\ndiscovered.“This ‘pay and chase’ model has potentially cost taxpayers\napproximately $750 million,” the report says. The 500,000 individuals in\nquestion have been removed from coverage, according to the findings, as the\ngovernment seeks to get the money back. The Senate report says the IRS and HHS\ninitially failed to coordinate on a plan for recouping funds, and claimed that\na subsequent plan from the IRS to recoup the money is still “ineffective and\ninsufficient.”In a July letter to Johnson, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen\nassured that the agency is “committed to identifying and efficiently\naddressing” improper payments. He reiterated that anyone “not lawfully\npresent” who enrolls for ObamaCare coverage “must repay” the advance premium\ncredit payments, and would be breaking the law if they don’t._Fox News’ Chad\nPergram and FoxNews.com’s Judson Berger contributed to this report.___\n\n", "title" : "Senate report: Illegal immigrants benefited from up to $750M in ObamaCare subsidies | Fox News", "twitter" : { "body" : "Senate report: Illegal immigrants benefited from up to $750M in ObamaCare subsidies | Via @foxnewspolitics | http://fxn.ws/1mo3one", "link" : "https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/697039357346185216", "retweets" : 435, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-08T20:48:27.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "@foxnewspolitics", "favs" : 263, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "697039357346185216" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "FoxNews", "link" : "http://fxn.ws/1mo3one" }

The\nlegislation also would strip federal funding for Planned Parenthood.The\nmeasure still faces certain doom at the White House, and Democrats derided the\nvote Wednesday as pointless. The president is sure to veto, and Republicans do\nnot have the votes to override.But the political theater marks the opening\nvolley in a fresh ObamaCare fight under the Paul Ryan-led House, and one\nlikely to energize the party’s election-year efforts. “I fully anticipate the\npresident will veto this, but I mean, how many times have we been saying we\nwant to put bills on his desk that say who we are, what we believe versus what\nhe believes, and that he will veto,” Speaker Ryan, R-Wis., told Fox News\nTuesday night before the vote. The new speaker’s next goal is to engineer and\npass a bill – also for the first time – to replace the Affordable Care Act.\nDoing so could help Republicans respond to Democrats’ allegations that they\nhave no viable alternative.Ryan is tempering expectations for the GOP in this\nexercise.In a recent meeting with reporters, the speaker indicated that the\nHouse was practically obligated to pass a health care reform replacement bill.\nHe was confident the House could do so this year but underscored that he\ndidn’t say the president would sign the legislation into law.But this is still\npart of Ryan’s effort to contrast Republicans’ plans with the Obama agenda.\nDemocrats have long hectored Republicans for failing to cough up a bill to\nreplace the current health care law even as they try to repeal it. If they at\nleast draft a bill, and even pass it, then the parties can argue over a\nconcrete policy choice.“We need to win the election, and the best way to win\nthe election is give people a choice,” Ryan told Fox News, speaking generally\nabout the two parties’ platforms.Republicans have held more than 60 votes so\nfar to repeal all or part of the health care law.They only cleared this one\npast the Senate because they used a special set of budget rules known as\n“reconciliation.” This allowed the measure to pass with a simple majority –\ntypically, Republicans would have needed to muster 60 votes to pass it.Planned\nParenthood has come under attack since videos surfaced last year of graphic\ndiscussions about harvesting fetal tissue.Wednesday's vote, meanwhile,\nprovided fresh fodder for the Democratic presidential candidates. Hillary\nClinton warned in Iowa earlier this week that the vote shows the high stakes\nat play in the 2016 race. She, too, accused Republicans of offering no\nalternative.“They have no plan. The Republicans just want to undo what\nDemocrats have fought for decades and what President Obama got accomplished,”\nshe said._Fox News’ Chad Pergram contributed to this report. ___\n\n", "title" : "Congress sends health law repeal to Obama's desk for first time | Fox News", "twitter" : { "body" : "BREAKING NEWS: Congress sends ObamaCare repeal bill to Obama's desk for first time http://fxn.ws/1ZNO3LF pic.twitter.com/rvjL1lASwO", "link" : "https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/684873666677600259", "retweets" : 225, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-06T07:06:21.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 494, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "684873666677600259" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "FoxNews", "link" : "http://fxn.ws/1ZNO3LF" }

The company did say it has set aside a\npremium deficiency reserve – meaning, it’s setting aside money to help make up\nthe difference.Humana, which will provide a deeper dive into its 2016 outlook\nwhen it releases its fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 10, said in the SEC\nfiling that it expects membership to drop this year by 200,000 to 300,000. The\ndecrease reflects plans sold under ObamaCare as well as older policies.“We\nexpect Humana will exit Health Insurance Exchange marketplaces in 2017 in\nlight of this data, and focus on its Medicare Advantage book of business,”\nLeerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said in a research note on Friday.Humana is\njust the latest mega-insurer to run into a profit problem under the Affordable\nCare Act.Last year, UnitedHealth’s CEO announced $425 million in losses and\nwarned it may walk away from the health care exchanges altogether.\nUnitedHealth is the largest insurer in the country.Many industry watchers warn\nthe threat from the nation’s largest insurer is just the beginning.Insurers\nlike UnitedHealth and Humana have had a hard time turning a profit since the\ngovernment-run marketplaces for plans opened in late 2013. Part of the reason\nis because customers flocking to big insurers are using more medical care --\nsomething that is cutting into company profits.Keeping ObamaCare alive is\nvital to President Obama’s legacy – but it won’t be easy.Calls to gut his\nlandmark legislation have continued and just last week, Obama was forced to\nfend off another GOP-led challenge. On Friday, Obama vetoed a measure that\nwould have repealed most of the health care law, saying the bill would do\n“harm” to millions of Americans. It was the first time Republicans succeeded\nin sending an ObamaCare repeal bill to his desk.Some lawmakers vow to keep up\nthe fight against ObamaCare and argue the legislation is harming the economy\nand wrongly forcing Americans to buy insurance.The pushback from Congress\ncomes as administration officials touted another round of strong signups.\n\"The marketplace continues to be stable, vibrant and growing,\" Andy Slavitt,\nhead of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers the\nhealth overhaul's online insurance market, said on a conference call with\nreporters last week.The administration is expecting a surge of young\nprocrastinators to sign up near the Jan. 31 deadline for 2016 coverage. That\ncould help hold down premiums the following year.Leading the administration's\ntally was Florida, with more than 1.5 million signed up. California followed,\nwith more than 1.4 million.Despite the optimism from the Obama administration,\nan increasing number of insurance and medical experts, like Mount Sinai Health\nSystem President and CEO Kenneth Davis, have started to speak up about the\nproblems facing ObamaCare.“Premiums are going up, deductibles are higher and\nthat’s a problem,” he said on CNBC, reversing optimistic comments he made only\na year ago.“What it’s all about is that not enough healthy people have signed\nup,” he said, creating a lopsided business model.   __\n\n", "title" : "Humana latest insurer to have big problems under ObamaCare | Fox News", "twitter" : { "body" : "Humana latest insurer to have big problems under ObamaCare : http://fxn.ws/1N7QY91", "link" : "https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/687349615147003904", "retweets" : 127, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-13T03:04:53.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 112, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "687349615147003904" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "FoxNews", "link" : "http://fxn.ws/1N7QY91" }

And the scale of its many\nbroken promises is matched only by the scale of its defenders' rigid and\nunfeeling responses to them.\"The White House promised a veto, saying the bill\nwould \"take away critical benefits and health care coverage\" from families.\nWith Republicans lacking the two-thirds House and Senate majorities needed for\na successful override, debate on the measure became a political messaging\nbattlefield as both parties looked toward the 2016 presidential and\ncongressional campaigns.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., mocked the\nRepublicans' \"absurd attempt\" to repeal the health care law and noted the\nlarge number of people -- including in McConnell's Kentucky -- who've obtained\ncoverage under the law.\"Do they bother to talk to their constituents?\" Reid\nsaid of GOP lawmakers.Senators were voting on a stack of amendments to the\nbill, all of them symbolic since the measure was destined to never become\nlaw.In one, the Senate voted 54-46 to reject an attempt by Democrats to\nprevent the cuts to Planned Parenthood. The proposal by Sen. Patty Murray,\nD-Wash., which came six days after a gunman killed three people at one of the\ngroup's Colorado clinics, would have also provided $1 billion for safety at\nwomen's clinics.Republicans fault the health care law for rising insurance\npremiums and deductibles and a diminished choice of insurers in some markets.\nGovernment officials said this week that health care spending grew last year\nat 5.3 percent, in part because of the health law's coverage expansion, the\nsteepest climb since Obama took office.With GOP leaders insisting they had the\nvotes they would need, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said he would support the bill,\nsaying it \"lays the groundwork for Obamacare to be erased from the books\naltogether.\" He and two GOP presidential candidates, Sens. Marco Rubio of\nFlorida and Ted Cruz of Texas, threatened in October to oppose the legislation\nif it didn't go further than a similar House-passed version.GOP lawmakers\nsuggested the bill could serve as a bridge to a new Republican health care\nlaw. Though Obama's overhaul was enacted five years ago and gets tepid support\nin public opinion polls, GOP members of Congress have yet to produce a\ndetailed proposal to replace it.Democrats say repeal would destroy a program\nthat has reduced the number of uninsured Americans by around 16 million, lets\nfamilies' policies cover children until age 26 and guarantees coverage for\npeople with pre-existing illnesses.The overall Senate bill would effectively\ndefang the health law's requirements for individual and employer-provided\ncoverage by annulling the fines that enforce them.It would terminate the law's\nexpansion of Medicaid to cover additional lower-earning people and the federal\nsubsidies it offers people buying policies in insurance marketplaces. It would\nalso annul tax increases imposed to cover the law's costs, including levies on\nthe income of higher-earning people, medical devices, costly insurance\npolicies and tanning salons.Republicans wrapped the measure in a filibuster-\nproof process that requires just 51 votes for Senate passage, not the 60\nusually required to end stalling tactics. The GOP controls the chamber by\n54-46.Planned Parenthood, a longtime target of anti-abortion forces, has come\nunder fire after secretly recorded videos showed group officials discussing\ntheir provision of fetal tissue to scientists. The organization says it\nconducts such transactions legally.Planned Parenthood gets $450 million of its\n$1.3 billion annual budget from federal taxpayers, mostly reimbursements for\ntreating Medicaid patients. Federal dollars cannot be used for abortions\nexcept for rare exceptions.__\n\n", "title" : "Senate nears OK of GOP bill unraveling ObamaCare | Fox News", "twitter" : { "body" : "Senate nears OK of GOP bill unraveling ObamaCare : http://fxn.ws/1XKO4Nx", "link" : "https://twitter.com/FoxNews/status/672500769963139072", "retweets" : 150, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-12-03T03:40:52.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 283, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "672500769963139072" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "FoxNews", "link" : "http://fxn.ws/1XKO4Nx" }

Trump's unconventional campaign style was\nparticularly noticeable in Iowa -- a state where retail politics is hugely\ncritical -- and next to Cruz, who crisscrossed the state relentlessly to\nensure he had visited all 99 counties. In contrast, Trump opted for large\nrallies over intimate settings and extended personal interactions with voters,\njetting in and out on his private jet and rarely spending the night in the\nstate. Who nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize?While the last-minute\nramping up of the campaign schedule in New Hampshire doesn't necessarily mean\nTrump is making substantive changes to the way he is running his campaign, it\ndoes at least suggest that he looking to step up his exposure here just days\naway from next Tuesday's contest. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks didn't comment\non Thursday's schedule.In his first event of the day in Exeter, Trump\nrepeatedly emphasized the importance of the New Hampshire race. \"We're at the\nbeginning of a very, very important last few days. This is really crunch\ntime,\" he said. \"This is going to lead to one of the most important\npresidential elections, maybe the most important in many, many decades. You're\ngoing to play such a big role.\"At one point, Trump used the major hotel\nproject he's working on in Washington to crack a joke about losing the 2016\nrace. \"I'm building a hotel next door, which is also located on Pennsylvania\nAve.,\" he said. \"I have an alternative if this doesn't work out: I'll still be\non Pennsylvania Ave. one way or another.\"After brief remarks, Trump did\nsomething he's largely avoided so far this cycle: take questions from the\naudience. Seemingly chosen at random, some half dozen individuals asked the\ncandidate about a range of issues, from illegal immigration to Social\nSecurity, to corporate inversions and the treatment of veterans. The first\nexchange he had with a woman in the crowd was tense, as she asked about the\nimportant role that undocumented immigrants play in taking on jobs that nobody\nelse wants. \"Who told you to be here?

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71cb4955d14d6f80767aa" }, "content" : "For tax year 2015, millions of Americans will be getting a new tax form\nrelated to health care reform measures.Will you know what to do with yours\nwhen it arrives?The Affordable Health Care Act, colloquially known as\n“Obamacare,” mandated three new tax forms to be used as a kind of proof of\ninsurance so taxpayers may avoid paying a penalty for failure to be covered.\nThey are:While Form 1095-A debuted last year after Americans began purchasing\ninsurance on exchanges and qualifying to related tax credits, tax year 2015\nwill be the first time the B and C version are mailed out to insured\nemployees.But if you’re intimidated by the prospect of more paperwork, don’t\nbe. In fact, you don’t even have to wait for the tax form to arrive in the\nmail if you know you were covered for all of 2015, said Debra Hammer,\nspokeswoman for tax preparation giant Intuit TurboTax.“Go ahead and file your\ntaxes before the form arrives. And when you do get a form, just review it for\naccuracy,” Hammer said.You may have to dig that 1095-B or 1095-C out of the\nfiling cabinet if you get audited, she adds, so don’t throw it away. But\notherwise it’s just a “check the box” exercise on your form 1040, then you’re\ndone.Of course, things are trickier if you do not have health insurance, or if\nyou were only covered for part of tax year 2015.The purpose of the forms,\nafter all, is to prove you have insurance and, therefore, avoid paying a\npenalty that is sometimes referred to as the “individual mandate.”That penalty\nis going up in for tax filers this April to $695 per adult or 2.5% of\nhousehold income, whichever is higher, up from $325 per adult or 2% of\nhousehold income previously. The penalties for children under 18 have also\nrisen to $347.50 from $162.50, and the household cap on fines has more than\ndoubled to $2,085 annually from $975.If you weren't insured for every month in\ntax year 2015, it’s worth exploring any exemptions you might have before\npaying any related penalties. In fact, the Internal Revenue Service said about\n300,000 people paid a penalty last year but likely qualified for some kind of\nexemption. If you are facing a fine, visit healthcare.gov/exemptions-tool to\nsee if there’s a way to reduce or eliminate that penalty.All in all, Hammer of\nTurboTax said that the new Affordable Act Tax forms are straightforward and\nthat taxpayers shouldn’t panic.“Given that people don’t have to wait until\nthey have the B's and C's to file their taxes, it shouldn’t be a difficult\nyear,” she said. And given that Form 1095-A is now a year old and the\nexchanges have been running for some time, both preparers and the IRS itself\nshould easily be able to process filings without a hitch this year.**But are\nbusinesses prepared?**However, while individuals may have an easy go of it,\nsmall businesses may find compliance with the new tax rules a bit troublesome\non their end, said Vic Saliterman, senior vice president of health care reform\nat payroll service provider ADP.Some employers with 50 or more full-time\nworkers may be subject to “shared responsibility” fines if they don’t offer\nemployees insurance — or if their plans are too costly or don’t offer a\nminimum amount of coverage. That means they have to keep accurate records and\nreport their insurance plans to the IRS or else suffer big fines of their\nown.“The 1095 form is really the mechanism that the IRS is going to use to\nassess whether or not each person has the required coverage, and it’s what the\nindividual is going to use to demonstrate that they’ve got the coverage,”\nSaliterman said. “Then the IRS will marry the two up.”In other words, if\nyou’re a small-business owner and miss some forms, discrepancies may raise\nflags or result in fines with the IRS.ADP recently conducted a survey of\nbusinesses to see how prepared they are, and more than half of businesses with\n50 to 999 workers said they’re not sure if they are in compliance. More than 4\nin 10 businesses with 1,000 or more workers also aren’t sure.Saliterman said\nthat the study shows that the smaller the company, the more at risk it\nis.“They are so focused on running their business, they just don’t have the\nadditional resources to focus on things of this nature,” he said.And,\nunfortunately, Saliterman added, small businesses may have their hands full\nfor some time because “it’s unlikely we’ve seen the final chapter” in tax\nchanges related to the Affordable Care Act. He pointed to debates over the so-\ncalled “Cadillac tax” on premium insurance plans as just one sticking point\nemployers will have to watch.“With something as broad and complex as the ACA\nand with so many political interests, things will remain very fluid,”\nSaliterman said._Jeff Reeves is the editor of InvestorPlace.com and the author\nof The Frugal Investor's Guide to Finding Great Stocks._\n\n", "title" : "Are you prepared for new Obamacare tax forms?", "twitter" : { "body" : "Are you prepared for the new Obamacare tax forms? http://usat.ly/1S3TJyu", "link" : "https://twitter.com/USATODAY/status/689767671659937792", "retweets" : 29, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-19T19:13:22.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 9, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "689767671659937792" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "usatoday", "link" : "http://usat.ly/1S3TJyu" }

Many investors, for instance, thought\nhospitals were going to be big winners since they would have to treat fewer\nuninsured patients. Many health insurers including UnitedHealth were initially\nbullish on the plan as more consumers would presumably purchase health\ninsurance. Instead, UnitedHealth says it is considering to stop offering\ninsurance plans through the public exchanges created by the law.UnitedHealth\ncut its 2015 projected profit to $6 a share, down from a previous range of\nbetween $6.25 and $6.35, citing the increased costs associated with offering\ninsurance through the exchanges. The warning gives credibility to warnings\nfrom critics of the law who have said the exchange would attract consumers who\ntend to have the most health issues, and therefore are more costly.

If UnitedHealth drops out, consumers would lose one of\nthe lowest-cost plans available in much of the country, and some wonder how\nsmaller insurers could fill the void. .“If they can’t make money on the\nexchanges, it seems it would be hard for anyone,” said Katherine Hempstead,\nwho heads the insurance coverage team at the Robert Wood Johnson\nFoundation.UnitedHealth (UNH) downgraded its earnings forecast, bemoaning low\ngrowth projections for Obamacare enrollment and blaming the federal health\ncare law for giving individuals too much flexibility to change plans.  People\nwho purchase insurance through the public exchanges are typically heavy users\nof their plans, draining insurers' profits, analysts say.In a sharp reversal\nof its previously optimistic projections, UnitedHealth suspended marketing of\nits Obamacare exchange plans for 2016 — which the company has already\ncommitted to offer — to limit its exposure to additional losses.“We see no\ndata pointing to improvement\" in the financial performance of public-exchange\nplans, UnitedHealth CEO Stephen Hemsley said on a conference call, though he\nadded that \"we remain hopeful\" the market will recover.The move comes amid\nindications that insurers are absorbing steeper costs than they expected from\nplans offered to individuals through the public exchanges, which are purchased\nonline.The average premium for medium-benefit plans offered to 40-year-old\nnon-smokers will rise 10.1% in 2016, according to the Kaiser Family\nFoundation.UnitedHealth warned investors that it would reap $425 million less\nin revenue during the fourth quarter than it had previously expected,\ntranslating into 26 cents in earnings per share in losses attributed to a\nworse outlook for the quarter and all of 2016.The company lowered its full-\nyear 2015 earnings-per-share forecast to $6, down from $6.25 to $6.35, and\nshares of UnitedHealth stock fell 5.7% to close at $110.63.Other health care\nstocks took a hit, too. Tenet Healthcare (THC) fell 8%, and HCA Holding (HCA)\ndropped 6.9%. Insurers Aetna (AET) and Anthem (ANTM) fell 6.5% and 6.9%,\nrespectively.Privately-held Kaiser Permanente said Thursday that it won't\nabandon the ACA exchanges. Kaiser is both a health care provider and insurer\nand sells plans on the exchanges for eight states plus Washington, D.C.\"At\nKaiser Permanente, we remain strongly committed to continuing to participate\nin the health exchanges,\" CEO Bernard Tyson said in an emailed statement.\n\"While there have been challenges at times, we believe at the end of the day\nthey are causing healthy disruption, and are forcing the health care industry\nto respond better to consumer needs.\"S&amp;P Capital IQ analyst Jeffrey Loo\nsaid in a research note that he was \"a bit surprised\" by the revelation\nbecause UnitedHealth had previously \"indicated optimism\" about the\nexchanges.But Hemsley said patients are using their plans more than the\ncompany had expected and dropping coverage when they're healthy, slamming\nprofits.The Obama administration argued that the health care marketplace would\nstabilize after a normal period of changes in the early years following the\nlaw's implementation. An average of 10 insurers per state are offering plans\nfor 2016, up from nine in 2015 and eight in 2014.In the exchanges' third year,\nthe number of plans offered \"continues to grow, giving millions of Americans\naccess to quality affordable insurance,\" Ben Wakana, a spokesman for the U.S.\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, said in an emailed statement.\"The\nreality is we continue to see more people signing up for health insurance and\nmore issuers entering the Marketplaces, and at the end of January, we believe\nwe’ll be looking at another successful open enrollment — just like the last\ntwo,\" Wakana said.\"This year, people looking for coverage in the Marketplace\ncontinue to have a robust number of plan choices and as the data shows the\nMarketplace is stable, vibrant and a growing source of coverage for new\nconsumers,\" he added. \"Today’s statement by one issuer is not indicative of\nthe Marketplace’s strength and viability.\"Even though UnitedHealth wasn’t a\nmajor player yet on the ACA exchanges, the fact that it priced plans\nconservatively and entered cautiously made its statements more significant,\nHempstead said.More than half of the 23 non-profit insurance co-ops\nestablished under the ACA will shutter by the end of this year, but\nUnitedHealth is the largest single insurance carrier in the United States.\nUnited’s comments about the health of exchange-plan holders also run counter\nto what was expected. Experts including Hempstead assumed the sickest people\nwould get insurance first, and then the “risk pool” would improve as more\nhealthy people bought plans.While UnitedHealth’s statement is significant,\nKaiser Family Foundation Senior Vice President Larry Levitt said it \"matters\nmore for what it says about what industry as a whole thinks about\nObamacare.\"\"If they exited (the exchanges), it wouldn’t matter that much to\nthe functioning of the ACA, but it would show why increasing enrollment is so\nimportant,\" Levitt said. \"This market is not yet profitable for insurers, but\nit could become profitable if enrollment grows.\"An exit could, however, affect\nprices on the exchanges. For 2016, UnitedHealth sells one of the two lowest-\ncost silver plans available to more than 40% of the counties in the 38 states\nthat use the federal Healthcare.gov exchange, Levitt said.The Obama\nadministration’s low predictions for 2016 enrollment may also have \"spooked\nthe insurance industry a bit,\" Levitt said. \"More enrollees (means) more\nbusiness for insurers and that more healthy people are coming into the\nmarket.\"UnitedHealth executives told investors in a conference call that\ninsurance holders who sign up after the open enrollment period are\nparticularly expensive. Those patients, who are able to obtain coverage after\na life event such as losing a job or having a child, have been among the most\nactive users of the insurance plans.Obamacare established a network of federal\nand state exchanges through which individuals who do not have insurance\nthrough their employer can obtain coverage — often with federal tax credits\nand subsidies. Insurers’ participation in the exchanges is optional._USA TODAY\nreporter Matt Krantz contributed to this story.__Follow USA TODAY reporter\nNathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey._\n\n", "title" : "UnitedHealth warns it may exit Obamacare plans", "twitter" : { "body" : "The nation's largest health insurer, UnitedHealth, warns it may quit Obamacare : http://usat.ly/1X2wgTa pic.twitter.com/WEgfxDpW6w", "link" : "https://twitter.com/USATODAY/status/667707795546984448", "retweets" : 72, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-11-19T22:15:18.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 32, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "667707795546984448" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "usatoday", "link" : "http://usat.ly/1X2wgTa" }

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was\nabsent.The legislation still must be approved by the House, which passed a\ndifferent version in October. The White House said Wednesday that Obama will\nveto the bill if it reaches his desk.Democrats say the 2010 Affordable Care\nAct — better known as Obamacare — has helped 17.6 million Americans gain\nmedical coverage and has stopped insurance companies from refusing to insure\npatients with pre-existing conditions.\"Everybody knows (repeal) is a gesture\nin futility,\" said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., before the vote.\n\"Let's move on from repeal and start making the Affordable Care Act work even\nbetter for the American people.\"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,\nsaid Obamacare has raised health care costs, limited patients' ability to\nchoose their doctors, and hurt the already struggling middle class.\"I think\nDemocrats have a particular responsibility to the millions their law has hurt\nalready to help pass (the repeal),\" McConnell said. \"I think the president has\na particular responsibility to the millions his law has hurt already to then\nsign it.\"Senate Republicans have tried more than a dozen times before to pass\nlegislation to repeal Obamacare, but they could not get the 60 votes needed to\novercome Democratic filibusters. In Thursday's vote, Republicans were able to\nprevent a Democratic filibuster by using a budget procedure known as\nreconciliation that allowed them to pass the bill with a simple majority.The\nbill would gut key sections of the health care law, including the mandate for\nindividuals to buy health insurance and for employers with more than 50\nworkers to provide it. It eliminates all fines for people and companies that\nfail to comply with the mandate.It also would eliminate federal subsidies to\nabout 6 million low- and moderate-income Americans buying their own insurance.\nAnd it would halt Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid for the poor, which has\nbeen adopted by more than 30 states. Those two provisions would take effect in\ntwo years, giving Republicans until after the 2016 election to come up with a\nnew plan to replace the existing program.Senators voted 90-10 to pass an\namendment by Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., that would repeal taxes set to be\nimposed in 2018 on expensive \"Cadillac\" insurance plans provided by employers.\nThose taxes are supposed to be used to help pay for medical coverage for\nuninsured people. Critics said the taxes would hurt workers by reducing the\nbenefits their employers provide or raising the amount of money that employees\nmust pay for their coverage.The bill also would strip federal funding for one\nyear from Planned Parenthood, which has been under attack by conservatives\nsince anti-abortion activists released undercover videos earlier this year\nallegedly showing group officials talking about selling tissue from aborted\nfetuses.

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was\nabsent.The legislation still must be approved by the House, which passed a\ndifferent version in October. The White House said Wednesday that Obama will\nveto the bill if it reaches his desk.Democrats say the 2010 Affordable Care\nAct — better known as Obamacare — has helped 17.6 million Americans gain\nmedical coverage and has stopped insurance companies from refusing to insure\npatients with pre-existing conditions.\"Everybody knows (repeal) is a gesture\nin futility,\" said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., before the vote.\n\"Let's move on from repeal and start making the Affordable Care Act work even\nbetter for the American people.\"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,\nsaid Obamacare has raised health care costs, limited patients' ability to\nchoose their doctors, and hurt the already struggling middle class.\"I think\nDemocrats have a particular responsibility to the millions their law has hurt\nalready to help pass (the repeal),\" McConnell said. \"I think the president has\na particular responsibility to the millions his law has hurt already to then\nsign it.\"Senate Republicans have tried more than a dozen times before to pass\nlegislation to repeal Obamacare, but they could not get the 60 votes needed to\novercome Democratic filibusters. In Thursday's vote, Republicans were able to\nprevent a Democratic filibuster by using a budget procedure known as\nreconciliation that allowed them to pass the bill with a simple majority.The\nbill would gut key sections of the health care law, including the mandate for\nindividuals to buy health insurance and for employers with more than 50\nworkers to provide it. It eliminates all fines for people and companies that\nfail to comply with the mandate.It also would eliminate federal subsidies to\nabout 6 million low- and moderate-income Americans buying their own insurance.\nAnd it would halt Obamacare's expansion of Medicaid for the poor, which has\nbeen adopted by more than 30 states. Those two provisions would take effect in\ntwo years, giving Republicans until after the 2016 election to come up with a\nnew plan to replace the existing program.Senators voted 90-10 to pass an\namendment by Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., that would repeal taxes set to be\nimposed in 2018 on expensive \"Cadillac\" insurance plans provided by employers.\nThose taxes are supposed to be used to help pay for medical coverage for\nuninsured people. Critics said the taxes would hurt workers by reducing the\nbenefits their employers provide or raising the amount of money that employees\nmust pay for their coverage.The bill also would strip federal funding for one\nyear from Planned Parenthood, which has been under attack by conservatives\nsince anti-abortion activists released undercover videos earlier this year\nallegedly showing group officials talking about selling tissue from aborted\nfetuses. Planned Parenthood has denied making any profit from the sale of\nfetal tissue.

More on those in a\nmoment.During their debate Thursday night, the Republican presidential\naspirants took their obligatory shots at Obamacare. Ted Cruz tipped his hat to\nthe \"the single moms who are working two and three jobs, 28, 29 hours a week\nbecause their hours have been forcibly reduced because of Obamacare,\" which he\ncalled \"the biggest job-killer in America.\" He promised to \"repeal every\nword,\" a pledge echoed by Marco Rubio.Earlier in the day, Donald Trump\nreleased his own healthcare plan, taking a swipe at \"the incredible economic\nburden\" of the Affordable Care Act. His proposal turned out to be largely a\nrehash of Republican shibboleths such as allowing the sale of policies across\nstate lines, elimination of the individual mandate, and expansion of health\nsavings accounts, the tax benefits of which flow disproportionately to the\nrich. Nothing in it supports his promise to protect people with preexisting\nconditions; on its face, it would leave them in the lurch.  Now for what the\nAffordable Care Act actually has achieved.Every organization examining the\nuninsured rate has found the same trend: The rate has come down since the\nimplementation of the Affordable Care Act.Every organization examining the\nuninsured rate has found the same trend: The rate has come down since the\nimplementation of the Affordable Care Act.As the Department of Health and\nHuman Services reported Thursday, \"20 million uninsured adults have gained\nhealth insurance because of the Affordable Care Act as of early 2016.\" The\nfigure includes 17.7 million who gained coverage via the insurance exchanges\nor Medicaid, and 2.3 million young adults age 19 to 25 who were able to remain\non a parent's plan up to age 26.The overall uninsured rate has been cut by\nnearly half, from 20.3% in 2012 to 11.5% now. The trend includes every ethnic\ngroup and both genders; for whites and non-Hispanic blacks, the reduction in\nthe uninsured rate exceeds 50%, and for Hispanics the rate has come down from\n41.8% to 30.5%.What about the employment effect cited by Cruz? It's not\nvisible in the real numbers. Since the Affordable Care Act was signed on March\n23, 2010, full-time employment growth has been strong and the number of people\nemployed part-time for economic reasons has consistently fallen.  Since 2010,\nthe U.S. has experienced an almost unbroken string of months with job\ngrowth.Since 2010, the U.S. has experienced an almost unbroken string of\nmonths with job growth.The number of workers taking part-time jobs for\n\"economic reasons\" -- that is, because they sought full-time work but couldn't\nfind it, has fallen steadly since the implementation of the Affordable Care\nAct. The number of workers taking part-time jobs for \"economic reasons\" --\nthat is, because they sought full-time work but couldn't find it, has fallen\nsteadly since the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. Meanwhile, total\nemployment has consistently risen.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71cb4955d14d6f80767b0" }, "content" : "The one common element in assertions that thousands of Americans are \"gaming\"\nObamacare by not signing up for health insurance until they get sick, thereby\nsticking beleaguered insurance companies with a big bill, is that none of\nthese assertions come attached to any hard numbers.Late last year, the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services invited insurers to produce the\nnumbers, if they had them. It did so by proposing to tighten up on the so-\ncalled special enrollment periods, or SEPs, that allowed individuals to enroll\nin health plans outside the once-a-year open-enrollment window, and asking\ninsurers to submit comments and data on the proposal. Most big insurers\nsubmitted comments, as did AHIP, the health insurance industry's trade group.\nNone that I reviewed offered any empirical data -- just blanket assertions\nthat people are gaming the system.This has become an article of faith and a\ncore complaint among insurers. The indispensable Charles Gaba of\nACASignups.net posted a good update on the controversy on Tuesday. My\nskeptical take on the complaints appeared in December. Since then, nothing has\nemerged to give substance to the insurers' complaints. \"We haven't seen any\ncomments laying out systematic abuse,\" said Laurel Lucia, healthcare program\nmanager at UC Berkeley's Center for Labor Research and Education.With the\ntraditional attack points on the Affordable Care Act having faded away--most\nenrollees were already insured (wrong), millions of people lost their coverage\nand couldn't replace it (wrong), etc.--Obamacare's critics have been looking\nfor new ones.An up-and-coming star of this firmament...With the traditional\nattack points on the Affordable Care Act having faded away--most enrollees\nwere already insured (wrong), millions of people lost their coverage and\ncouldn't replace it (wrong), etc.--Obamacare's critics have been looking for\nnew ones.An up-and-coming star of this firmament...Instead, she argues in a\nrecent article on the blog Health Affairs, the evidence points in the opposite\ndirection -- that the majority of individuals eligible for SEPs _aren't_\ntaking advantage of them. Many of them are relatively young and healthy, so\nthe result is that a disproportionate number of SEP enrollees are sicker than\nthe general population. That's exactly the trend that insurers should want to\navoid. The indications are that the insurers are wrongly treating SEPs as\ntheir enemy, when they should be trying to make them work better.  Indeed,\nsome of the comments filed with HHS about SEPs seemed to be flagrant\nexaggerations of the problem. Aetna, for example, argued that slack\nenforcement of SEPs \"poses significant threats [sic] to the viability of the\nrisk pool.\" The company counted \"40+ SEPs for on-exchange coverage,\" which\n\"leave individuals with little incentive to enroll in coverage during open\nenrollment, since they can wait until they are sick ... and drop coverage\nimmediately after receiving services.\" Is this plausible? To begin with, it's\nhard to see how Aetna came up with more than 40 SEPs, unless it's slicing them\nvery thin. Aetna didn't list them, and my generous examination of those listed\nby the government, treating every minor variation as a separate SEP, still\ncame up in the mid-20s. (Is \"gain or become a dependent due to to a child\nsupport or other court order\" one SEP? Two? Four?)The truth is that the SEPs\nfall into a handful of well-understood categories. These include \"life events\"\nsuch as getting married or divorced; becoming or gaining a dependent via\nbirth, adoption or placement in foster care; or losing a job and the coverage\nthat came with it. The qualifying events unique to the Affordable Care Act or\nother government assistance programs include becoming a U.S. citizen, moving\nto a new state or sometimes within a state, or experiencing a change of income\nthat makes one newly eligible or ineligible for government subsidies. The\ngovernment also allows special enrollments if a conventional enrollment was\nscrewed up through no fault of the enrollee. Some of these categories are\nexpansive, but not all of them are entirely under the consumer's control, and\nfor Aetna to argue that they cover so many people that it leaves \"little\nincentive to enroll in coverage during open enrollment\" is simply\npreposterous.Aetna must think the entire country consists of people plotting\nhow to get a quickie marriage or divorce or have a baby just in case they get\nsick. The vast majority of SEPs cover a relatively trivial number of cases,\nunless you think there are hordes of people applying to become members of a\nNative American tribe after they get sick.The insurers typically assert that\nan inordinately high percentage of new customers are coming in through special\nenrollment periods -- as many as 20%, by some reckonings -- and that those\ncustomers are unusually heavy users of medical services, especially in the\nfirst months after enrollment. That indicates \"'buying to use' behavior,\" the\ngiant insurer Anthem said in its statement to HHS. Nothing new to see here,\nfolks: Churn has long been a feature of the individual health insurance\nmarket, despite insurers' claims that it's a post-Obamacare phenomenon.Nothing\nnew to see here, folks: Churn has long been a feature of the individual health\ninsurance market, despite insurers' claims that it's a post-Obamacare\nphenomenon.But that's far from clear, Lucia said. She noted that the\nindividual insurance market always has been subject to short enrollments and\nheavy \"churn\"; a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation in 2014 found that of\npeople covered by individual policies in January 2010, only 62% still had that\ncoverage by July and fewer than half were still on it after two years. The\nreason is that many people used it just as a bridge to employer-sponsored\ninsurance or a government program such as Medicare. That's still the case.As\nfor the mob undeservedly exploiting SEPs, there's extensive evidence that the\nopposite is true. A study by the Urban Institute last year estimated that as\nmany as 85% of people who were eligible to use SEPs to obtain insurance or\nfill coverage gaps failed to do so. Similarly, a study published last year by\nthe University of Minnesota found a similar failure of outreach: \"A large\nnumber of people are potentially eligible for special enrollment periods, and\nthe majority of them are uninsured.\"Those researchers, like Lucia and HHS\nofficials, have found that millions of SEP-eligible consumers remain unaware\nof their eligibility despite efforts by government agencies to find and\neducate them.That leaves only the most motivated consumers to take advantage\nof SEPs -- those with medical needs. That doesn't mean they're deliberately\ngaming the system, only that they're inclined to investigate their options.\nIronically, tightening up the SEPs by shortening the windows of eligibility or\nrequiring more documentation from those experiencing life events is likely to\nexacerbate the prevalence of sicker consumers in the SEP group. Forcing\nyounger or healthy consumers to jump through more hoops before gaining\ncoverage will prompt them to give up earlier than sicker patients. The answer,\nLucia said, is to make special enrollment more accessible to eligible people,\nnot to find ways to turn them away. In California, for example, she proposed\nthat the state insurance exchange, Covered California, coordinate with the\nstate Employment Development Department \"to connect individuals receiving\nunemployment insurance with health insurance.\" The Department of Motor\nVehicles could notify Covered California when people change their\naddresses.What may be most important is to treat assertions of widespread\ngaming with a jaundiced eye. Insurance companies like nothing better than to\nsimplify their business by eliminating uncertainties, including special\nenrollments. The fact that they all claim to see gaming happening, but can't\nor won't cite statistics or produce documents to prove it, should make\neveryone suspicious -- of them.**Keep up to date with Michael Hiltzik.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71cb4955d14d6f80767b1" }, "content" : " Since presidential candidate Hillary Clinton quietly updated the healthcare\npolicy page on her campaign website over the last few days, most commentators\nhave focused on the especially notable paragraphs stating that she will\n\"continue to support a 'public option' — and work to build on the Affordable\nCare Act to make it possible.\" The policy page includes several other elements\naimed at improving the Affordable Care Act, including broadening the\naccessibility of heath coverage to otherwise excluded populations and reducing\nits cost. More on those in a moment.Clinton's support of the public option has\ndrawn the most attention because it revives a provision of healthcare reform\nthat was dropped from the ACA during the drafting and debate era of 2009-2010\n— to the disadvantage of the package as a whole, in the view of many\nreformers.It's also Clinton's strongest counterpunch to the single-payer plan\nproposed by her Democratic opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an\nexcessively expensive program that would start reform from square one and\neliminate many of the cost controls written into the ACA. Along with her other\nproposals, it's a reproach to Republican presidential candidates whose only\nidea is to scrap Obamacare in its entirety, without seriously contemplating\nhow to cover Americans in its stead. However you feel about Obamacare, the\ndifference in their approaches is unmistakable.As Charles Gaba notes, Clinton\nisn't kidding when she says she supported the public option in the past — the\nevidence can be found among those accursed emails of hers, which document her\nefforts to keep the provision in the bill. (She was acting as an outsider, as\nshe had left the Senate to become secretary of State in January 2009.) The\npublic option, it will be remembered, was a way to provide competition to the\ncommercial insurance industry via a government-run alternative, perhaps using\nMedicaid-level reimbursement rates for doctors and hospitals. The idea was\ndropped under pressure from the insurance industry and replaced with a hybrid\nsystem of nonprofit co-ops, which haven't worked very well. Otto von\nBismarck's famous definition of politics as \"the art of the possible\" gives us\na good assessment of the single-payer health proposal unveiled by Democratic\npresidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Sunday: impossible.  That's not to\nsay that the \"Medicare for All\" plan offered by Sen....Otto von Bismarck's\nfamous definition of politics as \"the art of the possible\" gives us a good\nassessment of the single-payer health proposal unveiled by Democratic\npresidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Sunday: impossible.  That's not to\nsay that the \"Medicare for All\" plan offered by Sen....Clinton's idea is to\nestablish the public option beginning at the state level using existing\nprovisions of the ACA — to \"work with interested governors, using current\nflexibility under the Affordable Care Act, to empower states to establish a\npublic option choice.\"She's referring implicitly to the ACA's section 1332\n\"innovation waivers.\" As Andrew Sprung of xpostfactoid observes, these aim to\nencourage states to develop alternative mechanisms for health coverage, as\nlong as they hew to Obamacare's coverage and affordability standards. The\nbeauty of the proposal, Sprung notes, is that it doesn't require additional\nlegislation.\"It would, however, need funding,\" Sprung notes. That's where\ncooperation between governors and a President Clinton might come in.  And\nthat's where the waiver might come in. If the state could find other means of\nsavings, those measures might be integrated in a waiver proposal with a public\noption. In time, state-level public options could be brought upstream to the\nfederal level and — _presto! —_ you've re-created the original ACA public\noption.Clinton's other proposals reflect a determination to fix the known\nshortcomings of the Affordable Care Act without eroding its consumer\nprotections. She would address the sticker shock of deductibles and co-pays of\nlow-premium individual health plans by providing a tax credit of up to $5,000\nper family to cover those out-of-pocket expenses.Clinton also would increase\ntax subsidies for families by lowering the maximum percentage of income that\nmakes families eligible for premium subsidies to 8.5%, from the current 9.5%.\nAnd she would eliminate the \"family glitch,\" a notorious flaw in the ACA that\nmakes whole families ineligible for premium subsidies if even one member of\nthe family is eligible for employer-paid insurance, even if the workplace plan\nis too expensive to cover them all.Another proposal is to make Medicaid\nexpansion an offer that the last 16 holdout states _—_ all under the control\nof anti-Obamacare Republican governors or legislators _—_ can't refuse.\nClinton's idea is for the federal government to provide 100% of the\nexpansion's cost for the first three years of implementation. Under current\nlaw, the government pays 100% for three years ending this year, after which\nits share declines toward 90% by 2020 and stays there for good.Her hope is\nthat the prospect of more free money will goad these states to climb down from\ntheir ideological resistance, even if the prospect of providing decent health\ncoverage to hundreds of thousands of their lowest-income residents hasn't done\nthe trick. Finally, Clinton is proposing to extend access to Obamacare\nexchange plans to all families, including those of undocumented immigrants.\nTheir exclusion from the right to purchase health plans on ACA exchanges\nserves no purpose except a punitive one, but those most severely punished are\nchildren. **Keep up to date with Michael Hiltzik.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71cb4955d14d6f80767b2" }, "content" : "The notion that mobs of Americans are actively plotting to cheat the\nAffordable Care Act by waiting until they get sick and then finding an excuse\nto sign up for health insurance is cherished by two groups: anti-Obamacare\nconservatives and insurance companies.As we've pointed out in the past,\nneither group has actually come up with data to substantiate their claim that\nthis produces huge losses in the individual exchange market. But there plainly\nare good reasons to close any loopholes. The Department of Health and Human\nServices on Wednesday announced that it would be tightening the verification\nrules for customers signing up for insurance during special enrollment\nperiods. This is the time frame outside the annual three-month open enrollment\nperiod, when anyone can enroll in an individual health plan.Special enrollment\nis reserved mostly for those with a major life change warranting a change in\ninsurance or new enrollment. Under the new federal rules, anyone claiming\neligibility under four major special categories will have to submit\ndocumentation. These categories are the loss of coverage, typically through a\njob loss; a permanent move, usually to a new state; birth, adoption or\nfinancial responsibility for a child; and marriage. The government says these\naccounted for three-fourths of all special enrollments on the federal exchange\nwebsite in the last half of 2015.Covered California, the state's ACA exchange,\nis also taking steps. Following a presentation on the potential cost of\nineligible enrollees taking advantage of special enrollment periods, the\nexchange is moving toward requiring verification of eligibility for some\ncategories starting in June. Covered California's board will vote on the\nmatter in April, but they'll be responding to a report by their actuary that\nsome health plans in the state are so concerned about the higher costs of\ncovering special period enrollees that they might seek additional premium\nincreases of 2% to 5% for next year \"if we do nothing,\" says the exchange's\nexecutive director, Peter V. Lee.With the traditional attack points on the\nAffordable Care Act having faded away--most enrollees were already insured\n(wrong), millions of people lost their coverage and couldn't replace it\n(wrong), etc.--Obamacare's critics have been looking for new ones.An up-and-\ncoming star of this firmament...With the traditional attack points on the\nAffordable Care Act having faded away--most enrollees were already insured\n(wrong), millions of people lost their coverage and couldn't replace it\n(wrong), etc.--Obamacare's critics have been looking for new ones.An up-and-\ncoming star of this firmament...The one common element in assertions that\nthousands of Americans are \"gaming\" Obamacare by not signing up for health\ninsurance until they get sick, thereby sticking beleaguered insurance\ncompanies with a big bill, is that none of these assertions come attached to\nany hard numbers.Late last year,...The one common element in assertions that\nthousands of Americans are \"gaming\" Obamacare by not signing up for health\ninsurance until they get sick, thereby sticking beleaguered insurance\ncompanies with a big bill, is that none of these assertions come attached to\nany hard numbers.Late last year,...\"We're very mindful of the impact of a\npremium increase of 2% to 5%,\" Lee says. That wouldn't be enough to provoke\nthe dreaded insurance \"death spiral\" in which higher premiums drive off\nhealthier customers, leaving progressively sicker populations to dominate the\nrisk pool and sending premiums even higher, but it would certainly burden\nenrollees who don't receive premium subsidies and thus might be inclined to\ndrop their coverage.It's unlikely that ineligible enrollees alone are the\ncause of reported losses by ACA insurers. UnitedHealth Group, which has\nemerged as the emblematic big insurer unhappy with the ACA market, has said\nthat it lost $475 million in that market last year and has already reserved\n$245 million against losses this year. Losses on that scale would require\nmassive gaming by thousands of customers; the root cause of the problems seen\nby United may be that, inexperienced in the individual market, the firm\nunderpriced its health plans to attract customers and suffered buyer's remorse\nwhen the customers turned out to be sicker than it expected.The question isn't\nwhether there's _any_ gaming going on; in any market as large as the ACA's,\nwith as many facets, there are surely some people who face the desperation of\nbig medical bills, have figured out how to take advantage and found the\nopportunity to do so.Whether there are so many \"gamers\" that Obamacare itself\nis threatened, or so many loopholes that it makes no sense for a rational\nperson to sign up for insurance during annual open enrollment periods, as\nAetna asserted in a recent government filing, is doubtful. Among other\nfactors, most people would prefer to have insurance than go without -- that's\nwhy there was public pressure on Congress and the White House to reform the\nhealth insurance market in the first place.Some complaints from insurers are\nconsistent with the expected profile of special enrollees. For several\nreasons, they tend to be sicker or have higher health needs than the general\npublic. An uninsured individual who falls ill is more likely to be on the\nlookout for the opportunity to enroll, but that's not the same as deliberately\nwaiting. Also, newborn babies, who probably account for a sizable plurality of\nspecial enrollment cases, are \"much more expensive than other children\" and\nremain so for their first year. But how much more expensive should the special\nenrollment pool be, compared to the overall exchange population? Among\nCalifornia's four largest exchange insurers, one found no difference in the\ncost of the two pools. The other three, however, cited differentials ranging\nfrom 15% to 50%, all of which seemed higher than expected.Another point of\nconcern was that insurers told the Covered California staff that demanding\nproof of special enrollment eligibility from applicants in the off-exchange\nmarket -- these are higher-income customers ineligible for premium subsidies\n-- made 15% to 35% of them \"disappear,\" a possible indication that at least\nsome weren't really eligible. (Asking people to jump through hoops typically\ndrives even some eligible applicants away, especially those who may be healthy\nand not desperate for coverage.) Off-exchange members account for about a\nthird of the more than 1.8 million enrollees in the California individual\nmarket.Some health plans documented \"hundreds of cases\" in which off-exchange\napplicants denied coverage because they couldn't produce proof simply\nreapplied via California and signed up without documentation, Covered\nCalifornia says. Even in the face of these vague indications of gaming,\nCovered California actually is stepping up its outreach to potential special\nenrollees, rolling out radio and digital ad campaigns to make sure that those\nwho are eligible know it.  It probably makes sense for the federal and state\nexchanges to require documentation of the most common life events, where the\nverifications are easiest to provide. \"We want to maximize enrollment of\npeople who are eligible,\" Lee says, \"but also as a matter of program integrity\nmake sure that people who aren't eligible don't get in.\"Tightening the special\nenrollment rules also could be effective at encouraging people to comply with\nthe individual mandate during open enrollment. Under Obamacare, people who\nlack coverage are subject to a monthly tax penalty. For the current year, the\npenalty is 2.5% of income, or $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, to a\nmaximum of $2,085. That's a pittance compared to the cost of obtaining\ntreatment without insurance for a serious disease. Knowing that the loopholes\nfor special enrollment have been sewn shut could make people think more\nseriously about the cost of bad health.\"The penalty pales in significance,\"\nLee says, \"compared to getting a diagnosis of uterine cancer in June and\ngetting stuck with a $100,000 bill.\"**Keep up to date with Michael Hiltzik.\nFollow @hiltzikm on Twitter, see our Facebook page, or email\nmichael.hiltzik@latimes.com.**\n\n", "title" : "Obamacare 'gaming' update: Feds, California tighten up on documentation for special enrollments - LA Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Government tightens Obamacare enrollment rules despite lack of evidence of cheaters http://lat.ms/1WJNaRY pic.twitter.com/yk0zpsjJjM", "link" : "https://twitter.com/latimes/status/702669380300247046", "retweets" : 21, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-24T09:40:09.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 19, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "702669380300247046" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "latimes", "link" : "http://lat.ms/1WJNaRY" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71cb4955d14d6f80767b3" }, "content" : "U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination,\nhas revealed on the campaign trail that his family no longer is covered by\nhealth insurance. Naturally, he blames the Affordable Care Act: \"I’ll tell\nyou, you know who one of those millions of Americans is who’s lost their\nhealthcare because of Obamacare? That would be me,\" he told an audience in\nManchester, N.H., according to Politico. \"I don’t have healthcare right\nnow.\"If you pay attention, however, you'll discover that Cruz’s quandary is\nentirely his own fault. His, and his Republican colleagues in the Senate.\n_[UPDATE: It turns out that Cruz actually is insured and always was, as his\ncampaign disclosed late Friday. This makes his remark about his losing his\ncoverage because of the Affordable Care Act look even more like pure political\nspin. Read on, and see more below.]_Essentially, Cruz’s coverage lapsed\nbecause his 2015 carrier, BlueCross BlueShield of Texas, ended its individual\nPPO plans for 2016, including the family plan that covered the Cruz family.\nThe carrier decided to move entirely to HMO plans for the individual market.\nAnd Cruz didn’t manage to sign up for a new 2016 plan by Dec. 31. That\nhappened even though the insurer announced its decision to close PPO plans way\nback on July 23. Five months is normally enough for an educated adult to\narrange health insurance. Cruz still has until Jan. 31 to sign up for coverage\nbeginning March 1, and he said he’d be doing that. \"We’re in the process of\nfinding another policy,\" he said. \"I hope by the end of the month we’ll have a\npolicy for our family.\"In other words, Cruz’s problem has nothing to do with\nObamacare and everything to do with his own sloth — unless the explanation is\nmore sinister, as insurance expert Richard Mayhew of balloon-juice.com\nspeculates: \"The Cruz family is currently uninsured to guarantee their father\na cheap laugh line.\" In the latest attempt by congressional Republicans to\nmake theatrical hay out of the Affordable Care Act without actually trying to\nmake it any better, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) tried to make a\npublic spectacle out of his own experience signing up for a health plan.Things\ndidn't turn...In the latest attempt by congressional Republicans to make\ntheatrical hay out of the Affordable Care Act without actually trying to make\nit any better, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) tried to make a public\nspectacle out of his own experience signing up for a health plan.Things didn't\nturn...It is widely held that the dopiest anti-Obamacare lawsuit is King vs.\nBurwell, a conservative contrivance that tortures four words in the Affordable\nCare Act to assert that consumer healthcare subsidies in three dozen states\nshould be invalidated.But the Supreme Court has taken up King for a\nruling,...It is widely held that the dopiest anti-Obamacare lawsuit is King\nvs. Burwell, a conservative contrivance that tortures four words in the\nAffordable Care Act to assert that consumer healthcare subsidies in three\ndozen states should be invalidated.But the Supreme Court has taken up King for\na ruling,...What’s more certain is that Cruz’s characterization of his issue\nis layered with dishonesty. He claims that the new plans he has examined carry\npremium increases of 50% — \"That’s happening all over the country,\" he said.\n\"That’s happening in New Hampshire.\"Well, no. Cruz wasn’t especially\nforthcoming with details about his old plan or the new ones he’s examining,\nbut average rate increases in the individual market in Texas aren’t anywhere\nnear 50%. No single carrier is getting a rate increase that high; the largest\nis 34%, for a very tiny carrier. At some companies, including BlueCross\nBlueShield, some rates actually decreased. In New Hampshire, the biggest plans\nhad increases in the single digits. At Anthem, the largest individual insurer,\nsome rates decreased.It’s proper to examine why Cruz is looking for insurance\non the individual exchange in the first place. Until last year, the Cruz\nfamily got its coverage from his wife’s employer, Goldman Sachs. But after she\ntook an unpaid leave of absence from her job to help him run for president,\nthey had to find coverage from his employer — the federal government.\nNormally, Cruz would be eligible for the standard government health insurance\nplan enjoyed by all government employees. But thanks to a deliberate monkey\nwrench forged by Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) during the drafting of the\nAffordable Care Act, members of Congress and their staffs are required to get\ntheir insurance through the exchanges — a biting-your-nose-off-to-spite-your-\nface stunt that increased the complexity of health coverage for them all,\nsince the ACA wasn't designed to substitute for employer insurance.Cruz is\nstill eligible for the government’s employer subsidy of up to 75% of his\nhealth insurance premium. He has said he wouldn’t accept the employer share,\nwhich makes his complaint about his cost of insurance just a teeny bit more\ndishonest because he’s the one driving up his own premium.Cruz’s lament is\nsadly typical of congressional critics of Obamacare, including former Speaker\nJohn Boehner, who made the claim in 2013 that his insurance rates had \"spiked\"\nbecause of Obamacare. It was just as bogus as Cruz’s complaint, as we\ndemonstrated here. Former Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) claimed in 2014 that\nObamacare had cost him his cancer doctor. Typically, his office refused to\nprovide any details, including why the 65-year-old Coburn was using an ACA\nplan instead of Medicare. That’s the state of Obamacare criticism on the GOP\nside of the aisle. They insist they want to \"repeal and replace\" Obamacare.\nBecause they can’t offer any legitimate reasons to do so, they’re stuck with\nmaking them up._[More on the Cruz campaign's backtracking: A campaign\nspokesman told the Wall Street Journal that the Cruz family had been\nautomatically enrolled by BlueCross BlueShield in one of its HMOs, or health\nmaintenance organizations, as of Jan. 1, when their former PPO plan expired.\nThe insurance carrier did this for all 2015 PPO enrollees who took no action\nbefore Dec. 31. Cruz presumably should have known this, if he was paying\nattention, as the insurance carrier informed all affected customers of the\nchange.__[The campaign says Cruz has now arranged to switch to a PPO plan\noffered in Texas by Humana, effective March 1.]_**Keep up to date with Michael\nHiltzik.

He predicted\nthe United States would \"play a significant role\" in destroying ISIS\nthere.**9:32 p.m.** It's Trump's turn to provide specifics about defeating\nISIS. He said the U.S. must be trying harder to \"knock the hell out of the\noil\" and take the oil ISIS holds and not worry about environmental impacts,\nand to also cut off ISIS financing.\"Nobody knows banking better than I do,\" he\nsaid.Asked what to do about the cities that ISIS controls, Trump said ISIS\nwill be weakened when their wealth disappears.**9:29 p.m.** Rubio is similarly\nasked to elaborate on his proposal to use \"overwhelming U.S. force\" to defeat\nISIS. He talked about building a ground force of Sunnis backed by a U.S.-led\ncoalition that also includes Jordanians and Egyptians, but also called for\nstrikes against the group in every part of the world where they have\naffiliates.Raddatz noted that Rubio has called ISIS the most dangerous terror\ngroup in the world -- more dangerous than al Qaeda, which the U.S. committed a\nhuge ground force to defeat. Why not send in a large U.S. ground force\nnow?\"They currently occupty Sunni cities and villages. Sunni cities and\nvillages can only truly be liberated by Sunnis themselves,\" Rubio said. \"Kurds\ncannot and do not want to liberate and hold Sunni cities and towns.\"**9:26\np.m. **Cruz further discusses his proposal to \"carpet-bomb\" the Islamic State\nof Iraq and Syria (ISIS), saying it would be \"not indiscriminate,\" but rather\ntargeted at oil tankers, oil facilities, command and control locations and\ninfrastructure. He also said the rules of engagement should be loosened.**9:23\np.m.** Bush has a pithy line when asked about the statistic that 68 percent of\nAmericans favor tax increases on people making more than a million.\"I'd like\nto see more millionaires,\" Bush said. \"This notion that somehow we're\nundertaxed as a nation is just foolhardly.\"**9:19 p.m. **Christie defends\nhimself against attacks on New Jersey's economic record as compared to\nKasich's record in Ohio.\"He deserves credit for his record on jobs, he's doing\na very good job in Ohio.\" But, Christie also said there were 10,000 fewer\nemployees than when he took office. \"John has a bigger government now and more\nemployees than he had when he walked in the door,\" he said.Kasich said Ohio's\ngovernment has grown with the rate of inflation and that there are the lowest\nnumber of state employees in 30 years.**9:15 p.m. **Some definitions of\nconservatism from the candidates:Kasich: \"In America, conservatism should mean\nthat nto only some rise with conservative principles, but that everybody has\nthe ability to rise...so they can live their God-given purpose.\"Trump: \"I view\nconservatism as a derivative of the word conserve. We want to conserve our\nmoney. We want to conserve our wealth...we want to conserve our country, we\nwant to save our country.\"Rubio: \"It's about three things. the first is\nconservatism is about limited government, especially at the federal\nlevel...it's about free enterprise, which is an economic model that allows\neverybody to rise without pulling anybody down...and it's about a strong\nnational defense.\"**9:06 p.m**A new debate question from WMUR political\ndirector Josh McElveen asks about the use of eminent domain in New Hampshire\nfor the Northern Pass project.\"Eminent domain is an absolute necessity for a\ncountry, for our country,\" he said, arguing there would be no roads,\nhospitals, schools or bridges without it. \"The Keystone pipeline without\neminent domain, it wouldn't go 10 feet,\" he added.When eminent domain is used\non somebody's property that person gets a fortune. They get at least fair\nmarket value and if they're smart they'll get at least two or three times the\nvalue of their property.\"Bush accuses Trump of using eminent domain to take\nover the property of a woman in Atlantic City.\"I didn't take the property,\"\nTrump said. \"The woman ultimately didn't want to do that.\"\"To turn this into a\nlimousine parking lot for his casinos is not a public use,\" Bush said.As Trump\nmocks Bush for \"trying to be a tough guy,\" Bush responds, \"How tough is it to\ntake away property from an elderly woman.\"The crowd boos Trump for telling\nBush, \"quiet,\" and Trump says it's all of Bush's donors and special interests\nin the audience.\"The reason they're not loving me is I don't want their\nmoney,\" he said.**8:58 p.m. **Trump is pressed over specific details of what\nhe would do about health care as moderator Mary Katharine Ham noted he has\nsaid \"everybody's got to be covered\" and also \"the government's got to pay for\nit.\" \"We are going to repeal Obamacare, we are going to replace Obamacare with\nsomething so much better and there are so many examples of it,\" Trump said. He\nargued the insurance companies are \"getting rich\" and he's going to end that\nby taking out the \"artificial lines\" between insurance companies to encourage\nfree enterprise.\"There will be a certain number of people that will be on the\nstreet dying and as a Republican I don't want that to happen,\" he added.When\nCruz is asked what he would say to people who gained coverage under Obamacare\nand are worried about losing it, he warned about \"socialized\nmedicine.\"\"Socialized medicine is a disaster. It does not work. If you look at\nthe countries that have imposed socialized medicine...what inevitably happens\nis rationing...the elderly are told 'we're going to ration a hip replacement,\nwe're going to ration a knee replacement, we're going to ration end-of-life\ncare,'\" he said. \"Socialized medicine whether proposed by a Democrat or\nproposed by a Republican would hurt the people of this country,\" he\nsaid.**8:53 p.m. **Once again, Rubio is asked about his support for the 2013\ncomprehensive Senate legislation that would have provided a pathway to\ncitizenship for those in the country illegally. \"Did you fight for the\nlegislation at the time or did you run from it?\" Muir asked.\"Here's the bottom\nline,\" Rubio said. \"We cannot get that legislation passed.\" He argued the\nAmerican people have no trust that the federal government will enforce the\nlaws. He, too, promised to enforce the law first as president and said then he\nwould see what the American people support.Christie jumped in to point out\nthat Rubio had skirted the issue.\"The question was did he fight for his\nlegislation. It's abundantly clear that he didn't,\" Christie said. He touted\nhis own record of fighting with teacher's unions and the legislature in New\nJersey.**8:50 p.m. **Kasich is asked how he defends his stance that the U.S.\ncannot possibly deport all people in the country illegally, given that the\nleading Republicans are promising to deport all 11-million plus.\"I cannot even\nbegin to imagine\" taking parents out of their house if they had not committed\na crime and leaving their children behind, Kasich said.Cruz is asked to give\nspecifics on how he would deport so many people, and he launches into his plan\nto secure the border -- and says, looking at Trump, that he has \"someone in\nmind\" to build the wall on the border.He said an employment verification\nsystem and biometric tracking for visas, as well as ending \"sanctuary cities\"\nand welfare benefits for those in the U.S. illegally, will end the presence of\nthose in the U.S. illegally.\"What you do is you enforce the law,\" he said,\nwhen pressed about the point Kasich made about not breaking up families.**8:48\np.m. **Another North Korea question: Bush is asked what he would do about an\nAmerican college student who was recently detained there.\"It's interesting\nhtat htat happened literally days when this hostage release took place in\nIran, a day or two days afterwards,\" he said. \"I think it's when we send a\nsignall of weakness when we're negotiating to release people who committed\ncrimes in our country for people who didn't commit crimes in Iran.\"\"The next\npresident of the United States is going to have to get back in the game where\nthe United States' word matters,\" he added.Christie echoed that idea.\"You\nnever pay ransom to the criminals, ever,\" he said. He added the U.S. must\n\"engage in a much different way with these folks. They do not understand\nanything but toughness and strength.\"**8:44 p.m.** Trump jumps in to say he\ndisagrees with Rubio's assessment that Mr. Obama knows what he's doing.

Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco\nRubio, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New\nJersey Gov. Chris Christie, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.This is the only\nRepublican debate to take place between the Iowa caucuses and the New\nHampshire primary. Cruz won the Iowa Republican caucuses, followed by Donald\nTrump, and then Marco Rubio. Trump and Rubio were separated by a single\npercentage point in the race.Going into the Granite State primary, Donald\nTrump holds a double-digit lead in most polls, with Rubio in second. Several\ncandidates on the debate stage, including the three former and current state\ngovernors, have invested a large amount of time and campaign resources on the\nNew Hampshire primary contest.This debate, hosted by ABC News and the\nIndependent Journal Review, is the first to exclude an undercard debate stage\nfor Republicans.Despite attempts by Carly Fiorina to be included on the debate\nstage, ABC News declined. She is the only remaining Republican who has ever\nbeen included on the main debate stage in a primary debate who is being\nexcluded.Banking on other media exposure ahead of New Hampshire's primary on\nTuesday, Fiorina's campaign is set to air an ad in the state during CBS' Super\nBowl broadcast on Sunday. The ad buy, according to the campaign was a six-\nfigure sum.Candidates qualified for the debate stage if they met one of three\nrequirements: finishing in the top three by popular vote in the Iowa caucuses,\nplacing in the top six in an average of New Hampshire polls recognized by ABC\nNews, or polling in the top six in an average of national GOP polls deemed\nvalid by the network.ABC News anchor David Muir and ABC News chief global\naffairs correspondent Martha Raddatz will moderate the debate.

You've gotten to know my\nheart.\"**Bush**: \"I want to celebrate the birthday of a great president.\nRonald Reagan would have been 105 today.

There is a\nreason it has been longstanding policy that we don't negotiate with\nterrorists, we don't pay ransoms.\" He slammed President Obama for the deal to\nswap Taliban prisoners for Army Sgt.

Both used the opportunity to call for strengthening the U.S.\nmilitary.**10:12 p.m.** Raddatz recalls Christie's decision to quarantine a\nnurse who had displayed symptoms of Ebola. Would he do that again to stop the\nZika virus from spreading?\"You bet I would,\" he said.Carson, asked whether he\nwould quarantine, said it's not a simple issue.\"Do we quarantine people? If we\nhave evidence they are infected and if we have evidence that infection can\nspread by something they are doing, yes,\" he said. But he would not \"willy-\nnilly\" quarantine people who were returning from Brazil, where the virus has\nspread the fastest.**10:08 p.m.** Would Rubio visit a mosque as president, as\nPresident Obama did this week and former President George W.

He says the U.S. should consult with its military experts to develop\nthat actual plan.\"I would support the possibility of renewed airstrikes if in\nconjunction with our joint chiefs and our military people, they felt that was\nan appropriate military strategy,\" he said when asked whether he would support\nrenewed airstrikes. \"None of us up here is a military expert. We sometimes act\nlike we are, but we're not.\"**9:34 p.m. **Bush said he would support new\nairstrikes in Libya to defeat the outgrowth of ISIS there.\"This is the lesson\nlearned from history: if you bomb something and don't do anything as it\nrelated to the aftermath...you get an unstable government.\"\"Dealing with the\ncaliphate is important because it has now spawned,\" Bush said. He predicted\nthe United States would \"play a significant role\" in destroying ISIS\nthere.**9:32 p.m.** It's Trump's turn to provide specifics about defeating\nISIS.

He talked about building a ground force of Sunnis backed by a U.S.-led\ncoalition that also includes Jordanians and Egyptians, but also called for\nstrikes against the group in every part of the world where they have\naffiliates.Raddatz noted that Rubio has called ISIS the most dangerous terror\ngroup in the world -- more dangerous than al Qaeda, which the U.S. committed a\nhuge ground force to defeat. Why not send in a large U.S. ground force\nnow?\"They currently occupty Sunni cities and villages. Sunni cities and\nvillages can only truly be liberated by Sunnis themselves,\" Rubio said. \"Kurds\ncannot and do not want to liberate and hold Sunni cities and towns.\"**9:26\np.m. **Cruz further discusses his proposal to \"carpet-bomb\" the Islamic State\nof Iraq and Syria (ISIS), saying it would be \"not indiscriminate,\" but rather\ntargeted at oil tankers, oil facilities, command and control locations and\ninfrastructure. He also said the rules of engagement should be loosened.**9:23\np.m.** Bush has a pithy line when asked about the statistic that 68 percent of\nAmericans favor tax increases on people making more than a million.\"I'd like\nto see more millionaires,\" Bush said. \"This notion that somehow we're\nundertaxed as a nation is just foolhardly.\"**9:19 p.m. **Christie defends\nhimself against attacks on New Jersey's economic record as compared to\nKasich's record in Ohio.\"He deserves credit for his record on jobs, he's doing\na very good job in Ohio.\" But, Christie also said there were 10,000 fewer\nemployees than when he took office. \"John has a bigger government now and more\nemployees than he had when he walked in the door,\" he said.Kasich said Ohio's\ngovernment has grown with the rate of inflation and that there are the lowest\nnumber of state employees in 30 years.**9:15 p.m. **Some definitions of\nconservatism from the candidates:Kasich: \"In America, conservatism should mean\nthat nto only some rise with conservative principles, but that everybody has\nthe ability to rise...so they can live their God-given purpose.\"Trump: \"I view\nconservatism as a derivative of the word conserve. We want to conserve our\nmoney. We want to conserve our wealth...we want to conserve our country, we\nwant to save our country.\"Rubio: \"It's about three things. the first is\nconservatism is about limited government, especially at the federal\nlevel...it's about free enterprise, which is an economic model that allows\neverybody to rise without pulling anybody down...and it's about a strong\nnational defense.\"**9:06 p.m**A new debate question from WMUR political\ndirector Josh McElveen asks about the use of eminent domain in New Hampshire\nfor the Northern Pass project.\"Eminent domain is an absolute necessity for a\ncountry, for our country,\" he said, arguing there would be no roads,\nhospitals, schools or bridges without it. \"The Keystone pipeline without\neminent domain, it wouldn't go 10 feet,\" he added.When eminent domain is used\non somebody's property that person gets a fortune. They get at least fair\nmarket value and if they're smart they'll get at least two or three times the\nvalue of their property.\"Bush accuses Trump of using eminent domain to take\nover the property of a woman in Atlantic City.\"I didn't take the property,\"\nTrump said. \"The woman ultimately didn't want to do that.\"\"To turn this into a\nlimousine parking lot for his casinos is not a public use,\" Bush said.As Trump\nmocks Bush for \"trying to be a tough guy,\" Bush responds, \"How tough is it to\ntake away property from an elderly woman.\"The crowd boos Trump for telling\nBush, \"quiet,\" and Trump says it's all of Bush's donors and special interests\nin the audience.\"The reason they're not loving me is I don't want their\nmoney,\" he said.**8:58 p.m. **Trump is pressed over specific details of what\nhe would do about health care as moderator Mary Katharine Ham noted he has\nsaid \"everybody's got to be covered\" and also \"the government's got to pay for\nit.\" \"We are going to repeal Obamacare, we are going to replace Obamacare with\nsomething so much better and there are so many examples of it,\" Trump said. He\nargued the insurance companies are \"getting rich\" and he's going to end that\nby taking out the \"artificial lines\" between insurance companies to encourage\nfree enterprise.\"There will be a certain number of people that will be on the\nstreet dying and as a Republican I don't want that to happen,\" he added.When\nCruz is asked what he would say to people who gained coverage under Obamacare\nand are worried about losing it, he warned about \"socialized\nmedicine.\"\"Socialized medicine is a disaster. It does not work. If you look at\nthe countries that have imposed socialized medicine...what inevitably happens\nis rationing...the elderly are told 'we're going to ration a hip replacement,\nwe're going to ration a knee replacement, we're going to ration end-of-life\ncare,'\" he said. \"Socialized medicine whether proposed by a Democrat or\nproposed by a Republican would hurt the people of this country,\" he\nsaid.**8:53 p.m. **Once again, Rubio is asked about his support for the 2013\ncomprehensive Senate legislation that would have provided a pathway to\ncitizenship for those in the country illegally. \"Did you fight for the\nlegislation at the time or did you run from it?\" Muir asked.\"Here's the bottom\nline,\" Rubio said. \"We cannot get that legislation passed.\" He argued the\nAmerican people have no trust that the federal government will enforce the\nlaws. He, too, promised to enforce the law first as president and said then he\nwould see what the American people support.Christie jumped in to point out\nthat Rubio had skirted the issue.\"The question was did he fight for his\nlegislation. It's abundantly clear that he didn't,\" Christie said. He touted\nhis own record of fighting with teacher's unions and the legislature in New\nJersey.**8:50 p.m. **Kasich is asked how he defends his stance that the U.S.\ncannot possibly deport all people in the country illegally, given that the\nleading Republicans are promising to deport all 11-million plus.\"I cannot even\nbegin to imagine\" taking parents out of their house if they had not committed\na crime and leaving their children behind, Kasich said.Cruz is asked to give\nspecifics on how he would deport so many people, and he launches into his plan\nto secure the border -- and says, looking at Trump, that he has \"someone in\nmind\" to build the wall on the border.He said an employment verification\nsystem and biometric tracking for visas, as well as ending \"sanctuary cities\"\nand welfare benefits for those in the U.S. illegally, will end the presence of\nthose in the U.S. illegally.\"What you do is you enforce the law,\" he said,\nwhen pressed about the point Kasich made about not breaking up families.**8:48\np.m. **Another North Korea question: Bush is asked what he would do about an\nAmerican college student who was recently detained there.\"It's interesting\nhtat htat happened literally days when this hostage release took place in\nIran, a day or two days afterwards,\" he said. \"I think it's when we send a\nsignall of weakness when we're negotiating to release people who committed\ncrimes in our country for people who didn't commit crimes in Iran.\"\"The next\npresident of the United States is going to have to get back in the game where\nthe United States' word matters,\" he added.Christie echoed that idea.\"You\nnever pay ransom to the criminals, ever,\" he said. He added the U.S. must\n\"engage in a much different way with these folks. They do not understand\nanything but toughness and strength.\"**8:44 p.m.** Trump jumps in to say he\ndisagrees with Rubio's assessment that Mr. Obama knows what he's doing. He\ndoesn't know, Trump says, and the country is \"going to hell\" as a result.On\nthe North Korea question, he says he would get on the phone with China and\ndemand they take the lead on dealing with their neighbor.**8:40 p.m.**Cruz is\nasked how, as president, he would respond to news that broke just minutes\nbefore the debate began: North Korea test-launched an intercontinental\nballistic missile.\"The fact that we're seeing the launch and we're seeing the\nlaunch from a nuclear North Korea is a result of the failures of the first\nClinton administration\" for relaxing sanctions against the country, Cruz said.\n\"What we are seeing with North Korea is foreshadowing of where we should be\nwith Iran.'\"One of the first things we should do is expand our missile defense\ncapacity\" by putting receptors in South Korea, he added.

Trump and Rubio were separated by a single\npercentage point in the race.Going into the Granite State primary, Donald\nTrump holds a double-digit lead in most polls, with Rubio in second. Several\ncandidates on the debate stage, including the three former and current state\ngovernors, have invested a large amount of time and campaign resources on the\nNew Hampshire primary contest.This debate, hosted by ABC News and the\nIndependent Journal Review, is the first to exclude an undercard debate stage\nfor Republicans.Despite attempts by Carly Fiorina to be included on the debate\nstage, ABC News declined. She is the only remaining Republican who has ever\nbeen included on the main debate stage in a primary debate who is being\nexcluded.Banking on other media exposure ahead of New Hampshire's primary on\nTuesday, Fiorina's campaign is set to air an ad in the state during CBS' Super\nBowl broadcast on Sunday. The ad buy, according to the campaign was a six-\nfigure sum.Candidates qualified for the debate stage if they met one of three\nrequirements: finishing in the top three by popular vote in the Iowa caucuses,\nplacing in the top six in an average of New Hampshire polls recognized by ABC\nNews, or polling in the top six in an average of national GOP polls deemed\nvalid by the network.ABC News anchor David Muir and ABC News chief global\naffairs correspondent Martha Raddatz will moderate the debate. Additional\nquestions will be posed by WMUR political director Josh McElveen and\nconservative blogger Mary Katharine Ham.\n\n", "title" : "Republican debate: Candidates gather for last time before New Hampshire primary - CBS News", "twitter" : { "body" : "If elected president, @realDonaldTrump says he will replace Obamacare http://cbsn.ws/20Ozp7m #GOPDebate pic.twitter.com/0t7G2tANrT", "link" : "https://twitter.com/CBSNews/status/696151553347055616", "retweets" : 61, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-06T10:00:38.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "@realDonaldTrump", "favs" : 117, "hashtags" : "#GOPDebate", "id" : "696151553347055616" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "CBSNews", "link" : "http://cbsn.ws/20Ozp7m" }

The bill also takes aim at federal funding for\nPlanned Parenthood -- a fight Republicans have renewed with vigor since last\nsummer, when an anti-abortion group released undercover videos of Planned\nParenthood employees discussing controversial procedures like fetal tissue\ntransfers. According to Hartzler, the legislation places a \"moratorium on\ntaxpayer funding to abortion providers\" for one year and uses some of that\nmoney to fund other community health centers.\"We have taken many votes to\npreserve health care choices and protect precious tax dollars in the House,\"\nshe said. \"If the president didn't hear the people's voices earlier,\nhopefully, he will through this bill.\" The Senate passed similar legislation\nlast month, narrowly voting through a bill crafted under the budget\nreconciliation process that repeals major parts of the ACA.

{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71cb4955d14d6f80767b9" }, "content" : "Ted Cruz had a teachable moment in Iowa, although he himself will learn\nnothing from it. A voter told Mr. Cruz the story of his brother-in-law, a\nbarber who had never been able to afford health insurance. He finally got\ninsurance thanks to Obamacare — and discovered that it was too late. He had\nterminal cancer, and nothing could be done.The voter asked how the candidate\nwould replace the law that might have saved his brother-in-law if it had been\nin effect earlier. Needless to say, all he got was boilerplate about\ngovernment regulations and the usual false claims that Obamacare has destroyed\n“millions of jobs” and caused premiums to “skyrocket.”For the record, job\ngrowth since the Affordable Care Act went fully into effect has been the best\nsince the 1990s, and health costs have risen much more slowly than before.So\nMr. Cruz has a truth problem. But what else can we learn from this encounter?\nThat the Affordable Care Act is already doing enormous good. It came too late\nto save one man’s life, but it will surely save many others. Why, then, do we\nhear not just conservatives but also many progressives trashing President\nObama’s biggest policy achievement?Part of the answer is that Bernie Sanders\nhas chosen to make re-litigating reform, and trying for single-payer, a\ncenterpiece of his presidential campaign. So some Sanders supporters have\ntaken to attacking Obamacare as a failed system.We saw something similar back\nin 2008, when some Obama supporters temporarily became bitter opponents of the\nindividual mandate — the requirement that everyone buy insurance — which\nHillary Clinton supported but Mr. Obama opposed. (Once in office, he in effect\nconceded that she had been right, and included the mandate in his\ninitiative.)But the truth is, Mr. Sanders is just amplifying left-wing\ncritiques of health reform that were already out there. And some of these\ncritiques have merit. Others don’t.Let’s start with the good critiques, which\ninvolve coverage and cost.The number of uninsured Americans has dropped\nsharply, especially in states that have tried to make the law work. But\nmillions are still uncovered, and in some cases high deductibles make coverage\nless useful than it should be.This isn’t inherent in a non-single-payer\nsystem: Other countries with Obamacare-type systems, like the Netherlands and\nSwitzerland, do have near-universal coverage even though they rely on private\ninsurers. But Obamacare as currently constituted doesn’t seem likely to get\nthere, perhaps because it’s somewhat underfunded.Meanwhile, although cost\ncontrol is looking better than even reform advocates expected, America’s\nhealth care remains much more expensive than anyone else’s.So yes, there are\nreal issues with Obamacare. The question is how to address those issues in a\npolitically feasible way.But a lot of what I hear from the left is not so much\na complaint about how the reform falls short as outrage that private insurers\nget to play any role. The idea seems to be that any role for the profit motive\ntaints the whole effort.That is, however, a really bad critique. Yes,\nObamacare did preserve private insurance — mainly to avoid big, politically\nrisky changes for Americans who already had good insurance, but also to buy\nsupport or at least quiescence from the insurance industry. But the fact that\nsome insurers are making money from reform (and their profits are not, by the\nway, all that large) isn’t a reason to oppose that reform. The point is to\nhelp the uninsured, not to punish or demonize insurance companies.And speaking\nof demonization: One unpleasant, ugly side of this debate has been the\ntendency of some Sanders supporters, and sometimes the campaign itself, to\nsuggest that anyone raising questions about the senator’s proposals must be a\ncorrupt tool of vested interests.Recently Kenneth Thorpe, a respected health\npolicy expert and a longtime supporter of reform, tried to put numbers on the\nSanders plan, and concluded that it would cost substantially more than the\ncampaign says. He may or may not be right, although most of the health wonks I\nknow have reached similar conclusions.But the campaign’s policy director\nimmediately attacked Mr. Thorpe’s integrity: “It’s coming from a gentleman\nthat worked for Blue Cross Blue Shield. It’s exactly what you would expect\nsomebody who worked for B.C.B.S. to come up with.” Oh, boy.And let’s be clear:\nThis kind of thing can do real harm. The truth is that whomever the Democrats\nnominate, the general election is mainly going to be a referendum on whether\nwe preserve the real if incomplete progress we’ve made on health, financial\nreform and the environment. The last thing progressives should be doing is\ntrash-talking that progress and impugning the motives of people who are\nfundamentally on their side.\n\n", "title" : "Who Hates Obamacare? - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Why do progressives trash Obamacare ? http://nyti.ms/1SPr8gQ via @nytopinion", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/695645592081600512", "retweets" : 90, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-05T00:30:08.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "@nytopinion", "favs" : 137, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "695645592081600512" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1SPr8gQ" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71cb4955d14d6f80767ba" }, "content" : "Last year, we encouraged returning Obamacare customers to shop around for a\nbetter deal. This year, a lot of people will have no choice.In markets\nthroughout the country, the plan in the most popular category that was least\nexpensive this year will not be offered next year. That means that some people\nwho took our advice and shopped for a bargain will need to shop again, even if\nthey’re happy with their plan.There are 499 markets for Obamacare plans in the\nUnited States. In 89 of them, the insurance company that offered this year’s\nbest deal in the “silver” category will not be returning for 2016. We’ve\nmarked those areas in dark grey on our map. Most of those exits are a result\nof insurance co-op plans that failed. A few exits came as insurers that are\nstill operating elsewhere decided to leave particular markets. People in these\ncanceled plans can’t simply renew their current policy if they like it — they\nhave to go back into the marketplace and find a new insurer.The widespread\ncancellations reflect continuing shifts in the new health insurance markets,\nwhich sprang into being in 2014. Insurers are still learning what sorts of\nplans will be most popular and what prices will be low enough to attract\ncustomers while still covering their medical bills.The numbers come from an\nanalysis from the McKinsey Center for U.S. Health System Reform, which did the\nwork of examining all the plans and matching 2015 products with 2016\nofferings. McKinsey examined the larger market areas that insurance companies\nuse to set their rates, instead of individual counties. That means that our\nestimate of terminated plans may be an undercount, because there are some\nadditional counties where renewing customers will be out of luck.Our advice\nfrom last year still applies. Even people who aren’t forced back into the\nmarketplace could be well served by examining their options. The McKinsey\nanalysis finds that, in many markets, people willing to switch plans could\nexperience significant savings on their premiums. A government analysis, which\nlooked at all the plans people currently hold, found that more than 80 percent\nof federal marketplace shoppers could find a better deal if they were willing\nto switch. And a report from the Kaiser Family Foundation published Wednesday\nestimated that renewers in the kind of plan we looked at would benefit from\nswitching in 73 percent of counties.And some of the 2016 plans that are\nconsidered renewals really aren’t identical to their 2015 counterparts; they\nmay have subtle changes in what customers have to pay for or what services are\ncovered. The government’s website for the marketplaces in most states,\nHealthCare.gov, is set up to provide more information about the differences\nbetween plans this year.Of course, switching insurance plans may mean even\nbigger changes. Different plans may have different structures of deductibles\nand other out-of-pocket payments. They may also mean switching to new doctors\nor other caregivers. My colleague Abby Goodnough has written about some\nObamacare shoppers who are planning to switch plans for the third time this\nyear. Many have found the shifts disorienting, even as they welcome new\nchoices that didn’t exist before the Obamacare market existed.\n\n", "title" : "In Many Obamacare Markets, Renewal Is Not an Option - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "What's happening to Obamacare premiums http://nyti.ms/1LmsPdQ pic.twitter.com/LZm88rixAG", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/667058475239915521", "retweets" : 73, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-11-18T03:15:08.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 83, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "667058475239915521" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1LmsPdQ" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71cb4955d14d6f80767bb" }, "content" : "Beyond the headline numbers showing a substantial decline in the number of\nAmericans without health insurance, today’s Census Bureau report contained\nsome important details, including:Enrollment numbers from the federal\ngovernment have told us that millions of Americans signed up for private\nhealth insurance in the new Obamacare marketplaces. But some skeptics had\nworried that those sign-ups weren’t uninsured people, but instead previously\ninsured people whose employers had stopped offering coverage once government-\nsubsidized options were available.Edmund Haislmaier at the Heritage Foundation\nhas been the most prominent proponent of this theory. Using data from\ninsurance company filings, he estimated that only a small minority of\nmarketplace participants represented previously uninsured people.Before today,\nit has been really hard to know for sure. Most private surveys have a poor\ntrack record in measuring what kind of health insurance people have. The\ncensus report, in contrast, asks more questions and is more reliable. The\nreport found that the number of Americans with employer coverage held steady —\nthere was no statistically significant change between 2013 and 2014. Some\nemployers probably did stop offering their workers coverage. And maybe more\nwill follow suit. But in 2014, it looks as if the new marketplace customers\ncame from the ranks of the previously uninsured. So far, it doesn’t look as if\nthe new insurance options mean the beginning of the end of employer-sponsored\ncoverage.Before Obamacare, most uninsured Americans were poor or near-poor, so\nit’s not surprising that Americans with the lowest incomes benefited the most\nfrom the insurance coverage expansion. The law made Medicaid available to low-\nincome people in many states and offered highly subsidized coverage to people\nbuying private plans who earned just above the poverty line.But the census\nnumbers show a trend that worries some experts on the health law: Takeup among\nmiddle-class Americans looks weaker than it does among those earning the least\nmoney. There were fewer middle-class people without insurance to begin with,\nbut the numbers still suggest that new options may be unappealing or out of\nreach to people earning higher incomes.The health law was intended to expand\nthe federal-state Medicaid program to people earning less than 138 percent of\nthe federal poverty level — about $16,000 for a single person — in every state\nof the country. But the Supreme Court made the Medicaid expansion optional,\nand not every state has signed on.The census confirms the findings of several\nearlier studies: States that expanded Medicaid saw substantially bigger\nreductions in their uninsured rates than those that didn’t. The effect appears\nto travel up the income scale, too. Even people who didn’t qualify for\nMedicaid appear to have obtained insurance in greater numbers in states where\nthe Medicaid expansion took place. That may be because states that expanded\nembraced the health law more fully, and worked harder to get people at all\nincomes enrolled in insurance.A year ago, my colleague Kevin Quealy and I\nreported on estimates, produced by Enroll America and Civis Analytics, of how\nthe uninsured rate had changed. The two groups used tools perfected by\npolitical campaigns to model exactly who had benefited from the Affordable\nCare Act’s coverage expansion.We wrote then that the data showed how the\nAffordable Care Act was pushing back against inequality, by offering insurance\nto groups that had fared poorly in recent decades.On the big demographic\ntrends, the model performed admirably. The census confirms that insurance\ncoverage improved disproportionately among groups the model identified: black\nand Hispanic Americans, the young and the poor.But the model wasn’t perfect.\nIts rankings of state-level reductions in the uninsured rate matched the\ncensus findings in most cases, but not all. It appears to have overestimated\ninsurance gains in Nevada, New Mexico and New Hampshire, for example, and\nunderestimated improvements in Iowa and Kansas.Of course, we’re now most of\nthe way through 2015, and the effects of the Affordable Care Act continue to\nbe felt. More states have expanded Medicaid. More people have signed up for\nnew private coverage. More employers may have changed their minds about what\nto offer their workers. The census report gives us a reliable, but old,\nsnapshot of what has happened to the insurance landscape. It will be tempting\nto rely on models to help us understand what’s happening until the Census\nBureau updates its numbers again next September.\n\n", "title" : "Four Ways Obamacare Has Affected Health Insurance - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "What the new Census data tells us about Obamacare 's successes and failures http://nyti.ms/1F2QWSW", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/644269293174190081", "retweets" : 67, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-09-16T07:59:04.000-0700" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 55, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "644269293174190081" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1F2QWSW" }

The only question is whether\nPresident Obama will have to veto a Republican resolution of disapproval or\nDemocrats will have enough votes to spare him that obligation by filibustering\nthe resolution and ensuring it never leaves the Senate.The second outcome\nwould be preferable. An override-proof presidential veto of a congressional\nresolution of disapproval is not the best path to a historic international\naccord. Major arms control treaties used to be bipartisan affairs. Those days\nare gone. Still, Republican maneuvering, backed by Prime Minister Benjamin\nNetanyahu of Israel, has not prevailed. That’s a victory for reason in a\nseason of rage.Why has a disaster been averted? Because if the deal had\nunraveled in Congress, so would America’s standing as a global power. Russia,\nChina and the European Union would have concluded that the United States was\nnot serious. To negotiate over years a tough compromise obliging Iran, among\nother measures, to slash its stockpile of enriched uranium by 98 percent and\nits operating centrifuges by two-thirds, and then walk away in a righteous and\ndeluded funk — well, that’s not how America won the respect of the world. It\ndid so by being consequential in hot wars and cold.Perhaps American power\nmatters less these days. I don’t think so. If America’s word is shot, so are\nthe underpinnings of global security. What would have been left of that word\nafter an Iranian volte-face — to follow the Syrian volte-face and ongoing\ndebacle — would have been meager indeed. America the Undependable would have\nbecome a watchword.Then there’s Iranian power. Absent the nuclear deal, it\nwould have grown. Tehran would have secured its objective of relief from\nsanctions — because the current coalition would have crumbled — without having\nto scale back its nuclear program or submit it to international inspection of\nunprecedented intensity.Iran would have resumed installation of new\ncentrifuges and increased the quantity and quality of its enriched uranium,\njust as it did for many years before Obama’s diplomacy reversed things. As\nSecretary of State John Kerry remarked this week, rejection would have left\nthe United States and its allies in “the very dangerous spot that we were in\ntwo years ago” — only “devoid of any realistic plan or option.”Of course, one\noption would have resurfaced: the military one, a certain catastrophe with a\nmaximum setback of Iran’s nuclear program of perhaps three years, against 15\nyears in a deal that would avoid a third unwinnable American war certain to\nconvince every wavering Iranian of the need for a nuclear weapon.There was no\n“better deal.” That’s the fantasy of all those who hate Iran and hate Obama\n(which one more is often unclear). The nuclear deal has become “such a\nluscious piece of Republican propaganda,” William Luers, the director of the\nIran Project, whose goal is to improve American-Iranian relations, told me.\nAnd a long election season has already begun.I said a disaster had been\naverted. A disaster has also been revealed. It is that not one — not one — of\nthe 301 Republican members of Congress (the largest Republican majority since\n1929-31) supports the deal, despite the overwhelming evidence that the accord,\nwhile far from perfect, is the best achievable, as almost all Democrats\nconcluded after often agonized review.Republicans, prodded by Netanyahu and\nthe American Israel Public Affairs Committee (in overdrive on the Iran\nquestion), are not about to let go of their Iran toy. It’s a way to attack the\npresident; it’s also a way to raise money.The deal will become the “Obamacare\nof foreign policy,” Nicholas Burns, a Harvard professor and former under\nsecretary of state, told me. Yes, it will. That is, it will be something\nsensible (at least in the eyes of most people across the world) to which\nRepublicans will never acquiesce and which they will try to use in every\nconceivable way to undermine a president they loathe.Prepare for congressional\nattempts to step up enforcement of non-nuclear-related Iran sanctions,\nincrease military aid to Israel over the next decade, constrain Iran’s options\nin spending the windfall from sanctions relief, bolster Persian Gulf allies,\nand so on. There’s a good case for doing much of this, as Obama himself has\nargued. But that case gets undermined when the underlying Republican objective\nis to sabotage the nuclear deal. Implacable hostility to Iran will be met in\nkind.Aipac recently put out a memo called “Promises Cannot Fix a Bad Deal.” In\nessence it said nothing Obama promises Israel will help because the deal’s\n“fatal flaw” is it “legitimizes Iran as a nuclear-threshold state in 15\nyears.”Here’s some breaking news for Aipac: Iran is a nuclear-threshold state\ntoday. The great merit of the deal is to slash and ring-fence acquired Iranian\nnuclear capacity until 2030. To say that is not in Israel’s security interest\nis utterly unpersuasive.\n\n", "title" : "Iran: The ‘Obamacare of Foreign Policy’ - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Iran: The Obamacare of foreign policy http://nyti.ms/1Oepdy5 via @NYTOpinion", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/639579149854752768", "retweets" : 74, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-09-03T09:22:06.000-0700" }, "mentions" : "@NYTOpinion", "favs" : 79, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "639579149854752768" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1Oepdy5" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71cb4955d14d6f80767bd" }, "content" : "Was I on the edge of my seat, waiting for the Supreme Court decision on\nObamacare subsidies? No — I was pacing the room, too nervous to sit, worried\nthat the court would use one sloppily worded sentence to deprive millions of\nhealth insurance, condemn tens of thousands to financial ruin, and send\nthousands to premature death.It didn’t. And that means that the big\ndistractions — the teething problems of the website, the objectively ludicrous\nbut nonetheless menacing attempts at legal sabotage — are behind us, and we\ncan focus on the reality of health reform. The Affordable Care Act is now in\nits second year of full operation; how’s it doing?The answer is, better than\neven many supporters realize.Start with the act’s most basic purpose, to cover\nthe previously uninsured. Opponents of the law insisted that it would actually\nreduce coverage; in reality, around 15 million Americans have gained\ninsurance.But isn’t that a very partial success, with millions still\nuncovered? Well, many of those still uninsured are in that position because\ntheir state governments have refused to let the federal government enroll them\nin Medicaid.Beyond that, you need to realize that the law was never intended\nor expected to cover everyone. Undocumented immigrants aren’t eligible, and\nany system that doesn’t enroll people automatically will see some of the\npopulation fall through the cracks. Massachusetts has had guaranteed health\ncoverage for almost a decade, but 5 percent of its nonelderly adult population\nremains uninsured.Suppose we use 5 percent uninsured as a benchmark. How much\nprogress have we made toward getting there? In states that have implemented\nthe act in full and expanded Medicaid, data from the Urban Institute show the\nuninsured falling from more than 16 percent to just 7.5 percent — that is, in\nyear two we’re already around 80 percent of the way there. Most of the way\nwith the A.C.A.!But how good is that coverage? Cheaper plans under the law do\nhave relatively large deductibles and impose significant out-of-pocket costs.\nStill, the plans are vastly better than no coverage at all, or the bare-bones\nplans that the act made illegal. The newly insured have seen a sharp drop in\nhealth-related financial distress, and report a high degree of satisfaction\nwith their coverage.What about costs? In 2013 there were dire warnings about a\nlooming “rate shock”; instead, premiums came in well below expectations. In\n2014 the usual suspects declared that huge premium increases were looming for\n2015; the actual rise was just 2 percent. There was another flurry of scare\nstories about rate hikes earlier this year, but as more information comes in\nit looks as if premium increases for 2016 will be bigger than for this year\nbut still modest by historical standards — which means that premiums remain\nmuch lower than expected.And there has also been a sharp slowdown in the\ngrowth of overall health spending, which is probably due in part to the cost-\ncontrol measures, largely aimed at Medicare, that were also an important part\nof health reform.What about economic side effects? One of the many, many\nRepublican votes against Obamacare involved passing something called the\nRepealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act, and opponents have consistently\nwarned that helping Americans afford health care would lead to economic doom.\nBut there’s no job-killing in the data: The U.S. economy has added more than\n240,000 jobs a month on average since Obamacare went into effect, its biggest\ngains since the 1990s.Finally, what about claims that health reform would\ncause the budget deficit to explode? In reality, the deficit has continued to\ndecline, and the Congressional Budget Office recently reaffirmed its\nconclusion that repealing Obamacare would increase, not reduce, the\ndeficit.Put all these things together, and what you have is a portrait of\npolicy triumph — a law that, despite everything its opponents have done to\nundermine it, is achieving its goals, costing less than expected, and making\nthe lives of millions of Americans better and more secure.Now, you might\nwonder why a law that works so well and does so much good is the object of so\nmuch political venom — venom that is, by the way, on full display in Justice\nAntonin Scalia’s dissenting opinion, with its rants against “interpretive\njiggery-pokery.” But what conservatives have always feared about health reform\nis the possibility that it might succeed, and in so doing remind voters that\nsometimes government action can improve ordinary Americans’ lives.That’s why\nthe right went all out to destroy the Clinton health plan in 1993, and tried\nto do the same to the Affordable Care Act. But Obamacare has survived, it’s\nhere, and it’s working. The great conservative nightmare has come true. And\nit’s a beautiful thing.\n\n", "title" : "Hooray for Obamacare - The New York Times", "twitter" : { "body" : "Paul Krugman: Hooray for Obamacare http://nyti.ms/1e8WBdh via @NYTOpinion pic.twitter.com/wUS2CzQqbP", "link" : "https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/615194228726046720", "retweets" : 436, "date" : { "$date" : "2015-06-28T02:25:08.000-0700" }, "mentions" : "@NYTOpinion", "favs" : 525, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "615194228726046720" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "nytimes", "link" : "http://nyti.ms/1e8WBdh" }

He could force President Obama to strip the funding\nfrom the landmark health-care law that had come to bear his name — Obamacare —\nby threatening to shut down the government.To some other conservatives, there\nwas a problem with Cruz’s plan.It still seemed impossible.To succeed, Cruz\nneeded a novel way to outmaneuver the Democrat-led Senate and then pressure\nObama to undercut his signature domestic policy achievement.But Cruz didn’t\nhave one. Instead, his critics said, he offered only a fanciful theory that if\nthe GOP flirted hard enough with a shutdown, Democratic lawmakers and the\nWhite House might lose heart and surrender.Grover Norquist, the influential\nanti-tax activist, likened Cruz’s strategy to a plotline in the satirical\nanimated show “South Park,” in which a group of gnomes comes up with a\nbrilliant plan to become rich.“Step 1 is: Steal all the underwear in South\nPark. Step 2 is: _Mumumumbumbumbum_,” Nor­quist said, making a nonsense sound.\n“And Step 3 is: Make a million dollars. And this [plan] reminded me of that\nepisode.”Josh Holmes, a former aide to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\n(R-Ky.), said it was “like a toddler’s version of legislating.”Cruz’s gambit\ndidn’t work. Neither Senate Democrats nor Obama gave an inch on their\ncherished law. Instead, the government shut down for 16 days, and Republicans\nin Congress were blamed for it — including by other Republicans, who said they\nhad distracted attention from the disastrous rollout of the HealthCare.gov\nwebsite. ****Today, the drama that surrounded the shutdown — including Cruz’s\n21-hour Senate speech, in which he read “Green Eggs and Ham” to his daughters\nvia the C-SPAN feed — is the defining moment of a Senate tenure that has\nhelped make Cruz the favorite Republican presidential candidate for many\nconservatives.To those supporters, the shutdown signaled the depth of Cruz’s\ncommitment to rein in government.But for many Republicans in Congress, this\nwas the episode that soured them on Cruz. Many suspect that he always knew his\nplan would fail but went ahead with it anyway — expecting that he would\npersonally benefit from the exposure, even if his party lost a damaging\nfight.“He knew that. He knew it. He knew it,” former senator Tom Coburn\n(R-Okla.) said. “It wasn’t about the shutdown. It wasn’t about the Affordable\nCare Act. It was about launching Ted Cruz.”On the campaign trail this year,\nnone of Cruz’s fellow senators have endorsed him for president. And some GOP\nrivals have used the shutdown to criticize him.Republican presidential\ncandidate Marco Rubio, a senator from Florida who was a vocal supporter of\nCruz during the shutdown, now uses it to call Cruz ineffective: “I’m the only\none running that’s actually ever scored a victory against Obamacare,” Rubio\nsays. He is referring to a bill that undercut a government program to bail out\nfailing insurers. Rubio didn’t actually play a very substantial role in its\npassage. But it passed.Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a former presidential\ncandidate and a longtime Cruz nemesis who is now backing former Florida\ngovernor Jeb Bush, cites the shutdown saga as proof that Cruz is\nshameless.“What he did was stood up for Ted and threw the Republican Party\nunder the bus,” Graham has said. On the campaign trail, Cruz often talks about\nObamacare, telling audiences that he will “repeal every word” of the health-\ncare law if he is elected president. But he refers to the 2013 battle\ninfrequently. And he rarely utters the word “shutdown.” ****Rick Tyler, a\nspokesman for Cruz’s campaign, said the senator doesn’t often say the word\nbecause shutting down the government was never his goal.“He didn’t pursue a\ngovernment shutdown strategy. That’s not even sane,” Tyler said. “That would\nbe a good thing to go out and campaign on? That wasn’t what he did. He led the\nfight to defund Obamacare.”But even in Cruz’s telling of the story, his plan\nto defund Obamacare was based on a misreading of how other key players would\nreact when he threatened a shutdown.He says he thought Obama and top Democrats\nwould be cowed. He says he thought Senate Republican leaders would be willing\n— at least in public — to take the risk.In both cases, he was wrong.“The\nreason it didn’t work is because Ted Cruz was the only candidate, the only\nsenator, who campaigned on defunding Obamacare and followed through on his\ncampaign promise. Nobody else did,” Tyler said, arguing that others said: “\n‘Oh, we don’t have the votes. We’ll just give up.’ That’s not leadership;\nthat’s capitulation and appeasement and surrender.” ****If there was a blunder\nin Cruz’s plans, Tyler said, “the miscalculation was that when his colleagues\ncampaigned on defeating Obamacare, he thought they meant it.” ****The fullest\nexplanation of that time, written from Cruz’s perspective, came in his 2015\nbook, “A Time for Truth.” In it, Cruz begins the chapter about his own fight\nwith a story from 160 years ago. Just before the Civil War, he writes, a\nWisconsin abolitionist was punished for breaking the law to help a former\nslave escape to Canada. But later, Cruz says, the man was pardoned and\nvindicated.“He was an American hero,” Cruz writes.In the next paragraph, Cruz\njumps from slavery to Obamacare, and from that American hero to himself.“In\nWashington, pundits repeatedly intone that we had no plan, no strategy, and no\nhope of success,” Cruz writes. “I’ve got many personal faults, but, as a\nformer Supreme Court litigator, failing to plan is not one of them.”It was not\nCruz’s idea, originally.In 2013, conservative activists were looking for a new\ntactic to defeat the health-care law, which had survived a Supreme Court\nchallenge, before its first insurance exchanges opened Oct. 1. Republicans had\ntried passing standalone bills to repeal it, but the Senate killed them. The\nnew plan was to use a bill that the Senate was obligated to pass — a spending\nbill to keep the government funded. They would pass a bill that paid for\neverything, except Obamacare.“It was the last chance. It was the last gasp to\nstop it,” said Brent Bozell, chairman of the conservative group ForAmerica.\n“Did I think it was going to work? We knew it was going to be tough. Anything\nis possible. But we knew it was going to be tough.”Cruz joined the “defund”\neffort early on and became its leading spokesman and an important legislative\nleader.“The president is never going to sign a bill that defunds Obamacare,”\nCNN’s Candy Crowley told him on Aug. 25, 2013, with a shutdown a little more\nthan a month away.“You know, you may be convinced to that,” Cruz\nreplied.“You’re not convinced to that?” Crowley asked.“I am not at all,” Cruz\nsaid.In theory, his plan worked like this:First, the House would pass a bill\nto defund the health-care law.Then came the Senate. Republicans had 46 seats\nthere — not enough to pass a bill but enough to block one. So they’d block a\nvote on any Democratic version of the spending bill. In the meantime, Cruz\nwould use lobbying and public pressure to swing wobbly Democrats over to his\nside.Eventually, Obamacare opponents would have the 60 Senate votes they\nneeded to pass Cruz’s bill and send it to the president.At that point,\naccording to Cruz’s plan, Obama might start to respond as he did during the\ndebt-ceiling showdown two years earlier. In those negotiations, the threat of\na government default was so scary that the White House and legislative leaders\nagreed to a series of drastic cuts known as the sequester.Chip Roy, Cruz’s\nchief of staff at the time, described the debt talks as a “model” for Cruz’s\nstrategy.“We could get some pound of flesh out of the president and [then-\nSenate Majority Leader] Harry Reid,” Roy said. “That was always the\nendgame.”But other Republicans believed that Cruz’s plan was too farfetched to\nwork.For one thing, Cruz would need to flip more than a dozen Democratic votes\nto get his idea passed by the Senate. And he’d need seven more Democrats to\noverride a presidential veto. If Cruz couldn’t get them, ever, then Republican\nleaders were reluctant to gridlock the Senate and wait for the impossible to\nhappen.“Virtually everybody understood the absurdity of the tactic,” said\nHolmes, the former McConnell aide. “Look, we all support the idea of defunding\nObamacare. But saying we were going to defund Obamacare” with 46 votes “in the\nSenate or shut the government down is absurd.”But in the summer and fall of\n2013, Cruz and conservative activist groups pressed on, pressuring other\nRepublicans to go along with the plan. They tended to reduce the complex\ncalculations of the fight — 60-vote thresholds, worries about presidential\nvetoes — into a test of Republican fortitude.“How do we win the fight to\ndefund Obamacare?” Cruz shouted at a rally in Dallas in the summer of 2013,\npart of a 10-city tour. “Don’t blink.”Step 1 worked, as Cruz wanted. The GOP-\nled House — pushed by conservatives who were coordinating with Cruz — passed a\nbill to cut off the health-care law’s money.Now it was time for the\nSenate.“Kind of like Evel Knievel crossing the Grand Canyon,” said former\ncongressman Steve Southerland II (R-Fla.), who voted for Cruz’s plan in the\nHouse. That was a joke: Knievel, the 1970s motorcycle daredevil, always\nboasted that he could jump the Grand Canyon. But he never actually did.Indeed,\nhere is “where the plan went awry,” Cruz says in his book.“What we did not\nanticipate was that . . . the GOP leadership team would decide to publicly,\ndirectly and aggressively lead the fight against the House Republicans and in\nfavor of Obamacare,” he writes.Senate Republicans did not gridlock their\nchamber, and several criticized Cruz for making them the villains.The\nDemocrats who ran the Senate were able to reject the House bill easily. Cruz\nnever seems to have made a concerted effort to lobby red-state Senate\nDemocrats, whom he described as the last key element of his plan to win over\nthe Senate.“I don’t ever remember hearing from Senator Cruz or his people,”\nsaid former senator Mark Pryor (Ark.), who was perhaps the Senate’s most\nvulnerable Democrat at the time. He would lose his reelection bid to a\nRepublican by 17 points. But he says he never felt pressure. “There was zero\ntemptation for Democrats to shut down the government or defund Obamacare. No\none on the Democratic side was interested in that at all.”As the days ticked\ndown to the shutdown, Cruz was criticized even by House conservatives, who\nthought he needed to do more to make his plan work. He gathered with top aides\nin a small office near the Capitol dome. He read to them from Psalm 40,\nrecalled Roy, his former chief of staff.The reading is a plea for deliverance\nfrom someone overcome by problems: “For troubles without number surround me.\nMy sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see.”Cruz then went to the Senate\nfloor.“I intend to speak in support of defunding Obamacare until I am no\nlonger able to stand,” he said.Cruz’s speech was, at its heart, a meditation\non impossibility. He cited cases in which things that seemed impossible — the\nContinental Army’s fight against the British, the British fight against the\nNazis, the mountain climbed by the Little Engine That Could — were difficult\nbut possible.His battle, Cruz said, was similar. “I think I can. I think I\ncan. No, you can’t. No, you can’t. We can’t win,” he said. “You can’t stop\nObamacare. It cannot be done. It is impossible.”But, it turned out, he\ncouldn’t.In his book, he blamed Obama’s refusal to compromise on the\npresident’s confidence in how the friendly media would tell the story.“He knew\nhis media lap dogs would report that it was Republicans who were refusing to\ncompromise,” Cruz wrote.Finally, on the 16th day of the shutdown, the Senate\nand the House voted to fund the health-care law, ending the standoff without\nany of the victories Cruz wanted. Cruz and his allies blamed Senate\nRepublicans, saying they had splintered without ever testing Obama’s\nresolve.“With respect to Obama, it’s the road not taken. We don’t know. I\ncan’t accept the premise that we miscalculated on Obama in the slightest,” Roy\nsaid. “The Republican leadership literally cowered in the corner, afraid of\nthe word ‘shutdown.’ ”**** Today, the sting from the standoff lingers among\nCruz’s congressional colleagues.“How can I say this nicely? He was still\ncritical of those of us who pointed out the obvious shortcomings of his\ntactic, and he called us capitulators,” Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) said.\n“That’s not real leadership. That’s lemming leadership. It’s lemming\nleadership, is what it is.”Even so, while the shutdown earned Cruz enemies in\nWashington, his success thus far in the presidential race shows that it gave\nhim credibility with the conservative base. When he was campaigning in Des\nMoines in the closing days before his victory in the Iowa caucuses this month,\none of the men who introduced him uttered the S-word that Cruz avoids.“When\nTed Cruz shut down the government,” said Michael Berry, a conservative talk-\nradio host and Cruz ally.The crowd roared.__\n\n", "title" : " For Ted Cruz, the 2013 shutdown was a defining moment - The Washington Post", "twitter" : { "body" : "Why Ted Cruz's plan to defund Obamacare failed http://wapo.st/1QjS2P6", "link" : "https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/699765185796558848", "retweets" : 43, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-16T09:19:55.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 54, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "699765185796558848" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "washingtonpost", "link" : "http://wapo.st/1QjS2P6" }

But he never actually did.Indeed,\nhere is “where the plan went awry,” Cruz says in his book.“What we did not\nanticipate was that . . . the GOP leadership team would decide to publicly,\ndirectly and aggressively lead the fight against the House Republicans and in\nfavor of Obamacare,” he writes.Senate Republicans did not gridlock their\nchamber, and several criticized Cruz for making them the villains.The\nDemocrats who ran the Senate were able to reject the House bill easily. Cruz\nnever seems to have made a concerted effort to lobby red-state Senate\nDemocrats, whom he described as the last key element of his plan to win over\nthe Senate.“I don’t ever remember hearing from Senator Cruz or his people,”\nsaid former senator Mark Pryor (Ark.), who was perhaps the Senate’s most\nvulnerable Democrat at the time. He would lose his reelection bid to a\nRepublican by 17 points. But he says he never felt pressure. “There was zero\ntemptation for Democrats to shut down the government or defund Obamacare. No\none on the Democratic side was interested in that at all.”As the days ticked\ndown to the shutdown, Cruz was criticized even by House conservatives, who\nthought he needed to do more to make his plan work. He gathered with top aides\nin a small office near the Capitol dome. He read to them from Psalm 40,\nrecalled Roy, his former chief of staff.The reading is a plea for deliverance\nfrom someone overcome by problems: “For troubles without number surround me.\nMy sins have overtaken me, and I cannot see.”Cruz then went to the Senate\nfloor.“I intend to speak in support of defunding Obamacare until I am no\nlonger able to stand,” he said.Cruz’s speech was, at its heart, a meditation\non impossibility. He cited cases in which things that seemed impossible — the\nContinental Army’s fight against the British, the British fight against the\nNazis, the mountain climbed by the Little Engine That Could — were difficult\nbut possible.His battle, Cruz said, was similar. “I think I can. I think I\ncan. No, you can’t. No, you can’t. We can’t win,” he said. “You can’t stop\nObamacare. It cannot be done. It is impossible.”But, it turned out, he\ncouldn’t.In his book, he blamed Obama’s refusal to compromise on the\npresident’s confidence in how the friendly media would tell the story.“He knew\nhis media lap dogs would report that it was Republicans who were refusing to\ncompromise,” Cruz wrote.Finally, on the 16th day of the shutdown, the Senate\nand the House voted to fund the health-care law, ending the standoff without\nany of the victories Cruz wanted. Cruz and his allies blamed Senate\nRepublicans, saying they had splintered without ever testing Obama’s\nresolve.“With respect to Obama, it’s the road not taken. We don’t know. I\ncan’t accept the premise that we miscalculated on Obama in the slightest,” Roy\nsaid. “The Republican leadership literally cowered in the corner, afraid of\nthe word ‘shutdown.’ ”**** Today, the sting from the standoff lingers among\nCruz’s congressional colleagues.“How can I say this nicely? He was still\ncritical of those of us who pointed out the obvious shortcomings of his\ntactic, and he called us capitulators,” Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.) said.\n“That’s not real leadership. That’s lemming leadership. It’s lemming\nleadership, is what it is.”Even so, while the shutdown earned Cruz enemies in\nWashington, his success thus far in the presidential race shows that it gave\nhim credibility with the conservative base. When he was campaigning in Des\nMoines in the closing days before his victory in the Iowa caucuses this month,\none of the men who introduced him uttered the S-word that Cruz avoids.“When\nTed Cruz shut down the government,” said Michael Berry, a conservative talk-\nradio host and Cruz ally.The crowd roared.__\n\n", "title" : " For Ted Cruz, the 2013 shutdown was a defining moment - The Washington Post", "twitter" : { "body" : "How Ted Cruzs plan to defund Obamacare in 2013 failed  and what it achieved http://wapo.st/1ooGWeY", "link" : "https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/700222019581956096", "retweets" : 25, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-02-17T15:35:13.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 41, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "700222019581956096" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "washingtonpost", "link" : "http://wapo.st/1ooGWeY" }

Ted\nCruz (R-Tex.) about his brother-in-law: He was a barber who couldn’t afford\nhealth care until the Affordable Care Act, and after getting coverage he went\nto the doctor for the first time in years, and was diagnosed with multiple\ntumors. He died soon after.“Mark never had health care until Obamacare,” Valde\ntold Cruz in a middle school cafeteria here. “What are you going to replace it\nwith?”Cruz has made repealing the Affordable Care Act one of the central\ntenets of his presidential run. He tells voters that he plans to “repeal every\nword of Obamacare,” a line that typically gets big cheers. Valde heard those\ncheers, and Cruz’s opposition to the law, at an event earlier this year. He\nwanted to ask Cruz about his stance but didn’t. He says he was “kicking\nmyself” because of it. So he decided to come to see Cruz again; this time to\nask the question.Cruz expressed his sorrow for Valde’s loss.“Under Obamacare,\nmillions of Americans have lost their jobs. Millions of Americans have lost\ntheir doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket. That is happening all\nacross this country,” he said, noting that President Obama said the average\nfamily’s health insurance premium would drop by $2,500.“I’ve joked, anyone\nwhose premiums have dropped $2500 as President Obama promised should vote for\nHillary Clinton. I’ll take everybody else,” as some people chuckled. Valde\nwasn’t amused.“My question is, what are you going to replace it with?” Valde\nasked.“Sir, I promise you, I will answer your question. I’m laying out first\nof all the problems,” Cruz said. He went on to say that the “most pragmatic,\nthe most prudent” thing to do is repeal the law and start over. When that is\ndone, he said that competition in the marketplace should be expanded, people\nshould be able to buy health insurance across state lines and that everyone\nwants people to have insurance coverage.“Your father in law, he couldn’t\nafford it,” Cruz said.“Brother-in-law,” Valde responded.“Your brother-in-law\ncouldn’t afford it,” Cruz said.“Right. But he could afford it, he finally got\nit under Obama,” Valde told Cruz.Cruz repeated Valde’s story, that by the time\nValde’s brother-in-law went to a doctor, he was already dying.“He would have\ngotten it earlier, if he could have afforded it earlier, but because of\ngovernment regulations, he couldn’t,” Cruz said.Valde, a Democrat who said he\nwill caucus for Hillary Clinton, said after the exchange that Cruz hadn’t\nanswered his question.The answer, he said, was incomplete.“I think he said\nwhat he wanted, but pragmatically, I don’t know how he’s going to get it\nthrough Congress,” he said.Valde said he knows there have been many problems\nimplementing the law, but he said it allowed his brother-in-law to finally\nafford health care.“It’s a stump line, we’re gonna repeal Obamacare, every\nword, and then you get the crowd response,” he said. “I want an America with\nhealth care.”\n\n", "title" : " Iowan asks Ted Cruz what will happen if he repeals Obamacare - The Washington Post", "twitter" : { "body" : "Iowan asks Ted Cruz what will happen if he repeals Obamacare http://wapo.st/1SloXn1", "link" : "https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/693964748271046656", "retweets" : 78, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-31T09:11:03.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 67, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "693964748271046656" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "washingtonpost", "link" : "http://wapo.st/1SloXn1" }

Of those, nearly 3 million are ages\n18-34 – more than a quarter of all plan selections. HHS officials touted that\npercentage, although it is about the same as late December last year.The\nofficials said one enrollment trend involving young adults was particularly\nencouraging.“Over 1 million new consumers under age 35 signed up for\nHealthCare.gov coverage,” said Andy Slavitt, acting administrator for the\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services. They represent 41 percent of all\nnew consumers, he said, up from 38 percent at this time last year.Federal\nofficials also said the latest numbers show that consumers are actively\nengaged in choosing their coverage. Among the 8.2 million re-enrolled\ncustomers nationwide, more than half came back, reviewed their information and\nactively selected a plan.And about 60 percent of people who actively re-\nenrolled through HealthCare.gov switched to a different plan, officials said.\nMany enrollees faced substantial premium increases if they stuck with their\nold plans and could save a substantial amount of money by switching, noted\nLarry Levitt, a senior vice president at Kaiser Family Foundation.Robert\nLaszewski, an insurance industry analyst and frequent critic of the law, has\nwarned that enrollment is not strong enough to make the ACA politically and\nfinancially sustainable.  \n“We always see these big enrollment numbers being announced by the\nadministration, only to see the block shrink dramatically by year-end,” he\nwrote in a blog post this week.Open enrollment continues through Jan. 31, and\nthe sign-up totals could fluctuate as plan changes or cancellations occur,\nsuch as those in response to life changes like a new job or marriage. The data\nreleased Thursday only reflect plan selections and do not indicate how many\nconsumers have paid their premiums to put coverage in effect.Until now, the\nObama administration's ACA snapshots have looked at just HealthCare.gov. Data\nreleased at the end of 2015 suggested enrollment was skewing slightly younger,\nand officials say that's likely a proxy for healthy people -- a trend that is\ncrucial to the stability of the marketplaces.Enrollment is a key barometer of\nthe 2010 law's success because insurance premiums in the federal exchange are\nup this year by 7.5 percent on average, nearly four times as much as a year\nago.Despite the latest numbers, the Obama administration has not adjusted its\nmodest projection for how many more Americans will have coverage at the end of\nthe year compared to the close of 2015 – acknowledgement that successful\noutreach will be increasingly tough.The decline in the nation’s uninsured rate\nwas stagnant last year, according to a Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index\nreleased Thursday. The survey showed that 11.9 percent of U.S. adults did not\nhave health insurance in the final quarter of 2015, the same as in the first\nquarter.“This validates concerns that similarly large reductions may not be\npossible in the future because the remaining uninsured are harder to reach or\nless inclined to become insured more generally,” Gallup noted.**Read more:**2\nmillion current ACA enrollees ignore advice to return to\nHealthCare.govCongress sends health-care law to Obama, setting up certain veto\n\n", "title" : " More than 11.3 million Americans signed up for Obamacare, HHS says - The Washington Post", "twitter" : { "body" : "More than 11.3 million Americans signed up for Obamacare , report says http://wapo.st/1RvSibQ", "link" : "https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/685192089907388416", "retweets" : 65, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-07T04:11:39.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 54, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "685192089907388416" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "washingtonpost", "link" : "http://wapo.st/1RvSibQ" }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "56e71cb4955d14d6f80767c2" }, "content" : "During the debate over President Obama's signature health-care law, opponents\nwarned that the law would discourage large numbers of Americans from working,\nforce millions into part-time jobs and make it more difficult to find work.\nThree new studies released this week suggest that, so far, it hasn't\nhappened.The new analyses are still early, since a key requirement of the law\nbegan to be phased in just last year, but they add to a growing body of\nevidence that, if the law has had any effect on the labor market, it's been a\nsmall one.Critics had predicted that, under Obamacare, employers would shift\nworkers to part-time schedules to avoid a requirement that they provide\ninsurance to full-time employees. Critics also predicted people might opt to\nwork less because they could obtain insurance through the marketplaces or\nexpanded Medicaid coverage.Last month, the Congressional Budget Office renewed\nits warning that Obamacare would discourage the equivalent of 2 million\nAmericans from working by 2025, since they can get health insurance without\nrelying on an employer.While the new studies don’t rule out a dim long-term\nforecast, they do offer reason for optimism. The predictions that the ACA\nwould have broad economic consequences weren’t borne out in researchers’ data:\nPart-time jobs didn’t significantly increase, and states that expanded\nMedicaid did not have significant shifts in employment patterns.\"There were a\nlot of stories about employers, with anecdotes about employers shifting jobs\nto part-time,\" said Larry Levitt, an economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation\nnot involved in the new research. \"You can't deny those stories — they’re\nreal. They’re just not generalizable. It’s not what is mostly happening, based\non this study and others.\"_[Read more: No, Obamacare isn’t killing full-time\njobs, new evidence shows]_That isn't to say that individual people and\nemployers haven't made changes because of the law. White Castle, a company\nthat had warned it would reduce some employees' hours a few years ago, has\nchanged its scheduling practices so more employees work fewer than 30 hours a\nweek, the threshold at which large companies don't have to provide health\ncoverage. Vice President Jamie Richardson said the company had 1,400 employees\nworking 30 to 35 hours before the law and very few do today.\"In practice, if\nyou're part time, you're going to be scheduled to work less than 30 hours per\nweek,\" he said.At other firms, though, owners ultimately decided not to\nrestrict hiring.In 2013, Jody Manor, who owns Bittersweet Catering, Cafe and\nBakery in Alexandria, Va., put his expansion plans on hold, fearing he would\nhave to pay for pricier comprehensive health coverage if he expanded his small\nbusiness to more than 50 employees.Instead, Manor found out he could get a\nbetter deal from the bakery’s health insurer with a larger payroll. He opened\na new cafe later that year, and employees’ premiums declined by 3 percent, the\nonly decrease he can recall since Bittersweet opened in 1983.The results of\nthe new research suggest that Manor’s approach was the more common response to\nnew health insurance requirements.One study, published Tuesday in the journal\nHealth Affairs, focuses on a widely criticized provision of the law that\nrequires employers with at least 100 full-time workers to offer health\ninsurance as of the beginning of 2015. (This year, that requirement is being\nextended to firms with more than 50 employees.) Critics worried that the\nprovision would deter small businesses from expanding and would encourage them\nto cut their workers' hours. But this study is the latest in a series to\nconclude that Obamacare did not, in fact, widely result in more firms asking\nemployees to work part time.The authors examined Census data and found no\nincrease in the likelihood of working part time, except for a 0.18 percentage\npoint increase in the likelihood of working 25 to 29 hours per week between\n2013 and 2014 — a trend that the authors say predated the ACA.\"These results\nare surprising to me, given that there was a concern that employers would make\nadjustments in employee work hours,\" said Asako Moriya, a service economist\nwith the governmental Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality who led the\nwork.The study included another piece of evidence that appears to contradict\nthe notion that the law would cause an increase in part-time work: The number\nof people working 25 to 29 hours a week in firms not subject to the mandate\nincreased between 2012 and 2015, while the number of people at firms subject\nto the mandate slightly decreased.Two groups of people were slightly more\nlikely to work part time: workers with little education and older workers\nbetween 60 and 64 years old. There was suggestive, but not conclusive,\nevidence that the shifts were voluntary and not caused by employers cutting\nhours.One reason that some workers might be voluntarily working fewer hours is\nto reduce their earnings in order to qualify for subsidized insurance from the\nfederal government — either through the insurance marketplaces or through\nMedicaid.A second Health Affairs study and a working paper issued Monday by\nthe National Bureau of Economic Research both** **examined whether employees\nhave chosen to work less in order to qualify for Medicaid, which became\navailable to a larger group of people under health reform.The new research on\nthe effects of the Medicaid expansion does not suggest that people are looking\nto limit their earnings. On the contrary, some might even be looking to work\nmore.\"In general, there's been no evidence that the ACA has done anything\nsignificant to employment,\" said Robert Kaestner, an economist at the\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago and one of the authors of the working paper,\nusing the abbreviation for the Affordable Care Act. \"We don't have to worry\ntoo much.\"Previously, only people living in poverty were eligible for\nMedicaid, but the law expanded that group to people with incomes up to 138\npercent of the federal poverty level. The Supreme Court, though, decided that\nthe federal government couldn't require states to expand Medicaid.That\ndecision created an opportunity for researchers, such as Moriya — who is also\none of the authors of the second article in Health Affairs — and Kaestner and\nhis colleagues at the University of Illinois.Following the decision, some\nstates chose to expand Medicaid to a less impoverished group of people, while\nothers did not, allowing the researchers to compare the change over time in\nthe numbers of people working and their schedules in these two groups of\nstates.Obamacare's detractors had said that with access to Medicaid, some\npeople earning between the poverty level and 138 percent of that level would\nquit working. They might have been working in jobs that did not pay well but\noffered health insurance sponsored by the employer. With insurance provided by\nUncle Sam, people in that category might have decided going to work wasn't\nworth it.At the same time, some people in that group who did not subscribe to\ninsurance through their employers might have turned down additional hours or\npromotions in order to keep their incomes below 138 percent of the poverty\nlevel and maintain their newly acquired eligibility for Medicaid.Moriya's\ngroup found that if some who gained Medicaid worked less as a result, their\nnumbers were too small to measure reliably. Although they found that people\nwere about 0.6 percentage points more likely to leave a job in the states that\nexpanded Medicaid than in the states that maintained the program as it was,\nthe difference was slight enough that it could have been due to chance.In\nfact, according to the calculations by Kaestner's group, the labor market\nactually looked a little bit stronger in the states that expanded\nMedicaid.That might be because some people whose incomes were below the\npoverty level before the expansion might have been working less to maintain\ntheir eligibility, and took on a second job or additional hours when the limit\non income in their state increased to 138 percent of the poverty level.\"People\ncan work more and earn more,\" Kaestner said. \"It frees people to actually be\nable to work without getting penalized.\"Moriya and her colleagues examined\nonly the number of people leaving a job or working fewer hours, not the number\ntaking on a new job or working more. As a result, their analysis might not\nhave accounted for this positive aspect of the expansion, yielding more\npessimistic numbers.Yet neither group of researchers produced statistically\nsignificant results, suggesting that any effect on the labor market was likely\nvery small.There will be real economic effects of easier access to health\ninsurance — people who retire earlier or stay home to take care of a child\nbecause they can get health insurance on their own. But as the data suggest,\nthese changes are happening on the fringes.So far, trying to detect the effect\nof the ACA on the job market is like \"finding a needle in a haystack,\" Levitt\nsaid.**  \nMore from Wonkblog:**How Obamacare helped millennials chill outOne way\nObamacare's plan to cut drug costs for Medicare recipients falls shortMitt\nRomney takes credit for Obamacare, a law he vowed to repeal\n\n", "title" : " What researchers found when they went looking for the jobs Obamacare killed - The Washington Post", "twitter" : { "body" : "One of the biggest fears about Obamacare never happened http://wapo.st/1Z5atpy", "link" : "https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/684710049655177216", "retweets" : 60, "date" : { "$date" : "2016-01-05T20:16:11.000-0800" }, "mentions" : "", "favs" : 44, "hashtags" : "", "id" : "684710049655177216" }, "topic" : "obamacare", "source" : "washingtonpost", "link" : "http://wapo.st/1Z5atpy" }
